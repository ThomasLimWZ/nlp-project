Cast=10 Acting=5 Trailer=7 Ending=8 Story=7
Visuals=7 Direct=6 Sound=7 Genre=8 Sub-genre=7Ex-UFC fighter Dalton takes a job as a bouncer at a Florida Keys roadhouse, only to discover that this paradise is not all it seems.""Somebody else asked me if I was afraid today. I am afraid...I'm afraid of what happens when somebody pushes me too far."" I enjoyed this, but I understand why this went straight to streaming instead of getting a theatrical release. As I compared this to the original, I found that certain things like the fight scenes (CGI excluded) were better with this one, but what I loved about the original was lost here. I think this is worth a watch...if you have trouble with reboots, think of this as a prequel instead.","25 out of 28 found this helpful."

That is severely lacking here with next to no time spent in the actual Road House and barely any screen time is given to the people at the bar. One of the highlights of the Swayze movie was him getting to know the staff and getting rid of the bad elements at the bar. Nothing of the sort goes on in this movie.Jaoquim de Almeida is wasted as the sheriff and has little to do while Daniela Melchior has less of a role than Kelly Lynch had in the original if that was possible.The movie's saving grace is Jake Gyllenhaal who is clearly having a lot of fun in the role and has good chemistry with an OTT Conor McGregor in the movies best moments. Best stick to the original cult classic.(Glad to see Arturo Castro's Moe live, by far and away the best character in the whole movie).","297 out of 394 found this helpful."

That's not what this film is. There are some similarities (a tough guy saving a roadhouse from a greedy rich guy) but it's different film with different themes and a different atmosphere and Jake Gyllenhaal is stellar in the role of Dalton, a kind, brooding guy who has a lethal aspect which scares him.Right now, this film has a 6.2 on IMDb, which I think under rates it. If you look at this without the lens of the original Roadhouse, it stands well enough on its own to be worth more than that.","22 out of 25 found this helpful."

Remake of an 80's classic and Jake G? Recipe for disaster. But..... this is a remake in name only. Fresh story, the only connection to the original is he's a bouncer for hire. I'll admit it, this stands up on its own.For lack of anything better to watch I gave this a shot. Color me surprised but I enjoyed the heck out of it. No agenda, just an old school action movie. Now the AI/CGI was nothing short of terrible, but if you look past that this movie embodies the old school Western movies it clearly mimics (and references several times, a bit on the nose).Was I entertained? Yup. Was it Oscar worthy? No, but I'll take entertaining over Oscar Worthy every time.Give it a shot, you may just enjoy yourself.","114 out of 151 found this helpful."

The bad guy, like the original, was a businessman in a suit, but the climactic showdown was against UFC fighter Conor McGregor's Knox. The fight between Dalton and Knox at the end is one of my favorites in recent history. Jake Gyllenhaal only had a few kick ass scenes since most of the remake focused on Dalton's internal struggle to a past traumatic event that wasn't explored in the original. In all, I liked this Road House just about as much as the original, and I strongly recommend this to all action fans.","39 out of 50 found this helpful."

It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and it's obvious literally from the very beginning that it's self-aware. It knows how to laugh at itself with its over the top fight scenes and at times bad and cheesy dialogue or even the constant wild music being played in the background. Even the way Conor Mcgregor walked and talked was not serious in itself. I mean come on, it's impossible to hate on a film like this. Sure, some movies that don't take themselves seriously can still be very bad, but this one was actually pretty alright if you don't compare it to the original or just go into it with lower expectations. I'd definitely recommend this as a fun popcorn action flick if you're bored.","104 out of 146 found this helpful."
"7","/10","Solid action flick not to be taken seriously","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9722115/?ref_=tt_urv","invisiblephrend","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38270836/?ref_=tt_urv","6 April 2024","Apparently the reviews are getting swarmed by boomers that didn't get their cream of wheat this morning. Do remakes suck? Usually. But this is a solid action flick that doesn't hide what it is: a slapstick action flick packed with ridiculous amounts of alpha Chad characters and protagonist plot armor. It's laid on pretty thick throughout the film that it's meant to be a goofy punchfest of senseless violence and overly eccentric characters.Even if you haven't seen the original, this film still stand out on its own as a movie that's just fun to watch and at no point takes itself seriously. If you're looking for a deep and thought provoking storyline, then this might not for you. But if you enjoy the adrenaline junkie style akin to John Wick or just about anything Jason Statham, then it's highly recommended.The most impressive thing that stands out in this film is Jake G's commendable dedication to getting in shape for this role. Jake went through intense amounts of training and discipline to acquire an absolutely shredded physique for this role. The fact that he achieved this while in his 40s is an inspiration to anyone who is trying to get in shape. It's on par with Hugh Jackman's preparation for Wolverine.Now for the bad stuff. The fight scenes are heavily reliant on CGI body doubles and shaky camera effects that stick out like a sore thumb in several scenes. If they had spent a little more time in perfecting these effects, it may have worked out as more believable. Jake's character also has superhero levels of plot armor that can induce a bit of eyerolling from anyone expecting realism out of the story. Plenty of scenes where he survives moments that would easily kill an ordinary man (i.e. Disarming several men with guns without getting blasted).You're also not likely to enjoy the ending, as it was pretty intentionally peppered with plot holes in order to allow a potential sequel. This also may come as a shock to some of you, but Connor McGregor is (gasp) not a professionally trained actor. He was hired to play the crazy goon that he is in real life and it worked well for the film, in my opinion. Is it still worth watching? Absolutely.","54 out of 77 found this helpful."

Despite the money thrown at it, blockbuster director, and casting of Jake Gyllenhaal the movie overall falls completely flat with awful dialogue, uninteresting characters, and a storyline so thin you can see through it.The only positive about this movie is there were some very creative shots in the fight scenes, but even those were relatively uneven. And Connor McGregor was given far too much (poorly written) dialogue which combined with his vapid delivery takes you right out of the movie.Overall it feels like ""Road House"" was the product of someone giving a 13 year old boy absolute control of a Hollywood production. The upside to this is the chaotic mess they left behind is somewhat entertaining.","535 out of 705 found this helpful."

Jake is great (as youd expect), and so are most of the supporting cast.There are also some fun moments and lines. But then Conor Mcgregor turns up and it goes down hill fast. He really can't act, and just stomps around spouting cringe one liners that he can't pull off. You'd also expect at least his fight scenes to be good, but they weren't.With another actor in the Mcgregor role this could have been a great action movie.The fight scenes are hit and miss with some looking very fake with some bad cgi at times too. In fact the cgi is pretty poor in general.","468 out of 642 found this helpful."

It was full of action and did not take itself to seriously. Great camera work in fight scenes and overall a fun to watch movie. My eyes were glued to the screen most of the time and even if I knew where the plot was going I wanted to see how the fight scenes would play out. It is not a new all time classic. The plot is fairly simple, but also unique because of the backstory of Gyllenhaals character. Gyllenhaal is a great actor and carries the movie with his acting skills. Mcgreggors character was a little over the top, which worked for me. As he was a real threat to Gyllenhaals character and everyone else, because he was so unpredictable and did not care for anything or more specific anyone. Overall a great movie full of action packed raw fight scenes that I would definitely recommend.","36 out of 38 found this helpful."
"7","/10","I liked it for what it was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9715879/?ref_=tt_urv","NateWatchesCoolMovies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18423640/?ref_=tt_urv","2 April 2024","So... the Road House remake. Am I allowed to say that I liked it as much as the original? I only saw the Swayze one for the first time last year and really enjoyed, but I also really dug Doug Liman's recent update with Jake Gyllenhaal too, for different reasons. Jake himself is one of those reasons, he's breezy and effervescent as Dalton, disgraced ex MMA fighter relocated to the beautiful Florida Keys to defend a beachfront bar from relentless goons. The Keys setting is also another reason why I liked this a lot, it adds so much laidback atmosphere and picturesque scenery as backdrop for this simple, straightforward action flick that fills the shoes of the original adequately enough. I think that having a marauding meathead like Conor McGregor as the head goon was a bit of a misstep though; the guy is clearly not an actor and thinks he'll win over the screen by chewing more scenery than Gary Busey, but a modicum of restraint on his part might have kept his performance this side of the moon in terms of subtlety, and let other aspects flourish to the forefront. Sultry Daniela Melchior, smarmy Billy Magnusson and always terrific Joaquim De Almeida are good in supporting roles. I really liked Jake's performance here though; he adopts this laconic affability that hides a sickening darkness in his past, something he's always on the run from. The action is fearsome and often quite funny, the tone tropical and easygoing. My only gripe is it could have been a bit longer to flesh certain elements out and focused on Mcgregor's seething villain a tad less to pivot more over to other aspects the film has that it seemed to want to take more seriously. All in all a really good time and easily as enjoyable for me as the OG Roadhouse.","44 out of 63 found this helpful."

Jake does a good job. Some of the fighting scenes were interesting. You could tell this was a very new Hollywood update of a classic movie. Some of the dialogue needed work.McGregor was also an odd choice. His permanent smiling expressions and him walking like he had hemorrhoids was very hard to move past. Sometimes you couldn't understand what he was even saying.Overall the movie was fun and if youre looking for a time killer its an okay option but I would probably just stick to the classic movie where the story and characters feel less contrived.","424 out of 581 found this helpful."

A self-serious yet simultaneously very silly modern day riff on the Western that's packed with testosterone, crunchy action and jokes in the most unexpected places. It feels like a streaming movie in some distracting ways but it still remains one of the better ones.Jake Gyllenhaal brings a natural intensity to Dalton as well as an impressive physical commitment. It's the possibility of his rage that he always keeps at bay that makes him so watchable in this role as he beats up his enemies and then makes sure they're okay before actually driving them to the hospital.From the moment he's introduced, Conor McGregor is definitely something. It's the kind of performance that's never boring and never good. Every single line is delivered in hilariously awful fashion and yet he's one of the best parts of the film as he takes a very generically unhinged villain and makes it his own.Doug Liman's direction certainly has a lot of energy as it alternates between fights in the first person, drone shots and simply getting as close as possible to the action. The fights themselves have a real weight to them with the heaviest blows really being felt however, some of the CG flourishes used to stitch them together distract rather than enhance.","223 out of 358 found this helpful."

The use of CGi was annoying and very noticeable, especially in the PostMalone scene. I liked it, but apparently our movie tastes have changed a bit, and I don't like action-oriented movies like I used to. He came, beat everyone, left and it was over.

Dalton is middleweight fighter who is going through bad times. A tragic encounter in the ring is traumatic for him and gives him suicidal thoughts. To make ends meet he takes up the job of a bouncer at ""Road house."" However things are not smooth for him since a local gangster boss wants to take over the property and keeps sending his goons to the road house to create problems. Dalton then fights them all with the help of his associates of Road house.Although apparently many disagree, I found the film very entertaining. Don't expect this to be a great one of its kind film. Road House is a silly remake of a modern westren-like movie filled with ridiculous comedy and loads of action scenes. The movie starts off in a pretty non-original way; he gets offered the job, he's not convinced, something bad happens, and he's kind of forced to except the job. Not to spoil more, he's faced with struggles there and has to resolve them. The action scenes were really entertaining to me and fun to watch. Jake Gyllenhaal was very good at his role which I felt had depth to especially that he's not the good guy but also not the bad guy. Connor McGregor was pretty weird at the beginning but as you get used to him, you understand why such a character is needed in the movie. Most of the jokes were also pretty funny with a lot of irony here and there which was also pretty entertaining. The movie also had some pretty unexpected plot twists.Shut your brain off and enjoy this!Score : 7/10.","11 out of 14 found this helpful."

Updating the setting to a Florida road house rather than the original's biker bar gave the film a unique atmosphere and vibe that complemented its contemporary audience. The film was beautifully shot and directed, adding a visually striking touch to the overall experience. The story follows a disgraced UFC fighter who takes a job as a bouncer at a Florida road house struggling with a tough clientele. While the plot remains somewhat true to the original, it is engaging and action-packed, featuring a storyline involving a shady property tycoon attempting to take over the land. The main villain was over-the-top, and casting Conor McGregor as the big bad added an intriguing element to the film. The action sequences were well-choreographed and visually dynamic, immersing the audience in the heart of the fight scenes. Jake Gyllenhaal excelled as the lead character, Dalton, showing dedication and depth in his performance. The supporting cast was also strong, and the dialogue and acting were effective throughout the film. The romance subplot was appropriately balanced and did not overwhelm the main story. The film's conclusion could have been more substantial, as it ends rather abruptly with Dalton boarding a bus and leaving. Nonetheless, ""Road House"" remains an enjoyable and solid film that provides a fresh and modern take on the classic story.","12 out of 16 found this helpful."

However, this remake fails to understand what makes the original pretty good as this remake provides an uneven script, terrible dialogue, weak performances, and a tone that takes itself way too seriously.Doug Liman's direction is bland and uninteresting and some of the dialogue really feels like something written by ChatGBT. I love Jake Gyllenhaal but unfortunately, despite Gyllenhaal having a solid performance, he wasn't able to save the movie from falling down.

If you wanted a scene by scene of the original just go watch that. First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal is great in everything he does and this is no different. The thing that impressed me the most was Conor McGregor. He did a great job for his first time acting. I know people either like him or hate him and the people who don't like him have all showed up in these reviews. I don't care if you like him or not he did a good job.

Yes, he was a villain out of a comic book but that's how he was written and he played the part great. I hope to see him in more movies in the future. Both Jake & Conor put in the work in the weight room too, both have always been in great shape but not like this. This was perfect for a movie to just have fun with and turn your brain off. I'll probably watch it again in the near future.","58 out of 65 found this helpful."

The way John Wayne stands at the end of the Searchers was an homage to his idol, Harry Carey Sr. The remake of Road House is a cinematic love letter to the original if you consider the all of the little nods to the original sprinkled throughout the 2024 film. If the 2024 iteration of Road House were no more than a re-shoot of the 1989 script it would rightly deserve double the number of Razzies the original received which most likely propelled it to its cult-classic status. To prove their love for the original the makers of Road House '24 have sprinkled their own little homages to Road House '89 throughout 1 hour, 54 minute run time. Charlie's bookstore is located next to the Double Duece grocery store not the Double Duece Bar in the original. Let's hope the ""clean ups on isle three"" are not caused by little old ladies fighting over cute tomatoes. Another homage to the original Dalton is the ""Be Nice"" signage instructions inside the 2024 bar. Then there is Charlie's reference to the hero that Dalton 2024 needs to be: a guy named Wade who just happens to be the name of Sam Elliott's 1989 character. Homages abound, but then there is the one I had to think about. It really helped that I am, well, old. In the original Road House Dalton is an anti-violence bouncer who has advanced degrees in philosophy, east and west. But 2024's Road House doesn't make that anti-violent gesture to his predecessor by making Dalton Dr. Nice. Dalton 2024's non-violent side is expressed, weirdly, in his first name and middle initial: Elwood P. There are not that many Elwood Ps in movie history. In fact, there is only the one. Famously, the only Elwood P. In movie history is the pooka loving character played by Jimmy Stewart in the stage production and its movie version ""Harvey"". (FYI: A pooka in this situation is an invisible 6 foot rabbit who likes to knock back a drink or two from time to time.) Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey is non-violent and ""nice"" to the point that his sisters think he's crazy and want to confine him to a nut house not a road house. (Harvey the afore mentioned pooka would love to hang at the road house.) Elwood P. Dalton and Elwood P. Dowd both have an infectious smile and pleasant presentation that invite people into their person. People like Elwood P. Dalton upon their first meeting. So rather than conjer a Far East non-violent homage to Dalton '89, Dalton '24's homage is organic to his being. It's built into his being on a cellular level not learned from a book. Elwood P. Is non-violent because that's who he is, not what he studied. The homage to Elwood P. Is organic to someone, something far more gentle than the Dalton of 1989. Dalton '24's tumble into PTSD and self-torture is all the more tragic because it is tearing away at the very structure of who he is, not something he has learned. The betrayal of Dalton 89's Far Eastern philosophy is not a tragic loss of innocent faith and love for humanity. It's a betrayal of book learning. Elwood P. Dalton is lost in a world of martial arts and murder. His out-of-place smile can't survive the violent punches and kicks of the Road House. The homage to the movie Harvey is far deeper and wholly unexpected. The left field homage to Elwood P. Dowd in the person of Dalton 2024 is more respectful of the artist Jimmy Stewart than any of the other winks to the works behind the original Road House.","16 out of 23 found this helpful."

The movie as a whole was just okay, the fighting was just okay. What I like most about it is simply that it's my boy Jake. He's always been one of my favorite actors over the past 15 years. I couldn't say specifically why, but just his general aura brings a boat load of screen presence to any movie. I can see why he's a very coveted actor even now, and he's pushing his mid-forties, but taking a lot of beatings in this film. I can see his age just barely creeping up on him, but dang he got pretty beefed up for this role (or maybe he already was, but I've seen him get thin now and then). He gets tanky every few years for a role, why not use him on several similar characters while we're at it? That's what they did here. It's a generic story at best.This is very similar to the original Swayze film from the 80's. Similar in the basic plot and the fact it's just one big brawl through the whole movie. There is a bit of romance, just a teeny tiny bit, almost enough to please some folks. The bad guy is difficult to pinpoint, there are like 3 antagonists if i'm being honest. They needed to cut out one bad buy, because three was a crowd in this. Statham would probably have been a good pick for this as well and he could've been a good character as the old friend, like in the original Swayze version. I wish they had put him in it, but I bet he's too busy.","6 out of 7 found this helpful."

Full of action, well coordinated fight scenes and some great cast members - Jake Gyllenhaal never fails to make a good character. Conor McGregor was also brilliant!Personally I loved it - a bit silly, a little cringey at times but overall an enjoyable watch, with good humour and something you could watch again, cause it doesn't matter that you know what happens. You knew anyway!Don't think of it like the original with Swayze - they've only really used the name ""Road House"" to add to the marketing of the movie and draw attention. It's a different movie and simply for fun!Not every film has to make headlines. Sometimes they just need to be entertaining.Just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one.

Understanding the criticisms here and elsewhere, Dalton is clearly a complex character. We get a little taste of his past that has set him down this path. The film could've benefitted from exploring this past in a deeper more meaningful way.Similarly, Connor McGregor shows that he has the chops in his new career, but his character could've been more nuanced. At times he seems over the top and his dialogue can be contrived.Best summary: This draft is more The Incredible Hulk and a few drafts away from being a closer version of The Dark Knight.","17 out of 26 found this helpful."

The originall was ,ore believable. The fight scenes were not nearly as dramatic. In the new Road House some of the action and fight scenes were a ilttle over the top, sure directors have many tools available now (CGI) and can have large explosions and unbelievable crahses and flying boats etc. Entertaining, but somewhat unbelievable... so I have mixed feelings about this new version but I like Jake Gillenhaal a lot and his acting was very good. Conner McGregor was over the top a big mean nasty dude and made me believe that he was souless as well.

This is the latter. I liked it. Overall, I thought it was slightly better than a ""one time watch"" movie. It's in the dumb fun category, basically.I liked Gylanhaal in the interpreter, and I thought he was was decent here. Furthermore, some of the fight choreography was good. The setting and story were ok, and even though it's over 2 hours, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't drag too much. Conor (who is basically playing an exaggerated version of himself) was entertaining, and I thought the UFC angle was integrated well into the plot. This film also has a lot of humor and I found that a decent amount of it landed. One henchman (I'll try to keep this spoiler free) had me laughing often.Now to the negatives: some of the acting is bad, like really bad. The sheriff guy in particular, although he isn't the only one. Then there's the VFX. Oh my gosh, they are bad. This movie looks like it was made in iMovie at points. They also did some CGI body double thing to make the punches land during the fight scenes and at best, they are unnoticeable, and at worst, look awful. There's another scene where a character is hit with a car (all done in CGI) and it looks like Sharknado.For a remake of a cheesy ""so bad it's good"" movie from the 80s that also feels like an athlete's vanity project, you could do much worse. I was looking forward to watching this one hoping it would be fun. Obviously, I wasn't expecting Goodfellas. And when the movie was over, I felt mostly satisfied. I would probably watch it again, but likely years later and not right now.If this seems like a movie you'd be interested in, and you have Prime, check it out out of curiosity and grab some beers before you do. I already have Prime so the fact it was essentially free for me gives it some points in its favor.I don't regret watching it.

You could see plot set ups coming from a long way back. I guess, if you are one of those people who wants edge of your seat/what's happening next content then, for sure you gunna be let down.

This is where this film really shines. Conor McGregors Knox is just larger than life and fun to watch.

He did step up the gears, for sure, never to the level promised from the build up, but that's not Jakes fault.Yeah the dialogue might be a bit dodgy in places, but what the heck.All in all, great movie, it does honour to it's namesake by complimenting it with no effort to try overshadow it.","12 out of 21 found this helpful."

A reimagining of the 1989 film starring Patrick Swayze, this has everything I enjoy in actioners right from a ludicrous plot, a bricky Jake Gyllenhall, loads of testosterone, a beachside setting, soul + rock n' roll laced soundtrack, and most importantly, some well-staged action (except when there's forced CG or janky edits). Gyllenhaal plays Dalton, an ex-UFC fighter looking for trouble (read: fist fights) wherever he goes, in the hopes of getting paid for it. Apart from looking like a million bucks, Road House isn't a film that pushes the performer in him. It just lets the guy smile, smirk, wisecrack, and punch his way to the ending. To no surprise, the film even gets the official UFC endorsement.Doug Liman hasn't made anything this fun (or self-aware) since American Made. The night shots are full of yellows and blues, and for a film with this premise, it fits the bill alright. Conor McGregor, as you'd expect, plays a beefy, madcap baddie and his showdowns with Jake are oddly satisfying (ft. The riffs from Rina Sawayama's version of Enter Sandman). The leading ladies (Daniela Melchior and Jessica Williams) are reduced to token roles, with not much texture - Hannah Love Lanier, in a cute supporting role, trumps the rest. In fact, that's the case with nearly everyone in the film as the stylization takes precedence over plot and characters. Arturo Castro, as a henchman with a funny bone, was good. The film is about 15 minutes too long, and most of the unnecessary scenes involve either the cops or Billy Magnussen on a yacht.P. S. For a streaming release, this features some finely executed moments .. best enjoyed in a theater full of people.P. P. S. I so wanted a Post Malone v. Jake Gyllenhaal fight, but they robbed us of it.","59 out of 132 found this helpful."

Does he do the job well, providing some weird plastic value as a wild creature? Hell yes! But I don't like this type of people and I don't think movies should go so overboard with their options when trying to convince us to what the story is supposed to really mean.That said... Yeah, this was some entertaining reboot of the 80s classic. But had it been someone else and not Jake Gyllenhaal in the titular role, it'd suck big time. More than half the film's appeal and energy is owed to JG's acting skills and persona. He's developed a character from scratch, exchanging the coolness of Patrick Swayze with a moderately fun character who falls not far from Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon. And it works. Yeah, the emotional trauma does not really blend well with how he can take things so lightly, but there are all types of responses to dark memories, who knows. The character wasn't too unconvincing after all.What wasn't convincing was the dynamics of the story. Even though they have kept an important deal of the no-holds-barred chaos from the original, this one is less credible when it comes to who does what for which particular reason. They have paid just too much attention to certain, incredibly well-shot scenes, while totally ignoring to give some credibility to the love story.We got four major detachments from the source material, each of which hold this movie back:1. Where the F is Wade Garrett?!? This film has NO Sam Elliott! He was the surpise, the soul and the ace in the hole for the original! Why have they paid money to a professional oaf like Conor and didn't even care to put into the script someone who could be today's mid-aged Sam Elliott? Where's the friendship between two tough fighters who are there for one another?2. Yeah, the original Road House was violent AF, too. But this one pushes the boundaries to some nasty grounds. Generally speaking, I don't like to see this kind and level of violence on film. Auteur cinema like Kill Bill can absorb certain graphic details, but the Fast and Furious kinda excess with action scenes do not make up for the underlying loss. Especially with this reboot, it does not.3. Where are the townspeople? Where is the town itself? Look, the source material may have been absurd in many aspects but it actually DID fall well into the Western patterns of ""stranger saving the day"", like in how Sergio Leone had adapted Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Lame, unconvincing or cliché as it may be, that underlying theme STILL could serve as a backbone. Why have they skipped it so easily?!? Yeah, the girl at the book store was a moderately-developed character who helped point at why they might have tried the ""shortcut"" to placing the hero into the story, kinda like breaking the fourth wall, but it comes just too short when the interaction with ""the spirit of the town"" is almost inexistent... There are too few secondary characters in this reboot to help strengthen and solidify the dynamics as needed... FFS, they have even replaced the ""bad guy"" with his son, putting the actual dude in prison, but we don't even get to see the man!4- Swayze's Dalton was a ""cooler"", a ""man of the trade"" who developed fame not only over how he had once killed a man, but also over how well he knew to control patrons of such joints. Especially in the earlier scenes, he was to nightlife security what Miyagi was to Karate. There's not even a trace of that in this remake. Gyllenhall is just a fighter, not a professional when it comes to road house security. Hard to figure out why they totally skipped that. It was a major selling point with the original.The four major deficits listed above account for 90% of what's wrong with this IMO.But still, it's watchable as an action flick, mostly thanks to its star.","9 out of 13 found this helpful."

This question is at the heart of examining this cult classic that defies traditional measures of quality filmmaking.Mediocrity and Disconnect""Road House"" stands as a prime example of a movie that falls short in various aspects. Its plot is mediocre, filled with clichés and predictable turns that fail to engage the audience. The writing lacks depth and fails to establish a meaningful connection between the viewers and the story unfolding on screen.Embracing Comedy Over SeriousnessHowever, it becomes evident that ""Road House"" never intended to be a serious action movie. Instead, it embraces its comedic elements wholeheartedly. This is evident from the very names used in the film, such as the bar's name ""Road House"" and the boat where the protagonist, played by Jake Gyllenhaal as Dalton, resides, aptly named ""The Boat."" These subtle touches of humor throughout the film indicate its intention to entertain rather than to be taken seriously.The Saving Grace: Conor McGregor's CharismaDespite its flaws, ""Road House"" is saved by the sheer energy and charisma of Conor McGregor, who plays a pivotal role in the film. McGregor's presence injects life into the otherwise lackluster storyline, elevating it to an enjoyable experience for viewers. His dynamic performance adds a layer of excitement and unpredictability, making the movie a memorable watch.In conclusion, while ""Road House"" may fall short when judged by traditional standards of filmmaking, it succeeds in delivering entertainment as an action comedy. Its mediocre plot and disconnected writing are overshadowed by the infusion of humor and the magnetic charisma of Conor McGregor. Ultimately, ""Road House"" proves to be a worthwhile watch for those seeking a lighthearted and enjoyable movie experience, where McGregor's presence truly makes the whole film come alive.","47 out of 53 found this helpful."

And this one is a major disappointment. Overall, there's no originality and nothing that draws you into the story, unless you like sing Connor McGregor's ass.

A major theme of this movie is the male torso and plenty of male shirts-off fighting (if that's your bag!). Road House plays out like a superhero movie without the costumes - Dalton (Gyllenhaal) the indestructible super and his arch nemesis Knox (McGregor) who has more than a passing resemblance to the biker dude from Raising Arizona (or Sponge Bob Square Pants the Movie) bearded, Irish and tattooed from head to foot.A bar and live music venue in the Florida Keys is being terrorised by some local riff-raff (or so it seems) until a dark stranger is hired to be the security muscle.Road House has overtones of a Guy Richie movie about it (Lock Stock, Snatch) - it's violently comic but lacks the conviction to go all out - watering down the wit and grittiness with more familiar tropes from the action / romance genres. In my opinion it needed to go harder or softer but - frustratingly - lands somewhere in the middle.I understand that director Doug Liman wanted the music to be as authentic to the Florida Keys as possible, he said, ""I wanted to find the types of bands that would actually play at a venue like the Road House."" But again, it would have been better I think for these acts to be a bit less polished and harder to go with the bar fights. Even when a famous metal tune kicks in it's a kind of lame pop version.All this smacks of a confused mixture that's not quite bond or John Wick. In the end this movie is a load of ridiculous fighty fun and amusing enough - but perhaps trying to be too many things at once.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

The root of the issue lies in the lackluster script and uninspired direction. Despite Gyllenhaal's best efforts, the film fails to recapture the charm and intensity of its predecessor. Fans of the original will be sorely disappointed by this lackluster remake. The chemistry and energy that made the 80s version memorable are sorely lacking here. McGregor's attempt to transition from the octagon to the silver screen feels forced and unconvincing, leaving me questioning his casting. While Gyllenhaal delivers a commendable performance, even his talent can't salvage this sinking ship. From the wooden dialogue to the uninspired action sequences, ""Roadhouse"" (2024) fails to deliver on its promise. Ultimately, it serves as a reminder that not all classics are meant to be remade.

It's simple, to the point and a lot of fun. Jake as Dalton was on point, and McGreggor really did exactly what he was supposed to. He isn't an Oscar award winner, nor does he try to be; he's an over the top fighter, just like he is in real life. Some of the jokes didn't really hit, but it's not a big deal. Some of the camera angles were annoying, but that's about it. Some reviews I read complained about character development, and I think I know who all they are talking about. Those characters really didn't need to be developed as much because the movie isn't about them.All in all, this is a straightforward movie. Not supposed to have some deep plot or some type of mystery. It's about a bar, a bartender and some people that wanna take it over. So if you take it for what it's worth, you'll definitely enjoy it.

also had some mixed vibes when it was released. They're both very good and fun to watch, but it's a little obvious why this new version feels lacking
simply because products of their generation win and lose aspects or excitment. It's so divisive that one website had on its main page a bashing of
the film, qualifying that it brings everything that was bad with 80's cinema yet there was another post about its popularity with the crowd. Won't
say it was a necessary remake but it's the kind of entertainment needed and Doug Liman ended doing a fine job with almost everything. Action,
thrills, some drama and romance are well combined in this explosive, funny and a little reflective film.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Dalton, an ex-UFC fighter who moves down to Florida where he takes a job as a bouncer for a problematic roadhouse
and its aggressive bully costumers. Obvious that those troublemakers are regulars not for the drinks and the music, but their idea is to torment
its owner (Jessica Williams) so she can sell the place to wealthy folks. Dalton is worth the money as he's the only one who manage to break things
apart, much to the despair of the rich man's son (Billy Magnussen) and his thugs who'll bring more danger and violence to anyone opposed to their
plans. Like the version starred by Patrick Swayze, Dalton is a man that doesn't really want to make use of violence to stop the savageness of those
bikers as he has a traumatic incident from his past. Yet he's great at throwing kicks and punches, like the typical heroic figure of such movies.By itself, this ""Road House"" was lots of fun, highly entertaining and exciting. It's easy to please and doesn't take itself so seriously -
though it can be a problem to some. Gyllenhaal is always great to watch, specially his humored interactions. A super cool movie and that's saying a
lot these days.Another fun reason is the wildly crazed problem solver played by fighter Conor McGregor (in his film debut). His twisted character is a fierce
opponent to Jake, as he's faster, mindless and enjoys hurting people and goes through such a series of unbelievable injuries and situations as if he
could not get killed. And it's such an hysterical over-the-top performance that manages to be enjoyable, rewarding viewers with great laughter each
scene he's in. He's destine to get a Razzie nomination (just hope he can accept it gracefully).However, it doesn't go out without problems and a comparison with the 1989 is necessary. The 1989 version is superior as it treats things in a
more serious and relevant manner, even with a sense of humor. It works as a good drama since Swayze's Dalton always ponders about the use of violence,
uses of dialogue to mediate things for a long time before turning into defense mood, as opposed to Gyllenhaal's Dalton who throws punches from the get-go.It wasn't just about being the cool action film, it had more values to reflect and to be considered, and the whole major conflicts felt as a real
story, as opposed to the absurdity of this one.But what hurts the most is the fighting sequences, with a majority of them made through the use of special effects and editing giving the
appearance of being wildly inventive as they go for a long time, as if being uncut. Yet it looked painfully fake, you can spot the trick very
easily as it does not look that you're seeing faces getting punched, bodies getting hit, which makes the stunt doubles being disposable. If CGI
fight like the ones shown here is the future of cinema than we're doomed. Old style editing is still something we hope for.Despite the mentioned problems and the lackluster romance of Dalton with a nurse (Daniella Melchior), I still had a great time watching
this ""Road House"", and even looked back to the old one which celebrated its 35th anniversary. A little escapism doesn't hurt anyone, specially
when it's well done. 9/10.","13 out of 14 found this helpful."

He's such a calm likable guy, that any deviation from that is just not believable. Well this movie definitely plays to his strengths. They made the new Dalton a really enjoyable character to watch.It's not the same as the old roadhouse. But, the old roadhouse is a relic of a time in Hollywood that doesn't exist anymore. Where you could have a monster truck just wreak havoc on a community...as a believable upset. There was a suspension of disbelief you could get away with back then that is just not reasonable by today's standards. Also, nobody is believing that you can just rip a guys throat out with one signature move anymore.It's not like *the best movie* but It's a great revisit to the classic drifter action movie trope that we're popular in the past. I think of movies like Rambo, Walking Tall, Desert Heat fit the bill when describing this type of movie.I don't want much from this type of movie, I want to watch badass dudes fight and blow stuff up.

Yeah. Can he play cynical character? Oh yeah!And now he plays a fighter and it seems really cool and nice.The enters McGregor.Many here critisize him for his smile, accent or hemmorhoid walk. Actually it did not spoil pleasure watching him. It got me interested. He seemed to me like some cartoon character. Drawn too hard crayon.I always say that the good action movie depends mainly on a bad guy. As I watched him he was like in some kind of experimenting with his abilities. I feel or rather I am sure that with some polishing of acting we will see him seen in movies when he would replace Statham. Hood English accent from lower London, good fighting skills and great smile. Not Gary Busey - we all miss him in such moments don't we ? Yet for me he was a good insertion - some kind of on screen casting.Good fighting scenes. Pretty well directed and planned.And the story ? It was completely empty.Other characters? Completely invisible.Dialogues?Funny parts in Jake's mouth.Some stolen from other movies - like hospital talk before fight taken from Reacher One Shot with Tom Cruise.The rest? Not really important because fury of the main guy was important and confrontation was important. Actually the movie was all about it.Some muscle movie - finally - almost free from LOVE.... free from sexual orientation declarations and so on. Simple message - ""This movie is about MMA"". And I read this signal. That is why I was not dissappionted.","5 out of 9 found this helpful."

This is horrific on any level-casting, acting, directing, cinematography, location and sets, plot, believability, character arcs. I understand some people might ""enjoy"" it, but it is truly a talentless film from start to finish. Every character is unlikeable and is shallow and uninteresting. They clearly had no sets made and just used some half vacant bar for $100 a day. Wow. Note that percentage wise MOST reviews are 1, 2 or 3, which is already generous. Really is a disgrace for Gyllenhaal who must really need the bucks... It is truly in my Top Ten Worst Films of the last 50 years.. no kidding!Its REAL value is that is makes you go on to NFlix or elsewhere to watch the original Roadhouse after many years and see what a fantastic genre piece that is.. Woe unto the current film industry that cranks out such trash.","18 out of 25 found this helpful."

Jake plays a really good Dalton and McGregor acting chops aren't too bad either, he plays a really good baddie. Over the top pure fantastical, he could be a character from a Guy Ritchie movie.They've deffo paved the way for a roadhouse 2 and hopefully they have the same people involved.This was 2 hours of pure escapism, I really enjoyed it. 7/10 all day long.

Conor basically played himself, so of course he was obnoxious. I've watched it twice and will go back again. The fight scenes are amazing.Some of the moves are next level. This isn't the original.

The storyline follows a worn-out formula, with Gyllenhaal's character playing the archetypal tough guy with a troubled past. The dialogue lacks depth and originality, serving up cringe-worthy lines that feel like they were pulled straight from a B-movie script. Even the action sequences lack innovation, relying on overused choreography and special effects that fail to impress. It's disappointing to see talented actors like Gyllenhaal wasted on such a lackluster project. The supporting cast fares no better, with one-dimensional characters that offer little in terms of depth or development. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, relying on tired jokes and slapstick comedy that elicit more groans than laughs. Overall, ""Roadhouse"" is a prime example of Hollywood's tendency to prioritize profit over creativity, delivering a forgettable film that will leave audiences feeling like they've wasted their time and money.","99 out of 167 found this helpful."

There is the bad guy, sometimes almost likeable, then there is the baddest bad guy, a Mac Gregor who manages to be more unpleasant only in real life, and there is the usual hackneyed plot of the beautiful and damned who saves a community. Nothing new in short, but the photography, the action and fight scenes are done with all the necessary qualities and a few times I even went back to see them again. In short, it is not a film that will remain in history, but it is a film that does exactly what it should do. It entertains.","6 out of 12 found this helpful."

I liked the western mythology (Shane) and the Arnold bit (End of Days) on the train track. He only killed one person, his best friend (in the past) and he carried that guilt all the way through the film. It was a sub-text to everything he did. The mandatory romance was a dud, and looked like some scenes got cut at the Glass Book. The fighting was well handed.Doug Liman invented the shaky-cam for Jason Bourne, but thankful be didn't use it (too much). If you saw the original ""Road House"", or heard Peter Griffin growl out ""Road House"", this is worth a Friday night with a beer and a blunt.Unfortunately, the villains were cartoonish but Conor McGregor was eating up the scenery. He was the perfect foil for Jake because he was a capable foe, and on some level, they understood each other.Watch it like a dry deadpan comedy, and the first time Jack gets stabbed.

It was critically panned then and its ratings are not better now. In terms of screenplay writing the original was written to the level of a rough sketch of a movie, a blueprint. The henchmen were practically the same mindless character, apart from the sinister boss and the cliche one good fighter who does nothing and then showboats (cue maniacal laugh).In this movie every character is far more written. They're 3 dimensional characters or at least closer to that than the original. The setting is far far more believable. I mean seriously, who thought the setting of a farm right across the narrow river from a psycho criminal gangs mansion made sense? That was just lazy writing. Jake Gyllenhaals character has evidence of an inner monologue questioning what going on rather than just simply being reactionary. Daniela Melchior is far better cast as a nurse than the original actress who was there purely to be a sex object and a damsel. Even the henchmen in this have distinctive characters with some surprise moments and humorous dialogue. The main weak point is Conor McGregor who acts like the henchmen of the original. He's mindless and can barely annunciate a clear impactful sentence through his constant grinning. The vibe and energy of the movie is far more fun and I'd watch it again in place of the first one.","11 out of 27 found this helpful."

The original ""Road House"" movie was good as it was, and with the many years lack of originality and creativity in Hollywood, then it wasn't surprising that a movie such as this would be done over.However, I had the opportunity to sit down and watch director Doug Liman's 2024 take on the 1989 movie. Though I have to admit that I sat down with very little expectations.And I was genuinely surprised with the outcome of this version of the movie. It was definitely an entertaining and enjoyable movie to watch. And I have to admit that writers Anthony Bagarozzi, Chuck Mondry and R. Lance Hill put together a good script. I was wholeheartedly entertained throughout the course of the entire 121 minutes that the movie ran for. So this is definitely a movie that is well-worth sitting down to watch, regardless of you having watched the 1989 movie or not, or whether or not you enjoyed the 1989 movie or not.Leading actor Jake Gyllenhaal definitely surprised me with his performance in the movie as well. I have to admit that I wasn't particularly thrilled when he was announced to star in the movie, but boy did he step up to the task. Jake Gyllenhaal really made this movie his and brought on a great performance. Aside from Jake Gyllenhaal, then I was only familiar with actor Joaquim de Almeida on the cast list. But it should be noted that they had a good cast ensemble to portray the various characters in the storyline, and most of the actors and actresses put on good performances. However, they really botched it with the casting of Conor McGregor, because that guy does not have an ounce of acting talent to him, and it was cringeworthy to watch and listen to him deliver horrible one-liners.There is a lot of action throughout the course of the 121 minutes that the movie ran for. And it was very nicely choreographed and executed action sequences. I enjoyed the action tremendously, and it really made the movie all the more enjoyable to watch, no doubt about that.I will actually warmly recommend you to sit down and watch ""Road House"", because it was quite a hard-hitting movie.My rating of ""Road House"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.","13 out of 34 found this helpful."

All of them come either from McGregor's haters or dinosaurs that lived with and liked the original. I did not see Swayze's film but this one was a fun ride, Jake being one of my favorite actors, absolutely loved the fighting scene, finally i see a film where we actually get to see the punches thrown and the faces smashed and not punch-cut-punch-cut and fleshes everywhere. In a fight scene, i want the camera to be steady and see everything that happens, this is what makes a fighting scene good, like the one in Oldebuoi which is one of the best fighting scenes in history. I'm sick of action films where we only get flashes. McGregor's character honestly i can not see any other actor/human that could do it. It was a maniac but in a funny way, like a goofy one, to add some laughs into it. And lets not forget the UFC scenes, as a UFC fan i loved those, the cinematography was so badass. Kept thinking that i want to see more of those and now i just hope that a full length UFC film starring Jake Gyllenhaal comes into production one day.

"6","/10","A Thrilling Ride Through Nostalgia and Action!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9704858/?ref_=tt_urv","jaysonpajaronvistal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158145467/?ref_=tt_urv","27 March 2024","Filmmakers face a delicate balancing act between paying tribute to the original source material and introducing fresh elements when remaking cult classics. The forthcoming 2024 version of ""Road House,"" which was once criticized but later praised for its action-packed storyline, is no exception, as it attempts to honor its infamous predecessor from 1989 under director Doug Liman's guidance. By reviving the energy of the '80s classic, this new iteration brings back fond memories while embracing contemporary innovations onscreen in Road House (2024).Upon its initial release, ""Road House"" received criticism for its convoluted plot and exaggerated characters. The movie's purpose seemed unclear, leaving audiences uncertain about the overall vision of the film. Nevertheless, as time has passed, a dedicated fan base has emerged who appreciate what makes this action-packed flick unique-its oddity combined with the fearlessness captured on screen. Patrick Swayze's portrayal of Dalton inspired many; he was known to be philosophical yet able to fight his way out of any situation thrown at him without hesitation, making ""Dalton"" iconic in playing heroic roles like no other bouncer before or after that could match up! Even though criticized upon first release, Liman is now directed towards modern cinema enthusiasts striving hard not to forget original RoadHouse roots while alluding to neo-nostalgic culture-an intricate balance yet achieved partially throughout the 2024 version, successfully showcasing neon aesthetics paired with synth-backed tunes rooting deeper unison among viewers, feeling one united journey. At times, it's successful, giving us glimpses of the neon-soaked, synth-backed era where a lone hero could stand against the tide. Other times, the film feels lost in translation, unsure how to wield its nostalgic weaponry without falling into the pit of pastiche.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the new Dalton in a film that delivers on its promise of high-octane action. Gyllenhaal's dedication to his role is evident, with his remarkable physical transformation leaving an impression. Whereas Swayze brought grace to the brawls, Gyllenhaal brings raw and visceral energy, bringing credibility to each fight scene. The updated Dalton is no longer just a pacifist bartender; he now embodies unstoppable power and captivates viewers through Gyllenhall's performance alone. Compared to Patrick Swayze's original portrayal, Jake raises expectations by delivering a vigorous physical presence that sets the bar higher for future performers.Liman skillfully takes us on a journey through 80s and 90s action cinema, immersing fans in an unrivaled world of barroom brawls where true heroes are born. The film pays tribute to its predecessor with high-energy sequences that will transport you back in time to the genre's heyday. Gyllenhaal shines as he unleashes powerful punches packed with raw emotion throughout each heart-pumping scene. This movie indulges in its over-the-top action-a respectful nod to its roots; elaborate choreography lands satisfyingly loud blows, making every brawl feel like it could stand alone as an epic fight sequence itself. ""Road House"" boldly stands up against modern films by bringing audiences cinematic thrills from when courageously audacious stories outshined everything else imaginable during the golden age of action movies. There is no missing this spectacular display.However, the latter half of the film loses its grip, particularly with the introduction of Conor McGregor's character. Although intended to be a compelling antagonist, his performance seems contrived and occasionally borders on caricature. His unclear motivations suggest that he is included in an attempt to capitalize on his off-screen personality rather than as part of the story itself. At times, it appears as though McGregor is unaware even about being filmed; this almost causes self-parodying performances. Nonetheless, there are some remarkable moments throughout the movie where Gyllenhaal duels with McGregor energetically combining aggressiveness and fervor, exposing their raw emotions while keeping audiences glued to their chairs due to sheer grandeur-it could make any viewer exhilarated.However, as the film progresses and increasingly relies on CGI, it detracts from the impact of these scenes. This causes viewers to become disengaged from what they're watching and instead feel like they are observing something artificial. While impressive in their own right, these visual effects overshadow the practical stunts and choreography that give ""Road House"" its authentic flair. In turn, this creates a disconnect between audience members, serving as a constant reminder that we are simply watching actors portray characters within an orchestrated production rather than being fully immersed in this cinematic universe. Nonetheless,"" Road House"" (2024) presents itself as a nostalgic journey for those willing to accept its flaws. Liman's reverence for the original work shines through throughout the opening opportunities, where he pays homage while infusing his unique style onto the film's center stage. Additionally,Gyllenhaal receives praise for their magnetic performance, which serves not only as anchors but also elevates beyond mere imitation into contemporary homages' realm, transforming nostalgia into timely remembrance.To summarize, ""Road House"" 2024 is a film of contradictions. It proudly embraces its origins, while Liman's reverence for the source material shines through his efforts to preserve it. Those who appreciate the movie's audacity and overlook some weaknesses will enjoy a thrilling ride back in time when brawls were entertainment and heroes were valiant, tough guys. However, even with all its pomp, flaws are still evident; poor acting performances and unsuitable CGI shots may diminish viewers' satisfaction upon closer examination of the filmmaking process.Reflecting on the legacy of both the 1989 classic and its contemporary counterpart, it is evident that ""Road House"" still holds immense cultural significance. Whether one has been a devoted admirer of the original or is just beginning to delve into this narrative about an individual bouncer who takes on society alone, there's something undeniably gripping in this tale. Despite its flawed nature, the 2024 film pays tribute to a time when audacious action and grandiose characters were prevalent, serving as a poignant reminder that sometimes all we need is someone willing to stand up tall and fight back hard with style for what they believe in while looking great doing so-our very own hero.","5 out of 10 found this helpful."

The ""main characters"" execute their roles very well, it's not so cringey that it's tough to watch, and the fight scenes are FANTASTIC. And in my opinion, Conor McGregor performed impressively for his ""first ever"" film. He was a natural on camera. This is the perfect movie to just turn your brain off for a little bit, sit back, crack a beer, and enjoy a fun movie after a long day. That's exactly what I was looking for when I chose to watch this movie, and it didn't disappoint. It ""went in"", it did its job (with all of the silly cliches), it looked cool, and it left. It was a great Saturday night action flick. I smiled, I laughed, I gasped, and I audibly said ""oooo... ouch"" on a few occasions (aka - that's gunna hurt tomorrow).My only complaint was the sound mixing. I run a rather high quality 5.2.2 system, and the dialogue from the center channel was quite distorted at times. It was mainly only an issue at the beginning of the movie, but I wish they would've cleaned up the sound editing to make it more balanced and clear.Apart from that, please disregard the 1/10 reviews.

And even if I think that people were to hard on this movie(59% come on, it's not that bad), I still wil say that I was disappointed.The first thing I should mention is that it is quite different from the original Road House, but in a good way. Of course it takes the main characters' name and the concept, but everything else is qiuet different. The main characters motivation and his personality was definitely a good change. Also Jillenhaal potrays his character much better than Swayze. He brings a lot of drama and depth in the character. Also McGregor potrays a very charismatic and funny villlain. But here comes the main problem.Now see, in my opinion this two charactres just don't go toghether. When Jake is trying to make this film dramatic and simple, Connor takes it as a goofy action comedy. And if this were to separed movies I think both them would have made a great part of that. However, in this movie it just breaks the tone, and destroy both sides of it. You can't take Jyllenhaals' drama seriously when in the same movie naked McGregor is destroing a market. And you can't laugh from the naked McGregor because of the serious themes this movie is trying to explore.Now obviously this movie is better than the original and I still think it's underrated, but be ready to have some problems while watching it.","5 out of 10 found this helpful."

While the families motives are uncovered, a call is made to get Knox to ""take out"" the bodyguard of the Road house.The first hour the movie is at its best, the action the back and forth between characters are all good, Jake does a great job acting BUT at times is hindered with McGreggors performance as it's his first time acting and you can tell that, which at times takes me out of the movie.On the opposite he is very good at the action scenes and the more threatening scenes, basic dialogue feels forced, the supporting cast are fairly solid across the board and the movie doesn't feel dragged out either.I had a fun time, 7/10.","9 out of 22 found this helpful."

Fast forward to the remake and my wife said I want to watch this, but cant really remember much about the old one. I said it's a western etc. So, when the new version gives its own nod to this idea it did make me smile. But what is it like? On a Friday night with a couple of drinks we really enjoyed it, even Connor McGregor hamming it up. Like the original film it's good fun, all you need do is disengage your brain and go with it. The central story is essentially the same but the film is different because of its setting annd back story etc. Jake plays a really good part, and works well in the role. The rest of the cast perform as you would expect, though Arturo Castro's character is arguably more hammy than McGregors, which is surprising considering how talented an actor he is.Everyone else stays in their lane and the film provides exactly what you want on a Friday evening. Solid, unchallenging entertainment.","6 out of 13 found this helpful."

After finally getting around to seeing the original Road House, I can say that I thoroughly enjoy it, but if you're a fan of that movie and hope for the same with this version, I would temper those thoughts. This version does its own thing and only takes the bones of the original story, as well as some character names. For what this movie is, it will be a movie I recommend and mention for a bit, simply due to how much fun I had with it. It's not great by any means though, so let's dive into it.Elwood Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal), an Ex-UFC fighter, takes a job working at a Road House in Florida, where he is meant to maintain peace and clean up the terrible nightly patrons. What comes into play shortly after this is that Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen) wishes to tear down the Road House to build condos. I'll be honest, that plotline almost completely ruined the movie at first for me because that is the villain storyline in so many terrible movies in the past, but I went with it. Magnussen's performance as that character was hammy enough to enjoy anyway, so when his character evolves and sends out Knox (Conor McGregor) to take out Dalton, the movie gets a significant burst of energy.Daniela Melchior as Ellie also shared some very solid chemistry with Gyllenhaal and I really liked Frankie (Jessica Williams) as the bar owner, but I truly believe the make or break of the movie is McGregor's over-the-top, Irish villain. He goes for it with a crazy accent and his back-and-forth with Gyllenhaal had me cracking up throughout. The action in this film and the fight scenes were a ton of fun, and that's all I really wanted. I think this film should've been put in theatres instead of straight to Prime Video (Amazon, what are you doing?), but I still enjoyed it at home. Again, if for nothing else, this is supposed to be a fun and exciting movie and it ends up being just that in my opinion.Road House is directed by Doug Liman, who did a great job at the helm, but with as many writers as this film has, it feels messy, storywise. I rolled my eyes multiple times but also equally wanted to clap at everything. It's weird because I can't say this is a great movie, but it's a movie I had a great time with and would watch again. Road House is now streaming and I think people will have a good time with it, regardless of whether they've seen the original. Check it out.","8 out of 19 found this helpful."

I understand why they choose Connor in the movie, but he might want to give acting a miss. If they used him to help the actors with the fighting scenes, then this may have helped the movie, but the casting in general was pretty awful.

The protagonists feel shallow and underdeveloped, failing to resonate with audiences on an emotional level. As the story unfolds, it becomes evident that the narrative follows a well-worn path, devoid of any originality or innovation. Despite attempts to inject excitement with flashy action sequences, the film ultimately falls short, with the thrills lacking genuine emotional resonance. Viewers are left feeling detached and disengaged, unable to fully invest in the on-screen spectacle.In addition to its narrative shortcomings, ""Road House 2024"" also suffers from pacing issues that further detract from the viewing experience. Scenes drag on longer than necessary, leading to moments of boredom and disinterest. While the film may offer fleeting moments of entertainment, it ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression, making it a forgettable addition to the genre landscape.","37 out of 59 found this helpful."

Those who criticise this film once he steps into the fray maybe should look back on his UFC history and realise he is just being himself, which is fantastically over the top, much like the character here.Jake Gyllenhaal does a pretty good job of reinventing the Dalton character (although let's be honest, Swayze was never going to be bettered) and does his best with the somewhat lacklustre script. I do miss the mentor role that Sam Elliott played in the original and feel that this movie lacks the ""heart"" that the original had.

If you wanna see that go for it, but don't expect it to be more. I love Jake & he did his job, but it's by far not his best work. Still in big contrast to Conor McGregor. I'm sorry, but he feels just not right, he walks like he's doing a parody and unnecessary crashes cars for fun? His fighting is obviously good but his character feels so out of place. His acting is just acceptable. I don't understand why they went for that type of character? Was it just to have a UFC fighter in it? I really don't get it.The story is flat, I liked some aspects but they never told why that happened, there is a solid foundation to go into Daltons backstory, go in his head and his struggles. To go a risk and make that movie more about him instead of pure fighting. But they don't do it, sadly in my opinion. Road House is just a Film about Fighting thats it. The ending isn't spectacular either but it is okay.I wish more risk would've gone with the story. It could've been a better movie, still it's overall an enjoyable popcorn movie but I would like to see Jake back in better Movies.

Sadly this film is a poor attempt at a remake, revamp or reimagination of a great albeit dated classic.No one can replace Swayze but I gave Jake a chance and he may well be the only good thing about this.Everyone else, you need to enroll in more acting lessons.The villain, Ben Brandt, just terrible acting but not compared to coner, with his ott stupid smug grin showing off his pearly whites, the dude can throw a punch obviously but jeez, why try acting, its not for him. Had his character been mute I probably would have sat through the other crap actors but he was just so bad!If the story was going to follow the original I'd took too long to get to the point.I gave it a chance but nope, my advice, just watch the trailer then go and watch Swayze's far superior classic.","71 out of 121 found this helpful."

Roadhouse (1989) is a timeless classic and sets a standard when it comes to classic cheesy action flicks and in Roadhouse 2024's favor it does not try to replicate this. The new movie has a couple of nods to the original, but it does try to have its own identity. It stands pretty well at the top end of mediocre action movies of recent times and it well worth your time if you have already seen Nobody, John Wick, The Beekeeper & Guy Richie's The Covenant.Connor's debut goes well, he plays a typical 80's villain well and I look forward to see what other opportunity's arise from this role.Overall - I enjoyed the movie for what it is - high octane action and close combat fighting!

Because how can you counter an invincible MMA fighter except with another invincible MMA fighter, who's also Scottish?Really, the ideas in the film are not as impactful as the original Road House, mostly because the connections between people were not as strong.

I'm a massive fan of the original roadhouse movie and I wanted to give this film a fair shotI don't really know where to start but let's start with the plot.... In the original (1989) you could see clearly what was going on from start to finish.. you could see who each character is and what their part in the film is and the relationships between the characters...but with this film (2024) it seems to skip from point to point and you can't connect the dots or at least I couldn't.The cast generally as characters have no charismaIt's a pale imitation of the originalI have to say as well that the casting of Conor McGregor is the biggest joke of all... Absolutely ridiculous... I can't stand that man the way he walks the way he talks, he's just the most annoying person in the world and he is exactly the same character in the film... Obviously I wouldn't say it to his face because he were batter me but I literally can't stand him.","45 out of 74 found this helpful."

McGregor played a part that he is like in real life (with a dash of villianism 😂 which was Perfect for his role!. The fight scenes were good. I though it would of gotten ruined by too much CGI but it was captured well. 4) great mix of action and humour. Also, ps. From the get-go I love the homage to the original road house where Dalton got stabbed in the stomach (same area in both movies) and he met his fling there.

I will say this- it was shot pretty. Great cinematography! The female leads seems like they were DEI hires and were forced into the story simply to meet a quota. Casting by committee not the best actors getting the job. Connor Mcgregor was like a cartoon version of a bad guy.

But, I was totally wrong, looking at his IMDB page, it is littered with action movies, however he is best known for drama. This shows that he is a very good actor, that can do action. He is one of those actors that is always good, even in bad movies. And, if you are going to enjoy this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal - not McGregor - is going to be the reason why.Roadhouse follows Dalton (Gyllenhaal) as an ex UFC fighter who is told to take back a local Roadhouse from a local gang. Why a Roadhouse? So they can get the clout from the fame of the Swayze move from the 80s of course. There is no real connection other than the name, so purists be ware (on a side note, I loved the 89 Roadhouse! It was a good blend of action, drama, love and fun).What works is Jake Gyllenhaal. He is fun, refreshing and likeable as always. The action I also found strong. It is a breath of air from the John Wick style, over stylized, super ninja action that litters our streaming services today. The tone is generally fun and light, and I'm glad the actors and director take this path.So, let's talk about the elephant in the room... McGregor. So, the studio/director does the right thing here. They insulate him, surrounded by a good cast and a fun story. All he needs to do is just nail the role - and he falls flat. There isn't much for McGregor to do, and the inexperience is obvious. As a UFC fan, it is obvious most of his shtick is an act, so just repeating that would be fine. This is not all on McGregor, but he should blow this role away, and he doesn't. He isn't bad, just he isn't good either.The movie does get lazy near the end, and although the final showdown is a good set action piece, it is obvious at this point the director just wants to wrap things up.I really enjoyed the film, but it is almost all because Jake Gyllenhaal had such fun in the role that I was pulled along with him.7/10.","6 out of 14 found this helpful."

I'm an elder millennial (Oregon Trail Gen!) so I'm going to have a special place in my heart for the original. I won't say this quite lived up to the original. Sam Elliot and Swayze brought something that can't quite be recreated today. However, fans of the original need to be realistic.... It was cheesy, like super cheesy. I still remember Swayze kicking the overweight guy through the window with the fakest roundhouse kick I've ever seen and the the dude just looked like he jumped out.So, this version didn't have the all the charm but it did have some. Gyllenhall was great, as always. The book store girl was super likable and helped provide a reason for Elwood to stick around. The fight scenes were far far better than the original and I don't see how anyone could argue against that objectively. Only a couple of the bar staff were memorable and the owner just seemed pointless. I agree that McGregor was over the top. He had some great moments too though. I think they could have done better reigning McGregor in and maybe spending time making some of the Roadhouse crew a little more memorable. The plot was meh but so was the original and no one watches a movie like this for the plot. If you make the characters likable enough you don't need a great plot. This is more like a 6.5 for me but I'm rounding up due to the ridiculously low ratings from some.","6 out of 14 found this helpful."

He did make me laugh, was that the point? Maybe not. But he was actually the most enjoyable part of the film for me.Overall it's not an AMAZING movie, it's a bit predicable and doesn't go really deep into a plot. I would've liked a bit more meat on the bone when it came to Dalton's relationship with his friend or something, but it's basically just a fun action movie about men hitting each other.","6 out of 14 found this helpful."

I won't make this too long of a review and I'll let you decide on your own by giving it a watch but die hard fans of the original will know where I'm coming from, and this ain't it. A few key things I've noticed is Dalton or Elwood Dalton?? Should be James Dalton, is nothing like the original. Patrick Swayze's character was dark, mysterious. Only revealing little by little what his life is all about. In the remake, he's trying to be a funny guy? Talkative? Quirky? I get this is a remake for a new generation but why can't they stick to the source material? Also Florida, really?

Frustrated with his fights in the ring he is on a death wish due to which he loses his car. Thereafter he lands up at Florida Keys to take up the job of a bouncer at the "" Road house"" , As he alights from the bus he tells a friendly teenager Charlie (who manages a bookshop) that he has come to clean up the place of the ruffians who cause disturbance and damage in the ""Road house."" Charlie responds "" Just like the old westerns?"". This then is the one line storyline of the movie.A number of movies have been made on the larger than life hero who comes to demolish the oppressors and save the innocent . In fact this movie is based on the 1989 movie of the same name starring Patrick Swayze. There is therefore the inevitable comparison. But I am not doing that.For me this movie is super because of actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Ever since I saw "" Nightcrawler "" and "" The covenant "" I am his big fan. This actor has extraordinary talent of becoming the character he plays to perfection. He is super in this movie too and is easily the highlight. He carries the movie throughout and it really doesn't matter who the director and the actors are. There are a number of mean guys without shirts showing their well toned bodies and posturing, threatening and intimidating their opponents. Lovers of action will like this movie . The movie is engaging enough and is full of action scenes assisted with CGI. Notwithstanding the violence the location is shown beautifully. There are some foot tapping music tracks which gives the movie a good pace and keep the audience entertained.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Matter of fact Cm was fun as a villain and look fwd to his villain take on more serious roles as he definitely has the charisma and intrigue. JG was very solid but Swayze was able to add a complexity/depth w his script that is missing in this one..I thought the new script not including a real Sam Elliot equivalent role was a MASSIVE mistake which short changed Dalton's character development and did the same the to the story potential.Some of the side roles had cheezy acting... so did the original but honestly this one bordered more on bad acting on some of those side roles vs just cheezy.Combine all of these issues w so many beautiful sunny day settings near the beach and it made it real hard to sell it the same way the original did.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays Elwood Dalton, the toughest UFC fighter around, who is largely hiding from the limelight beating others by winning before they've even started as his fearsome reputation proceeds him. He takes a job as bouncer at a Road House in the Florida Keys where there has been a mysteriously excessive and unnecessary amount of violence. Quickly mopping things up, it becomes clear that local and very dangerous gangsters want the Road House and want him gone.Whilst this starts out as a fun bit of pantomime with so called heavies being beaten within an inch of their lives, it soon progresses to higher levels of action and violence which is exciting, bloody and very well staged. Gyllenhaal is pretty cool and looks great all smashed to pieces but nowhere near finished, with real life fighter Conor McGregor as very very tough Knox, Dalton's nemesis and convincingly, albeit with some serious scenery chewing, someone you really wouldn't want to argue with. Ok, it's all nonsense, but exciting, quite amusing in places and overall pretty good fun.","6 out of 15 found this helpful."

First of all I think you need a certain mindset going into this film, don't take it too seriously, sit back, chill out and have a laugh. It's a cheesy action flick with a very basic story you aren't going to get a whole lot of wonderful acting or a deep storylines. The fight scenes are interesting sometimes I was like ok pretty cool then other times I was sitting laughing at how bad it was. The CGI at times was defiantly shoddy again so much so I had to pause and rewind just to see how bad it was. But again I wasn't taking it too serious and I found myself laughing quite a few times and ended up enjoying it.Conor's acting debut - I actually thought he wasn't too bad considering its his first acting role, he seemed intimidating and charismatic. My only gripe was and I guess wasn't his fault was the overuse of the cheesy one liners like they are constant when he was on the screen. Also felt a bit awkward at times they way he delivered some of his lines but again cant be overly harsh.Nobody else really stands out at all Jake is ok I guess but his character is so impassive its hard to tell what's going on with him.Summary
Its an over the top cheesy action flick nothing less nothing more. I wouldn't nit pick every issue I have with it because I knew before even watching the film it was going to be that good. I could come on here and say how awful it was the acting, the characters, the writing, the CGI and give it a 2/10 but it doesn't take itself too serious and either should you when watching it it.","5 out of 12 found this helpful."

He's the fakest person I've ever seen, watching Conor in movies is like watching your school bully who never grew up yet for some reasons becomes the mayor of the town.(small) This guy's a blow hard with no acting abilities he's a ""fighter"" yet he's no longer fighting? Idk how much money these people are worth but I love Jake he used to be my favorite actor, between this and southpaw I feel like he should just quit acting and do what he obviously loves. It's not Jake's fault this sucked. My opinion is just watch clips of southpaw and this movies fights. That's about it. Maybe I'm alone in this but I'm tired of Hollywood rewarding bad behavior. People as big as Conor McGregor should be taken down a notch when he punches a older man for not liking his liquor..but nope he's out here rich ASF and roided up to boot. Here comes worse behavior.

"7","/10","Is this Remake as Good as the Original?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9703618/?ref_=tt_urv","Vince_D","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3307133/?ref_=tt_urv","27 March 2024","With Doug Liman directing, Jake Gyllenhaal takes on the role that Patrick Swayze famously brought to life in 1989. This update smartly distances itself from its predecessor, attempting to carve its own identity in a landscape where classic, small-scale action movies struggle to find relevance among superhero spectacles with overblown budgets. Unlike the original 'Road House' (1989), this version only loosely resembles its source material; Liman's vision incorporates contemporary visual styles while attempting to maintain the original's spirit, a decision that mostly works in its favor given the shift in audience tastes over the years. The Florida Keys and Caribbean flavored setting serve the film well, being well-shot and visually appealing. However, the use of music falls short of memorable, with a generic score that lacks the iconic blues-rock vigor of its predecessor. Despite these ambitious decisions and attempts at modernization, 'Road House' ultimately struggles to conjure up the distinct charm and enduring appeal of its forebearer.Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as 'Dalton' is confident and intentionally amusing; he seems to understand exactly the type of film he is in, and that saves the movie from being a complete miss. Furthermore, Conner McGregor is over-the-top and chews every scene he's in as a villainous henchman; maybe that's intentional, or maybe it's because he can't act and doesn't know any better; regardless, his performance works well for this type of material. Also, despite being severely underwritten, Jessica Williams is quite good as the bar owner who hires Dalton to clean up the local riffraff. She shares a certain chemistry with Gyllenhaal, hinting at a missed opportunity for her character to be developed as a more central figure and potential love interest.This brings me to one of this film's biggest problems: Gyllenhaal has zero chemistry with his actual love interest in the film, played by Daniela Melchior. Melchoir was the stand-out character of 2021's 'The Suicide Squad;' her performance as the 'Ratcatcher' was the heart of the movie and probably the most memorable character of the film. However, in 'Road House', she and Dalton have zero on-screen chemistry; I didn't care about their romantic subplot at all. Their meet-cute scene at the hospital felt forced and contrived, and really, none of it made any sense. I think this was more due to the writing than to Gyllenhaal and Melchior's performances. Furthermore, the sheriff, played by Joaquin De Almeda, and the main villain, Billy Magnussen, were also underwritten with nothing much to do other than posture and leer. It would have made more sense to have fewer characters and beef up their parts; for instance, the bar owner and love interest could have been the same character.Speaking of missing characters, I understand why they got rid of Sam Elliot's older 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' mentor character, a genre trope that sees him guide the hero and die toward the end of the second act. Elliot would have been a near-impossible act to follow, and the film likely benefits from sidestepping a direct comparison.However, the remake noticeably lacks one of the original's most distinctive features: Dalton's background as a PhD in Philosophy. Having a highly educated protagonist in this type of action movie is a rarity and added a layer of depth and charm to the original that this film was sorely missing.Overall, this film wasn't bad, and my review sounds harsher than it should, but I suppose that's due to disappointment from what could have been a much better film with some easy fixes. The film delivers entertaining fight scenes, and Gyllenhaal's performance is a saving grace, making it a worthwhile watch for genre aficionados; just don't go in expecting the original and watch it as its own thing.","4 out of 9 found this helpful."

If you're not attempting to recreate the essence of Road House, then don't label it as such; choose a different name. But if you insist on using the title, at least pay homage to the 35-year-old classic in some way. We're still here, remembering the original Road House and the emotions it evoked - the grit, the action, the raw authenticity.We've been hearing all the discussions about whether to release the new movie on streaming or in theaters. Honestly, I couldn't even bear to watch it on my home TV, let alone finish it in a theater. It's just a waste of time. It feels like a disservice to the legacy of the original, like a cheap imitation trying to capitalize on its name without understanding what made it special.

If you don't like the original, this stinker will be right up your alley.What's bad:The fight scenes are shot in a strange wide-angle. This is a clumsy attempt to hide the fact that they're largely CGI, as are most of the stunts. It doesn't work, as the CGI jumps out at you like the 3D portions of a bad 1950's horror film.The writing is awful and is missing all of the campy, unintentional humor of the original. Whole scenes are lifted from the first movie but the best lines and characters are inexplicably left out.The cast is an unlikely mix of unnecessarily (but predictably) diverse people that have nothing in common, other than that they check off all the DEI boxes.Don't expect a Sam Elliot cameo either. He had enough sense to stay well clear of this dumpster fire. There's not even a Wade Garrett character in the movie, which would have been the perfect opportunity for the casting director to check off another box or two. Maybe an Asian or a little person? Maybe an Asian little person!Jake Gyllenhaal is bulked up and at least physically believable, although with as much CGI as there is in the movie, that may be computer-generated, too. But this version of Dalton is so randomly tough, friendly, corny and intense that none of it rings true and he comes off as more schizophrenic than multi-faceted.Conor McGregor is here only for publicity. His naked, weirdly bowlegged strutting is off-putting and his accent is unintelligible. Unsurprisingly, he's not a good actor. At all. And the end credit scene exists only because his bloated ego wouldn't contractually allow him to be killed by Jake Gyllenhaal. This, like many aspects of the film, makes no sense.And the other characters? Don't worry about it. None of the other characters has enough depth to even mention. The cast has more NPCs than Free Guy.The film is not clever, not funny, not true to the original, has no depth and adds nothing to what the original already brought 35 years ago.What's good:More people will see the original to find out what the fuss is all about.If it had been called Road House 2, it would have just been a mindless action movie sequel, and we could cut it some slack and give it 2 stars. As a remake, it deserves less than zero. So the average of those two is one star and that's more than it deserves.","18 out of 28 found this helpful."

But the stunts, choreography and brutal mixed martial arts fights are top notch and exactly what I expected coming from Doug Liman.There's no aha moment or any real suspense - except maybe a hot shave on rough seas, yikes - as Hannah Love's character alludes to when she likens their situation to a ""mystery western,"" and there doesn't need to be.

And I know it's a remake it's not meant to be the same as the original but still, it doesn't matter if it's a remake or not the plot should feel real and not corny due to some acting. Fight scenes were pretty cool for the most part but their were a couple where you could actually see them pulling the punches which made it feel fake, especially the post Malone fight that was awful cgi or whatever you want to call it that they did. I have never left a review on any movie but something about this remake just didn't sit right with me. Was looking forward to Jake in this movie but his acting wasn't up to his standard especially with how good he was in southpaw. You definitly have to watch it to form your own judgment because it is a remake of a great film but that was just my take on it.","62 out of 114 found this helpful."

The lead has exactly the right tone as does the head bad guy. But when Connor McGregor shows up and starts playing off the rest of the cast the fun really starts and the film cooks... I'd also like to give a shout out to the great local music bands, and seemingly original music they're playing throughout the film. Those guys are great and the album / soundtrack would be worth a download.Conner McGregor belongs in a bond film. He is the perfect villain.I could see a sequel to roadhouse and I'd be the first in line to watch it.Not sure how they would put that together because they really need most of this cast to return. They're that good together

Conor McGregor plays himself an annoying individual, but Jake Gyllenhaal throws in everything such charisma, turns in such a fantastic performance in low grade movie that he actually elevates this into enjoyable and whatchable perfect comic timing and he looks like he could actually knock u out if u cross him.

The action was great. The main characters were good, they were typical textbook characters but good. Billy Magnussen is pretty good at playing a bratty character, feels like that's all I see him do now. Mcgregor was a pretty eccentric character, almost cartoonish but in a good way. Was shocked to see Post Malone. I've never been to a bar in the south but the frequency of the fights seemed a bit exaggerated.After the first 30 minutes focused on character introductions, the plot didn't progress as swiftly as I'd hoped. It wasn't a slow-paced film per se, but rather, the events didn't seem to drive the plot forward significantly. It's pretty predictable, probably stems from the characters' and the town itself's typical personalities. I think you know where each character's gonna end once introduced.The fight scenes were undeniably fantastic for, especially the 'knife' sequence during the climactic brawl. Despite the runtime, the action wasn't as densely packed as expected.While the movie doesn't break new ground and is based on an old film of the same name (which I haven't seen), it's still alright though. Perhaps pacing it a bit quicker would have heightened the thrill factor, but overall, it's a solid forgettable watch. I loved the mid credit scene, pure chef's kiss.","5 out of 13 found this helpful."

Enter 'Road House' (2024), a film that not only understands the art of entertainment but redefines it.This adrenaline-fueled joyride is a delightful concoction of action and fun. While it maintains a mostly light-hearted tone, there are moments of gravity that send shivers down the spine, courtesy of Gyllenhaal's mesmerizing gazes.Speaking of which, Gyllenhaal delivers yet another stellar performance, exuding an intriguing blend of nonchalance and depth. His portrayal keeps you guessing, always hinting at layers beneath the surface.The fight sequences are nothing short of spectacular, leaving my jaw hanging in awe. Each punch feels visceral, expertly choreographed to immerse the audience in the action.Surprisingly, humor also finds its place in this action-packed spectacle. I found myself bursting into laughter at unexpected moments, particularly enjoying the comedic nuances woven seamlessly into the narrative.A standout aspect is the film's daring embrace of an R-rating. It's a refreshing departure from the trend of sanitized versions, adding grit and authenticity to the experience.From start to finish, 'Road House' delivers on its promise of pure entertainment. It transcends the confines of a mere bar brawl, evolving into a wild, pulse-pounding adventure.Gyllenhaal's charisma shines through, supported by a commendable performance from Conor McGregor, whose portrayal of a formidable antagonist adds to the film's intensity.While it may slightly overstay its welcome, 'Road House' remains an exhilarating thrill ride.

What you need to understand going into this movie is that it is not a remake, it's a reimagining of a great 80's movie. The plot is easy to follow and the acting is good. Also the fight scenes are good and realistic. Jake Gyllenhall does great as the Protagonist of the movie being an ex UFC fighter down on his luck and finding a job as a bouncer in a bar in the Florida Keys. Billy Magnussen plays the Antagonist to the bar and Conor McGregor plays the Antagonist to Jake Gyllenhall's character. For me the big difference between the original Road House and this one was in the Patrick Swayze film,the story was very clean and you knew the stakes from the beginning. This one is more about ""Dalton '' than the Road House. I felt like this version was the origin story for the character. They left it open for squeals for both Jake Gyllenhall and Conor McGregor characters. There are some call backs to the original film. Like the line ""No one wins a fight"" and other stuff but this is not a REMAKE. It's a different movie with the same Protagonist Dalton. I would give this film a solid 7 out of 10.","5 out of 14 found this helpful."

The chemistry between the characters is enjoyably special, things go south in ways that don't make sense, and the spirit of fighting is as strong as the former. We see Road House for the action and fighting basically, the original may be a bit more subtle in the dialogues, thanks to a better script but I think this remake is more than acceptable for a movie that despite being a cult classic, it's not a gem of filmaking, no direspect. In this one, Dalton has a different temper but his phylosophy is still similar and his performance is very good. It's hard to criticized the acting of Mcgregor when the character he portrayed resembles himself so much in real life, but all in all you get the wild card antagonist that works very well in spcying the film.

Nevertheless, this iteration provides an enjoyable thrill ride with its gripping action sequences.What more could you wish for than Jake Gyllenhaal and Conor McGregor going head-to-head in badass fistfights? McGregor's entrance is both spectacular and uproarious, setting the tone for his amusing yet somewhat flawed performance. While his acting may not reach stellar heights, his presence adds a unique flavor to this absurd narrative, fitting snugly into its quirky universe. McGregor's dedication to the role is evident, injecting authenticity and vigor into the fight scenes, proving that this venture was more than just a paycheck for him.The fight scenes truly stand out, showcasing a level of intensity and impact rarely matched in cinema. Regrettably, the rest of the movie falls short of this standard. While the action delivers, it lacks the depth and intrigue present in the original.

Dont watch this expecting a serious movie because its a road house movie and like the first film its just silly violent fun that hits all the beats of a classic 80s popcorn munching action film.","5 out of 15 found this helpful."

Humour adds positively to violent nature of the very predictable and mostly silly plot that can be easily written by a 15 year old cinema enthusiast.Conor McGregor more than pulls off what needed from an action genre antagonist and never dissapoints by his acting or existence.

Please don't listen to the ridiculously negative reviews!I throughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish, its action packed, funny and a fantastic remake.. fight scenes in it are brilliant..
Story follows the original to a fashion, but has its own spin on it too..
I think Connor mcgregor as the villian, basically playing himself was a nice touch.. hope to see him carry on this little acting stint, as he has a lot of potential.. all in all its a great fun time movie.. definitely give it a go and form your own opinion.. way to many movie snobs reviewing this, that take themselves far to serious.","4 out of 11 found this helpful."

Joel Silver whose gift was the cast choices...Here, I am sure many viewers would have prefered Jason Statham, but not me, because the lead hero needed to have a sympathetic face, and Statham has a rough face. No, I think that Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect, and he is used to such roles: fighting on screen, remember him in SOUTHPAW. This one is an agreeable time waster, but I will always prefer the original.

I think the writers may have thought that we the audience always want bigger and crazier set prices and highly styled editing.Well I don't, anyway...Keeping it a similar story with a more realistic editing style would have increased the score from my point...

This movie should have been named 'Out House' because it's where you go when you want to take a dump. There's absolutely no resemblance to the classic 'Road House' with Patrick Swayze. The fight scenes were ridiculous. Conor can NOT act. He's all swagger and delivers his lines like if he's reading from cue cards. They introduce so many characters and have no time to flesh them out. I can now see why it's straight to the bargain bin at Walmart because it would fail big time in theaters.

I was kind of surprised by how much overall fun I had with this movie, it's not like a masterpiece or anything but my god was it a fun time to sit through. Unbeknownst to me my mother had never actually watched the original in full before, which would've been helpful to know earlier but I guess she'll just have to watch it at a later date, she is a really big fan of Patrick Swayze though, as I presume a lot girls were during the 80-90s. And I am being told very clearly by her at the moment to sit down and watch Dirty Dancing now, which I suppose I will have to soon because it's obviously a classic and I don't really know anything about Swayze's filmography.I think I'm in the minority here when I say that I enjoyed this possibly just a little bit more than I did the original, which doesn't seem to be the general consensus but this just radiated fun for me. The original Road House was much more a romance movie filled with Patric Swayze fan service and a whole lot of boobs, but this movie is much more focused on the ""badass"" action hero, and even more importantly the action itself. Which is definitely something I'm more into than the stuff that was going on in the 89' version, plus I felt the third act here was ten times better than the one we got back then, which in my opinion dampened how good the film was prior to that.I am also a massive fan of Jake Gyllenhaal to the point where I'll watch any movie I come across as long as he's a character within it, and his take on the newly named 'Elwood' Dalton was something I enjoyed more than I did the 'John' Dalton of Swayze's film. I thought the background or the character was much more interesting to boot, a UFC fighter who ""accidentally"" killed his opponent feels much heavier and more intriguing than a guy with a philosophy PhD who killed a guy in self defense, but maybe that's just me. Another thing I really enjoyed here was just how frightening Dalton was, from his very first scene on camera everyone starts absolutely freaking out because they're terrified of fighting him, and that continues throughout the entirety of the film. Gyllenhaal's version of Dalton radiates badass energy and it's shown time and time again how scary of a man he is, especially when he actually tries during his fights, which can get seriously violent.This is for sure a movie you should be watching with another person, it would have a much better reception if everyone was watching it in theaters with other audience members instead of by themselves on a television screen or a laptop. My viewing of this film was heavily impacted by the fact my mother was watching it with me and her reactions to everything that happened on screen definitely made it more entertaining where I'd be much less likely to like it if I watched it alone. Definitely a movie that's built around the idea that people watching it will audibly react to the stuff occurring on screen, and I think that is what made it so much better for me, and releasing this straight to streaming definitely wasn't the right move for that reason.There's one thing that I find a little jarring about the entire experience though and that's just the way the action scenes are filmed. It's not like horrendous by any means, at least not in my opinion, but they're definitely in your face and all over the place a lot of the time. The camera seems to follow the action that's taking place on screen, or more specifically the actor doing the action scene, and as they toss people around or slam them into tables the camera violently follows those same movements, which does get a little bit strange if you're not used to it. Personally I think I got used to the way it was shot pretty quickly and that for sure helped me enjoy the fight scenes more, but I can absolutely see why it would turn some people off of the action. It's extremely intentionally intense and I loved that, every punch has an insane amount of weight to it and they all feel REAL, which definitely added to the overall feeling of being in the world alongside the characters. Some really good fight scenes in here that made my mom audibly react, and not be able to look at the stuff being inflicted on screen.I thought this was better than the original movie, and I'm glad that the romance wasn't nearly as big a plot point here as it was then, even if it's still fairly prominent. It's also just a very different story than the original was, really the only similarities are bar, bouncer named Dalton who regrets killing someone in the past, and also love interest who is a doctor. Other than that pretty much everything that happens in this film deviates very heavily from the source material, the story flows entirely differently and the plot has basically no ties to what went on in the Swayze film. Plus the final fight in this movie is like a million times better than the, what I consider to be, slightly rushed ending of the 89' one. Conor McGregor is a goofy ahh fella and I love his little stance as he walks around, and his silly accent. Surprisingly really good in this film despite being a very comedic character, had a lot of charm and his fight scene with Gyllenhaal's character were amazing.I adored the end credits to this movie by the way, I usually never pay much attention to the end credit sequence of movies, unless we're talking like pre COVID MCU/Marvel movies where that's all I did; but the end credit sequence here was a blast. I really liked the way it used scenes throughout the film and super imposed on certain aspects of them, and cgi rendered them in the background (I think). Plus the Post Malone song playing in the background of the credits was a banger, I have really always been a fan of Post Malone, mainly because of how goofy a guy he is. I really liked his little cameo here, and his tiny intro fight was quite good and I wish there was more of him.This isn't everyone's thing, and it is very similar to its predecessor in that regard. A very dumb fun movie that just aims to please the audience who loves great looking action scenes and one badass main character. I had a really fun time with it, and if you're going to sit down to watch it I recommend watching it with someone you know, definitely makes the experience much better. This is 110% a dad film, and I love that for it. Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors of all time, and he did a really good job at playing a cool guy, plus he's seriously ripped here my god, I really need to watch Southpaw after this. I can see why people might not enjoy this one, but I did, and if you are in the right mindset going in I think you'll have a good time as well. I'm not recommending it very avidly but if you wanna watch cool action and turn your brain off this is a very good choice in recent years.","14 out of 18 found this helpful."

There were moments in the movie where I felt his comedic timing was very good too.The movie felt slightly too long at times and was left just wanting the story to progress a bit quicker. This feeling was predominantly for the second half of the movie as the first was giving feel-good vibes as there were a lot of wholesome moments.CGI was used for some of the action scenes and unfortunately, it was not very well done.McGregor does a decent job as the villian. Considering it's his first time acting I thought he did well but, I went in with very low expectations for him.I don't know if this did the original movie justice, however if you've not see the original and want an action packed, wholesome movie with some decent character development for the protagonist this is a nice watch.","4 out of 12 found this helpful."

He can do no wrong. Outside of that, this film does a couple things wrong. One thing it does great is thrill! You are always cheering for the good guy, and jeering at the bad guys. And, there is plenty of opportunities to do just that. The fight choreography is filled up to the brim with exciting movement. Every punch and kick felt like they had weight to them, and the over the top destruction of every set was nothing short of explosive. That bar is going to go broke just from buying tables alone.Billy Magnussen, I hope, will continue to appear in films that I watch. I have enjoyed him in every film I have seen him in, and he has played his roles well. He can be funny, he can be a support role, and we now see that he can at least play the rich bad guy. He's not the threatening villain that comes in swinging an axe, but I believed that he could be the son of a wealthy criminal who is trying to make a name for himself. By the way, that hotel model was gorgeous!Speaking of the real villain, we have Connor McGregor. He can't act his way out of a wet paper bag, but d*mn can he menace! He, obviously, is extremely believable as a fighting monster, and I can see that he enjoyed the choreographed fight scenes. His character was the full blown, over the top psychopath with zero fear of anyone or death. And, all of this is totally acceptable in this movie! Even the bad acting! It's ROAD HOUSE! Yeah!The supporting cast was overall decent. Everyone played their parts in the action genre. Set pieces that add to the scenery, and move the story along. Sometimes with great humor. Speaking of which, I am truly starting to love Arturo Castro. You see him in smaller parts, you saw him in The Menu, but you never see him as they allowed him to shine in this movie. He was the comic relief, but it wasn't just a joke. You could see a backstory behind the humor. I know that was the point of the writing, but Castro just does it better. I want to see more of him as well.Did you like Top Gun: Maverick? If the answer is yes, then you will probably like this as well. If you are a fan of the old Road House, then you will probably fall into one of two camps. One, you see this for what it is, a cash grab vehicle to put some cool action on film. Waa! Waa! Art is dead! You took my beautiful 90's overblown B movie, and remade it into a 2020's overblown B movie! Two, you see this for what it is, and you realize that Hollywood is not going to stop doing this. Ever. So, you ride the wave, watch my man Jakie G go to town on some local thugs and then have to face off with the big boss man (the actor of whom happens to be a former MMA bad*ss), and then feel like you do after every big budget action movie. Satisfied that there was a little excitement in the form of a movie, that happens to come free with your Amazon subscription. Free 3 day shipping too? Amazon Music? Nice.It is what it is. If this movie didn't have Jakie G, baby!, Billy Magnussen, and Arturo Castro, I would have rated this much lower probably. 6.25/10 slightly lame endings.","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

Road House takes the name and the general premise of the original and updates it for modern times.Fortunately, the ""updating for modern times"" isn't done in the usual Hollywood way of creating safe enviroment for people who identify as this or that and spending most of the movie preaching some political view most of the world couldn't care less about.It's Florida instead of where ever the original was, it's mixed martial arts instead of karate and it's Jake Gyllenhaal instead of Swayze... and it works.Gyllenhaal plays his part well enough. He's a former UFC fighter with a skeleton in his closet. He doesn't show it to the world, approaches everything with this laid back demeanor that sometimes feels forced but at times lands perfectly for a specific scene. The whole vibe of the movie is just that, one notch away from being a flat out over the top comedy. The gangsters, their attempts at doing their boss's bidding, the boss himself and the big baddie, they're all tiptoeing on the verge of ludicrous.Conor McGregor is... well, Conor McGregor. The swagger, the talk, it's him but being called Knox. I'm not a UFC fan, never really liked the sport but I've seen enough of him in and around it to know who he is. Regardless, he plays the off the rails nut job sent on a job everyone else keeps failing as well as someone who's not an actor can. Liman probably just told him ""be yourself"" and it fits.The supporting cast also does a good job, Arturo Castro's Moe being a highlight in what little scenes he's in. A genuinely nice guy who somehow wound up mixed up with thugs... and he just runs with it.All in all, take this movie for what it is and you'll have a fun ride. It's not philosophical, it doesn't ask deep questions, doesn't require you to think at all, it's just a fun ride.Been a while since people approached making movies with that in mind.","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

While the movie excels in delivering pulse-pounding action sequences reminiscent of the genre's golden era, some viewers may find the character development lacking in depth.Despite attempts to evoke empathy for protagonist Elwood Dalton, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, his backstory feels somewhat underexplored, particularly in relation to his UFC career failure and the significance of the bookshop burning incident close to the end of the movie.Injecting a sense of vulnerability or peril into Dalton's character could have added layers to his persona, making him more relatable to audiences.Nonetheless, the film succeeds in capturing the essence of '80s action cinema, offering viewers an enjoyable ride filled with adrenaline-fueled excitement and a gratifyingly drawn-out climax. In terms of modern action movies, this Road House stands out for its nostalgic charm and faithful adherence to tropes of its genre predecessors.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

There are good one liners in the movie, most of the action is intense and fun to watch, and unlike some other recent action movies, I didn't feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this one.

The way he was hired was just out of control corny awesomeness.

That guy is hilarious, and he adds to the fun and excitement.I can't see any thing more better about this movie because it just takes all the boxes in so many ways.

I was in the mood for a classic action movie vibe, complete with a comfortably predictable plot, delightfully cheesy dialogue, and entertainingly exaggerated barroom brawls. And oh, did it deliver beyond my wildest dreams! It's essential to manage your expectations appropriately. Is this film a cinematic marvel that will redefine the genre? Not exactly. But is it an enjoyable romp that will keep you entertained from start to finish? Absolutely. It's packed with enough eye-roll-inducing moments to keep you entertained, and the forced one-liners are so bad they're on the cusp of being amusing.In summary, while this film may not set new benchmarks in cinematic achievement, it certainly fulfills its role as an entertaining watch. It's peppered with enough over-the-top action, forced humor, and nostalgic nods to the original to make it a worthwhile experience for those looking for an action-packed adventure.

Didn't get either.It starts with roughly the right tone and pacing. Sadly, this drops off after about 15 minutes. The story is uneven, characters thin and dialogue is awful. By the time that Connor McGregor turns up the film is already flat lining but through no fault of his own, the film loses its way completely when his 'Knox' character turns up. He just isn't needed at all. The plot is already struggling at this point and then the 'anti-dalton' expert fighter is just a 'bolt on' that adds nothing to the narrative.The BTS stunt footage makes it look like the fight choreography was probably amazing. The way the camera work is done during the fight scenes though detracts completely from the action.Gyllenhaal is likeable throughout but that's all. To be honest, he doesn't really pull off the ""I'm traumatised by killing someone"" persona until that is completely spelled out to the audience and then the switch at the ""I've been pushed too far"" moment isn't really that dramatic or convincingly portrayed.The original was no masterpiece (it wasn't supposed to be) but this is a very weak remake (especially given the hype).","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

Jake is always interesting to see in a movie and I like his Dalton character. The other characters weren't that fleshed out, and the Connor character was plain silly and over the top, but I just went with it. After all, the film needed someone able to equal the Dalton character in fighting skills. Don't focus on the story or plot too much as it is pretty simple. The biggest plus for me were the way the fight sequences were shot and edited - very energetic and in your face, and far more entertaining than the original Patrick Swayze version (I did watch that version a few days after this one, and it kinda, almost stand up decades later, but is very dated in many ways). I also liked the bookshop girl and her western analogy that she presents to Jake, not subtle at all, but nothing in this film is subtle. The zen of bouncing (""Be nice"") from the first film version is not here, but replaced with a caring side to the Dalton character where he takes those he hurts to the hospital.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Dalton, the main protagonist and Conor McGregor as the bad-ass Knox. The story is fairly straight-forward, a bunch of tugs instructed by a rich and corrupt developer the remove the last stand between him and his development plans. Dalton is of-course the savior of the little people, their cowboy and the knight in shining armor. It is a fast-paced action full adventure with plenty of fists-fights on all levels, some of them more serious then others.It is a well-made movie, CGI is good and all the actors dong a great job, but it is a bit soulless. The attempt to bring some softness and kindness to the story with the inclusion of Hannah Love Lanier is nice but it's not enough to give this movie and emotional twist. Also Daniela Melchior, as beautiful as she is, stays cold for most of the script.Overall this is a good ""turn off your brain"" action movie. It's long and start to be repetitive at some point but it ends just before getting too boring. Really nothing wrong with it other than it will not leave a lasting impression on you other then remembering the image of the nearly-naked McGregor here and there.The story of why Dalton left UFC is an interesting one and I wish it was more developed, again nothing wrong here, just feeling like the surface was scraped but not dug into.Guide: R rated due to extreme violence, rough language, but no sex scenes. Exact score: 71 / 100.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

It seems they wanted to borrow the themes, in a different location, and just make more of an entertaining action movie.The movie starts in the ring, Jake Gyllenhaal as martial arts fighter Dalton is finishing off the opponent and it looked personal. He developed a reputation for being something different, a nice guy who could become brutal when agitated by an injustice. (In many ways similar to McCall in Denzel Washington's several 'Equalizer' movies.)So Dalton decides to accept the well-paid position of bouncer at the Florida Keys Road House bar and restaurant with live entertainment. The business had been plagued by fights and Dalton soon realizes it is because a wealthy man wants the place for himself and will do anything, hire any troublemakers, to try and get it.A novelty is ""introducing"" MMA fighter, Scotsman Conor McGregor as Knox, sort of a ""Tasmanian Devil"" character come alive. He and Dalton have a couple of brutal but very entertaining fights. I don't like McGregor much, from negative things I have seen in the news about him, but frankly he does a great job as the villain fighter, he seems a natural in front of the camera. And the scene of him walking nude through an outdoor market is a hoot!Not a great movie by any measure, but it is funny and entertaining.

Their contrasting motivations and personalities drive the narrative forward, adding layers of complexity to the story.Despite differing opinions on secondary characters and storyline coherence, I found the conclusion to be justified, with Jake's character undergoing a notable evolution.In summary, Road House delivers a thrilling experience that is well-suited for home viewing.

The fights are random. The music is random. The plot, such as it is, is random. Having a pre-teen girl as one of the main characters is random. Rapper Post Malone appears early in the movie and he should never be allowed to take off his shirt in public again. NO ONE should be forced to see tattooed man-boobs. The notorious MMA fighter Conor McGregor makes his first movie appearance as, essentially, a bearded cartoon. Think a bowlegged Roadrunner or Tasmanian Devil. Gyllenhall sleepwalks through his part although he can thank the producers for paying for his weight training. He is CUT. Nowhere do you see the quirky madness that Ben Gazzara brought to the villain in the original. Or the beauty and sexuality that Kelly Lynch brought. Or the humor and rough wisdom of Sam Elliott. I watched this movie so YOU don't have to. You're welcome.","16 out of 28 found this helpful."

From start to finish, it's an adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster ride that leaves you on the edge of your seat. And let's talk about Jake Gyllenhaal - WOW! He absolutely nailed his role, delivering a performance that's beyond compare. Seriously, I haven't seen someone do it better.But hold on, because the surprises don't stop there. Conor McGregor's debut? Phenomenal! His presence on screen is electrifying, and his performance packs a punch that's impossible to ignore.And don't even get me started on the fight scenes. They are next level. Captivating, intense, and filled with fine detail that keeps you hooked from the first punch to the last.But amidst all the action, there's depth too. The dialogue is sharp, especially lines like Elwood Dalton's: ""I am afraid. I'm afraid of what happens when somebody pushes me too far."" It's moments like these that add layers to the characters and elevate the movie beyond your typical action flick.So, if you're looking for a movie that's not only thrilling but also delivers top-notch performances and memorable moments, look no further. This is it. Grab your popcorn and buckle up because you're in for one wild ride!","18 out of 26 found this helpful."

You're just asking for trouble trying to tell people you're remaking a classic especially when it's NOT a remake!Sadly, I seem to be in the minority on this but i enjoyed this movie very much. Jake was surprisingly believable, conor was a great villain and i looked forward to his every scene. The pace was nice and steady especially for a two hour movie, the story was flawed and a little soft but it made sense and didn't waste a lot of time. The movie knows and realizes you are there for jake and conor and let's everything else kind of get out of the way.The fight scenes were definitely interesting and different.

This movie could have been great - Jake Gyllenhaal held his own in the role of Dalton and Arturo Castro in the humorous, and almost genteel, role of Moe was a surprise and delight.

Trust me, there's so many shirtless scenes you won't care about ridiculous plot choices. The CGI was fine, the acting was hit and miss - and for Conor McGregor it was clearly easier to act crazy than it is to act.Doug Liman and Joel Silver prove to be a match made in action heaven, the fight scenes were bold and brazen with decent cinematography to boot.

The original wasn't a great film like Dead Poet's Society, Do The Right Thing, or Born On The Fourth OF July. It had moments that were cheesy and silly enough to make many people cringe. Though, it had its own charm. There was something about Dalton's philosophical view of the world, and moments that gave depth to his charcter and background. Something about the moment that Frank raises a fist after helping to fend off Wesley's goons. Something about the Double Deuce itself. Little wonder that it developed a cult following that's lasted over thirty years.This film is not a cheap reboot of the 1989 version. If you're looking for a succession of fan pleasing callbacks as some other reboots are a bit too quick to deliver, you'll be disappointed. What has been created here is a new film that's quite its own thing. The new bar has its own identity, featuring a different Dalton, in another town with different problems. It isn't a great film and cannot stand alongside the likes of Oppenheimer, Poor Things, or Dune 2. But, like the original, it has something about it. It largely hangs well together. There are moments of charm and it engages and entertains sufficiently even when things get somewhat silly, the camera movements distract, or some of the acting is too lightweight. Overall, it's delivered well enough that some might look back fondly on it in another thirty years time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

I would assume that was intentional.It felt like they left it open for a sequel if it was well received. I don't see that happening. McGregor's character was a little over the top, almost cartoonish.

Not really made it into the cinema but ok to watch at home. It's a bit mindless at times with lots of action and a fairly pointless plot. But the two main characters look funny and there is some good scenary of the supposed Florida keys even though the movie was filmed in DR. What is arguably most integral and intriguing to the movie is that roadhouse can call itself the first feature film to have Connor McGregor act in it. Many will watch for the athlete's first major motion picture. With Dan's of the UFC growing in recent years, and a well known actor playing the main character, McGregors presence in itself will draw the crowds. Amazon decided to release it on prime , to show paying for prime had some purpose other than getting deliveries on time. Reacher, a similar mindless action series with lots of fight scenes to keep the audience, with increasingly less attention span due to tik too etc., engaged in the film, is of similar pedigree to roadhouse, and perhaps the niche Amazon is carving out for itself, of 6.2 type pictures keeping viewers entertained but not completely satisfied.McGregor is funny and it doesn't really matter in the end why he is going around smacking people at this point. So the mediocre dialogue doesn't really matter in this movie.But overall it is a good watch. What to have a few beers to and laugh to now and again with the boys. Girls will probably like the physiques of some of the characters as well. So get a cheap whisker, and wash it down with roadhouse, even if it is just to see Connor McGregor make the transition into acting.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

It's obviously a blockbuster movie that asks you to turn off your brain because of the over-the-top and beautifully choreographed action, as the feature relies heavily on chaotic and senseless violence shown through a dizzying lens, a narrative that doesn't go beyond the surface, pitifully spoon-fed dialogue and a delightfully idiotic performance by Conor McGregor - a lot of pointless fun-. And after all that, I'm surprised I liked this movie at all - I suppose I had that feeling thanks to the great charisma coming from Jake Gyllenhaal.I haven't seen the eighties Road House, so I can't say much about changes and adaptations. However, I do know that the original became a cult classic because it was fun to watch on cable TV. Nothing in the movie was difficult to understand, or at least nothing made less sense if you got halfway through the movie. Regardless of where you started or stopped watching, you were guaranteed to see some thrills, violence or some kind of sexual appeal and probably a few laughs, intentional or not - and I firmly affirm this after watching six chapters of the Rocky Balboa saga, where it was really necessary to turn off my brain to absorb the likes of Ivan Drago and George Washington Duke.Although the cable TV movie ecosystem seems to be going extinct these days, this remake of Road House would have thrived in it too by keeping that same well-known essence of the eighties movie. These are the typical consistently entertaining movies that you could watch over and over again without ever intending to watch it twice. The remake builds up the atmosphere of a great bar; a place where you go less to get drunk than to soak up the vibes of the music and the regulars. It's much funnier and more satisfying than it has any right to be in reality.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

A lot of the story line (which kinda sorta of follows the original but not really), some roles switched from male to female, the locale, I didn't catch any cheesy lines like ""Pain don't hurt"", and the intention of the movie seems to be a little more serious then the original was.Is it worth a watch?

As far as this film goes on its own it's entertaining, it's got good fighting scenes, and it has a pleasant romance. The acting is good, but the sound is terrible. I don't know what's up with Prime movies, but they always fluctuate sound terribly. Sometimes it's speaking parts, other times its effects, and the rest of the time it's the on-screen music. Visually some of the effects suck such as explosions or vehicles flying, but those aren't dominate characteristic of the film. Overall, it's a decent movie that I enjoyed watching. If you like action packed movies then this one may be for you.That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!PS - The acting is good and I liked Jake Gyllenhaal as Dalton. He brings about a very tough, but calm demeanour to the role. I'm starting to like him better in action films the more he does them. The addition of Conor McGregor was entertaining. It definitely feels like the role was made for him rather than him made for the role. In true McGregor fashion the attitude and cockiness is there. It's more funny to watch in this film than when he's doing UFC presentations. Though his natural charisma is there it seems more forced than his fight pressers. Overall, I don't hate him in this film and think he did well.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Nonetheless, the integrity of the lead character Dalton is maintained; he's smart, tough, cool as a cucumber, pithy, and lethal when necessary. There was wondrous innovation in the fight scenes, too. Filmed in a visceral way that heightens the realism of action sequences. Hats off to the collaboration between special effects and stuntmen.Kudos to the debut of the big bad villain Conor McGregor, whom I've never heard of but is now seared into my mental film bank of onerous villains. His character was beyond bonkers, chaos incarnate, and downright scary! Daniela Melchior was lovely but miscast. Billy Magnussen, as always, was delightfully consistent in being his serious, smiley self.Finally, let's give a strong standing ovation to Jake Gyllenhaal's award-worthy performance. It's obvious he prepped intensely for the physical demands of the role and delivered another quality performance with an understated panache.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

I think the plot was miles better and more cohesive.This movie felt like chunks were missing, and it felt like the plot became filler, just to get you to the next fight scene.With that being said, the casting, was great. Until you get to Conor McGregor, who would have been outdone by a cardboard cutout. His role really feels like a cartoon character and takes you out of the movie.Go into this movie with an open mind and an understanding that you will NOT be watching a remake of Road House, but rather a new story, and I think you'll enjoy it.

Fake violence where nobody really gets hurt, and stunt actors who perform get well paid for their work.

His night ends with being stabbed in the parking lot. It's just another night except Frankie (Jessica Williams) offers him the job to clean up her Florida Keys bar, ""The Road House"". Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen) had hired local bikers to harass the bar in order to steal it on the cheap. When that doesn't work, Ben's imprisoned father hires crazed fighter Knox (Conor McGregor). Ellie (Daniela Melchior) is a nurse who takes a liking to Dalton.I don't like the original as much as most fans. Everybody seems to like the fights and the rowdiness and the crazy action fun. For me, I like Dalton's smarts the most. He's the guy on reality TV who comes in and fixes a rundown bar. He's the smartest guy in the room. I love the early parts where he's fixing all the problems. That's why I really miss buying the tires. First, he buys the car where the lights can be retracted. The used tires show that he knows what's coming and he's prepared for it. His brain power is really the best part of the original.In this version, Dalton is not as smart and director Doug Liman is concentrating more on his body. Most of all, Liman knows to be cheeky. The sunshine state looks very sunshiny. The people are very surfacy. The villains are having ridiculous fun being baddies. This one adds a troubled mind to Dalton and that leads to a change in him in the middle of movie. That part is a little wonky. Liman needs to foreshadow that better by showing his big UFC fight at the beginning. This movie has some good camp and fun. The dark part causes some wobbling.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

Gyllenhaal's Dalton literally just wanders thru this, sorta showing the bouncers how to fight. But mainly, he let's them do all the work until he finally gets really really mad, which, looks about same as him not really really mad. It just has cooler camera work and bigger explosions.I liked Conner MacGregor in this. He was over the top and the only one who seemed to be in the spirit of the original. At least he was a real villian and not some whiney rich kid so dumb he wants to get a straight razor shave on a speeding boat. I'm not making that up. That's our intro to the ""Bad Guy"".All the other henchmen suck. None of them call their boss ""boss"" and none of them bragged about what they did to dudes on prison. They basically hatched stupid plans, executed them stupider and then died. One by random crocodile. That part was kinda cool. Sorry EZ.The doctor love interest is this one. But she seems to barely interest Gyllenhaal. Or us. Not her fault, her character sucks and should be named Plot Point. She really had no chance against Kelly Lynch.All this said, I wasn't bored with this. I just didn't get why they killed the fun. Just like the Point Break remake.

Overall, a mindless action-remake that has an entertaining performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, well-choregraphed action sequences, and pretty good humor, but the movie is really held back by its formulaic story, bad over-the-top dialogue, and bad performances from some of the cast.Pretty Bad to Decent Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good because the action sequences are well choreographed and have a unique/over-the-top style that makes the movie entertaining, and the worldbuilding/scene-setting helps highlight the Florida Keys; the direction on a microscale is bad because a lot of the performances felt off/inexperienced, and the interpersonal scenes feel so forced and rigid, but he does do a good job in setting up the comedy in the movie; the storytelling is very formulaic and emulates action movies from the 80s (so basically Road House); he builds tension somewhat well, but it definitely feels forced for the most part), Bad Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Jake Gyllenhaal (Has good comedic timing and is a good action star in the fighting sequences, but it feels like this performance is more propelled by his acting experience rather than the material), Bad from Daniela Melchior (A pretty Monotonous performance that does not play off of Gyllenhaal at all), Decent from Billy Magnussen (The character is really written for him because of his past roles (the rich arrogant prick)), Decent to Pretty Good from Jessica Williams (Has good scenes with Gyllenhaal), Very Bad to Bad from Joaquim de Almeida (Has no emotion and feels very off compared to the rest of the cast), Decent from Austin Post (He's in the movie for like 2 minutes), Very Bad to Bad from Conor McGregor (He just plays his persona, but his lack of acting experience shows as he misses a lot of his queues), Pretty Good from Arturo Castro (The comedic relief character as he does a good job with his meta interjections), Very Bad to Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of inexperienced actors who do not develop chemistry in the cast or buttress Gyllenhaal; this does not include child actors)), Pretty Bad to Decent Story (The concept is super simple as it uses the same action-movie template as its predecessor (but the movie is really more about the action/fighting sequences that it really doesn't matter that much); the plot structure is very formulaic to the 80s action movie template; character writing is good for the protagonist as they provide some depth to his character and his trauma, but the rest of the characters are just cookie-cutter shallow characters from action movies), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is just so forced and bad overall because it tries super hard to emulate the over-the-top 80s, but this ends up making the movie feel unnatural; the humor is pretty good as they make an effort to inject comedy whenever they can, and it hits probably 3 out of 5 times; the symbolism is surprisingly prevalent for the protagonist as the movie touches on themes about trauma and duty, but beside that its pretty shallow; the foreshadowing is only prevalent because the movie is very formulaic/predictable), Pretty Good Score (Along with the soundtrack, it helps establish that 80s Road House, action-movie feel), Good to Very Good Cinematography (I really enjoyed how the action-scenes were filmed as the use of wide-angle, panning, and following shots really help give the fighting scenes a unique feeling), Good Editing (Really well executed in the action sequences to give it an over-the-top feel), Good to Very Good Sound (Helped make the fighting sequences/punches feel very crisp), Good Visual Effects (Very over-the-top, but still well executed and enjoyable), Pacing is fine as the movie just follows a template, Climax is decent as it's just over-the-top action on a massive scale (still very enjoyable), Tone is very over-the-top with its 80s action-style (but does a pretty good job at lightening the mood with humor), Saw an encore screening at SXSW.","79 out of 175 found this helpful."

It's perplexing how a movie centered around fighting could feature such lackluster combat sequences, especially when it boasts the involvement of seasoned MMA fighters. To exacerbate matters, the excessive use of subpar CGI effects only serves to further diminish the quality.This movie is a significant waste of resources and a blatant disservice to its predecessor.","13 out of 23 found this helpful."

The forced empathy Dalton has for the kid is never developed and comes out of nowhere, making the ending not believable.I have visited the Florida Keys and it is one of the least diverse places in Florida, Google ""Florida Keys crowds"" so why create an imaginary universe if not for DEI? The largest minority group are Hispanics, specifically Cuban Americans who are given no screen time here in favor of the message.The re-imagined African American female owner ""Frankie"" of The Road House set now in the beautiful Florida Keys is beyond laughable and poorly acted by Jessica Williams. Her bar includes an ugly and obese bartender seen no where in America, skinny college age boys as ""bouncers"" and the most ridiculously diverse bar bands that do not even exist in NYC let alone the Florida Keys.Thankfully the fight scenes are well choreographed and they give Dalton a believable love interest in Portuguese actress Daniela Melchior as Ellie but they go out of their way to make her look as unattractive as possible despite the sexier images you can easily find online. It clearly looks as if the costumer director intentionally hid her femininity.Thankfully Conor McGregor steals the show and his presence is the most entertaining thing on the screen. Up until the very last few minutes of the final fight he may have been perfectly done, thankfully the post-credit ending takes some of the seriousness of the brutal fight down a notch.The original film is good but not my favorite action movie and has lots of room for improvement. It is not some sacred thing that cannot be redone but if you are going to insult it with a DEI re-shoot then I can understand the concerns as justifiable. Still the action scenes alone easily make up for the paint by numbers plot and for that this deserves a higher rating.","2 out of 13 found this helpful."

But every once in a while, one comes along that surprises me; one that understands what it means to entertain. Road House (2024) is the definition of entertaining.This is a highly enjoyable and fun action flick. It has a mostly light-hearted tone, but there are a few moments that demonstrate the seriousness; a few looks given by Gyllenhaal that chilled me to the bone.To continue on that topic, Gyllenhaal gives yet another phenomenal performance. He has this weird demeanor of someone relaxed, chill, and carefree. But there is always something more behind his eyes.The fight scenes are fantastic. I had my jaw dropped for extended periods. There are so many punches where they focus on letting us see the hit. I don't know how they did it so well.The other surprise is the humor. I full-volume laughed repeatedly, my favorite being the nice henchman. And it never feels random or forced. Most of the laughs aren't even jokes, but rather situational humor within the action.One last point of note, I want to thank these filmmakers for having the courage to go for an R-rating. It seems obvious for this type of movie, and for a movie that's not dependent on ticket sales. But I've seen too many movies, even streaming, that opt for the neutered version of their film. A few that come to mind: Rebel Moon, The Gray Man, Samaritan.I had a blast watching Road House. I think most people will love it. It may not be super deep, but it remembers how to entertain.(1 viewing, 3/20/2024)","278 out of 531 found this helpful."

I was kinda presently surprised to watch a recent, apparently well-made movie portraying men as strong man that can throw a punch. Connor McGreggor was another reason to see the movie, but his stupid smile and lines nagged me from the trailer and posters. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy. He looks like a living inspiration of hard work and perseverance. Just the stupid, not funny at all bad guys from some movies, are what ruins movies. A rule of thumb: the better the villain, the better the movie.I noticed the ""message"" diversity and inclusion in this movie, but IMO wasn't too distracting ( as in other movies where becomes the primary focus)
When writers are focussed on politics, they generally end up portraying as annoying, characters they intended to make funny( Cpt Marvel as a classic example)I hope They for whatever reason decided to portray this way McGregor and didn't really think it was funny or likeable. Or maybe he has a walking problem, and I'm gonna get cancelled. In the Italian version, this voice is plainly annoying and looks like a cartoon of himself.Same with the bookstore teen girl, Of course we gonna make her really badass with a baseball bat confronting the Hells Angels. Hmmm what is your plan exactly?I'm ok with Strong girl/women, I'm not ok, with pushing them to be stupidAnother problem I have with movies, is when they don't make logical sense, I'm still giving this a 7, since from one of the first scenes, the guy takes a knife without blinking as it were a punchline. Calm, collected, was missing, he just gives a hug to the one who did it. Yeah, I got it, he's a Superman and this is a superhero movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

The production faced problems that the original didn't encounter. Namely, the diversity mandate placed on Hollywood productions these days.All the minorities were portrayed favorably, while the villains were all played by white actors (except Dalton). There is nothing wrong with a diverse cast, but like everything else, too much of something CAN get a little distracting and annoying.Overall, an OK watch, but it doesn't merit a rewatch.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

The acting was above and beyond, full hearted character portrayal and emotion displayed. The cinematography was elementary, like a film producer with a new lens they are excited to try out, but it really isn't right for the scene. Possibly some sales pitch about the style of camera work being ""the new trend"" but half way through the movie I had enough of the terrible angles and poor direction. The script was also not great, really cheesy amateur ""tv"" stereotype foreshadowing, it seemed like the writers were baiting the audience to feel informed and then able to figure out what's going on, like a psychological scheme to release brain chemicals haha without getting to far off track, the script made the actors ""indicate"" they were acting, frequently. The special effects were very lazy AI reminding me of the 90's computer animations. There was a lot of bad directing overall, by the end of the film I wondered if Jake was simply ready to end the movie. I imagined the producer just going ""this is garbage"" like 3/4 through and just being like how did I not see how terrible I was making this movie. Jake and Conner really saved the film, at which point I was watching Jake and Connor not what ever was happening in the story, and without them this movie would be really boring and quite amateur.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

The newer adaptation has no mixed perception about itself as well; this film knows what it is and embraces the simplicity of the original (in the best way possible). I think if you are a fan of the original but can have an open mind you will enjoy it. It's stupid, it's over the top, it's Road House, and that's what the film was meant to originally embrace.

It had no story and it had a lot of CGI that was very cringe worthy. Shouldn't of remade it.Nowhere near as good as the original. Y'all need to stop remaking classics. This felt like a money grab. Don't use a lot of CGI in future movies. Stop making money grab movies. Make movies that are not the same storyline with ""different"" characters. Not everything has to be made with CGI.

It's a remake of Road House which was a somewhat cheesy 80's action flick. Giving it under 5 stars is just unfair and almost as if you're trying to counter the high ratings. It's no 10, but 2? Come on...This updated version is more, not totally, plausible, but still just a movie made for entertainment. I don't think they were going for Oscars. Most all the actors were pretty good. Jake Gyllenhaals character was clever and usually had something witty to say. Conor's (""Knox"") acting was decent. Remember, he's used to entertaining in the ring, but he's not a trained actor. However, they could have backed off on his insane smiling and not had him walk so odd in every scene. Unless I missed it, I would have liked more on his back-story. Was he former MMA, UFC? I don't believe he was as the main people didn't seem to know him. But how could hold up against, and sometimes get the edge on, a former UFC champ? A movie is only so long and can't be as thorough as a series so I accept it for what it was and really enjoyed it. I'd go 7.5, but since that's not possible I rounded up.","52 out of 92 found this helpful."

I almost enjoyed it!Jake G is good. His character actually feels like he has some depth to him, he's fun and serious and moody. Makes friends, stays guarded - well done!Even the other characters are solid. The bar made and the kids he trains to be bouncers are fun! We needed a lot more of them and their characters.Then Conner shows up, and it goes sideways. He can't act, and even though he really didn't need to act, he still makes a mess of it. He just stomps around, mumbles one liners, and while I get what they were going for with his character - Conner doesn't deliver. There are a bunch of other tough men who could have actually made the roll believable and solid.And what was up with the cgi? The truck on the bridge and the canoe falling from the ceiling stuck out as entirely out of place, poorly done cgi.The movie is ... fine.

Road House's answers to these are: why, just because it's an IP that could draw people, how can you honor or improve, no need to honor or improve anything. Jake Gyllenhaal is a good draw and it's interesting to see the choices they do for a remake, but there's not much draw other than those things. Unfortunately if you are drawn to the movie, nothing will make you want to revisit is like you would with the original.Even if you were not compare the remake to the original, there's some glaring issues with this tropical action mess. Things start off good enough. We get the ""I'm not interested in your offer to be a cooker at a bar"" to mind changed 2 minutes later. Some nice scenes with Dalton being introduced to the Florida Keys beach town. Stakes are set up early on and there's some good fights happening, especially with Gyllenhaal displaying high levels of charisma. This is where things start to fall apart, though, as the villains are base level with Conor McGregor's character especially having no ambition. Music choices could be better. There's protagonists that have no place in the film and others that could be developed more, with the love interest being cannon fodder for a cgi-ridden third act.Everything that elevates the 1989 classic from being a generic film is left out of the remake. What you have left is a movie that looks good and has good moments, but offers nothing to make it memorable. It's not a movie you necessarily hate, but there's nothing to love. A new theory in Hollywood will be how much a script is written by AI. This feels like one of them.","1 out of 7 found this helpful."

This film has been massively hyped up, with Connor McGregor and Jake Gyllenhaal touring all over to promote this film. As a result, the audience expects a rocket ship of a ride, combining the relatively good acting skills of Jake with Connor's top tier martial art skills. What we're left with is a relatively disjointed movie experience, which begins with a great, positive and true American fashion movie, which quickly becomes dull and too focused on the story. I'll admit, accomplishing both action and great storytelling is extremely hard, much less near impossible in today's film industry. Connor's acting is quite frankly terrible, I would go as far as saying he's not even acting; he's just trying to be bigger than life Connor. What's with that stupid walk? And the bulging stance? The film certainly contains some great scenes, but the middle feels like it focuses too much on the storytelling, leaving behind any form of reason to keep one invested in the film, other than the predictable ending where Jake and Connor will inevitably face off. On the whole, a mediocre film which was let down by its extravagant marketing efforts, leaving me feeling like I'd somewhat wasted my time.P.

He's TOO cheesy. Not funny. And just an irritating character (though he's really just playing himself) that is a poor on screen counterpart to Gyllenhaals Dalton.

It had a nonchalant bizarre kind of humour and acting but it does lose it. Connor Mcgregor surprised me and had a very cheeky and just generally silly role that was just really amusing to watch. Some of the early fights were fun too.What I didnt like: The movie would've been fine contained in more simplicity, goings on in the Roadhouse and other more confined story. It just tries too hard to become some big action epic which it rushes to become and at the same time slows itself way down and hobbles the story because of the drastic transition. For what the movie is it really lacked action outside the beginning and end like a sandwich with one piece of cheese in the middle. The beginning builds the story up and has some cool fights and funny moments, then it spends most the film stuck in the transition to some intended action flick with vehicular fighting, explosions and murder. What's more shocking is that the simple bar fights in the beginning were the highlight of all the action.It's a very frustrating thing that Hollywood always has to blow everything up to ridiculous ends. Movies can just exist as what they are and be contained and grounded, we aren't all children and we have a reasonable attention span. I'd like to think so anyway.","31 out of 69 found this helpful."

The directorial work is captivating for those who enjoy the genre, as there are shots that dare to innovate by incorporating first-person views in the midst of the whirlwind of fight sequences. The photography also adds to an entertaining choice of cameras during the confrontations. There is also good and measured use of drones. Good technical work.As for the performances, Gyllenhaal's acting range and charisma are known, which are maintained in this story. All the supporting characters fulfill their roles decently, with the exception of the main villain to defeat. Everything about Conor McGregor is off the mark. Overwhelming exaggeration, terrible acting and a laughably implausible corporality.

Surely, I cannot have been the only one going into this thinking that it would just be a simple action flick that will contain some witty and some horrible one-liners, with a rather simple-to-follow plot line, and some entertaining bare knuckle fight scenes. To me, it seemed clear, about 20-30 minutes in that this was not a movie that was taking itself very seriously. Jake Gyllenhaal's laissez-faire, slightly defaitist attitude shown almost entirely throughout the story was, in my opinion, mirroring the overall spirit in which the movie was shot. I guess some people do not appreciate this directing style, but if you're willing to come off your high horse and acknowledge that they were not trying to go for Oscar-greatness, you might come around to liking it for what it is: a fun little movie that you can watch after a long day at work when all you want to do is to switch your brain off for a little while before going to bed.To be clear, that does not mean it merits 8 or 9 stars either. It is, after all, not exactly Oppenheimer. The dialogue is often quite clunky, side characters do not get a chance to shine much (though I will say that I found Arturo Castro pretty funny as one of the motorbike gangsters), the villain wasn't compelling, and the plot line is anything but a logical marvel. However, in contrast to many of the naysayers here, I found Connor McGregor quite entertaining. He looks like he had a blast, plays - I mean, what did you expect? - mostly himself, and turned the villain's henchman role into a maniacal over-the-top killing brawler. Is he going to have his own star on the Hollywood walk of fame in the future? Probably not. But was it funny to watch him making his way through the plot as though he had coconuts for testicles, invisible swimmies inflated around his arms, and seemingly no awareness of the fact that cars come with breaks? I'd say yes.In conclusion, this movie is for you if you are not looking for lots of intellectual stimulation, are not expecting a one-to-one adaption of the Patrick Swayze flick (which, let's be honest, was not a stellar piece of filmmaking either), and just want to watch a somewhat decent movie with some entertaining fight and action scenes to pass the time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Some of the lines are incredibly bad and out of place, and yet they're presented like they're meant to be clever or funny. Gyllenhaal does his job well - he looks good and fights decently well, but the only other draw card is McGregor and he acts like he's been bashed in the head too many times. The fights are fine-ish but not good enough to carry the story (and lots of VFX obvious for riskier shots.) The story is so bad, but maybe the writers assume every person watching has head trauma of an MMA fighter anyway so they thought it'd be ok?Give it a pass.","18 out of 37 found this helpful."

The cameraman couldn't hold the camera still for more than a second and there were contant gratuitous panning for absolutely no reason. So you had unsteady handheld vertical and horizontal movement constantly throughout the film. It was nauseating. Then you have the terrible writing that made Dalton into a wear combination of class clown and supposedly world class MMA fighter. Then you have a roided-up McGregor playing the villain and clearly being a vastly superior fighter in every scene matched up to the much leaner gyllenhaal. We're talking multiple weight class difference and makes the film absolutely laughable. It just felt like a high school film project with a massive budget.","9 out of 16 found this helpful."

I see only minimal parallels.This reference and the exclusion of the expectation of being presented with something like a serious action film with dramatic references. I would describe it more as an exaggerated action comedy and, as Comedy says, it's all about having fun. Everyone involved obviously had a lot of fun and this is certainly transferred to the viewer. Blinking your eyes before they are beaten green and blue, and this in a continuous loop. Stereotypes, clichés, a minimalist story, a holiday feeling, minus pretensions, all in a high-speed mixer and seasoned with amusement.

The film told the story of James Dalton working as a feared and very successful bouncer in the Double Deuce bar. The film acquired a cult status and in 2006 it got a straight to video sequel Road House 2: Last Call, by the way a really terrible bad film, by the way without Swayze. Sadly, Patrick Swayze lost us at the age of 57 in 2009 with the consequences of pancreatic cancer. Now there's the reboot of Road House and actually you have to wonder if you should want that, because didn't an 80's classic like Road House have its time a bit? This time Jake Gyllenhaal plays the lead, only this time we follow ex-UFC fighter Elwood Dalton. Funnily enough, MMA fighter Conor McGregor makes his acting debut in this film. McGregor is a beast of a fighter of course, he can't really act alone and that's a smear on this movie.Yet the film about the big picture is entertaining and it is not much less than its predecessor from 1989. The story is completely different and the only similarities you'll actually find in the film is the name Dalton, which is about bouncers in the film and the bands that have to play behind a piece of mesh in the Road House. For the rest, the comparisons will stop there and maybe that's the salvation, this is a real reboot of Road House and not a remake. Why I like the original from '89 better actually only has to do with the music in the film provided by the blind guitar virtuoso Jeff Healey and his Jeff Healy Band. For the rest, the cult classic from '89 was also nothing more than entertaining and this should not be made bigger than it is. This is just a piece that lacks in this reboot, it lacks the blues-like atmosphere, although of course the setting has moved from Missouri to the Florida Keys.The action is abundant and we are not going to mee about mistakes or unbelievable things in the film, because this is not the film for that. What in my opinion could have been a lot better are the fights and especially the effects of them. Each fight in the film uses full body-doubles because of the production using a new multi-pass method to perform seamless punches and kicks instead of mimicking hits or bypassing the action to be credible. In each fight, the doubles are pasted a few frames into the mount before being reassembled into real footage. This sometimes gives an effect as if working with AI, where the action is fake. For the rest, the film just runs as a standard action movie by default, where you won't get bored for a second. The film lasts 2 hours and that's really a great playing time for this film.Road House has become a great reboot of the 1989 cult classic. The only reason that movie was better was the music of The Jeff Healey Band, for the rest it's all of the same sheet a pack. The action is fine, although the fights sometimes look a bit fake. MMA fighter Conor McGregor makes his acting debut in this film and although the beastly fighter is ideally suited for the fight scenes, the man cannot act. Maybe if he's a few movies further that things will get better, but based on this movie I'd say McGregor better stick to the martial arts. Road House does not last too long with its two hours and walks its own way, there are a few similarities with Road House from 1989, but at the end of the film you will really have to draw the conclusion that these have really become two completely different films, where it may be difficult to see separately because of the subject and the name of the film, but it would not be fair to really compare them.","0 out of 6 found this helpful."

From ""Top Gun"" to ""Ghostbusters,"" nostalgia continues to drive many productions, with varying degrees of success. Amidst this wave of revival, the 1989 cult classic ""Road House"" has found its place among the remakes, albeit with a modern touch. Directed by Doug Liman and starring Jake Gyllenhaal, the 2024 iteration of ""Road House"" aims to capture the original spirit while updating it. However, as I immersed myself in the neon-lit atmospheres of Glass Key, Florida, I found a film that, like its predecessor, oscillates between pleasure and disappointment. Gyllenhaal portrays Elwood Dalton, a former UFC fighter tasked with restoring order in a Road House plagued by bikers and thugs. While initially distant, his performance gradually finds the right balance, albeit surrounded by shallow characters and awkward dialogues. One of the film's strengths is its willingness not to take itself too seriously. With moments of genuine humor and intense fight scenes, ""Road House"" offers glimpses of entertainment amidst its predictable narrative. However, these bright spots are often overshadowed by exaggerated performances, especially that of Conor McGregor, who risks becoming a caricature. Despite its flaws, ""Road House"" has its charm. Gyllenhaal and flashes of nostalgia keep the film afloat, although it struggles to maintain a steady pace. Liman's direction, while competent, fails to inject the necessary energy into the scenes, leaving the film on the brink of mediocrity, much like its predecessor. Ultimately, the 2024 ""Road House"" emerges as a mediocre remake. It's not a total failure, but neither is it a triumph of modern cinema. Instead, it occupies a middle ground: a bumpy yet surprisingly enjoyable journey, as forgettable as it is engaging. Reflecting on my journey through Glass Key, I can't help but feel ambivalence. ""Road House"" may not be a masterpiece, but it's a film that knows what it wants to be: a fun ride through nostalgia, engaging enough to warrant a viewing. Though it may not reach the epic heights hoped for, ""Road House"" (2024) manages to hit some points, despite its flaws. So, grab your popcorn, fasten your seatbelt, and get ready for an adventure in the territories of Glass Key: you might just pleasantly surprise yourself.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

While his portrayal lacks the charisma of Patrick Swayze's original, Gyllenhaal makes Dalton a compelling figure wrestling with his past. The fight choreography is brutal and well-shot, with a focus on realistic kicks and punches. The bar brawls are appropriately chaotic and energetic. The script injects some laughs, particularly through self-aware winks at the original film's cheesiness.The film tries to balance action, humor, and drama, but doesn't always land each element smoothly. While Gyllenhaal shines, some supporting actors fall flat. Conor McGregor's villain, though menacing, struggles with the dialogue. The story borrows heavily from the 1989 film, offering little that feels fresh.Doug Liman keeps the pace brisk, but the camerawork can be shaky during fight scenes, making it hard to follow the action at times. The Florida Keys setting is beautifully captured, with clear water and lush greenery.""Road House"" (2024) is a decent popcorn flick. It won't win awards, but it delivers on the promise of bar brawls, witty one-liners, and a charismatic lead (even if not quite as charismatic as the original). If you're looking for a mindless action movie with a touch of humor, this remake might just be your ticket.

I really like Jake Gyllenhaal and his roles so I watched it for him and possibly to see how Connor McGregor can act in his first movie lol That was kind of funny, however I see Connor fought most of the same way he does offset so that wasn't as fake. The movie did use too much cgi and the one liners from every well known to unknown actor in there were very very very bad and cheesy. Some things didn't follow up nor made any sense and I listen to the podcast smartless on the road and just heard jakes interview and Will Arnett and Jason Bateman were asking him questions about the movie and they both were pumped to see it themselves telling the listeners it looks really good, so that got me more fired up to see it other than the fact that I just watched the original one months ago and it wasn't too bad of a movie being 80s produced and all. So I thought this one was gonna live up to the same standard since Jake doesn't usually star in bad movies and he said one of the reasons he took this job was because he used to work with Patrick Swayze in Donnie darko as a kid at the time and was just in awe of him when he was younger and said he was the nicest guy and all the good things you would have usually heard about Swayze when he was alive. RIP 🙏 So he felt he needed to do this movie somewhat in honor of pat.My suggestion, if you're into corny and bad action movies, this will be perfect for ya, but don't expect any good qualities out of it.","8 out of 15 found this helpful."

However, for me, it's pretty comparable to how much I enjoyed the original Roadhouse despite the deviation from the originally story. The story is kind of silly and implausable. It does have some things going for it. Jake Gyllenhaal was a standout. He had some funny moments and good fight scenes. I also found the bar owner, Frankie, likable. Everyone else was pretty mediocre and forgettable in their roles. Well, with the exception of Connor McGreggor. He was memorable because his acting is so over the top, it's unintentionally laughable. But I have to admit that I actually kind of looked forward to his scenes because they were ridiculous.

The first thing that came to mind was the momentarily bad decisions in filming, which of course did not affect the movie experience much in the end.The biggest minus was the use of McGregor. You write what you read about the guy, as if he were acting himself. An asshole, that's a big mistake.Finally some good stuff.Some impressive downright flying cgi scenes.A familiar and safe story.Only a few well-known actors gave a workable result.Bottom line.. an 8 star movie drops to just 6 stars, mainly because of McGregor.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

That's Road House formula, through and through.If the original showcased the doctor as eye candy, this one injected a couple of girlboss roles which had nearly no effect on the story. In fact they were more a nuisance than supporting the main story.Gyllenhaal portrayal of Dalton was disappointing for me. Dalton was a cool and calm person in Swayze's portrayal, making Dalton's character a man's man. While Gyllenhaal was eratic when angry, almost lunatic.Lyman's style of action was very recognizable. The close camera and shaky AF confused me rather than engaging. What did I see in thise fights? 1989 Road House was a martial art action flick, this one was an action drama. A little too far than the high expectations.Then there's McGregor lunatic villain. He was the comedic and horror aspects of the film. Straight forward crazy dude with murderous habits. At least he was funny.The most annoying part of 2024 Road House was the detective investigation part of the story. This was truly unnecessary and made the film dragging its feet on the rough sand. All Lyman needed was a small over hearing conversation scene to bridge the story.In summary, I do feel 2024 Road House could be better if Lyman kept the story straighter, without the additional drama. Stylistic wise, Lyman's shaky close scenes were more annoying rather than engaging.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

But what about a remake of a bad movie? If you're honest with the original, it's not good. It's ridiculous. Yoga guy afraid to get in fights goes to a bar and cleans up town as a bouncer?! It was a stupid plot from the beginning, but the campy, ridiculous, over the top testosterone made it a cult classic. And rip Patrick Swayze, but don't tell me he was a good actor in that movie. He's a movie star doing movie star stuff.Cut to the remake starring Jake Gyllenhaal and of course it's bad, but actually better than I expected. The plot makes more sense than the original. The fighting is ridiculous and over the top but why not? McGregor is so crazy and I'm here for it. People think it's bad acting (it is), that he's over the top crazy (he is), but I think it's brilliant. ""Is there a world class UFC fighter out there that's over the top crazy? Like a guy that starts fight with buses full of other fighters?"" Ya they found the craziest fighter ever and had him be crazy. It's hilarious and gives the fighting a touch of authenticity. I mean the guy was a two division champ. He can fight. It's like the writers were like, ""let's have a movie star and a ufc star take a bunch of roids and fight each other everywhere.

I wasn't expecting a lot out of it, even coming from a standpoint of never seeing the original. But to my surprise, I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought I would.Jake Gyllenhaal's acting performance was great, and the storyline, while not groundbreaking, was good enough to make an enjoyable movie. The action was really fun, and the camera has you feel every punch that's thrown.But that's pretty much where the fun ends. Most of the acting from supporting characters isn't very good. Namely, Conor McGregor.Don't get me wrong, the man is a great fighter, which is why he's really good in the action scenes; but his acting is downright horrendous. A lot of his dialogue becomes very cringey simply by his delivery, and it really pulls you out of the movie, especially since he's a big part of the second act.Which brings me to one of my next points. McGregor isn't even introduced until the second half. It's very weird to watch a movie, get acquainted with the main antagonist (who is not McGregor), only to find out midway that that first villain is only ONE of TWO very important bad guys.It's a very weird dynamic to introduce a brand new character, who is supposed to be very important in the plot, in the middle of the movie. Because of that aspect, it once again, really brings you out of the movie.A lot of this movie is very messy, including a few plot holes, which I won't get into to avoid spoilers, and because this review is already as long as it is.But to add to the mess, the camera work and cinematography is really not all that great, apart from the action scenes, but even those can be a little jarring sometimes.Overall, is it a bad movie? No. Is it a great movie? Far from it.But if you like action and don't mind turning your brain off for a couple hours, then go ahead and give it a shot. It's truly not the worst film in the world, but it could have been a LOT better.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing in last year's film ""Coventant."" However, this film is so flawed and cheesy, it's much WORST than the 80s Patrick Swayze version. Here's a few thing that are so absurd--they make it hard to watch. Entertaining at times, but like a bad TV skit Where to start... having been to Florida 100 times and the Keys 20 times, I can tell you this gangster angry violent redneck vibe is NOT the Keys in any way. Perhaps there may be somewhere on the border for Florida/Alabama like this, but this is not the keys. The ""owner"" character is not like anyone in the Keys, the patrons are not like Keys folks, well dressed and relatively smart thugs does not make sense. Nothing really adds up here. Not even as a black comedy. The bands and the bar would never play there. Key West is one of the most laid back friendly places anywhere. Every patron is ready to fight or die every night it seems. Angry, drunk, gang thugs with nice bikes is not Key West. The original Patrick Swayze 1980s film was set in rural Missouri. Maybe there are some odd folks there for sure. But the Keys are VERY expensive. Even shacks can be pricey near the water. His love interest is also absurd. A doctor who thanks him for injured patients. If you can turn of 99% of your brain for 2 hours, this might be a visually fun angry fighting soap opera. Back to the bands... they are good, but would never play behind a chicken wire cage in the keys. Really a 5/10, but I'll add an extra point just because Doug Liman directed the classic LA/Vegas film Swingers. Stick to films like that Doug. Avoid these direct-to-streaming absurdity. And avoid politics. You can do much better.","0 out of 5 found this helpful."

Unfortunately, the entirety of the UFC story arc last about 2 minutes and the rest of it felt more like a cheesy 80s-90s action movie but without a gram of spirit, emotion or bravado. Jake is probably the only reason why people know about this film and even though he carries the whole thing on his charisma, it never feels enough to make the film consistently enjoyable.Road House is about an ex UFC fighter who gets hired as a bouncer in a bar by the oceanside. He soon realizes that this establishment is a target for a local crime family who will stop at nothing to obtain it. The whole experience feels like a third tier western but instead of guns, we have punches. Jake tries his best to use his lightheadedness and fighting moves to propell this film forward but sadly, the rest of the cast and the writers don't seem to be interested in helping him.The only other reason why people might want to watch Road House is Conor McGregor and say what you want about his peculiar acting or badly written speeches, at least this man tries to bring some energy and villainess to the otherwise dull affair. One of the key problems is that on top of feeling like a B movie, the story never shows us why should we care about the bar or any of the characters. There are absolutely no emotions in this 2 hour paper thin story and the cringe dialogue along with the half-baked action can only do so much.","6 out of 11 found this helpful."

Yes, some things in the 1989 movie were done better, but this movie, in the Knox character, added a lot of humor. When Knox got ready to go the Roadhouse, he had a golf club, and said ""it's been awhile since I have gone clubbing."" There is less about how Dalton intended to run the bouncers of the club and as in the 1989 movie, spent time observing the fights before he got involved. In both movies, there is a man in charge who is the problem. I suspect a lot of reviewers will rate this movie based on how well they like the 1989 movie, but this movie really needs to be rated on its own. I feel the fight scenes were exciting and well done.","0 out of 5 found this helpful."

There's no redeeming quality to it. A deplorable script filled with caricatured clichés and dialogues as flat as its characters. The camera jerks in the fights are aesthetically horrible. The worst film in Jake Gyllenhaal's filmography. Complete trash catering to alpha males unworthy of its predecessor. It's depressing to think that a product like this has a target audience; it's not even worth watching with friends and pizza. They haven't even managed to get brand placements right; the Cleopini suit thing is ridiculous. The casting is equally bad; McGregor's parts are unbearable. I can't fathom how anyone could find the character gallery believable. The jokes are as childish and facile as they are crude. The underwater shots are the culmination of this embarrassing spectacle.

If it had been marketed, and titled, as something else entirely - something completely divorced from the iconic Patrick Swayze original - then it might have stood a chance. It's fun, mostly, but it's far too different to the original for its own good. At least, considering the title and marketing.Jake Gyllenhaal really is VERY very good here, his preparation and training for the role really paid off. Frankie, the bar owner and 'replacement' for Mr Tilghman from the original isn't too bad, given that she has relatively very little screen time. Billy Magnussen is fantastic as the somewhat-useless son of the criminal who used to run the town with fear and violence, and he really gets to flex his cheese-chops here. Most of the henchmen are interchangeable (aside from Arturo Castro's Moe, he's great fun to watch) as are most of the bar staff - what little we get to see of them aside from Laura, Billy, and Reef. Those last three are pretty good, though.Conor McGregor, though? A perfect example of stunt casting right there. The man can't act worth a damn, and seems to ALWAYS walk like he's heading down the ramp to the Octagon. Honestly, I'd have MUCH preferred to watch either a WWE Name, or even another UFC Name in the role than this palooka. Heck, gimme Ken Shamrock over this guy!Seriously, the best thing to do with this movie right now is rename it. Completely divorce it from the original masterpiece of homoerotic cheese and it'll have a chance at being something.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

Swayze's version is a classic but typical Hollywood cannot leave things the way they were. Instead of coming up with new ideas and creating something interesting, we are given remakes and sequels after sequels. However, this film delivers on some, not all, but some of its fight scenes. Gyllenhaal does a somewhat respectable job as the main character. A good chunk of the writing is average at best. The CGI needed to be reworked in spots, especially in some of the fight scenes. Then again, McGregor was a halfway decent villain. While this film does not compare to the original, I think it has some respectable qualities that save it from being a complete dumpster fire.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

Just sit back for violence with a smile.Gyllenhaal maybe not the perfect guy for the part, his performance was a bit flat, but he does well enough. Also although I hear a lot of criticism about McGregor, let's be honest he obviously isn't an actor, I do think he was hilarious, probably because it was ridiculous.

They can do their own thing, or a reimagining of the original, as long as it doesn't disrespect what came before. And I don't think this remake disrespects the original or Swayze. It does it's own thing, adds a modern flare, but keeps the core principle of the movie; a bouncer that cleans up a bar.I always like Jake Gyllenhaal, and as with pretty much every role he takes, he was great in his role as Dalton and owned it. Billy Magnussen is always entertaining, but he plays a fairly generic spoiled brat character type in this one, but hey that's his role and so I can't fault him for that. McGregor's debut is pretty much him just playing himself, but even more over the top. It's like Liman whispered in his ear and said, ""just be yourself, but crank it up to 20"".Speaking of which, I'm actually a bit surprised this is directed by Doug Liman. He's made some fantastic action films with stunning fight choreography and effects, but I have to say, 'Road House' was disappointing in both of those areas. The CGI was atrocious (the truck backing up on the bridge jeeezz). The CGI assisted fights were actually not horrendous, but needs work.

They all keep saying how they feel this film does justice to the memory of Patrick Swayze.The film starts off promising but has confusing fight CGI which is hugely apparent to the eye. I'm unsure as to why this decision was taken to go that way when a standard fight scene would have worked much better.The casting is clearly forced and that's all I will say on that. After 15 or so minutes the story deteriorates with some pretty poor dialogue.Conor McGregor did reasonably well in his acting debut and literally just plays himself which makes it fun. However, there was no need to keep constantly smiling which, in my opinion, kills the authenticity of his acting. Overall he did make me laugh at times. His character could have had much better dialogue.I can't say much more about this movie as it was utter rubbish and probably Jake Gyllenhaal's worst film in a long while.Is it worth wasting 121 mins of your life watching this crap?

It's hard to come up with a truly unique franchise these days. Is that a good thing, or a bad thing? I don't know, but that's not the point today. Even if a film isn't a remake, it can still be inspired by other films and even copy them in places, giving off a remake-like vibe. These films can be literally anything from action films from the '80s to kung-fu flicks. Even though they're technically different franchises, you can sometimes get confused about who the characters are, like in those ""pseudo-sequels"" that the pirates made. The house on the road, for example, is a movie from our childhood - it's so rustic and has silly dialogue, but it's also full of testosterone and drive, although that might be debatable. We're going to talk about this guy, Dalton, who's a secret superhero with an unknown background, but he's got great physical skills and can kick ass. It's all in the best tradition of action movies and even westerns, you know? He goes to a new city and nobody knows him, so he makes some noise. He's not very social, has some weird habits, and has a secret that stops him from being fully open with anyone. If you grew up watching action movies from the 80s and 90s, that role might be really familiar to you, but is that a bad thing? Is that house by the road the McGregor car from ""The Fugitive""? Jake Gyllenhaal absolutely nails this image of a mysterious psycho with good intentions, you know what I mean? At first, it all went smoothly. We were introduced to the characters, the ""house on the road"", which is the local name for the bar where the action takes place. The lead character works as a bouncer there, calmly taking down all sorts of thugs, and drinking black coffee until it's time to cross the street to see important people. Then these guys decide to threaten the people that Dalton cares about. As we all know, that was a huge mistake. Dalton was the quiet guy from behind the desk, but as soon as those guys gave him free reign with their threats, he was already out of state. The only person who can get out of the car is another car, and that's what makes the movie so interesting, besides Jake, of course, and Connor McGregor in his big movie debut. He's pretty good for himself, with a mountain of muscle and just a KamAZ that rumbles around, knocking everything in its path down. But KamAZ is a bit off, because he walks around smiling and looking glassy, and, sorry to say, with a naked butt. Men might like that image, but it scares me. It makes me feel like I'm watching Terminator 2, with McGregor playing the role of the liquid terminator that relentlessly chases the main character. Is the house near the road McGregor's car? The film has the usual structure for action movies, but it stands out because of the setting. Florida is so beautiful and fresh! But we're here not to talk about the beaches, we're here for some testosterone-fueled mayhem. And that's basically it, except for some choreography that's influenced by the UFC. There are plenty of captures and some really brutal stuff in this movie. There's also that action cam that does a great job of making transitions seamless. All in all, it looks pretty cheerful, with some great techniques. But there are some weird choices. In those kinds of films, magic used to come from realistic special effects - explosions were real explosions. Here, we decided to use a lot of CGI to create the effects, and sometimes it can be a bit unsettling, like in the scene with the car on the highway. Another crazy thing they did was to add graphics to the fights. Sometimes, characters become polygons for a few seconds and fly a hundred meters away. That artificiality is even stronger in the punches - the main character takes dozens of hits to the head and there's no visible damage, no dissections, let alone more serious injuries. And the sound of the punches are like a sledgehammer hitting. The action camera is great, and the choreography has its moments, but it doesn't feel like people are fighting. It's like McGregor is hunting Dalton like a Terminator. I'm starting to wonder if that's how it's supposed to be. Another downside of this movie is how long it is. The movie, despite having a cool main character handing out crayons, can't impress with anything really special. But for some reason, they try to add a love story, which they immediately drop. Just for one thing, functional characters are added that are only needed for one purpose - to get Dalton out of his shackles. Because of those moments that didn't work for anyone, the movie lasts 2 hours even though the average time for those types of movies is usually 80-90 minutes. I'm not sure why they decided to slow down for that, though. So what do we have? We have a decent B-movie, which is mainly about Jake Gyllenhaal and secondarily about McGregor. Unfortunately, it's only okay in the action department. The director should have worked more on the dynamics of the events and the practical effects. The film's job isn't to introduce new facets to cinema, it's just to take us back to childhood and give us a nice evening. Basically, it does that, but with some nuances. It'll help you pass the evening, but that's it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Of course there's a hefty side plot involving shady drug deals and corrupt property development plans that drive the film in between numerous insane fights, cheesy dialogue and some fairly decent 'bar band' music.Aside from the wholly predictable popcorn fodder plot, the main problem here is the casting. Despite his impressive physique, Jake just doesn't seem right in the lead role with his annoying permanent smirk/grin and dull downbeat personality, while there is literally no one likeable or believable in the entire cartoonish supporting cast. MMA superstar Conor McGregor is worthy of mention though, just because his big screen debut is so insanely ott it's actually funny and entertaining - like Vinny Jones on speed!The piece is nicely shot with some decent CGI effects, but the haphazard overlong screenplay, throwaway love angle and especially off the rails level of gratuitous violence/fight scenes actually becomes a distraction come the crazed, drawn out finale.In summation I would actually give it a hard pass and seek out the 1989 original instead - this is definitely one pointless remake that fails to punch above its weight and deliver a knockout blow.

First, of your going to remake a film, you better make sure it's better than the original. Thia was a trainwreck in every category - the script was embarrassing bad, like so bad it seemed like a 14 year old wrote it. I'm watching it as I write this and I honestly can't believe how bad it is, it's like a parody of a bad movie. Its one of those scripts that seem like the writers didn't realize how laughably exaggerated and unrealistic the dialogue is and therefore almost impossible to relate or identify with the characters. This isn't ""fun"" or ""interesting"" but instead it's annoying and insulting. Sadly, the only thing worse than the script it's the acting. Gyllenhaal does fine with the material he's given but almost the entire supporting cast is unwatchable. They're not serious actors and they're inexperience and lack of respect for the craft shows. Take a class, get on stage, put the work in, and learn how to develop a character (although again there's not a whole lot that can be done with such a terrible script). The last element is the directing which is just as bad as the first two elements. Who knows what decisions were made by the producers but regardless this whole thing was disaster.

an 80s classic, that stands right up there with all the other good ole action, tough guy flicks.Now, are the cast in this movie bad? No.Not at all. In fact, it's got a really good cast. Gyllenhaal, whether he is or isn't a good guy in real life (obviously, idk the guy personally), is one of the best actors walking around today. The guy is phenomenal. I enjoyed seeing Melchior (loved her as Ratcatcher 2 in the Suicide Squad) as Dalton's love interest. Even McGregor was good as the character he played (pretty much playing himself more than likely, but still). What's bad about this movie is writing, the direction, the fact that they made the dang thing.

At first making waves w/the dive bar convincing some of the staff to step up to keep the calamity to a dull roar & suceeding makes Magnussen's dad decide to bring in an uber-fixer, played former MMA champ Conor McGregor, to give Gyllenhaal what's what in a lead up to a prolonged siege where Magnussen's holds Daniela Mechior (the nominal doctor/love interest originally limned by Kelly Lynch) hostage after Gyllenhaal grabs some much needed cash Magnussen's had coming for his big deal while McGregor, like a brakeless speeding train, comes barreling in for a beachfront clutch which doesn't disappoint. Much has been written about director Doug Limon's (The Bourne Identity/Mr. & Mrs. Smith) desires or belief the film was headed towards a theatrical release (which star Gyllenhaal denies wasn't the case) holds some water since the film just from its original cult status & the pedigree being brought to the remake could've been a great financial boon for Prime which I feel left money at the table but it is what it is & we're the richer for it as the film does its own thing & manages to be a great crowd pleaser w/unabashed glee in every kick, punch & neck break.

The decision to incorporate CGI in fight scenes felt misplaced and detracted from the authenticity of the action. Moreover, the inexplicable storyline where a character fatally injures his friend in a UFC match leaves audiences baffled without any substantial backstory or reasoning.The character development was shallow at best, making it difficult to care about anyone's fate, except perhaps the character who provided some comedic relief with his broken arm. The town's inhabitants were overwhelmingly unpleasant, adding to the film's off-putting atmosphere. The bookstore girl, rather than endearing, came off as irritating. The plotline involving a crocodile was bizarrely abandoned, leaving viewers with unresolved questions. The romantic subplot was also unconvincing, transforming a smart, violence-averse ER doctor into a cliché of contradictions without much explanation or character depth.The script was rife with cringe-worthy one-liners, not helped by Conor McGregor's exaggerated performance, which felt more caricature than character. It seemed as though Jake Gyllenhaal must have had compelling reasons outside of artistic choice to participate in this film. Ultimately, the movie's downfall can be attributed to a poorly written script and misguided direction, making it an unfortunate addition to Gyllenhaal's filmography and a sequel that falls short of its predecessor in every conceivable way.","5 out of 10 found this helpful."

Connor is a great fighter, but his performance in this was one dimensional, flat, and atrocious. It distracted and detracted from the very little that was going on.Jake was fine, but usually does much better. Best performances were Billy Magnussen and Jessica Williams.

If you're looking for a carbon copy of the original, just rewatch it. Jake Gyllenhaal consistently delivers outstanding performances, and this film is no exception. Conor McGregor's acting debut impressed me the most. Despite mixed opinions about him, I think he did well. If he were a lesser-known actor, I believe his performance would have been more universally praised. Yes, his character is like a villain from a comic book, but that's fitting for the role, and he nailed it. I'm excited to see more of his acting work. Both Jake and Conor clearly dedicated time to physical training, looking even more impressive than usual. This movie is ideal for a fun, no-thought-required viewing.

How else is a mercenary for a criminal group suppose to act ? Is their a road map blueprint? Or do you guys suppose they gotta act mysterious like they apart of a ninja clan? Or MI-6? They chose to have the mercenary portrayed as maniacal due to well he kills ppl for a living n probably enjoys it so im sure hes kinda looney for sure, next hes a skilled fighter so im guessing he fights quite alot n mix that with hes maniacal well it seems obvious he would behave more crazy as more fighting happens. If any other actor said the one liners he did I am sure u all wouldnt be so upset but Conor pulled off the lines very good for someone whois first time acting.Sure their was something I disliked and that was certain times they tried to cut the film length down so they opted to skip showing Conor beating up the minions n NPCS, but It would have put a bigger statement on his threat level if they actually showed it instead. I am sure they did this not only to save time but probably they feared Conor couldnt hold back on his punches cause I swear lots of times during this film I thought omg Conor really punched the guy foreal and thats what makes the fighting more legit & entertaining cause unlike actors playing the roles to fight, Conor legit is a dangerous fighter and many haters may laugh at this comment just cause he hasnt fought in a while but the fact is every single hater if stepped up to him to fight probs would be dead n Conor wouldnt break a sweat and thats why when u see someone whois not an actor do fight scenes n hes legit a real dangerous striker & u gonna be on the edge of ur seats wondering holy shiet did he hold back? Or did the director appease his star status so much that he let the stuntmans n extras get ass whooped for real.I didnt like the female lead love interest as she wasn't to great but on a side note I thought the minor character Moe was great! Infact I would watch a film if they made one on his character lol, a comedy film where hes always joining up different groups of ppl n ending up in bad n hilarious situations before having to pack his bag on a hobo stick n ride off into the sunset before joining another in his search for some friendly biker friends :P.","53 out of 107 found this helpful."

There are a few incredulous moments but compared to the latest mission impossible (2023) it was 10x less. If you don't like graphic and realistic violence I don't think this is for you. If you don't want to see people get hurt or killed, pick another film. But if you want good action at a nice pace with some backstory and character development then I think this is for you.","40 out of 79 found this helpful."

For stupid teenagers?The choice of script and director is key for a career. It's hard to get up. It's easy to fall.The director here is a fairly well-known creator of passable action films and ""thrillers"". But it is not he or the actors who determine the quality of the film, but the script.

As someone who loves the 1998 version of Road House starring Patrick Swayze, Kelly Lynch, and Sam Elliott, I have to admit that the 2024 version is almost as good as the original. Believe it or not, Road House (1998) ranks as my second favorite movie ever, out of a total of 902 films that I have rated over the course of my adult life, spanning 40 years. Jake Gyllenhaal, known for his role as Dalton. His an ex-UFC fighter, that becomes a bouncer at a Road House in the Florida Keys. However, he soon realizes that this seemingly perfect paradise is not what it appears to be. Jake is an exceptional performer. One of my personal favorites is when he plays the main character in ""Prince of Persia"". I'm uncertain if that movie helped him secure a role in Road House 2024, but I strongly believe it did. His portrayal of the Prince of Persia in 2010 was truly remarkable. Another actor who really stood out for me in this film was Conor McGregor, portraying the character Knox. This individual excels in every aspect of his life, including UFC, marketing, interviews, politics, and now Hollywood movies. In this movie, his on-screen performance is phenomenal as the ultimate villain of the UFC, determined to annihilate anything and anyone in his path to achieve his ultimate objective. In this film, you can expect plenty of laughter, heartfelt humor, a portrayal of a family man with integrity, and some sexy moments to keep you engaged throughout its 120-minute runtime.","31 out of 60 found this helpful."

The people giving bad reviews have memory loss about the original. For the purpose of being fair, we watched both movies back to back. Man, the original is bad. If you watched it on cable then you didn't see all the nudity from the original. I'm not a feminist and even I was appalled by the original. My husband is a huge fan of the original. After we watched it with our 15 year old son (bad idea) my husband was really disappointed. He didn't remember a lot of what we saw in the uncut version. So I have to wonder if the people loving the original are recalling a watered down version (cable edit). I do love Patrick Swayze. He is the only reason I didn't truly dislike the original. The original is not awesome. It's not even a 5. Compared to other movies of its kind during that decade, it's not that great. I'd say rewatch it before you watch the new one. Watch the original, not cable edit. You'll see.There is absolutely no way these reviewers should be leaving anything under a 5 for the new version. It's way beyond mediocrity, which is a 5. Anyone saying it's less than 5 has some hard core nostalgia going on and are too biased.The new Roadhouse is absolutely awesome. It's an action flick people!! It has a nice plot. The acting is SO much better in this version. Jake definitely pulls this role off well. I loved his take on this. I loved this version of Dalton much more. Connor McGregor? You have to watch it just to see his character. Dude was awesome! This movie reminded me of the good action movies from years ago but with better stunts and acting. Well done on the remake. We laughed, we yelled, I winced several times..... we loved it. We will definitely be watching this one again. Great action movie!! I hope there is a sequel.","16 out of 28 found this helpful."

I didn't notice it too much - maybe if I had seen it on a bigger screen I would have? Who knows - maybe those who have.I don't think I would have minded too much! Better that way than people actually hurting each other - Jake said he did accidentally hit someone in the making of the movie - the other guy was a trooper though.

Since the cops in town are not much help, the business owner recruits a washed up former UFC champion (Jake Gyllenhaal) to be the bouncer.It is a good 1/3 into the movie, after a ton of fighting scenes, you are still left wondering what the underlying motive is for the violent behaviour in the bar and what is it that carries the story. Well, it turns out that the drama revolves around the classic uber-rich-family-wants-to-build-a-fancy-rich-resort-on-the-beach and need-the-local-business-to-get-out-of-the-way. Because the local business doesn't want to give up, they choose different methods (i.e. Intimidating through violence and aggression).The story is extremely flat, the script and dialogue a very poor with even more poor performances. I like Jake Gyllenhaal and he was great playing a fighter in Southpaw, but there is nothing that stands out in his performance in this movie - except his six pack.If fighting, violence and blood is your jam, you'll like this movie, but otherwise there isn't much to enjoy about it.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

The only thing that makes this film remotely worth watching is getting to feast your eyes on Jake Gyllenhaal's incredible physique. One of those men who gets better with age. I didn't think it possible but minus the tattoos he's every bit as smoldering hot as Patrick Swayze was in the original. And as far as the role he's playing, every bit as quietly menacing as the famous Dalton but very much Gyllenhaal's own version of him.As for the film itself, I felt insulted that anyone would call this a ""remake"" of the original. An imitation of it is more apropos and not a very good one either. The characters are there, and a very thin skeleton of the plot, but few similarities to the brilliance of Swayze and Elliott taming the baddies at the Double Deuce. Just a lot of wild chases and over the top nonsense. I'm glad I didn't have to buy a ticket to see it.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

Then appeared that god awful wannabe villain character played by, in my humble opinion, one of the most despicable human being alive, and, I couldn't find anything to like in the rest of the movie.Don't get me wrong here, I've seen and enjoyed movies with actors I can't stand before. But THAT, wow, a whole other level of bad acting. The movie could have been all right. Maybe, on a great sunny day, a 6/10.

Most of the magic rode on Swayze himself, because he could take on the role of an action hero, but brought more to the table than that. You can't build a movie around Jake Gyllenhall. He can go to the best trainers, get more cut than Swayze was and that's as good as it gets. The classic ridiculous of Roadhouse was cranked to ten when it was already comfortably set at ten. They just broke the clock.'89 at it's heart is was a street level western, one of the good points of '24 was that they identified that pathos. It was at moments like that where I had higher hopes for the movie. Instead, they compensated with a sad attempt at ""biggening up"" elements.Everything was larger this time around in the special effects department and the twist the movie introduced seemed not a search for a novel direction, but a result of recognizing the lead lacked the range to pull off what Swayze could. His chemistry with the love interest seemed like he was working on dating his sister. At times I thought they were building a Wish level Bond film and stopped trying to capture what made Roadhouse a winner.","5 out of 13 found this helpful."

He neither came off as funny or tough. His character was poorly written but the poor performance can't only be blamed on this joke of a script.

The actors' performances are consistently excellent across the board. Jake, in particular, plays his role absolutely perfectly, as expected. I can only imagine how satisfying it must be for the director to have such talent in front of the camera. In my eyes, Jake isn't just a very good actor; he's one of the best of all time! I hope to enjoy many more films in which he takes the lead.He's a perfectionist and it shows.As for McGregor... simply superb! 😄 While I've only partially followed his UFC fights (since I don't have PayTV), I've caught glimpses through the fantastic compilations on YouTube. Whether it was truly a role or he played himself, McGregor embodied it flawlessly. Rarely have I experienced an antagonist who is simultaneously hilarious, insane, and menacing. I look forward to seeing much more of him on the big screen in the future. Kudos to the writers!Roadhouse has everything a film of its kind should have: heart, action, drama, outstanding actors, suspense, and an exceptionally well-crafted cast. It avoids unnecessary awkward sex scenes and any political or ideological preaching. Instead, it delivers hard-hitting, witty, and fantastic action. As someone who makes films (i am an amateur though :) and belongs to Generation Y (yes, the big 40 is on the horizon this year), I felt transported back to the days of Demolition Man, True Lies, Tango & Cash, and the great '80s and '90s action movies. Thank you for that!I'd also like to give a shout-out to Amazon. Reacher was great, The Boys is phenomenal, and Roadhouse is excellent. It's wonderful that streaming services still cater to people who appreciate real movies. 🎬👏For some, this may only be some action movie... for me, it's like a forgotten world, a craft that seemed to be lost in time.

This new Dalton comes off as a psychopath instead of the introspective Buddhist, tai chi expert that Patrick Swayze played. Plus, there's no Sam Elliott, big points lost there, too. The second best thing about this movie is Conor MacGregor, not introduced until 3/4 of the way thru, who literally and figuratively bares all to be the most comical villain in years. I truly hope to see him in more movies, he actually was fun and you can tell he doesn't take the whole thing too seriously. Think Bond villain, or even better, an Austin Powers villain. Otherwise, for entertaining cheese and a Dalton you will remember for over 30 years, spritz on some Love's Baby Soft, grab a Diet Coke (because they don't make Tab anymore!) and travel to the Road House you knew and loved in high school, when a feathered mullet still set hearts afire.","6 out of 17 found this helpful."

While I trusted names like Doug Liman and Jake Gyllenhaal, I had a feeling inside that ""this movie is going to be terrible."" Fortunately, it wasn't that bad. It's not a perfect movie, but it's not terrible either.After all, we live in a different era. Music culture has changed, bar culture has changed, and Dalton had to adapt to this change. The trailer for the film also clearly conveyed the message ""I'm not a copy of the old movie, I'm an updated adaptation."" From this point of view, the film delivers on what it promises.So, will I watch this movie again? No. I'm listening to the soundtrack album of the 1989 version as I write this review of the film. I also see the Blu-ray on the shelf, maybe I'll watch that tonight. This is the biggest problem with new movies (and this movie of course): Viewers don't own movies like this anymore. That's why they're not made like this anymore. As I said, we live in a different era.Coming to the 2024 version, I can say that Jake Gyllenhaal did a pretty good job as Dalton. He brought his own interpretation to the character and it gave the character a new breath. The action scenes in the movie are also quite successful. The final fight scene is especially exciting.However, the film also has some shortcomings. The story is a bit weak and some of the characters are not deep enough. The film's music is also not as impressive as the 1989 version.Overall, the 2024 film ""Road House"" is a film that will be overshadowed by the 1989 version. However, it is not a bad option for those who want to watch a fun and action-packed movie.","9 out of 29 found this helpful."

The worst Doug Lyman movie. With a good introduction - and admittedly, the beginning was very promising - the main conflict turned into a ""Bollywood"" fireworks display. The drama of the main character ... Sorry, but Doug leaked the inner drama of the main character, the author did not reveal and did not develop the internal conflict that forced the hero to kill his friend; the author did not show internal contradictions and remorse: the author outlined the path, but did not lead the hero, did not finish. Yes, some camera solutions in action scenes are great, but most of them look like a home video shot on a GoPro. The final denouement is some kind of absurdity, both in the logic of what is happening and in the motives of all the actors, and dialogues are flashes and patterns. The editing of Act 3 is very chaotic, illogical and inconsistent at some points: there are a lot of actions, but attention is not focused on emotions or characters.Now it is clear why the ""movie bosses "" released Doug's masterpiece on the Internet, because renting in cinemas costs money in itself and will not pay off. And it is clear why the director quarreled with the producers - the film is unsuccessful, and the ending resembles a ""Bollywood"" action movie.I haven't watched this movie.And Connor plays well))) His image of an eccentric psychopathic replicon is not bad: bright, outrageous, provocative, but the motives are poorly substantiated.

So the fight scenes should be on point but they are not, what they are is terrible. Why was it necessary to sped up the fight scenes and use terrible angles? It was ridiculous especially when there was a have a proper fighter on set. The film had no energy, no atmosphere and even the sound track was bad; it's an insult to the original movie. Nothing good to say about it, it couldn't make its mind up either, using stupid jokes and one liners and then trying to be all serious, just didn't work. Jake had a smug grin on his face the whole time the film was just bad, bad, bad and is a shame as it could have been brilliant remake. Lazy directing, the director should never make a movie again.

I don't think the role suited her and I found her acting to be inadequate for the character she played.

That is the only upside.McGregor is terrible, which it's not all his fault, he's being directed, badly.His OTT constantly grinning character has that strained ""I'm about to Poo myself"" expression throughout which probably explains why he walks in that way too. In parts I don't even know what he's saying.It's pointless for me to echo what others have done before me regarding this movie.The original I have watched several times and I've always enjoyed it.

Did he read the dialogue before accepting the role? It's appalling. Having enjoyed virtually all of his other movies, I was expecting more from this. But his smarmy take on Dalton was painful to watch.Road House is not Road House, it has literally zero mood or attitude that the original (albeit not an Oscar winner itself) carries. Not a single character is either believable or interesting, and if you didn't like Conor McGregor before, you'll find him even more of a talentless (acting-wise) pr!ck in this.In the original, despite my age at the time, I wanted to be Patrick Swayze. His cool demeanour, his unique set of skills and his zen-like attitude, unfortunately Dalton 2.0 has none of this.The plot is atrocious and makes very little sense in this day and age, the acting is poor but not helped by the lacklustre script and even the fight scenes, which should in theory be realistic considering the UFC influence, were totally ridiculous... Most of the combatants would be dead not wobbling off in different directions!Struggling to find any positives in it, except maybe that Jake Gyllenhaal can only do something better with his next movie, as it would be hard to do worse.

Yes there are maybe two scenes where they say similar lines and then there's Dolton with the same name. Other than that it's a completely different movie that doesn't even come close to the original. Jake Gyllenhaal and Doug Liman should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves, they have made actual good films in the past and should know better. As for the rest of the group in the movie I understand why they made the movie because it's work for them who otherwise wouldn't be getting any work - and rightfully so.Every female in this movie should never be allowed to act again, they were all horrible. The woman that plays Dolton's love interest Ellie, Daniela Melchior, is absolutely gorgeous but she's a horrible actor. However Daniela Melchior doesn't even come close to the horror film that is Jessica Williams who plays Frankie. Jessica Williams doesn't even belong on a B movie, maybe she could hang with the acting prowess of actors on a porn set but again I doubt it. Williams is the worst new actor I've seen in a long time. The rotund bartender is probably the best female actor in the film and that's pretty scary.Another person who never belongs on another movie set as long as he may live is Conor McGregor. Just ridiculous that he was even cast in this film to begin with. You don't need a physcally gifted fighter in order to pretend to be a fighter in today's Hollyweird. He walks around the entire film like he's got a cactus up his ass and anytime he opens his mouth to say anything it takes off points from the movie. Never Again, Conor.This is a perfect example of what Hollyweird has become. Forced casting to include every race under the sun in the interest of inclusion, even if it still doesn't accurately reflect current demographics of the country. Not yet at least as they flood the south with more to replace those numbers - but not yet Hollyweird,... I digress. It's forced. It's weird. You can't even find good actors to make it even remotely watchable. They just have to do all this nonsense to try to appease the w0keys or they'll be cancelled. Pay attention Hollyweird, this is why you're failing so stop doing this crap because nobody cares to see any of it. It's not real life anywhere except maybe in the hellscape that is California.I'm even slightly ashamed of myself for having watched this entire movie. I debated giving this movie only 1 star but ultimately decided on 2 because the ocean and beach scenes are beautiful, but that's literally all the movie has going for it. This movie should never have been made and it doesn't deserve the title. You couldn't even give me a new Wade Garrett. Do yourself a favor and watch the original instead.

The film doesn't just stop there it keeps getting worse and worse and worse until the credits thankfully finally roll.The original is a classic piece of 80s cheese, it's sexy, it's violent, it's got personality and character. This is a John Wick remake of road house, but not the good first John Wick film, this is a John Wick 4 remake of road house. It's truly terrible, instantly forgettable rubbish.Arguably it's actually got more plot than the original, a good reason for the baddie acting the baddie for example. But also it makes less sense than the original with Dalton morphing from an MMA fighter to Denzels Equaliser at the flick of a switch.What else?The ""actors"" are simply not up to the job,
There's no character development,
There's no characters,
The script is threadbare,
The music is lacklustre,
There's no love story element,
It's been de-sexed and de-nudified,
The fights are rubbish,

Jake Gyllenhaal and Conor McGregor show off some impressive physiques and cool UFC fight moves. You can tell they're both having fun, and the viewer can't help but also have fun.I love the setting of the story. It's very immersive and the beachy vibe suits the tone of the movie. I don't watch UFC fighting, but I imagine this movie is a similar thing in that it's not about technicalities or depth, it's about entertainment and having a good time. And in my eyes, they achieved with Road House what they set out to do.If I wanted to get nitpicky, I could complain that at times the dialogue isn't the best, or that not everyone's acting is on point, but there's more than plenty to make up for that. There are a lot of fun and likable characters that create some delightfully humorous interactions with the protagonist. And as usual, Jake Gyllenhaal poured 110% into this role.

Sadly the makers of this flick clearly failed to achieve that. Was not sure if comedy was meant to be part of the plot or the acting was that bad it came across that way. Seemed like a parody. That includes Conor McGregors debut performance as an actor which just eclipses David Beckams efforts when he debuted in King Arthur. Wasn't a compliment. You stay tuned hoping it will get better only to realise it wont. I know the original wasn't going to get nominated for any Oscar's or golden globes, but it worked and was entertaining. And was something you could watch again and again. Having watched this once, I cant see myself watching it again. Watch it and make your own mind up, but in my opinion this is the sort of movie which if released thirty years ago would have skipped the cinemas and gone straight to video or dvd.

His female supporting cast are also provide watchable performances. However the film is kind of let down buy the bad guys who terrorise the Roadhoue bar. There's something lacking. However the fight scenes were great with new perspectives and bone crouching sound effects. Unfortunately the whole thing kinda fails when we are introduced to Mr McGregor. With an inane grin throughout the whole time on screen. A wierd waddle walk which locks like he has a broom stuck up his rear. In conjunction with dreadfull dialogue delivered in a vapid, flat and sometimes unintelligible brogue. He never appeared menacing, just laughable. I am sure the casting director could have found a real actor who could have provided a genuine nemesis for Gyllenhaal to riff off. Ultimately a made for TV blockbuster which fails in its bid to honour a cult classic. The soundtrack was pretty good though (a bit different from the usual movie monotony). Ultimately, watchable, just too many fails with all of the bad guys dialogue and performances. More comic book than cool teen classic. Shame!","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

However, their stellar performances alone cannot elevate this film from its foundational flaws. The film sorely lacks in character development; it seems as though the scriptwriters have forsaken any attempt to create a narrative that echoes the depth and relatability of the original ""Roadhouse"" starring Patrick Swayze.Notably absent is any homage to Wayde Garrett or a storyline that articulates the community's disdain for the oppressive reign of the antagonist, a role iconically embodied by Brad Wesley in the original masterpiece. This omission strips the movie of the rich context that made the original so compelling. The narrative fails to engender empathy for the protagonists or adequately address the tumultuous dynamics besieging the Roadhouse bar.My anticipation for scenes that mirrored the original's heart-where Jake Gyllenhaal's character revitalizes the bar through exemplary leadership and the iconic edict to ""be nice""-was met with disappointment. Such moments, which cemented the original's legacy, were conspicuously absent, leaving a void where there should have been a powerful exploration of redemption and transformation.Moreover, a critical aspect of the original ""Roadhouse"" narrative that profoundly resonated with audiences was Dalton's harrowing internal conflict stemming from a moment of lethal self-defense, where he was compelled to end a man's life in a stark, unforgettable manner. This intense moral quandary offered a raw and unflinching exploration of the burdens borne by the protagonist, significantly deepening the connection between the audience and the storyline. The profound impact of this struggle provided a compelling lens through which viewers could experience Dalton's turbulent journey, making the narrative infinitely more impactful and relatable.In sum, this film presents a missed opportunity to not only pay tribute to its revered predecessor but to also forge its own legacy. It's a disservice to viewers who yearned for a narrative that both resonates on a personal level and honors the spirit of the original ""Roadhouse.""","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

This 2024 rendition throws punches with some impressive fight choreography, but struggles to capture the magic of the original.Jake Gyllenhaal steps into Dalton's shoes, but the role feels like a well-worn pair of boots compared to Patrick Swayze's effortless swagger. While Gyllenhaal delivers a decent performance, it lacks the spark that made Swayze's Dalton iconic.Throwing us headfirst into the action, the narrative struggles to keep pace feeling more interested in fight sequences than building a compelling story. On the other hand, despite its cheesiness, the original had a heart that's missing here.The casting choices have also stirred the pot among fans. Let's just say a quick internet search might raise some eyebrows for those unfamiliar with the lead actors' past controversies. Adding insult to injury, Hollywood's recent trend of regurgitating past successes feels a bit like a cinematic game of whack-a-mole. While nostalgia can be a powerful tool, audiences crave fresh ideas and stories!Looking for the Real Deal? Ditch the reboot and revisit the 1989 classic. It's a bonafide cult film with quotable lines, unforgettable characters (hello, Brad Wesley!), and a hefty dose of 80s nostalgia.My Verdict: this 2024 remake might entertain fans of action flicks, but it's a pale imitation of the original.

The mystery, the intelligence, the action and the style. It is cheesey but it works. And this new film just reminds me how perfect the original is.I like Jake as an actor. Top notch. He can fit into this role. But the makers of this one were clueless. They failed to understand why the original worked. Instead, they just wrapped the weak story development around awful scenes. It all felt so forced. Like they were deliberately trying to mess it up. So much so they nearly turned it into a comedy. A slap stick parody? A joke.It did catch my attention in places. For the camera work. The occasional glimpse of creativity. The drunk driver on the bridge scene. A clever way of filming it. Super fast. Super harsh. Interesting.But 90% of the rest of the film is an insult to the original. Only because the Director didn't have a clue. The choice to go for the lazy option was the wrong one.And bringing in a sport celeb to 'act' was a HUGE mistake. The final nail in the coffin. His woefully inconsistent accent was laughable. His miserable acting. His pointless inclusion.This film is bad. Sorry Patrick. They messed with your legacy. They made it perfect! Right, I'm off to watch the original. A true masterclass.","3 out of 9 found this helpful."

Another role you can't take serious, because of the stupid one-liners and inherent annoying persona.I can't believe I made it to the end, but I kept holding out hoping it would get better. Sadly, it didn't. Bad decision and judgment on my part.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

The movie starts with a somewhat realistic plot then out of no where throws that out the window. Though it is charming in how it plays out. Towards the end, the fighting scene has u on the edge of your seat and is satisfying to watch. Also love the UFC cameos in the film, not much of other fighters, but little lines thrown in about Connor or other UFC references. Never wrote a review about a movie, but with seeing so many people hating, I had to show some love. Good watch.","12 out of 22 found this helpful."

I'm not sure it needed a remake. But, Gyllenhaal is game, as always, as the central figure, Elwood Dalton. He's an ex mma fighter with a dark past. He finds his way to the town of Glass Key, a small seaside town with too many unsavory characters looking for a good time and a fistfight. Just like the original film, it all plays out like a modern day western. The local baddie is trying to take over the town and a lone drifter comes along to stand up to the bully and all his baddies in tow.Unfortunately, there isn't much character development. For a movie with a 2 hour run time, it moves surprisingly fast. This is both good and bad. The original Roadhouse benefit from a great cast of peripheral performances. From Kelly Lynch to Sam Elliott to Ben Gazara. That movie managed to squeeze every bit of backstory without complicated the issue. This Roadhouse feels much too light for its own good. Gyllenhaal has to carry the weight of this movie, and he does the job. But, you come away wishing he had more to work with. The fights sequences are filmed well, albeit with a bit of CGI assistance. However, there are some set piece action scenes that feel out of place. And, there will be much talk about Connor MacGregor's film debut. Suffice to say it's equal parts scene stealing and scenery chewing bafoonery.The original Roadhouse filled a gap. It was entertainingly violent and trashy without leaving a bad taste in your mouth. It's the type of film you watch anytime you're scrolling late night for some to pass the time. It's comfort junk food at its finest. This new film leaves a taste in your mouth that's hard to identify. It's junk food that feels more like junk. Good, but not quite satisfying.","17 out of 34 found this helpful."

Both of their performances were laughable. Fortunately in the case of the former, it's short.That said, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jessica Williams, Arturo Castro, and Hannah Lanier all turned in excellent performances.But it's not really worth watching in the end.

I can't argue that the premise of the original wasn't dumb, but not only do the updates make it dumber than the original, the interpretation of the characters is dumber than the original. I get 'F9: The Fast Saga' vs. 'Sharknado' vibes from this. I didn't see the remake of 'Point Break', but I would imagine it's of the same caliber and also suffered greatly from lack-of-Swayze. I'd wager 'Point Break' was more based in reality in their use of wing-suits though, and the remake probably at least *attempted* to stick to the story.I don't know how to look at this movie as anything other than a long-form commercial for UFC 300, because making this film requires asking the question, ""What if we made 'Road House', but much worse and without the elements that made the first one more than a dumb fighting movie?"", and how else would that get studio approval without a lot of sponsorship? Like, ""make our product a focus of the movie"" amounts of sponsorship. The only similarities between this movie and 'Road House' are the names of the places and characters, which makes this 'The Wheel of Time' of 80's movies. Another bang-up job, Amazon Studios.I'm actually starting to like Donnie Darko less because Jake is playing another quiet awkward character, but with more Ted Lasso and 1-punch KO power, which makes him a bit insufferable. The villain is like something out of Superman III/IV or Wonder Woman 1984, and he has the depth of Terry Silver in Karate Kid III, which makes me think this remake is for kids, but everyone drops F-boms constantly, so it's not for kids. Conor is basically a violent cartoon clown trying to give the cast of 'Batman & Robin' a run for their money.It's cool that Dalton found a pay phone in 2024 to call the cops from anonymously, but I don't really see why anonymity matters in a town where crime is basically legal/Florida. Some of the on-location shots look pretty. They really didn't need to drag Metallica into this. May as well end the movie with ""All Star"" by Smashmouth.Another remake that will be forgotten along with so many others of the last decade. I weep for this generation and completely understand why they would prefer user-generated content over movies and tv series after watching 'Road House'; they're getting pizza crust and being told it's pizza.","3 out of 10 found this helpful."

For one, the story is extremely shallow and unlike the original version of it and you feel no connection to the characters whatsoever or the storyline. As for the the cast, they are comically bad and again you feel no feeling towards them whatsoever and I could care less what they're doing or not doing. I don't know who the casting agent was, or if they were just going for the cheapest supporting cast, they could find, but none of them are memorable whatsoever, except for the girl of the bookstore owner. The acting is dismally bad and the script as bland as it gets. The fight scenes are unimaginative and basically look like CGI run amok. The villain is so ridiculous that the fight scenes are just not watchable. The romance between Gyllenhaal and the doctor has no chemistry to it whatsoever and again, you feel no feeling toward their relationship or have any idea what in the world would bring them together other than some quick sex. There is no Sam Elliott, mentor characters to help provide some backstory for Jake's character.. the only thing you have to go on are some MMA fight flashbacks that are more like a gut punch than giving you any reason to feel empathy for him.

Lots of pointless action and the main characters are terminators.The remake completely lost out on everything that made the original fun: No marshal arts, not enough of the staff, no good villain, no chemistry between Dalton and the doctor, lack of belief, and no Wade.","3 out of 11 found this helpful."

The movie is fun, has a lot of action and will not disappoint the audience.Fight scenes are well made, makes you feel like you are in the fight, with the close ups and camera effects.Jake Gyllenhaal put on a crazy body shape for the movie.

"2","/10","Even with an open mind, it's still a pale, poor man's version of the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9703254/?ref_=tt_urv","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0345596/?ref_=tt_urv","26 March 2024","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulDalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a former UFC fighter, whose career came to a shattering halt after a bout went wrong. He moves to the Florida Keys, and takes a job by bar owner, Frankie (Jessica Williams) whose business has come under attack from a group of violent thugs. He attracts the attention of Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussun), the son of a notorious drug lord, who is struggling to run things, and Knox (Conor McGregor), a hulking brute with whom he is drawn into a shattering final confrontation.In a day and age when the 'reboot' has become the accepted norm, when modernised versions of classic films from years past are updated to modern audiences, who may not even have heard of the original film. But to me, Rowdy Herrington's 1989 beat em up/shoot em up fest is one of the quintessential 80's action films, and I'm sure to many others. And so, naturally, my first thought is simply: it won't be a patch on the original. But even with this in mind and appreciate it as much as I could on its own merits. But sadly, even from this viewpoint, Doug Liman's modernised take on the original film falls desperately short.Some may say it's unfair to even consider the original film when reviewing this new one, but being so fond of that film, what else can I do but compare it, and see how far short of the mark it falls compared to that?!? And as a result, the main thing that comes off...is it's just so unconvincing. Unlike the original. Where the roadside Double Deuce bar, with bikers loitering around outside, created such an uninviting impression, complimented by a cramped, tight, smoky inside, that created such a genuinely brutal feeling. This trendy, cosmopolitan new version, with its open space design and tree palm roadside location, totally fails to recapture that, along with bouncers who don't look like they could fight their way out of a wet paper bag (unlike the grizzled, mean looking ones in the original), and whose fight scenes are pathetically unconvincing.Cast wise, in the lead role, Gyllenhaal, making a name out of remakes after 2021's The Guilty (which I'd bet far fewer are aware of), and who's allegedly been quite vocal of his dissatisfaction with the film's stream service fate, certainly has an impressively ripped physique, and gives his Dalton a more wise-cracking persona over Patrick Swayze's calm, philosophical but alternately icy and unnerving portrayal, but...he's also less convincing. Dalton's back story, involving his guilt over taking a man's life, is more closely examined here and far more prominent, through some vividly relived flashbacks to the incident, but sadly no more affecting. Former real life UFC fighter McGregor I imagine is aping Marshall Teague's role, but just comes off as a mindless lunatic, whilst Magnussun's whiny, shrieking overseer really makes you appreciate Ben Gazzara's original cruel, sadistic kingpin.I was determined not to write it off. I tried to give it a fair chance. And I tried not to think too much about the original. But sadly, my memories of it, along with a weak, apathetic plot, sadly just expose what an inadequate, unsatisfying mess this is. *","3 out of 11 found this helpful."

Many memorable scenes too. Swayze's Dalton knew what he was doing. He had his thick medical record with him when he visited the hospital, he bought a junk car to take the heat from his actual car, an expensive Mercedes, and so on.Gyllenhaal's Dalton doesn't seem to know ...jack. He has no plan, and overall he is kind of the loser drifter type.My main problem with this movie is that it's more comedy than it should be. The bad guys are caricatures. All talk and no ""substance"" to the point that you don't actually care about the conflict at all.The casting is also like it was chosen for laughs.The amazing thing that I didn't know when I started watching this is that Doug Liman is the director. I'm not the biggest fan of the Bourne movies, but I do think that Edge of Tomorrow is great.Overall: Certainly not an action drama like the 1989 version.

I didn't expect a masterpiece, but I expected it to be much better than this.The good things first: Jake Gyllenhaal was good. He has lots of charisma and really carries the movie, although he was given precious little to work with. Props also to Arturo Castro, he had a tiny role, but made it pretty fun. Billy Magnussen'e performance was pretty decent, although his character was stereotypical and nothing special. As for Conor McGregor, I find him extremely annoying and this movie did nothing to change my opinion, with him walking constantly like a chimp with a bad case of swamp butt and making idiotic faces all the time. That said, he was well suited for the role of an annoying jerk, because that is pretty much the whole of his persona(lity).The rest of the cast ranged from bland to terrible, including ridiculous accents from the sheriff and his daughter who are explicitly said to have been born and raised in Florida (both actors are actually Portuguese). If you make it a point that a character is from somewhere, get an actor who sounds like that, or change the character's background. There really was no need for those two characters to be Florida natives.The script was terrible. An unfinished mess of an unoriginal plot that often drags for long periods of time where nothing is happening. That includes prolonged performances by mediocre musicians. It seemed like those people paid to be in the movie in order to promote their music.The fights ranged from good to terrible. Unfortunately, the good fights were the small ones, while the ""boss fights"" were absolutely terrible instances of character A standing and getting hit with no effect, only for them to then hit character B with equally no effect, and then repeating the cycle. The 80s movie case of ""the main character can't unleash his full potential until he gets beaten bloody.""At least this movie made me want to see the original, because I never saw that one. Hopefully it is better than this mess.","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

A lot of the dialogue is garbage and that brings me nicely to Conor McGregor, he is not a proper actor and it shows in this. He was bad. But hear me out, I actually found him funny and a decent villain so his performance wasn't a 0/10 but you can tell he's literally just a complete and utter joke in this movie on purpose and it makes this weird ass balance between being overly funng and sarcastic by McGregor and stern and calm by Gylenhaal, it didn't really work for me.The ending left me with a lot of questions, why didn't he give money to the Roadhouse to help them fix it up after all the damage? Why did Ellie just tell him to go and look so disappointed after he literally saved her life? Why did he leave and not stay? There was just a lot of stuff i would have liked to see resolved better. Finally there were some god awful shots in here, some whacky close ups of Gylenhaal screaming in the octagon, some janky POV shots mid-fight and some blatantly obvious punch/throw transitions in the final fight were all tacky.I did have fun with it though, the fight scenes were pretty cool and as much as McGregor made me cringe he did also make me laugh (by how stupid he was).

"4","/10","Serves no real purpose other than to prove that modern remakes of popular 80s films will always be inferior to the original product","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9718015/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","4 April 2024","""Road House"" is a remake of the 1989 cult classic action film of the same name. Directed by Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"") and starring Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role, it serves no real purpose other than to prove that modern remakes of popular 80s films will always be inferior to the original product.Since retiring, former UFC fighter Elwood Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) has made a living scamming fighters within the underground circuit, attracting plenty of notoriety in the process. One night, Dalton is approached by a woman named Frankie (Jessica Williams), who offers him the job as the head bouncer at her disorderly roadhouse located in Florida Keys. Despite some initial reluctance, Dalton accepts the job and heads over to Frankie's roadhouse known simply as ""The Road House"". Upon beginning work, Dalton soon learns that his job is going to be much harder than he had anticipated, as the local area is filled with violent motorcycle gangs, corrupt law enforcement, and greedy businessmen intent on making life difficult for anyone unfortunate enough to cross their paths.If there were ever a definitive decade for guilty pleasure movies, most would agree it would have to be the 1980s. From the overindulgent special effects of David Lynch's ""Dune"" to the cheesy love story laced with synthesiser music of ""Top Gun"", the 80s aesthetic of ""so-bad-it's-good"" remains unmatched even to this day, with many of these films attaining loyal cult followings for this very reason. One such movie that fills this role perfectly is 1989's ""Road House"", a Patrick Swayze-led project that has gone on to become a quintessential 80s guilty pleasure movie, containing just about everything that is ridiculous about cinema from this decade. In yet another attempt to cash in on people's nostalgia of the 80s, the 2024 remake of ""Road House"" tries to replicate all of the original's over-the-top qualities to appeal to a modern audience, but like all the others it fails in every way possible.The most notable reason why this film just doesn't work is in its failure to understand why audiences found the 1989 version so entertaining in the first place. You can say what you will about the overall quality of the original film from a critical standpoint, but it at least knew how to set up its lead character and invest us in what could happen to him throughout the story. For the first two thirds of this film, instead of spending time developing its characters and establishing its plot, all we get are repetitive fight scenes that begin and end the exact same way. Someone causes trouble in the Road House, Dalton tries to prevent things from escalating further, the problematic person ignores Dalton and tries to fight him, Dalton quickly gains the upper hand and ejects the person from the premises. Rinse and repeat.Although the original film did contain scenes just like this, they at least had some build up and an element of fun to help you look forward to watching Patrick Swayze's Dalton handling himself efficiently in hand-to-hand combat. Here, all of the fights seem like copy-paste versions of each other, only with different thugs each time. It's as if the screenwriters for this remake watched the original and assumed that the only reason people liked it was solely for the fight scenes, but that's simply not the case. Audiences like myself enjoyed watching Swayze's Dalton form a connection with the staff of the Road House before getting into the nitty-gritty fist fights he is known for. Unfortunately, this film does nothing like that with Gyllenhaal's Dalton, preferring to keep him emotionally distant from everyone he comes into contact with, at least until we're already 60% into the film's runtime. As a result, it's near impossible to care about anything that happens to this version of Dalton, as we just cannot relate to him on any personal level.To add insult to injury, none of the fight scenes this time around are framed efficiently enough to leave any lasting impact. One of the reasons people enjoyed the fighting in the original was how realistic these scenes looked, as they all seemed as though they were happening right in the very moment at the actual location in question. In this film, there were several instances where it was obvious that CGI and green screen was being used to make it look like the people were fighting somewhere they obviously weren't. Though this may be excusable in other movies, it felt completely unnecessary here considering most of the fights took place inside the Road House as opposed to somewhere exotic like the inside of a volcano.This leads to another major problem with the remake, the lack of grit and an appealing atmosphere. The excessive use of CG effects causes all of the fight scenes to look so clean and sterile, as though the actors are obviously performing within a controlled environment without any sense of danger from their surroundings. Because of this, there is little to no excitement in watching people fight one other since everything plays out in the same safe and predictable style each time. At least the original film gave off the impression that the characters are in places that could pose a threat to their safety, but here I never once felt as though anybody was in the location they were supposed to be due to the lacklustre special effects. When you can't even get the fighting scenes right in a ""Road House"" remake, you know you've messed up somewhere.The film also fails to elicit any real laughs, which is something that helped the original attain the cult status it still holds today. Sure, there are moments that are clearly intended to make the audience laugh, but they all feel poorly integrated into the story. For example, when we are introduced to Conor McGregor's character, he is shown proudly wandering around an Italian town completely naked after being forcibly ejected from a woman's bedroom. As he searches for clothes at a nearby market, he decides to headbutt an innocent passerby to steal his outfit and later burn down the market immediately afterwards. Normally I would laugh at the excessiveness of a scene like this, but instead it felt like it was trying too hard to be funny and edgy rather than add something important to the story, or lack thereof. Then again, it's not like the original film didn't have similar ridiculous moments as well, so what didn't make me laugh just might make several others guffaw in disbelief.None of the characters are interesting enough for us to care about in the long run, coming off as one dimensional caricatures of who they are all supposed to be. Even the otherwise watchable Jake Gyllenhaal has very little to do other than fight people in the exact same repetitive style from beginning to end. Though Gyllenhaal tries his best with the material given to him, there's no denying that he lacks the iconic charisma and screen presence of the late Patrick Swayze. Had Gyllenhaal's Dalton been written better, I would say that the film would be worth watching just for him, but I'm struggling to remember anything remotely important about his character other than that he's simply good at fighting.Additionally, the two lead villains are just so cartoonishly absurd that they feel as though they were plucked right out of the 80s and made to interact with the world of the 2020s. For instance, the main antagonist is a wealthy real estate developer who runs a drug empire and wants to expand his development onto the land where the Road House is located. The actions of this character are so bizarre, like when he requests to be shaved with an old blade on his boat while traversing rough seas. If you can consider that character to be the brains, then the brawn would have to be Conor McGregor in his first acting role. However, all McGregor does in this film is punch things and pick fights simply because he feels like it, all while brandishing a menacing grin on his face. It's hard to tell if all these creative decisions were added as an ironic attempt at leaving a lasting impression on today's audience, but it just comes across as woefully desperate in my point of view.For an already unnecessary remake of a popular guilty pleasure, this 2024 version of ""Road House"" just cannot find a way to distinguish itself any more than as a poor imitation of an arguably better original. The 1989 film might be considered bad by some, but it at least has a certain charm that has allowed it remain in the ""so-good-it's-bad"" category even after more than three decades. On the other hand, while this remake is indeed a bad film, it is bad in an uninteresting way; the kind that leaves you scratching your head as to why it was even made in the first place other than to capitalise on nostalgia. I cannot imagine this version ever achieving cult status like its 80s counterpart, but I could be wrong considering the general public's tendency to find appeal in almost anything. With that said, I believe it will be the original film that future generations choose to keep in high esteem.I rate it 4/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Was that real or clever CGI? Kelly Lynch had a better part then Danielle Melchior. Best part was the bands but no one can compare to Jeff Healy. None of the bands were drawn out. No Sam Elliott. The cop dad of Danielle Melchior was why. His name was Big Dick. Was that because his name was Dick and he was Big. Or...... Connor MacGregor was OTT. He sounded like Fat Bastard from the Austin Powers flicks. And the guy who played Brandt was no Ben Gazzara. All of the fights looked so staged as to be laughable. Except the dialogue was even funnier, unintentionally of course. Many of the sub characters seemed contrived even if they were sympathetic. Hard to believe Doug Liman did this given his background with some of the Bourne films. I gave it 5 stars because I actually sat there and watched it through because I wanted to compare it with the original. Boring it wasn't. Maybe Gyllenhaal was just having a good time.

Another thing I noticed about this film and others of late is that modesty on show... no nudity let alone dirty dancing... oh hang on, there was a glimpse or two of one of the protagonist's rear...
Nor was anyone smoking even though we could tell who the baddies were because they were inked males... And all the ladies were ""goodies"" you might say... is it just me or was there some clumsy agenda afoot here?The time will come when we will be able to date these movies by factors such as these... maybe I should go back and watch the Swayze version and count the number of times the cast light up?","9 out of 18 found this helpful."

In that way it's very different than the '80's version starring Patrick Swayze. That film has large doses of cheese; this one? Grittier and slightly more self aware.Liman is a director who has helmed some great movies (The Bourne Identity, Edge Of Tomorrow), and some clunkers. This falls somewhere between.Gyllenhal is not only believable, but multi-layered in his performance. Although they are very different characters, akin to his performance in Southpaw.Raw, brutal, damaged individual.There are three relationships that orbit Dalton's (Gyllenhall) journey: the teenage girl who provides emotional grounding and ironic one-liners, the nurse who's there just for a romantic interest, and the bar owner (Jessica Williams in a truly awful performance) who provides the entry into the violent world Dalton has to navigate. The villains are a psychotic scion of a mobster, and Connor McGregor as an even more psychotic brawler bent on killing Dalton.The rest of the supporting cast are one dimensional cardboard cutouts, and the script is a barebones straight line to the conclusion we prey much expect.It may not be easy to watch, or enjoy visceral immersion because it's so brutal and bloody. The comedic beats featured in the trailers are few and far between.There's a long list of former fighters and muscle guys who've made the transition to film: but Connor MacGregor does no one any favors with his cringe worthy performance.As they say at the carnival, to forewarn patrons...THIS IS A DARK (VERY) RIDE.Other than Gyllenhal there are no performances that stand out, and that's the problem. His portrayal is complicated, begging for a three dimensional adversary and fully developed allies. Because neither of those things happen what we're left with are beautiful shots of water, well choreographed fight scenes, and that's it.","3 out of 12 found this helpful."

I mean the real ""Road House"" is an iconic '80s action film that revels in its blend of high-octane fight scenes and a uniquely philosophical bouncer, played by Patrick Swayze, tasked with cleaning up a rough bar. Perhaps its over-the-top narrative, complete with memorable characters and a sense of humor about its own absurdity, has cemented its status as a cult classic. But the film's charm is bolstered by a strong supporting cast, including Sam Elliott and Kelly Lynch, and a soundtrack that captures the era's spirit. The real ""Road House"" has grown in appreciation for its unabashed embrace of action movie tropes and Swayze's charismatic performance. I miss the Sam character in the remake.","3 out of 12 found this helpful."

But it had a likeable hero, a classic soundtrack, and an uplifting vibe as Patrick Swayze cleans up the bar step by step.The remake barely spends time in the actual road house and thereby omits what made the original a classic. Instead, we get a tired recycled plot about an evil property developer - yawn!The Florida setting had potential, especially in light of the Florida Man meme. They could have done a lot with it, but unfortunately they never do.Unlike in the original, which depicted a town full of crooks, the locals in the remake can do no wrong, especially anyone not white.None of the secondary characters here really have much in terms of character arcs. The best I can remember is the one villain who has his arm broken and the love interest having a European accent despite being from Florida, and sounding like she has throat cancer.The standout is Connor McGregor who plays an exaggerated version of his ring persona and delivers a completely unhinged villain.He spends to movie wearing a lunatic grin and walking with an exaggerated swagger. The best recurring joke in the movie is him smashing his car into objects instead of using the break.Unfortunately, the tone of the movie is a mess. Jake Gyllenhaal mopes around as a traumatized hero with a horrible past in one scene, only to crack jokes in another, then suddenly not care and want to leave, and then ruthlessly murder people. We have no emotional anchor in the movie, compared to Patrick Swayze's uplifting good guy.That is not to say Jake Gyllenhaal isn't fantastic in this film. He absolutely carries the film on his own. Without him, the film would barely be a 2 or 3/10.The direction is awful. From bad color grading to half the movie being out of focus, with way too many closeups. You barely see two characters in focus on screen at the same time outside of fight scenes.These are shot with a fisheye lens and a constantly revolving camera. They're disorenting and look fake. It's not as bad as shakycam, but it's a trend that needs to die, along with the heavy use of focal depth blur.The fight scenes are also scored poorly with generic action movie soundtrack that doesn't even fit the on screen scenes, and then interrupted by jokes.During a life and death fight after many people have been killed, someone gets their head smashed into a piano and says ""that piano is out of tune"". It's a funny line and would have been great early on, but out of place at that point in the movie.As mentioned the Road House location is barely used. We see it early on a few times, each time introduced the same way: a bad song starts playing and then we get shots of a band. It's repetitive. The location also lacks a unique look or coherent geometry. It never feels like a place people would want to go to. The bands keep playing during fights with broken bottles and people getting beaten half to death with golf clubs. None of it makes sense or feels coherent.Part of what made the original satisfying was the feeling that Swayze slowly but surely improved the place. We never get that feeling here, and the 2nd half of the movie barely even spends time at the Road House.Add to that the awful camera work, bad pacing, bad color grading and generic unfocused writing, and you have a steaming mess of a movie.You may get a few chuckles out of it, but overall it's unsatisfying.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

Overall I think is suffers from lack of identity; if it had been either a little grungier or a little lighter, it might have found continuity.What hurts Road House is that it rides a middle line and doesn't accomplish either its campier elements to make this a lighter romp, or its rougher violent edginess that makes us believe our antagonist can unleash hell on the biker gangs and thugs that plague the road house, and embracing itself as a brawl film. Accomplishing neither, it falls on its face.What hurts the film the most I think are the villains, who all come off as caricatures of characters rather than characters themselves.Our main ""baddie"" a second generation spoiled real estate trust fund child, wears pink shirts, laughs maniacally as he spouts cheap dialogue, ending up as a cliche rather than anything original or intimidating. Also we have the cliche bad cop, the stupid underlings that think they're tough, only to run scampering when Gyllenhaal's character throws a few punches.Worst of all (sorry) is when McGregor's big baddie comes on the scene. His introduction is laughable as he prances around like a cartoon character, practically self-narrating with his big cheesy grin that never leaves his face, and stomping around wide-legged like he has a basketball tucked between his knees ""look what a big bad crazy guy I am"".I will say Gyllenhaal is the best thing here. He does play a character that has compassion, self-loathing and a tough dirty side very well.This film also could've benefited from some atmosphere and better cinematography; pulling us into the heat and humidity of Florida, rather than shooting it like a shiny new penny.Road House is not a ""bad"" film, but I think the worst disappointment in a film is when you see potential that was missed, and characters and editing that were phoned in, that if they had been better developed and given more attention, could have made this a better film.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

However, from the very opening scene, it becomes evident that this reboot falls short of expectations, particularly in the realm of CGI and fight choreography. Despite its attempts to deliver a fun, entertaining experience, the film struggles to overcome its technical flaws, leaving audiences feeling underwhelmed and disappointed.The film's introduction, marred by the poor CGI portrayal of Post Malone's punches, sets a disheartening tone that persists throughout the movie. Instead of immersing viewers in the excitement of the action, the subpar visuals serve as a distraction, detracting from the overall viewing experience. It's a missed opportunity to grab the audience's attention right from the start and set the stage for what could have been an exhilarating ride.As the story unfolds, the issues with CGI only seem to worsen, with awkwardly rendered fight scenes failing to capture the intensity and realism expected from a film of this genre. Despite being promoted by the UFC, renowned for its high-caliber fights and impressive athleticism, ""Road House 2024"" fails to deliver on the promise of gripping action. Instead, viewers are left with a sense of disappointment as they watch poorly executed fight sequences play out on screen.While the film strives to be a lighthearted, entertaining romp rather than an award-winning masterpiece, it ultimately falls short of even these modest ambitions. The pervasive presence of bad CGI serves as a constant reminder of the film's shortcomings, preventing audiences from fully immersing themselves in the story and characters. It's a frustrating experience for viewers who were hoping for a fun, escapist adventure but are instead met with a barrage of technical flaws.Despite its flaws, ""Road House 2024"" does manage to offer some moments of enjoyment. The charismatic performances of the cast, led by a charming lead in the role of the protagonist, help to inject a sense of energy and humor into the film. Additionally, the soundtrack, filled with catchy tunes and pulsating beats, adds to the overall atmosphere of the movie, providing brief respites from the onslaught of CGI chaos.In the end, however, these positives are overshadowed by the film's inability to overcome its technical deficiencies. ""Road House 2024"" may have been promoted as a fun, action-packed thrill ride, but it ultimately fails to live up to the hype. As audiences exit the theater, they can't help but feel a sense of disappointment at what could have been-a rollicking adventure through the world of underground fighting, marred by the unfortunate presence of bad CGI. In the end, ""Road House 2024"" is a bumpy ride that fails to deliver on its promises, leaving viewers longing for something more.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

Obviously HE was the big draw, and if he had been hellraiser himself, the girls would have liked it.

It's as if the narrative is skimming the surface, leaving behind a sense of unfulfilled potential and a longing for a more immersive storytelling experience. The viewer is left craving the richness of a more intricately woven narrative, one that draws them in and holds their attention from scene to scene, allowing them to truly experience the story alongside the characters.","3 out of 14 found this helpful."

The plot runs along some of the same lines as that film but also has different elements to it which make this a film in its own right. Jake Gyllenhaal is really good in this and in essence carries a lot of the film through his performance. The supporting cast are all solid enough, however it has to be said Connor McGregor really cannot act! The film is directed by Doug Limen (The Bourne Identity) and looks great. The only downside is there are perhaps a couple of scenes which have too much CGI. Fight scenes are well done but can at times feel too over the top. Less would be more in some of them. I also found the third act a little weak compared with the first two acts once Gyllenhall boards the main bad guys boat. In essence though Roadhouse is a well made fun film which is probably better than it has any right to be. How does it compare to the Swayze original? I would say this remake is certainly on a par with that film. In summary i found Roadhouse an action packed fun watch which was better than i expected.","6 out of 12 found this helpful."

The fact that they had him riding the bus and then walking was so disrespectful to Dalton as a character. You would've never caught Buddy walking anywhere. This depicts him as financially irresponsible which was never a concern in the original.Then on top of that, they show him as fearful and manipulative. He shows fear when dealing with an injury and there was not a time I could remember in the original that I recall him ever portraying the emotion, especially not where or when others could see it.He also manipulated those guys out into the parking lot which also displayed fear which is definitely not anything you'd ever see in the original.The music is trash. That was another great part of the original that was totally lost here. I just cannot force myself or my mind to suffer through another disappointing and disrespectful minute of this trash. They should've changed Jake's name and changed the name of the Road House and no one would've associated the 2 with eachother.Buddy would be rolling over in his grave right now at the sorry excuse of a remake as this. Uggghh, tbh it makes me sick literally and figuratively and that's saying something.Howard Stern got me slightly excited for this after his interview with Jake, but I think his interpretation was just jaded by the fact that he got to actually interview Jake about it and that he has spoken to other stars like Post Malone. His position was just too close and personal to be objective cuz he was way wrong about this one. I hate it, sorry not sorry!!","3 out of 15 found this helpful."

This movie is over the top Swayze awesome. This was Road House with a flare of Point Break. McGregor just did the thing that made everyone want to watch his fights, and did it amazingly. If you go into this movie thinking ""this will be like one the Jason Bourne movies"" you will leave confused. If you go into it with a ""remember how ridiculous and fun Road House was"" you'll leave loving every second.Quick note about CGI fighting, they filmed quite a few shots in what's called a four-take sequence. Which is why the punches look so real, but also kinda not. But that's not the point. The point is, it's fun, awesome, hilarious, action packed.....it's Road House.","7 out of 15 found this helpful."

In this version the ""roadhouse"" plays no real role here. The director doesn't even make an effort to creat a story around the bar and it's employees, which was critical in the original movie.

The storyline follows an ultimate fighter with a checkered past who becomes a bouncer at a new Road House, which is under siege by someone looking to acquire it. As the fighter works to clean up the bar, the antagonists escalate their efforts to close the deal.Directed by Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow), the film stars Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler), Conor McGregor, Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad), Billy Magnussen (Into the Woods), and Jessica Williams (2 Dope Queens).The first half of the movie shows promise, with a solid opening fight and authentic acting that drew me in. Even Conor McGregor's performance worked for me. The storyline is coherent, the dialogue clever, and there's a sprinkle of comedy throughout. However, the film takes a drastic turn for the worse during the boat sequence, with random explosions and unrealistic fights that devolve into chaos. The final fight feels like a glorified wrestling match, albeit with a cool finish.In conclusion, Road House starts off strong but ultimately becomes a mindless action film with a disappointing finish. I would rate it a 4/10 and recommend skipping it.","2 out of 9 found this helpful."

The movie is also proof that blues rock can still be great soundtrack and used for modern movies.And tbh, nothing can go wrong with Jake Gyllenhaal, one of my favorite actors out there 😁💪 I love all of his movies (Nightcrawler, Ambulance, Nocturnal Animals, Prisoners, and so forth) and he didn't disappoint here.

Perhaps it was in the editing, maybe the writing, maybe the directing, or maybe it was in everything it just felt like nothing was there, nothing of substance. I always like to give movies like this a try, movies that really straddle the line between popcorn thrills, sincere storytelling, and complete garbage. Usually if you have enough of the former two, the latter will sort of become part of the charm. The best example for me is Unstoppable, the movie about the runaway train. The premise is extremely straightforward, so there's very little sincere storytelling to go off of, but when it does (the taking of the mantle by the new generation) it actually gives it just enough credence to warrant its existence, also the popcorn thrills and the sprinkling in of complete and utter garbage really make that movie one of the most enjoyable and entertaining watches I've ever had. This movie, on the other hand, forced in some very pointless storytelling, some decent popcorn thrills, and was mainly just complete and utter garbage, so much to the point where that's really all the movie was. Edgy shots galore, pointless characters who make the messy plot feel even more convoluted, unnecessary and hackneyed character motivations, rehashed tropes that were not approached in a fun or inventive manner, no satisfying or meaningful resolution, and, to top it all off, hints at another entry in this movie's universe. Admiteddly, I haven't seen (nor have any interest in seeing) the original, but, from what some of the other reviews mention, a lot of cheesy nostalgia-bait that neither pays homage well nor feels natural and well-placed. So, for basically every metric that exists to mark what makes a piece of cinema bad, this one hits all of them. A loveless homunculus retreading tired, old ground of a project that really has no single element that warrants its existence other than Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, which, while still great, was even a bit ham-fisted for his standards (as one of the best talents of the current generation). Even then, I've definitely seen far worse, so with respect to Jake's care and performance I can't say this project was entirely without any consideration or effort., it's just that even if you give Michelangelo a pile of feces to sculpt with, and he sculpts a masterpiece with it, it's still a pile of feces. That's how I'd categorize Jake's performance in this movie, he did the best with what he had, but even that still couldn't remove the movie from the fact that it's a steaming pile of feces. But. Again, far worse, less enjoyable movies exist; even if the basal majority is better, far, far worse exists. 3.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Or maybe his friendly local pharmacist. Anyway, the casting of McGregor was an inspired bit of self-sabotage: most actors can be trained to carry off a well-choreographed fight scene, but it turns out that not every fighter can be turned into an actor. Who knew? By comparison, Mr T gave a nuanced and emotional performance as Clubber Lang, and John Cena looks ready for theatre.The rest of the cast seems to be largely unknowns (Joaquim de Almeida being the only one I recognised personally, but maybe I'm out of date), and some of them (mostly the female characters) do a decent job. But since everybody labelled ""bad guy"" rose to the level of McGregor and was utterly plastic, it was really hard to give a damn about the overall narrative.And despite Gyllenhal's best efforts (he's still charming and likeable, but you can see that it is definitely requiring effort) with so little to oppose and work with, even he can't quite sell the critical moments.In short, do yourself a favour and spend a night in with Patrick Swayze. The original hasn't aged especially well, but it's still a better vintage than the remake.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The original ""Roadhouse"" holds a special place in the annals of cheesy yet charming cinema. If you missed its heyday and catch it now, you'll likely find it dripping with camp, predictability, and a healthy dose of chuckles. Yet, somehow, it's still strangely enjoyable.Enter the remake, strutting down the same well-trodden path. Jake Gyllenhaal, a fine thespian in his own right, seems to have phoned in his performance. Was he daydreaming about his next project? Playing the calm and collected hero suppressing his inner demons should have been intriguing, but it comes off a tad smug and lackluster. The action sequences? Meh. I've seen smoother CGI on homemade YouTube videos shot on an iPhone. However, I'll give credit where it's due-the fight scenes boast some slick choreography and nifty camera work.And then there's Conor McGregor, giving it a go. It's almost as if he's poking fun at himself, strutting around like he's on the brink of a bathroom emergency. Sure, he's got that professional fighter finesse in the ring, but Gyllenhaal seems a bit more... let's say, unpolished.Overall, it's a decent flick to throw on when you're craving some mindless brawl action with a side of predictable plot. But hey, don't hold your breath for any groundbreaking revelations. I, for one, sorely missed that iconic prison line from the original. Give it a watch, but don't expect it to rewrite the script of cinema history.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Story wise, there are quite a few similarities, but I think the omission of a Wade Garrett-like character was a misstep. Gyllenhaal is a good actor and did fine as Dalton. Conor McGregor is unrealistically psychotic, but I have to admit that his scenes made the movie more entertaining. He would've been scarier if he seemed intelligent as opposed to just being a maniac though. I can tell a lot of effort went into the fight choreography, but the cinematography wasn't doing it any favors. Excessive cuts, weird angles, unnecessary closeups, blurring (why?), and some bad CGI tarnished what could've been. People want to see wider angles and way fewer cuts to appreciate the work that goes into it. If that means more rehearsal and takes, it's worth it for a more polished fighting movie, which is what this is at its core. It falls way short of the original for me, and is not a memorable movie in the genre.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

It just wasn't very good. Weird pacing, dizzying camera shots, lazy script, and terrible use of the villain. I thought it started pretty well. It had some well done humor and the fighting was great. But once McGregor was introduced the movie went downhill. I don't blame McGregor, it was just a terrible script. Amazon had to know this movie was going to bomb in theaters which is no doubt why they sent it straight to streaming. They would have been better off making a shot-for-shot remake or to have just left this film alone altogether.","2 out of 12 found this helpful."

He is asked to clean up a club ""Road House"" because of constant violence. His performance was ok but the cliche troubled tough guy routine is so thick it's cheesy at times.

I couldn't understand his thick Irish accent, he acted like he was on crack and they really went overboard.My idea - if nobody's giving thought to this in Hollywood already - is to make a series of films featuring Jake as Dalton and go from city to city. I like the idea of a new setting, slightly varying stories. It'd be a bit like Mission Impossible I suppose, maybe not as good, but if they can come up with original things to Dalton's character, as in the way he approaches different enemies. I loved when he held up his left
I do believe this could work as a film series (in the mold of Mission Impossible). Maybe he'll have a love interest. Not the girl from this movie, but someone, eventually. I also like the idea of past acquaintances showing up in future movies. Maybe he pays a visit back to the Keys and visits the people at the shop and those at the bar.I would definitely watch any sequels. I believe Jake could carry this series.

How someone thought casting this idiot was a good idea is beyond my understanding. It felt like casting a monkey in a James Dean movie. But even if there was someone capable instead of him there is so many questions in my head. Why make a remake of an average 90s movie? Why to spend so much money on it? Why Jake said yes to it?

And so the movie delivers as promised, not more but not exactly less either. Hero looks brutal and calm, main antagonist looks brutal and psychotic, fighting is endless and seemingly inconsequential punching each other in the face - as promised. Perhaps even too much of said punching - during the final part it felt like their faces should've looked like crimson basketballs for 20 minutes already but there's still barely a minor laceration or two.What I find this movie severely lacking though is acting - Jake Gyllenhaal is unpredictably witty or lost, and his ""really pissed off"" state differs from all the others not at all; Conor McGregor is too caricature and grotesque to be believable; Billy Magnussen is all cliche. The only decent acting comes from actors on secondary roles, but that doesn't really save much.What I find this movie having severely too much of is pointless rage - the generic night at the bar seems to be ""try to kill someone because the music is wrong, then try to maim someone because why not, crash some furniture, smash some bottles, drive home wasted"". I've never been to Florida, but I seriously doubt it does any justice to the local population.","2 out of 15 found this helpful."

A fantastic bad guy trope, with adequate levels of violence and humour.Unfortunately it felt like they blew the cast budget and focus on the two leads, and the rest of the cast is ""thoroughly adequate"" No character is badly portrayed/acted, but no-one else stands out, either. Credit to Post Malone for his cameo, which worked out well. The ""bad guy"" didn't quite hit right for me - whether that was the actor or the lines he had, I'm not sure.I did appreciate that it didn't feel as green screen/CGI/Sound-stage as a lot of the recent productions. The few times it is noticeable (water/boat scenes, the car crashing into the bar/fight scene, and a few others) it doesn't distract/detract too much from the enjoyment. For the most part it felt like it was either shot on location, or done well enough to not be noticed. As a UFC fan, I did notice the changes to Conor's tattoos.As my title suggests - if it wasn't a remake, it'd be a star or two higher - but the original set a high bar to try to redo. It *is* a great remake though - they thought through how to make it suitable for a modern setting, and the UFC footage/link being well executed. I can't help but wonder if they hadn't made a few subtle changes and called it something else, how it might have been perceived in a higher regard.

The original movie was a classic because it built up a believable story with strong and interesting characters that are appealing. This movie casts an array of talentless and physically unappealing people. Couple this with terrible dialogue and no character progression and it makes it impossible for the audience to care about any of them.The dialogue is simply atrocious. There is no mystery to the plot, everything is just thrown in your face in the most blunt and clumsy way possible. There is no buildup to the scenes or smooth logical transitions. Instead the plot jerks forward with plot holes everywhere. The story moves on to its predestined outcome without a care for logic, consistency or drama. There are so many things that happen that don't make any sense.The ""roadhouse"" which is not a roadhouse is in the middle of nowhere. How can a large entertainment business survive in the middle of no where? Where are the customers coming from and why would anyone want that small strip of land? Also the Brent family built the area up and have a lot of businesses (legal and otherwise) but have no money and are in debt so they want to make a massive investment? What? Which is it? None of this makes any sense.The plot points where Dalton cleans up the roadhouse and transforms the clientele is completely glossed over. There is no methodical change and buildup. Only a rush to the next plot point. There is no character development either. The acting is often terrible. Dalton and Knox are just smiling stupidly for most of the movie. It's a parody of itself and the characters can't help but smile along. Terrible movie that was not worth the time.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

But regardless of ignoring the hype, I still didn't enjoy it. Conors strange walk and very blatant lack of acting ability, doing a half awkward smile on a nervous looking red face made me feel cringe and uncomfortable for him.

Who in hell thought that he'd make a good actor in a film? The minute he strutted into the scene, I was tempted to turn it off. His never ending grin and his walk as though he had a pineapple shoved up his bum were distractions that were hard to ignore. And his limited dialogue...did he write his own lines? They were cringe.Jessica Williams' portrayal of the bar owner was wooden and lifeless, almost as if she was back in high school in the annual drama class performance. Daniela Melchior (Ellie) was also quite subdued and boring while playing Dalton's love interest, and that side story went absolutely nowhere. Most of the other actors fall into this same category for me, with the possible exceptions of BK Cannon (Laura), who added a very down to earth and realistic performance, and Arturo Castro (Moe), who added some much needed comic relief.The story itself was meh...similar to the original Road House, but with it's own twist.

Then after serving as a very thin, zero story means of exposition to set the scene the bar owner is so rarely seen and does absolutely nothing that she may as well not be in the movie.The protection job is so easy that gyllenhaal spends most of the movie sitting at the bar doing squat while 2 of the scrawniest, least intinimdating bouncers you could ever imagine handle things and the cloest thing to guidance they get from the seasoned fighter is "" when he pulls a knife step back"" because self defense is that simple.Gyllenhall's background makes no sense as a motivation or explanation because it goes nowhere, he does something that would undoubtedly left him serving jail time yet instead he is a free man who had a 6 figure job yet with no explanation for how he avoided jail or what he did with his money, we see him for some reason living in his car, scraping by and feeling sorry for himself.At the start of the movie he welcomes violence, including allowing a man to use a weapon on him without fighting back yet when he is employed as a bouncer he sits at a bar casually drinking waiting until the entire place is destroyed and then tries to have a ""humourous"" conversation to get people to leave.The ""plot"" of this movie is a spoilt rich son refusing to destroy a bar despite having the law in his pocket and enough money to have bulldozers on sight within an hour. At one point in the movie ""keys"" are talked about, obviously meaning cocaine, yet nothing ever comes from that path, it's not a ""mystery"" because it is a well constructed, weaving story leaving the viewer theorizing what will happen, it is a ""mystery"" in the sense that they never explain anything. Do you know how the bar owner is rich enough to offer 5k a week? Do you know what role ""keys"" play in the story? Do you know why the millionaire son pays drunk bums to slightly annoy a bar owner hoping it will result in her abandoning it? Do you know who McGregor's character is, how he's a skilled fighter, how he can travel cross country and even cross continent assaulting everyone he sees with facing zero repurcussions? Do you know how a man can get stabbed in the kidney, have internal bleeding and be perfectly fine by slapping some tape on it? No? Well neither do the ""writers"" of this movieThe ""romance"" has dialogue so bad I have no doubt it was AI generated. A woman shouts at a stranger because she has to do her job > they have the wierdest conversation in cinema history talking about conchs > they hook up > nothing happens past this point and the ""connection"" between the 2 of them is never relevant againThe special effects are pathetic, the entire budget must have went into McGregor's pocket because there is no way any went into the effects, I have seen more convincing effects in direct to tv syfy originals made on a shoestring budget.There's the worlds shortest workout montage which plays out very similarly to a family guy episode where they poke fun at Michael Bay's over the top style.The ""villain"" has the entire state's police on his payroll yet instead of simply sending a bulldozer to take the bar down his ""strategy"" is to send a bunch of out of shape unemployed guys to go to the bar and throw a tantrum, which is moronic from every angle, not least of all the fact that as mentioned above even without the incompetent thugs there are fights in that bar literally at least once an hour.Speaking of the thugs, they are barely in the movie and still are so poorly written it's impossible not to spot it. One of them likes to have casual conversations after having his arm broke or seeing a dead body, between the big black guy and the slicked back hair guy there are 5 different times in the movie where they are either standing face to face with someone or standing outside a place with weapons in hand but the screen cuts to another scene so in this supposed action movie they cheaped out and skipped as many action sequences as they could.The original movie isn't a landmark in story telling but at least it makes sense, it is set in a dive bar, with down and out folks and has earned a rough reputation because of that which in turn draws in more of the same crowd. This movie is set on an easy living tropical paradise where somehow the entire population is unemployed yet they have enough money to drink all day and night, they start fights over literally nothing, destroy the bar, the bar is miraciously repaired at zero cost to the owner and this cycle repeats on an hourly basis. I'm all for dumb fun action now and then but this has little action, effectively no good action and has all the dumb in the world but none of the fun. "" hey fellow smiling middle age white guy living in a tropical paradise wearing hawaiian shirts and day drinking lets throw tables and chairs at each other because after dancing to this song I have now decided I no longer like this song"".Small point but I think another factor in pointing to it being chatgpt is the naming scheme. The bar is called ""road house"" Gyllenhall lives on a boat called ""The boat"", the only other named business/place we see is a book shop in Glass key and it is called ""Glass Books"". That level of ""creativity"" is too mind blowing for humans to have concocted itI was not even born when the original came out, but I have seen it and it is a good, dumb fun action movie. This one is frankly an insult, it should not be called road house, there is not a single argument to be made for it to be almost 2 hours long and it's an insult to the original to use the same character name, albeit same surname different given name, it does not have good action sequences, it has one decently choreographed fight the rest are slop that no named characters are even involved in and the ""humour"" is painfully bad. This has to be a chatgpt generated script and screenplay, there is no other plausible explanation for how a movie with such a basic formula to draw from was made so dumb and so bad that by comparison it makes 2017's Baywatch look like such a milestone in cinematography and story telling that it should be preserved in a museum for future generations to marvel at.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

The Patrick Swayze original is not great but compared to this worthless piece of garbage it suddenly seems like one of the greats from the 80's. There is no part of this way too long failure in film making that works. The wafer thin backstory for Gyllenhaal's character doesn't stand up to a minute of scrutiny and the attempt to paint him as a western hero via a book store owner completely fails. The dual female leads played by Daniela Melchoir & Jessica Williams as so thinly drawn as to be nothing more than tropes and neither actress has the skills to make more of what they've been given. On the bad guy side the biggest joke is the casting of Connor McGregor as the psychotic heavy; this man should never be let in front of a camera again, it was excruciating to watch, not quite so bad was Billy Magnussen as the boss and rounding it off was the sad sight of Joaquim de Almeida as the corrupt sheriff, an actor of once high profile roles. On the directing front Doug Liman has some serious work behind him the original Bourne film most notably but he can be erratic and here he is definitely erratic; fight scenes are amateurish and predictable as well as being completely unbelievable, the camera is all over the place, there is no solid editing and the plot continuity is almost non existent.

The characters - including the lead - have no development (there's some flashbacks to Dalton's previous life but that is fleeting and pointless), you don't have much or any opinion on who they are, or what they are doing and everyone, bar Jake Gyllenhaal has little screen time.All that's left is are the fight scenes which don't really work that well (partly due to CGI) and the introduction of McGregor as the nemesis just takes it down further.If they really wanted to make something new from the classic, it would of been interesting to have focused on Dalton, his backstory or better still an origin story of Wade Garrett who was always the most interesting character in the original.","1 out of 6 found this helpful."

So, I went in with little in terms of expectations except that Jake Gyllenhaal usually delivers a good performance. In the end, that's all I got that was good.The movie starts off pretty good introducing Mr. Gyllenhaal's Dalton character as someone who is struggling to deal with something in his past. But he pulls himself up enough to do this job at the Road House of dealing with their troublemakers. We find out he is a UFC fighter with a reputation. The owner, Frankie, is slightly mysterious as to why she is having trouble. Dalton gets to town and quickly discovers there is trouble in multiple areas. All this sets up for a good story, but then we get thrown overboard to the man-eating croc for the rest of the movie. The worst is Conor McGregor's Knox character who is more of a comic book villain at best and completely throws off the entire movie. I'm glad they tried to bring a real UFC fighter into the movie (and there is a lot of fighting in the movie - not all realistic though), but his character (and acting) were just all wrong. But it's not just him, I found myself not caring about what happened to Frankie's Road House either because she wasn't really seen fighting for it much or making a case for the audience to care about her - she just inherited it from her uncle and her character seems like more of an afterthought. Dalton's love interest was at most a distraction and at worst a forced plot device. The most sympathetic characters were the father and daughter of the book store, but they were more of a side story bit - maybe their story could have been combined with Frankie's or something. And Dalton himself doesn't really go through much of any character arc. He comes off as a Jack Reacher type, but maybe that's okay. Mr. Gyllenhaal's performance was good otherwise.","1 out of 6 found this helpful."

In production for nearly a decade, the lead role was originally set for Ronda Rousey, but various real-world complications caused that to fall through. After being shelved for half a decade, the film was revisited in 2021 with Doug Liman as director and Jake Gyllenhaal as lead. Finally on track, Road House was ready to come together.Running from his past, drifter Elwood Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) makes his money from underground fighting. After being given an opportunity to do some good, Dalton finds himself in the Florida Keys defending a roadhouse aptly named, Road House. After making his mark within the town, Dalton finds himself over his head as town secrets become uncovered. Choosing between his life and the town, he faces the question of who he is and what he is willing to do.Road House is a fun action flick but fails to uphold the charm and uniqueness of the original. The story is unoriginal, even going as far as referencing that it is just retelling an older action movie archetype. While the action is mildly entertaining, the should-have-been realistic fight scenes are replaced with rubbery, comic-book-esque CGI, causing the stakes to feel non-existent. Akin to recent Fast & Furious entries, Road House is the Saturday morning cartoon of modern films.Though Gyllenhaal consistently delivers a captivating performance, his loner personality creates a difficult character to connect to. Walking a thin line between humble hero and unhinged combatant, his interpretation of Dalton leaves a far different experience than his predecessor. Unfortunately, Gyllenhaal fails to produce any sparks with love interest Daniela Melchior as he turns Dalton's stoicism to 11, leaving little believability to their romance. Although Billy Magnussen is the main villain, McGregor instantly steals the show in his feature film debut, causing every other performance to pale against his rivalry with Gyllenhaal.Though it isn't perfect, Road House is a fun ride. Held together by Gyllenhaal's wacky performance and McGregor's outlandish personality, the film fails to be noteworthy. Choosing style over substance, Road House delivers a hollow shell from what was once a classic. Fortunately, Road House is currently streaming on Amazon Prime and, while it isn't worth a trip to the movies, it's definitely worth checking out on a lazy Saturday afternoon.","1 out of 6 found this helpful."

This movie has no memorable staff working in the bar, just a diverse mix of young people who all seem to have a chip on their shoulder for no reason. There is no character development at all and when Connor McGregor shows up the movie basically dies. They spend more time on speedboats and yachts than they do in the bar, which is barely a bar anyway. It's more like a beer tent on the beach. You don't get to see Dalton gradually turning the bar into something better like you did in the original, he just has a fight every fifteen minutes or so. What happens in between is of zero interest or relevance most of the time.Jake G is really trying to do something with his character, but he's stuck in a 2024 action movie so he's basically wasting his time, much like I was when I watched this.","1 out of 6 found this helpful."
