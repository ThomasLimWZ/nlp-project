"6","/10","Lots of fun but G movies are becoming too cheesy...sigh","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9716970/?ref_=tt_urv","jefzilla-28534","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur134865577/?ref_=tt_urv","3 April 2024","As a hard-core Kaiju fan of many years, I love that we are being treated to all of these Godzilla movies as of late. My opinion of the first two in this series (Godzilla and Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is that they were (somewhat) reality based and not obviously made for children. My criticism of G v K (the ending in particular) and this movie is that so much of it is far-fetched and fantasy based. Much more cartoonish.The bottom line is, they're making the monsters out to have too much human intelligence when they should actually be more animalistic. This was like watching a superhero movie and in my opinion, making the monsters out to be superheroes is a huge mistake. That's what happened when Toho did this in the 60's/70's which resulted in Godzilla movies becoming silly, low-budget kids movies, which has since been ridiculed for decades and has tarnished Godzilla's image. I understand the writers are trying to be creative and give the fans something different from all of the other monster movies out there, but this can be done without all the cheese. Please stop making the monsters so human!I enjoyed the movie but have to admit that I am somewhat disappointed.","124 out of 137 found this helpful."

Humans = garbageAnother Monster-Verse installment to the collection gave me another reason to visit my cinema. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.About humans:
If you want to watch the movie at home, don't waste time on humans subplot. It's completely pointless. The dialogues aren't funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these ""characters"" are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they're doing doesn't make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It's better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn't be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.About the monsters:
Kong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I'd want to appreciate the ""dialogues"" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don't use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.Godzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn't intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you're a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don't expect to see raise of ""the new empire"" in this movie. It's a kinda awkward title generated by ChatGPT.","226 out of 282 found this helpful."

That's why we go to something like this, right?G X K is about the same for entertainment wise as G vs K, though I'd give the newest entry a slight edge for a couple of reasons. For one, there's a bit less silliness. There's comic relief of course, but it's not out of place or goofy. The 80's throwbacks with the tunes, synths, and vibes were great. And lastly, the Titans were back to being the bad guys instead of humans. I always find it a bore when you watch a movie about monsters fighting, but have to bare through a story of human villains and their idiotic ideologies.A side note, it's hilarious that these Titans seem to really enjoy having their royal rumbles in the biggest cities on the planet, or while destroying some of the world's most revered structures. Like really guys, you couldn't have thrown down in the middle of the Sahara? More destruction equals more entertainment I suppose. Also, Godzilla just casually murders hundreds if not thousands just walking around from point A to point B. I digress. Go pink Zilla!","132 out of 172 found this helpful."
"6","/10","A brainless, but (mostly) entertaining monster mash.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9707853/?ref_=tt_urv","vinayaksrivastava-20682","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur176477157/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 2024","Releasing merely weeks after the critically and commercially acclaimed ""Godzilla Minus One"" won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is a boon as well as bane for ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" - while more people are familiar with the behemoth radioactive lizard, there is an undeniable urge to draw comparisons between the two movies. Adam Wingard's second Monsterverse film following 2021's ""Godzilla vs Kong"" delivers satisfying Titan action, but overall, the film feels like a step back, largely owing to dull and tedious human drama.Personally, I found ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to be the best Monsterverse film. It embraced the absurdity and silliness of its premise and made the most of it to deliver one hell of a show, placing the Titans front and centre, while jettisoning any unnecessary human drama. ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" starts off much slower, with the actual plot taking nearly 20 minutes to kick in. Combined with an uptick in uninteresting human drama, this slows down the movie with certain portions feeling boring.Much like its predecessor, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" struggles trying to the connect the stories of the two leading titans. Kong is the heart and soul of the movie, with Godzilla largely feeling like an accomplice or sidekick. The first half of the movie is almost entirely about Kong's exploration of Hollow Earth, the subterranean ecosystem where the Titans live. While learning about the mystical world was engaging and intriguing, it lead to a delayed introduction of the villain, leading to the third act feeling slightly rushed and less rewarding compared to the enthralling finale of ""Godzilla vs Kong"".The action sequences themselves are a whole lot of fun, with a face off in hollow earth with gravity slightly messed-up being one of my favourites of the entire franchise. The finale in Rio delivers plentiful excitement and fun too.""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is best suited for fans of the Showa era. For Kong fans(like myself), there is a lot to like about the movie, owing to the humanisation of the great ape. The action scenes are fun, colourful and campy, similar to it's predecessor, but an increased focus on human characters and a slower pace make this a slightly underwhelming entry to the Monsterverse.","96 out of 129 found this helpful."

Godzilla's total screen time is probably less than 7 minutes. The movie is filled with monkeys throughout, making it more like an independent Kong film because it barely depicts Godzilla, with Kong having far more screen time than Godzilla. I feel like Godzilla's role was forcefully added and feels disconnected from the rest of the movie. Also, the portrayal of SHIMO is superficial, failing to showcase its power, while Skar King is portrayed as a clown; it can't even defeat King Kong one-on-one, lacking a strong antagonist that leads to a rushed conclusion of the final battle. Finally, I have a big question: why do the director and writers like monkeys so much?","55 out of 74 found this helpful."

Unfortunately, there's no time to spend on making things make sense or even matter all that much, and what few emotional punches are thrown lack the necessary wind up to connect, save for some very well done moments between Kong and his Hollow Earth kin.Overall didnt live up and the plot was mediocre at best.","37 out of 50 found this helpful."

They really added nothing to the film. Except annoyance dumb rehashed mcu jokes, not even remotely amusing. Not even in the same league as the masterpiece like Godzilla minus 1. This will be my last one of these types of Godzilla movies they toss out tripe like this on a regular basis like EA churns out GaaS games that ultimately get shut down within a year. Why because they are poop. The Cranston one was good, then the Farminga one wasn't bad, though the milly brown family aspect made it cringe. Soon as we got to the ones with ms hall and skarsgard they went down the pan and in the gutter. All flashy bright colors felt like we were watching iron man. Such a shame because Godzilla Kong and the creatures really tried to carry the human cast. But every scene these collection of humans were in we wanted them to meet a grizzly end. Such a farcry from Godzilla Minus 1 directed by Takashi Yamazaki.","67 out of 78 found this helpful."

Not just their actions but their presence and size.. a bit of slowness in how they walk and move, to feel that ""thud"" when they take a step and the sheer overwhelming presence that they represent - Like in Pacific Rim or in Godzilla King of the Monsters. You FEEL the bigness and the size.A splash in the ocean can causes huge tide-waves due to the size.A resounding BOOM that is felt when two Kaiju's collide.Where is that?There is no respect paid to the bigness.It's just they took some superhero action sequences and applied them to giants and made them move like they were the same size as humans.There is no FEEL or BIGNESS - It's simply a 6 out of 10 movie because it caters ""enough"" to enough people because it goes for what's popular and throws a lot of it while giving away the depth and the ""feel"" of a big monster movie that is what godzilla is meant to be.","81 out of 126 found this helpful."

The film doesn't disappoint in this aspect, as the fight sequences are incredibly well-executed and visually stunning, capturing the raw power and scale of these colossal creatures.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance the spectacle of the monster battles with a decent plot that keeps the audience invested. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, the plot serves its purpose by providing enough context and stakes to drive the action forward. It effectively sets the stage for the epic clash between the monsters, making their confrontation feel earned and impactful.One of the standout aspects of the film is its breathtaking visual effects. The CGI is top-notch, seamlessly blending the massive creatures into their environments and delivering jaw-dropping action sequences that truly immerse the audience in the epic battle between the Titans. From the destruction of cityscapes to the intricate details of the monsters themselves, the VFX work is nothing short of astonishing.After watching ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"" I'm left wanting more. The film delivers on its promise of entertainment, offering a thrilling cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression.

My biggest problem with it, was the human characters. Just like ""Godzilla vs Kong"", the characters are flat and i would rather watch monsters fight than them.The direction by Adam Wingard is pretty good. The action in particulat is really well done and you can really see what's going on.The actors were OK for the most part but for the script they are given, they are fine.Giant praise to the VFX. Everything looked amazaing and you can see that the money went in the place, not like ""Captain Marvel 2"" for example, which had a 300 million dollar budget and for the money, it looked awful.The music is good too.

My expectations were kind of meh, me personally, Godzilla Vs Kong (GVK) was OKAY, nothing special, maybe about a 6/10So who won this time in Godzilla X Kong & what is this New Empire?... well legendary studios of course!After a victorious achievement for Toho... we all know what we've come for here at legendary studios, & the results are definitely not a minus one...because this time we up the ante, and the people have spoken, we want this, legendary in this film is simply unlocking the massive cheese vault oozing into my optic stems, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a hyper adrenaline rush energizer, it felt like my brain waves digested a high voltage energy drink kicking every inch of my brain cells.Dan Stevens is a solid comic relief along with Brian Tyree Henry. The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80's vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.My issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It's not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.This is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it's just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It's a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.I've never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don't ruin it either this time. It's not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that's the Kaijus.New Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I've ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing cameraworkThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters. Compared to GVK, they have a better direction here without getting lost.It's a ride, took the issues of GVK & corrected it more, there's plenty of action if not more than you'd think... there's plenty of surprises, emotional character moments with humans/monsters, & although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plot/story following the elements at play... Godzilla X Kong was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something.7.5 / 10.","117 out of 204 found this helpful."

Now the thing is, the reason I am saying wow, is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because I am most definitely human and not Godzilla trying to promote his own film. The reasons being; CGI, Big monster go rahh, and epic battle scenes. Anything else is boring and I frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all I care about are the things that THE FILM IS ACTUALLY ABOUT (humans).First, I wanna start off by saying that comparing this film's CGI to Godzilla Minus One (greatest Godzilla film that actually made me care about humans), budget wise, is like an insult. GMO had a budget near abouuuut 20 million or so, while GXK had 10x the budget. GMO managed to achieve winning an Oscar with 100x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale CGI I've seen ever. BUT, the CGI even with such a smaller film beating it, is still excellent as always and doesn't look like some PS5 game that was reprogrammed to run on a Nintendo Switch, unlike other films. It has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the MonsterVerse.Monsters; I'm a sucker for Godzilla, not so much Kong, but this version of him definitely catches my eye. Godzilla and Shimo were what really brought this film together, and the funny thing is, before I saw Godzilla with pink atomic breath, it was my most disliked color, but on him, it's my preferred look for him. I also already loved cold related things so a big beast like Shimo definitely made me see this film.Battle Scenes. Now I know, I know, not all Godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes, I'M JUST SAYING, I wish they were longer. They are definitely what everyone, including me, came to see, and I am beyond glad with the outcome of the film, that I totally didn't see coming (that's sarcasm), and I actually would love to see more of the franchise, whatever it may be. Also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of Godzilla, watch literally any dated Godzilla film.In summary, I love Godzilla, Dune Part Two and GMO still beat it by an inconceivable number, but if you like big monsters or just Godzilla in General, watch this, maybe watch it again, or just watch the fight scene clips.","95 out of 176 found this helpful."

We're here because we want to see giant things smashing stuff up.Movies like this are like a Big Mac. It's not real food but it has its place.It is a whole load of silly, loud, goofy fun.The opening of this movie sees Kong luring a pack of giant hollow earth hyena things into a complex mechanical trap. He then takes a shower after covering himself in the blood of one of those giant hyena things having torn it in half whilst letting out a trademark intimidating roar.The first human moment sees Jia (the small girl from versus) having some psychic visions.It is that ridiculous.There was a ""surprise"" death that was possibly the most telegraphed in history and a scene where a monarch monitoring station, in hollow earth, has been destroyed. (Remember that hollow earth is huge, mostly uncharted and full of giant monsters) and the question is asked ""What could have done this?""
Giant mechanical arm ex machina. Loads of explanation for stuff we didn't ought to have figured out. Magic mind control. Magic gravity control.There's a kind of anti gravity fight which is pretty decent and scenes of our favourite titans on Rio beach, Giza and even having a nap in Rome's Colloseum.Honestly it's ridiculous.

The Kaiju terror is here, but in a very watered-down state.No dialogue because it's just senseless roaring beasts? Don't need to pay anyone to write a good script. Excessive closeups of the beasts all the time? Well that handily means they didn't need to animate higher-budget complex scenes from a more interesting POV.

Especially Dan Stevens. But then I AM kinda biased towards him as I've loved his work in everything I've seen him in so far.All that aside, Kong was great - and MASSIVE - and Godzilla was pretty damn impressive, too - and just as massive as Kong - but more than that, we got a look at a few other Titans as well, and they were ALL pretty impressively brought to life here. My ONLY gripe about Kong himself is that, in the early going the filmmakers tried to humanise him just that little but too much, and it kinda fell flat to me. Once things actually got moving and shaking, though, it all got a lot better.","72 out of 134 found this helpful."

The smackdowns between the film's creatures are loud, frantic and reasonably fun, but the plot is a sloppy turd of Titan proportions -- a stinky, contrived, overblown mess brought to life in a maelstrom of not very convincing CGI.The script is absolutely terrible, and the majority of the film had me either scratching my head in confusion or laughing at its preposterousness. Kong being equipped with a metal fist is an undeniably cool idea, but the fact that the protagonists just happen to have such a device on hand in Hollow Earth is just crazy (especially one with built in anti-frostbite serum!). A vet who knows how to extract a Kong tooth also knows how to fly a Hollow Earth hover ship -- clearly a man of many talents. God only knows what the Iwi tribe were up to with their glowing pyramids. What was the deal with that glowing spike that nasty ape used to control the ice lizard? And why did everyone suddenly start floating around in Hollow Earth?

And in all that there's nowhere in the site possibility of simple 'just sit back and enjoy the rid'. What an insulting mess of corporate idiocy... That beautiful queen under the surface and some fights do save this experience, but the whole thing is not worth the effort at all...","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

Several Uber generic rehashed MCU jokes that weren't even funny. I love Godzilla and the monster verse started off great with Brian Cranston and that first Godzilla film but since then it's just slowly gotten worse imo.

A movie about Kaiju finding their way in the world with the established notion of coexisting with humans on this planet! Here, hollow earth is vastly explored with great visuals and Kong delivers an exceptional performance! The fight sequences are to the point and give great depth to the brutality of the situation on earth. As a kaiju fan I could not ask for anything more than to see monsters go at it and save the planet. Such as any other monster movie people go see. Godzilla is true to form and is his usual reign of terror to other kaiju. The human provide the skeleton of the story but the monsters carry it! I had so much fun with this movie! No need to go with the expectation of cinematic dialogue and epic depth.Just sit back, relax and watch monsters do their thing!","62 out of 114 found this helpful."

In fairness it picked up towards the end though.A signal coming from somewhere within the Hollow Earth causes Godzilla to begin to strengthen himself for an upcoming battle. Within Hollow Earth, Kong unwitting reveals a deeper level, that was previously sealed off and within that level are other giant apes, ruled over by a tyrannical king Skar. Kong challenges Skar but is wounded in a losing effort. Desperate he heads to the surface to convince Godzilla to join him in the battle.That all sounds pretty exciting I know, but its all belaboured by a relatively boring middle section, that we spend with the human characters, exploring the Hollow Earth. The humans themselves are actually pretty good. Dan Stevens is great in everything and he's having a lot of fun here. He has good chemistry with lifelong friend Rebecca Hall and with Bryan Tyree Henry, both of whom are reprising their roles from ""Godzilla vs. Kong"". Still though their voyage through Hollow Earth is lacking in peril, or excitement. (Whilst we're here, the ""Monarch"" TV series established that time moves much slower in Hollow Earth than it does on the outside world - a fact that this film ignores entirely.)It does, as you might imagine, pick up for a zero gravity multi-Titan battle that takes place leading into the films climax. From that moment on I was engaged with the film and enjoyed it through to the ending.I don't know how helpful it is to compare this with ""Godzilla Minus One"" as despite sharing the same character, they have very different objectives in the stories they tell. But I did feel this was inferior to the last Monsterverse film and I'm not sure where I'd take the series from here.","6 out of 11 found this helpful."

The film's narrative dives into the discovery of a new threat emerging from the Hollow Earth, prompting Godzilla and Kong to team up once more to defend the surface world.The story unfolds with a fast-paced urgency as ancient secrets are unearthed and new monstrous adversaries rise. While the plot is undeniably engaging, it occasionally feels rushed, lacking the depth and development that could have elevated the film from great to exceptional. Some story arcs could have benefitted from more screen time to fully flesh out the intriguing mythology that surrounds these legendary creatures.Despite this, the cast delivers stellar performances across the board. Rebecca Hall returns alongside Brian Tyree Henry and Kaylee Hottle ensuring that the human element of the story remains strong amidst the colossal battles. Dan Stevens also makes an appearance as Trapper, a pretty fun and interesting character.The true stars, however, are the VFX and SFX teams. The visual effects are nothing short of spectacular, bringing the titans and their world to life with breathtaking detail and realism. The sound design amplifies every roar and explosion, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding action. The sheer scale and spectacle of the monster battles are awe-inspiring, making every clash a visual feast.Overall Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire earns a solid 7/10 from me. The film boasts a fantastic cast and phenomenal VFX and SFX, ensuring a thrilling cinematic experience. While the story could have benefitted from more nuanced development, the movie's strengths more than make up for its shortcomings. Fans of the MonsterVerse will undoubtedly appreciate this latest adventure, and it sets the stage for even more exciting possibilities in future installments.","5 out of 10 found this helpful."

I thought the first 4 was mediocre and this was no different quality wise from it's predecessors.This film followed the footsteps of GvK and KOTM by trying to fix the problem of the previous installment but mess up on something else. The fight scenes in GvK were very dragged out so they tried to make it shorter, however any action sequence with Godzilla was just bland. Speaking of which, Godzilla legitimately felt like a regular old side character rather than a main character. Not to mention how he moves. I'm not kidding when I say Godzilla moves like he was crack. His movements were just so weird and unnatural. This was disappointing to me because I came here just because of Godzilla and seeing him get sidelined was just crushing.I can tell they tried to make this a great film. Because in the first act, they put in a bunch of separate action sequences in between scenes trying to entertain the audience but as I said, they were completely 1-sided extremely short fights that really doesn't entertain us. However the writers did come up with smart choices throughout the film and set up some of the twists well but the plot was so underwhelming. 2014 was the only MV film with a decent plot and it just went downhill from there. Don't even get me started with how they ended the film. ""You are my home"" like what does that mean? I know what the girl is trying to say but couldn't they figure out a better line?Speaking of which, this film has a lot of points that makes no sense from a logical perspective. Where does the hollow earth get light? How did the tribe end up down there without any advanced technology? How do they survive the high temperatures of inner parts of Earth? And the list goes on.However they did nail at one thing. Kong's plot and his action scenes were legit very fun and entertaining albeit I felt like they didn't know how to start the opening so it was just Kong chilling. Obviously I came to theaters to see Godzilla not Kong but I don't have much to complain about Kong. The team did think of creative ideas to get the fights going and so on. Even if it wasn't the best, The human plot was a significant improvement over previous installments and the final battle was entertainingRating: 6.3/10.","9 out of 22 found this helpful."

Over and over. I love monster movies and can enjoy dumb-fun action. I'm the exact target audience. How do they continue to fail? Aside from Godzilla (2014), they range from mediocre to terrible. And GxK is no different.I know most reviews will compare this to Godzilla Minus One. But I have to. Every single Godzilla shot from Minus One is better than every single shot of him in GxK. Every single action scene in Minus One is better than every single one in GxK. Better story, characters, dialogue, emotional investment. Everything. Minus One is better in every way.The worst thing I can say about GxK is... I was so bored. And I didn't care about anything that was happening. Zero investment. This is partly because it doesn't really have a story. Stuff just happens. Halfway through, I still didn't know what the story was about, what conflict we might be heading to, any kind of build up of a threat.They continue with another useless human plot, completely formulaic and bland. One of the only positives is a highly talented cast. They're just not given anything to work with. Rebecca Hall is the only one who gets to show her talent.Even worse is the 50+ comedic attempts. I laughed twice. The nearly sold out crowd laughed a few times. The rest made me cringe. They're like dad jokes. The entirety of the human story is basically a kids movie.What about the titans? They rarely show the scale of these monsters. Most of the time it's from the perspective of the monsters, not the humans. So they always look like they're 6 feet tall, with everything around just smaller.Even the movements are so fast like humans are fighting. When they fall, they fall in a second. No ground-shaking impact. It feels so fake and nowhere close to epic. I'm not anti-CGI, but the big action scenes are hectic gibberish.I give up. It shouldn't be this difficult. I don't even need it to be a ""good"" movie. Just entertaining with good action. Instead I get forgettable and dumb.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 3/28/2024)","129 out of 204 found this helpful."

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is an okay movie, but probably the weakest of the MonsterVerse movies so far. The movie would mostly rely onto the story of Kong that it has forgot to give a plot for Godzilla. The most we would see from Godzilla is that he travels and that's it, with not much new from him. That and just like in the other MonsterVerse movies, I really did not care for the human characters. I felt they haven't gotten a lot of character suitable for this movie. The only ones I see does try to put effort to the movie's purpose is Jia. However, it can be well enough to be an exciting monster film with awesome battle scenes that feature abilities for each monster that they have, along with great atmosphere for Hollow Earth. I'd say that it can be a good movie for Godzilla fans for the monster fights. But if you're expecting this to be something like Godzilla Minus One, I wouldn't set your expectations that high. It was not that bad as it is for a monster movie, but could've done a lot more.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

We open with the uneasy alliance between Godzilla and Kong, tasked with protecting humanity from lurking threats. However, whispers of a hidden danger soon tear this fragile peace apart, dragging our ape and atomic lizard into a clash for survival.The film's biggest strength lies in its breathtaking visuals. The battles between Godzilla and Kong are undeniably impressive. Director Adam Wingard stages these showdowns with a chaotic energy, taking us from the neon-drenched streets of Hong Kong to the gravity-defying caverns of Hollow Earth. The special effects are top-notch, with both titans rendered in stunning detail. Godzilla's atomic blasts illuminate the screen, while Kong swings through the air with a balletic grace that belies his immense size.Unfortunately, the impressive visuals can't mask the film's narrative shortcomings. The plot feels cobbled together, relying on tired tropes and predictable twists. The human characters, once again relegated to monster movie peanut gallery duty, are given little to work with. There's a valiant effort to establish a connection between Kong and a newfound ape companion in Hollow Earth, but it's underdeveloped and ultimately inconsequential. Meanwhile, bland dialogue and clichéd motivations make it hard to care about their fate.The pacing is another culprit. The film lurches between slow, exposition-heavy stretches and frenetic action sequences. The editing feels choppy at times, leaving some fight choreography confusing and hard to follow. The score by Tom Holkenborg (Junkie XL) is a mixed bag. While it boasts some pulse-pounding tracks during the fights, it lacks the thematic depth or memorable motifs that truly elevate a monster movie.Godzilla x Kong: The New Kong Empire feels like a missed opportunity. It evokes memories of classic monster brawls but fails to capture the spirit of what made them special. While Kaiju fans might find some enjoyment in the big-budget slugfests, the film ultimately disappoints with its forgettable story, underdeveloped characters, and uneven execution. If you're looking for a monster movie masterpiece, look elsewhere. This one's best left on Skull Island.","36 out of 53 found this helpful."

If you are interested in the creature concept and especially mega creature fights, you may think this movie is for you. You may want to watch the monsters that you were afraid of when you saw them on television when you were little, to experience the same feeling when you grow up, or you may want to take your children to the movie of the toys that they are most likely to buy on hamburger menus and show them this movie as the Transformers of the period. In any case, you would be wrong . We will explain how it happened in the next part of the article, with comments containing even a little spoiler.Let's go in order. First of all, we have an action movie in front of us. This movie does not contain horror elements like the Godzilla and King Kong films of the horror genre of the fifties, nor like 2005's King Kong with Jack Black or 2023's Japan-released Godzilla. It's not that the movie fails to be scary, it's that it doesn't even consider being scary. Godzilla and Kong, who are referred to as Titans instead of creatures, monsters, etc. In the movie, exist as mythological heroes throughout the movie.Contrary to horror, the film gives the impression that it is designed as an action movie that can be watched by the whole family. It contains very wild images for the young audience, especially with scenes of Kong hunting in his natural life and especially dismembering his prey. Although the green mucous fluid effect was used instead of blood in the scenes where Kong divides the giant jackals or the sea monster in half in order to reduce the apparent brutality, this eliminates the possibility of calling the film a children's movie.In a way, the movie follows the same formula as Transformers . Creatures from space or underground emerge, and some of them want to take over the Earth, while others fight against them on behalf of humanity. Here, Kong in particular seems like the good Autobots that it's probably easier to attribute human characteristics to a mammalian ape than to a cold-blooded lizard. The difference between Godzilla x Kong and Transformers is that everything from character structure to jokes is presented to the audience in a more filtered and simplified way. This situation, which causes too much simplification, leads to moments in the film that cannot be explained to anyone, such as the Bernie character being allowed to join the journey to the Hollow World.While there is an explanation in the story for the primary school-age character Jia's obligation to return to the Hollow Earth, there is no explanation for a civilian like Bernie endangering his life just because he wants to. Likewise, for Kong, who is expected to fight against the greatest danger ever on Earth, while putting on that mecha glove, which was previously shown in the poster and in every promotional material, on the hand of Kong, whose hand has ice burns; There is no answer to the question of why the rest of the mecha armor in question was not used. The audience is expected to say, ""Only one glove was made, and it probably fell on Kong's injured hand."" Although we will not list all of the open doors one by one here, there are plenty of examples similar to these two in the movie.The inconsistency is noticeable not only in the story but also in the visual language. Although very successful visual effects were used in the previous movie of the series, Godzilla vs. Kong , which was also shot by the same director , this movie is where almost everything except people is CGI; It contains visuals like an Atari game plugged into a tube television. The visual effects of the entire Hollow World are not pleasing to the eye, except for Godzilla, Kong, and Kong's other baby monkey, who look serious even though they lack fine detail. Especially the other dinosaur, which is capable of starting an ice age, appears with an animation quality that can only be seen in B movies shot by small film studios with the help of friends. Indeed, the film has a high ranking among the films released in 2024, but remains relatively small due to the brand it deals with and its goal of becoming a blockbuster; It has a budget of 125-130 million dollars. The visual problems do not end with the fact that the creatures look like poorly animated Pokemon: Like the creatures that come out of the Pokemon ball and pose, the creatures in this movie constantly need to get to high places and pose, but the sloppy editing and camera angles result in the axis being distorted.The film, whose action scenes and climax points are obviously rushed, instead of long action sequences; It looks like a collection of scenes taken from different movies, with short and excessive action scenes. In other words, it seems like the aim is to short videos to be shared on YouTube or social media instead of the integrity of the movie. The film, which resembles many works such as Avatar , Journey to the Center of the Earth , and God of War in many respects, cannot fully integrate what it takes from these works into its own visual world. The use of visual effects, which is the biggest expectation from this movie, fails to please the audience and send them home.It feels like Adam Wingard, who attracted attention with a horror movie like You're Next or the previous movie of this series, Godzilla vs Kong, did not have the opportunity to put what was on his mind on the screen this time. It seems that the series will continue after the Godzilla x Kong movie, which will be more enjoyable if you lower your expectations and go to the cinema to have an event. All we have to do is wait for the last movie of Planet of the Apes, which will be released a month from now .","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

If you want monster action, The New Empire has it in spades, and is easily the most beautiful of the four recent films. The Titans, every one of them, looks eye-wateringly outstanding, an absolute stand-out being Mothra, who remains as gorgeous as she was in King of the Monsters.Godzilla looks great, and his new colour palette is especially amazing, and though he gets top billing in the title, he is side-lined in his own film, in favour of Kong. Don't get me wrong, Kong is a good draw in this film, in his pursuit to hopefully find other giant apes in the Hollow Earth, a realm which is as epic as the monsters that reside there; it just would have been good to see more of our favourite lizard too.Though the effects will absolutely be the number one reason to see this film, the story, script and human characters are certainly not. The script is the most contrived, convenient mess this addition to the franchise has ever seen. Example, 'we need special item - lucky, it is right next to us, though we never mentioned it before until now because...reasons.'A massive thing missing from this monster movie is a heart. The first two films had Ken Watanabe's Serizawa, a sole believer in Godzilla and the titans, who fought for co-existence between monsters and humanity. The third entry had Millie Bobby Brown's Madison, who exhibited an undying faith in Godzilla when others did not. This film? Yeah, none of that.Rebecca Hall does her best as Dr. Andrews, and despite the occasional moment where she can flex her acting muscles (let's face it, she deserves better than this), she is normally used as an exposition tool, simply telling us the back-story and describing what will happen next. Think of the film this way - there is a big monster scene, then Dr. Andrews will explain why and what happens next - then there will be another monster scene - rinse and repeat.Bryan Henry and Dan Stevens share the role of comedic relief, though it is Ron Smyck as Harris who arguably had some of the best lines (and deserved more screen time). The film at times often feels like a comedy, more than an action feature, trying to squeeze in as many 'funny' lines as a Marvel film.The music is of course as on point as ever - a bombastic score that makes every set-piece that much more entertaining, but that's all this film has - it is the most beautiful and colourful the monsterverse has ever been - but it is shallower than any puddle you'll find.","30 out of 45 found this helpful."

The film focuses primarily on Kong, as Godzilla takes a back seat until the end of the movie. The main narrative is that a team led by Rebecca Hall and Dan Stevens embark on a journey to the ""Hollow Earth"" to decipher a mysterious signal. Meanwhile, Kong is on a journey to find more of his kind. The cast does well, despite playing somewhat generic characters. It is, however, very clear that the filmmakers' principal focus is the spectacle, and the story is just a vehicle for the epic fight scenes. The fight scenes are indeed epic, however, as the monstrous titans engage in multiple colossal battles throughout the film. I think the film may have tried to balance too many ideas, though, including the emotional story involving Rebecca Hall's character and her daughter. There was just not enough buildup of the human storyline to make the conclusion rewarding. All in all, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a fun popcorn movie, delivering spectacular action, and nothing more.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Now, don't get me wrong, because I have thoroughly and genuinely enjoyed the recent movies, by all means, but they were not really outstanding.And then director Adam Wingard brought ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" to the table. Holy Monster Bash, Batman, what a phenomenal surprise of a movie this turned out to be. I have to say that I was blown away by this movie, and I had not seen a movie of this magnitude making its appearance. I was fully and wholly entertained throughout the course of the 115 minutes that the movie ran for.The storyline in ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"", as written by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, Jeremy Slater and Adam Wingard, is pretty straightforward. But what works here, in comparison to the many previous newer Godzilla and/or King Kong movies, was that this movie was all amount Titans fighting one another, and the human storylines were mere backdrops. That worked so well for me, because the insane amount of action in terms of Titans fighting throughout the course of the movie, was amazing. And it made the movie work on such a great level for me. Seeing Godzilla and King Kong fighting, or either of them fighting other Titans, now that is why I sit down to watch movies such as this. And, oh boy, did director Adam Wingard deliver her.The acting performances in the movie are good, and I have to say that I wasn't really overly familiar with any of the actors or actresses on the cast list. Sure, I've seen some of them before, but am not all that familiar with their previous work. Kaylee Hottle (playing Kia) and Fala Chen (playing the Iwi Queen) definitely put on memorable performances with their characters.Something that is important for a monster bash movie such as ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" are special effects. And wow. I was beyond amazed here. The CGI in the movie is phenomenal, and it looks so great and realistic. And the sheer amount of mayhed and destruction throughout the course of the movie almost had me cheering in the cinema. This is definitely the most intense Kaiju movie (or Titans as they are called in this movie) I have ever seen. And that alone makes it more than well-worth sitting down to watch ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"".""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is how Kaiju (or Titan) movies are supposed to be. And this particular movie from director Adam Wingard was simply amazing. This is a movie that I strongly and warmly recommend you to go watch. Do it in the cinema, because the sounds of the Titans roaring and battling is so well-worth getting shook through from the cinema speakers. I loved that about the movie as well.I am a fan of this movie, no doubt about it. And when I walked out of the cinema, it was with a big 'wow, are you kidding me' feel. Because Adam Wingard's 2024 movie ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" was over-the-top and exactly how such a movie should be.My rating of ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" lands on a rock-solid nine out of ten stars.","52 out of 98 found this helpful."

It was innovative on one hand, but not over the top. The close-ups and medium shots were great.Editing and Pacing: Editing was commendable. Sometimes the pacing keeps me engaged, but then the narrative structure does not always keep up, with plot twists and character arcs that feel aimless or underdeveloped at times.Sound and Music: Sound and music play pivotal roles in setting the tone, with the electronic score punctuating the epic battles and quiet moments alike. However, the choice to abruptly cut music in some of the scenes detracts from the cohesion of the film's soundscape, leaving a disjointed impression that the rest of the soundtrack struggles to mend. In the second act, the soundtrack was very generic. It sounded similarly to what you can hear in typical superhero films with a ""heroic"" vibe. The whole second and third acts felt like a generic viewing experience.VFX: Visual effects are where the film shines brightest, crafting a world that is at once familiar and fantastically alien. The VFX was innovative and pushed the boundaries of the genre.CGI: The reliance on CGI is super heavy. On one hand, some CGI moments were great, but on the other hand, as the movie progressed, it became so much that I didn't want to watch it anymore because it looked generic. It feels like I am watching an animation film. Using too much CGI instead of real locations can sometimes break the immersive experience; the use of more authentic natural landscapes could benefit the film.Cast: The cast was incompetent. It often felt misplaced or unable to fully embody the larger-than-life characters they portray, which exacerbates this. In other words, it felt like I was watching actors from a 2012 parody movie.Costume Design: The character's costume design was terrible. They could have created unique costume designs for the characters, such as having the same for everyone while traveling.The movie's emotional and intellectual engagement was inconsistent. Mysticism and technology are both big ideas in the movie, but the story is both big, undeveloped, and hard to follow. I wish this film had more depth, meaningfulness and clarity. Also, Godzilla had less screen time, which is sad.In conclusion, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is a mixed bag. There is too much going on, and every detail (e.g., large, small or microscopic) is difficult to digest through visual storytelling. Individuals seeking a narrative with depth and coherence, not just smashing things, might feel it falls short in that aspect. Although the film has flaws, it showcases the progress in VFX.","24 out of 36 found this helpful."

The titanic clash between the two iconic monsters is undeniably entertaining, providing fans with the epic showdown they've been eagerly anticipating. However, despite its strengths, the film leaves some crucial questions unanswered, particularly regarding the concept of aging in the Hollow Earth as touched upon in the Monarch TV Season.Firstly, the movie excels in its action sequences. The battles between Godzilla and Kong are choreographed with precision, showcasing the immense power and unique abilities of each titan. The special effects are top-notch, bringing these legendary creatures to life in a way that is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. The sound design complements the visuals perfectly, making each roar and clash resonate with the audience.The human characters, often a weak point in kaiju films, are serviceable here. While their storylines can feel secondary to the monster action, the cast does a commendable job of keeping viewers engaged. The exploration of the Hollow Earth is particularly intriguing, offering a glimpse into a mysterious and vibrant world that adds depth to the MonsterVerse lore.However, the film stumbles when it comes to integrating the broader mythology established in the Monarch TV Season. One glaring issue is the concept of aging in the Hollow Earth. The TV series hinted at the unique temporal properties of this subterranean realm, suggesting that time might function differently there. This intriguing idea had the potential to add a fascinating layer to the story, but ""Godzilla x Kong"" fails to address it adequately.As the characters delve deeper into the Hollow Earth, one can't help but wonder: how does aging work in this environment? Are the creatures and ecosystems affected by time in the same way as those on the surface? The movie provides no clear answers, leaving fans of the franchise with lingering questions. This oversight feels like a missed opportunity to enrich the narrative and explore the implications of such a unique setting.In conclusion, ""Godzilla x Kong"" is a solid entry in the MonsterVerse that delivers where it counts: in the epic, monstrous mayhem. The visual spectacle and the sheer scale of the battles make it worth watching for fans of the genre. However, its failure to address the intriguing concept of aging in the Hollow Earth, as introduced in the Monarch TV Season, and its occasionally uneven pacing prevent it from reaching its full potential. With a bit more attention to detail and storytelling cohesion, this movie could have been a true titan of its genre.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

It's important to recognise that Godzilla x Kong is purely entertainment and special effects focused. At times, there are too many 'effects' and action-packed moments that movie is dragging us into - at the cost of some more interesting aspects, such as for example a bit more constructive interactions between the main characters, learning their stories, motive etc.There isn't time for that really, because this movie doesn't slow down and the time ends up passing rather fast.That's why you should not expect too demanding plot. It doesn't have too much depth, yet it manages to remain sensible enough to make a decent storyline that can be followed.

This movie is an emotional roller coaster, blending extremely exciting action with touching bonds and epic team ups.Suko, Kong's loyal companion who is like a son to him, steals a spotlight for me, he is so cute and shows his loyalty and affection towards Kong. Godzilla's and Kong's eventual team up is what we all wanted for so many years!!! For these two iconic titans to fight together against Skar King and one other formidable foe.The introduction of the main antagonist of the movie, Skar King is very interesting, I really like the concept of this antagonist as he will bring some emotions to the character as well which is very interesting for a titan to have such human like behavior, and also adds a whole new layer of excitement to the movie with later putting one of the best monster battles ever brought from a movie.But whats truly sets this movie apart is its heart. Amidst the chaos and destruction of the epic monster battles, there are moments of pure emotion between the titans and the humans, and what brings ""The New Empire"" is the new bonds that were made between the characters for me.This is by far the best addition to the Monsterverse yet, it has all that we asked for and its truly a masterpiece, thank you Legendary, This will probably be one of my favorite movies ever made!!!

From the weightless cgi looks to the boring dialogue and characters, the first act of Godzilla x Kong didn't do much for me. However, as the film progresses, it started to show off its bonkers ideas and charms one by one, and slowly & ultimately managed to win me over. This cinematic universe slowly drifted away from its dark, grounded, almost disaster-movie-like origins of godzilla 2014 as it went on, and after watching gxk you wouldn't believe they're even set within the same continuity. Gone are the rains, dust and night-time battles of king of the monsters or the vibrant, operatic cinematography larry fong achieved in skull island. In gxk, 90% of the battles are set in broad daylight, and the camera spins, cuts, and turns upside down (director adam wingard goes crazy in some shots) to maximize and display these battle of titans in a cartoon-like manner. You are basically being waterboarded with cgi spectacle, and that's not a bad thing! As someone who was turned off by the way godzilla ran in the first trailer, i kinda do miss the old aesthetic of the monsterverse, but i can't deny that what they achieved in gxk is helluva fun. I was basically cheering inside during the third act. They cut off all the bs (mostly) and solely focused on delivering a bonkers, digital, fantasy-like colosseum for the titans to punch and throw each other. Also notable is the role of kong as basically the protagonist of the movie. Contrary to godzilla, who gets less screentime and is treated more like a force of nature/beast he is, kong acts, feels, and emotes more like a human. There is an interesting contrast between kong's human-like and godzilla's animalistic behavior. Most of kong's scenes works as a dialogue-free fantasy action film about a lone warrior wandering this fantasy world and bonding with a child.Hollow earth where exotic creatures dwell, ancient hidden civilization in there, huge temples built with shining crystals, hidden lore of monsters, portals, giant monkey tyrant riding an ice dragon, anti-gravity action sequence, and historic landmarks being destroyed disaster-movie-style. You can not fully be on board with the new direction, but you can't deny its charm and fun.Also forgot to mention godzilla fighting an radioactive(?) sea dragon in the arctic. Think this maybe qualifies as a gonzo blockbuster.","10 out of 29 found this helpful."

If I'm honest, you come to this film for the sheer kaiju-smashing spectacle and not much else, because it doesn't have much else to offer. It starts with a lot of promise but takes itself too seriously and becomes tediously long and drawn out... also barely any Godzilla in this Godzilla movie. Dan Stevens and Brian Tyree Henry are desperately trying to make this one-dimensional material work. I thank them for their service as they were easily the most likeable part of the cast. Meanwhile, Adam Wingard's direction is nothing special and Junkie XL sounds like he fell asleep on his synthesisers half the time, ultimately leaving Godzilla × Kong feeling like the lesser parts of the Showa era, dumb fun with nothing much to cut your teeth into and not a lot worth giving a damn about.","14 out of 20 found this helpful."

This film is ridiculous and it knows it. It fully leans into the campiness and fun of the situation and thus the film is a fun time overall.The highlight is definitely Kong and his plot line. This film and Godzilla vs Kong have him be the main focus and the film does a good job with conveying his thoughts and feelings with little to no dialogue (sort of). His journey feels the most fleshed out and the villain is probably has the most personality of any monsterverse antagonist. In contrast, Godzilla gets very little other than going around killing monsters and helping out in the 3rd act.With the focus more squarely on the monsters, we get a lot more action and it's pretty good. The CGI is great and the action choreography is pretty good as well. The plot simply acts as a means to get from one fight to the other, with no attention for consistency or logic.Unfortunately, the major drag of this film, like many monsterverse films, are the humans. They all exist to spout exposition, state the obvious or intervene at a pivotal moment in the story. They have very little character and their arcs are pathetic. The only bright spot is Trapper, who feels like just the kind of character the monsterverse needs more of. Someone who sees everything ridiculous going on and seems to be enjoying every second of it.Overall, Godzilla X Kong is exactly what you thought it would be. Turn your brain off for 2 hours and simply bask in the ridiculous premise and the epic monster fights.","4 out of 9 found this helpful."

Movie Review -Adam Wingard's previous flick in the monsterverse, Godzilla Vs. Kong (2021), even defeated the pandemic, so you can imagine the growing popularity of this cinematic universe. With Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, this cinematic universe of monsters has gone to the next level. This is the most epic, most explosive, and most crowd-pleasing spectacle in the monsterverse or any monster flick since Godzilla (1998). Those days of Jurassic Park (1993) and Godzilla (1998) are gone. Those childhood memories can never be matched. But yes, these new generation monster flicks can create new memories for new-age kinds and provide big-screen entertainment to all kinds of audiences. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire does exactly that. It may still be a kid-level story as far as on-paper creative ideas are concerned, but the visual extravaganza is too powerful to notice its lukewarm storyline. It's not Godzilla vs. Kong, but it's Godzilla and Kong! I hope that takes your excitement to a whole new level.The film begins with the introduction of Kong, who is seen fighting some fox-like creatures in his den. The next scene has Godzilla's entry, who is sleeping inside a circle-like building. Godzilla's first fight is with a spider-like giant creature, and after that, he is seen sensing something and being attracted to it. Dr. Andrews (Rebecca Hall), her adopted daughter, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry), and Trapper (Dan Stevens) follow Kong through a mysterious Hollow Earth, where they discover a big threat. The untold origins of the Titans and Skull Island are set to destroy the Hollow Earth, and Kong and Godzilla must join forces to beat those powerful monsters.The story by Terry Rossio, Adam Wingard, and Simon Barrett is strictly for kids. Despite some techno-savvy and resourceful elements, the screenplay doesn't create any excitement for the upcoming events. However, it all becomes very interesting and fascinating because of the visual effects and the presentation. Cameron introduced us to the blue people's god ""Ewa"" in 2009, and here Godzilla Vs. Kong has an ""Ewi"" community, coincidentally in the blue theme only. Their God is yellowish, though. As mentioned above, it's not Godzilla vs. Kong, but Godzilla and Kong. Now, this one spoiler is allowed to set the mood right and hype you up a little more.It's like a monster version of ""RRR"" (2022). First, the two powerful and fearless heroes are against each other, but in the end, they must come together. In that film, Jr. NTR and Ram Charan were seen running through fire. Here, you'll see Kong and Godzilla making a whistle worthy entry through ice and fog. Not just that, but the next 15-20 minutes are packed with explosive and larger-than-life action spectacles with a lot of crowd-pleasing moments. In one scene, Kong is seen trying to save himself from Godzilla, but the very next scene has Kong carrying Godzilla's tail on his shoulder. Hell, that's some blockbuster monstrous stuff.The performances by Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Dan Stevens, Kaylee Hottle, Alex Ferns, and Fala Chen are expectedly decent. Brian Tyree Henry brings a few laughs here and there, whereas Kaylee Hottle walks away with many important scenes. The production value is extremely beautiful, and the VFX work makes it a proper large-scale spectacle. Forget the other action scenes of Kong and Godzilla; those last 20 minutes of the film are alone enough to make your tickets worth their money. You'll clap, scream, hoot, and jump out of joy at seeing what's happening on screen. Before the film, fans were divided into two teams: Kong and Godzilla. But after the film, they will celebrate it together. Ben Seresin's camerawork is fine, and Josh Schaeffer's editing keeps you on the edge of your seats for nearly two hours. Adam Wingard extends his monsterverse with additional characters like Skar King, Mini Kong, and Skimu. The franchise is not limited to just Kong and Godzilla now; there are more, and that's why this one's more entertaining, more audience-friendly, and more massy. Wingard makes sure that you have a great time at the movies. Go and enjoy this gigantic entertainer in cinemas near you. Godzilla and Kong fans are in for a treat.RATING - 6.5/10*","5 out of 13 found this helpful."

For some people, this might work - if you love some of that rock 'em sock 'em ""Transformers""-like large-scale action, you'll get what you came for...eventually. Otherwise, this was a gigantic waste of time; a silly, pointless, illogical, and soulless film that is missing everything that makes these iconic characters special. It was like watching a kid play with their Godzilla and Kong toys, there's no substance to it. I loved Gareth Edwards' 2014 Godzilla film, with its excellent visual style and sense of scale and tone. But this is no longer that (no disrespect meant to director Adam Wingard) - it's visually incoherent and lacks any sense of scale or weight. It's almost like it's become a cartoon of what it once was. And honestly, I think Godzilla Minus One broke the Monsterverse for me. I'm more interested in deeper stories that use these creatures in more intelligent ways. Godzilla x Kong is mostly fine but it's cinematic junk food and the epitome of empty calories. The novelty has worn off and the sense of gigantic scale is lost with too much time in hollow earth. Plus I'm just really not into the ""big monkey punches big lizard"" fights anymore. Some will love this, but it's just not for me. If you liked the first Godzilla vs Kong, then you'll for sure like this! A little too dumb and mindless with nothing else really going for it. Heck, Godzilla and Kong only appear intermittently in the first 90 mins, which is bogged down with boring human exposition before our titans even share the screen. When they do it's one of the most ridiculous, anti-climactic, generic team-ups imaginable. Nonetheless, it's hard not to be entertained watching giant monsters fight, and at least they do this well. As Rotten Tomatoes summarizes: ""Come to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire for the sheer monster-mashing spectacle - and stay for that too, because the movie doesn't have much else to offer.""","15 out of 22 found this helpful."

Plus a special classic Titan makes a comeback. Wew! Nonstop action and fun. My 12 year old son was rooting for G-man! My 16 son was only there for Kong. My wife loved Shimo. I, cheered for them all.

I'm not a faithful kaiju fan though I have seen enough info to at least know what the Showa Era style is. When this movie was announced I didn't think this is where they were going but I think they did pretty good for adapting that style to a modern big screen. Also it shouldn't have to be stated but there's no sense in comparing this to Minus One and that should not take away from either experience.I'm judging this movie based on the style they were aiming for. Though the Showa Era can span from somber to straight goofy we got the feeling they were going away from the somber end of things with this one. Me personally I'm still a much bigger fan of the 2014 tone but that's not to say I can't enjoy myself here.All that being said we finally got some human-free monster interaction and communication. It works very well for me too. I do like the humans as I think they're the key to perspective in these movies. I do think the humans need to tone down on the silliness a little bit though. Expect a joke attempt for most scenes containing them.I liked how the humans integrated into the conflict here it was pretty interesting and especially hearing the story of the Titans for what hasn't been explored in these movies yet. I just think some of the scenes don't hit as hard as they should since I was basically waiting for a punchline. I want humans, I just want them done in a certain way.These monsters have WAY more personality in this one. In GvK we had some mean mugging and attitude but here we have that and much more facial expression and emotion. Some of you may like it some of you may not I don't think there's any way to know other than seeing it.This story moves FAST. Too fast. That being said, I get it, there's also a TON of story to get through. I could've sat through another 30 minutes though. Honestly I would've taken an extra 30 minutes of fighting and 30 minutes of context. I have no problem with long movies so that's just me.The fights are what you come for. This is no Minus One and it doesn't need to be. The movie has an ""Infinity War"" feeling in my opinion at one point. The gripe I have is some fights needed to be much longer. I know Godzilla is the king and I love watching him win.. but I still need to feel like it's earned especially with the context in his part of the story. There are some crazy sequences in this one and I'm glad they simply said we're going this side of the Showa Era and we do not care. That being said it's not straight goofy but it is pretty creative and cool. I think they adapted that Era to the modern Era perfectly as far as fighting goes. I just needed them to last longer. ESPECIALLY THE FINAL BATTLE. I guess it's more of a 2 part final battle but that second part was much too quick for me.Still. If this sounds like what you're looking for, go see it. I even say this isn't my favorite but I had a hell of a time. This movie is not designed to be analyzed critically it is to be injected into your veins as kaiju juice. There are still some things holding it back from that type of movie being better but it's still worth it in my opinion.","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

The plot delves into King Kong's journey in Hollow Earth as he searches for others of his kind, only to discover a species with intentions to dominate Earth. Meanwhile, a Monarch agent cares for a young girl from Kong's island who shares a unique bond with the giant ape and believes he's in danger. Determined to help Kong, the agent leads a mission to Hollow Earth to uncover the truth and potentially save him.Directed by Adam Wingard (known for You're Next), the film features Rebecca Hall (from The Town), Brian Tyree Henry (from Bullet Train), Dan Stevens (from The Guest), and Kaylee Hottle (from Godzilla vs. Kong).Godzilla vs. Kong boasts an abundance of CGI, reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy or Jurassic Park, which surprisingly worked for me. The film successfully navigates the challenge of uniting Kong and Godzilla in a way that should meet expectations of fans of the monster universe. This picture is filled with exhilarating and visually stunning monster fights that are the highlight of the film. Godzilla's presence is particularly impressive, and Kong's battle upon arrival in Subterranean Earth is an epic standout moment. The evolution of the baby gorilla is fun to watch too. The film pays homage to historic Godzilla films with numerous Easter Eggs, while the storyline is adequate and essentially takes a backseat to the monster action. There are numerous sequences that only work because this is a monster universe movie and can't be taken seriously; however, the solid performances from Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens provide enjoyable comic relief to offset any overdone scenes. Additionally, the soundtrack is solid and the concluding battle elicited an applause from the audience (including my daughter).Overall, Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire is a well-executed American addition to the monster universe that warrants a viewing. I would rate it 6.5/10 and recommend giving it a watch.","5 out of 14 found this helpful."

Normally I dont write a review but wanted to add for this one so that people could get an opportunity to deprive themselves of the trauma lol

I've said it out loud once and it feels like they heard me. Though the New Empire does have a human story it goes by so quick as to not let too much time linger between the Kong /Godzilla scenes. It threw me off at first cause I was not expecting such a short movie but it was jam-packed with all the monster fighting you needed. Particularly with Kong being a bigger focus on this movie than the other. So much so in fact that you could say that he was that human story I was expecting in the film. The destruction was wicked, No matter what Godzilla's duty to protect this earth in the Monsterverse being created, this movie makes it obvious that we are nothing but insects to this dude. There was something truly horrifying about the Death and Destruction that this movie was showing. I don't think any Godzilla movie was as globe trodding as the New Empire allowing the King of Monsters to commit to some serious genocide defending the planet as a whole. It's a little disturbing and I loved it, but it's the only thing this movie shares with the far better-done Godzilla Minus One.Overall, it's the perfect movie experience.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

During his stay, he encounters more of his kind including a small red ape who starts out as hostile, but begins to trust Kong. However, with this discovery comes a new threat: Skar King, a tyrannical leader of apes who controls a titan with ice powers. Kong must get the help of his rival Godzilla in order to take on Skar King and his weapon. Kong is accompanied by Dr. Irene Andrews and her adoptive daughter Jia who is close to Kong, Bernie Hayes the conspiracy podcaster and newcomer Trapper who helped heal one of Kong's wounds.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire delivers exactly on what the trailers promised. I have heard that this movie puts the human characters to the side a bit and gives more spotlight to the monsters. While I think the humans got a little more screen time than I thought they would have, this movie definitely focuses on Kong and the civilization of apes he discovers. This movie is Kong's story and what I like a lot about this movie is how his scenes are handled with his expressions and actions. The relationship between Kong and Suko is the perfect example. We can see when Suko slowly begins to trust Kong as he shows the young ape kindness just from his eyes. These scenes do a great job with show and do not tell. This is definitely where Director Adam Wingard's passion for the source material comes into play. I can tell that Wingard set out to make a movie about the titans rather than the humans dealing with the titans. I really enjoyed the scenes where Kong is traveling through Hollow Earth and discovering the other apes. They are interesting, intense and fun especially the scenes with Kong and Suko.Skar King might be my favorite villain from the MonsterVerse. He has the most ominous presence I have seen from a villain in a while. Just the way he walks around his army, how he smirks at Kong, the way he controls Shimo and how he uses his awesome weapon makes him such a memorable bad guy. Shimo is pretty fun, but a bit more of a minion than I thought she would be. My only major complaint about this movie is that I really wish Godzilla got a little more screen-time. I understand that this Kong's movie and that Godzilla is more of a force of nature than a character, but I would have loved to see him either destroying more monsters or spending a little more time fighting alongside Kong.The action scenes are fantastic. This is a movie that is packed with action from nearly beginning to end. My favorite set piece is one that takes place in Hollow Earth that involves zero gravity. It is one thing to have kaijus battle it out, but it is another to have them fight from rock-to-rock. That whole fight is a joy to watch and it reminds me why I love seeing these kinds of films on the big screen. Another fight I like is Kong's first encounter with Suko and two other apes. Yes, it looks a bit goofy, but it is so entertaining to watch Kong use Suko as a weapon to smack the hostile apes. All of the fights are enjoyable to watch because they are shot expertly and they pack a punch.While I prefer the visual style of Kong: Skull Island and GvK to this, this movie is not without striking images and creative set designs. I love the use of purple in this movie particularly with Godzilla. He looks more powerful than ever. Some of the sets on Hollow Earth look really cool, especially the temple which fits Hollow Earth well. The special effects for the monsters look amazing as they are so expressive and lively, that it gives them more character. Their powers look great and their designs are very impressive. The scale is interesting here because the monsters are now in a world bigger than Earth making them seem a bit smaller than they are. I love the scene where they return to Earth to remind us their massive size. This is a great looking movie that shows how much fun Adam Wingard had directing this movie between the colorful visuals and the crazy fight scenes. The soundtrack is decent with a nice choice of song at the end and a solid musical score by Tom Holkenborg and Antonio Di lorio.I think the human story is okay, but not particularly inspired. The cast do a great job, especially Kaylee Hottle as Jia who is wonderful in this movie. Hottle is a deaf actress and she does a fantastic job expressing herself especially with her interactions with Kong and with her adoptive mother. She is the heart and soul to both this and GvK. Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens look like they are having the time of their lives here and Rebecca Hall gives a very committed performance as Dr. Irene Andrews. The actors are definitely game and they are fun to watch. My problem is that they are kind of just here along with Kong for the ride. Jia is the only character who has a major role in the story.The tone of the movie is very goofy with plenty humor that mostly landed with me and a lot of scenes that make little sense. There is a scene where one of the humans gets eaten by a plant out of nowhere and it is not brought up again after that scene. This feels like watching a Saturday morning cartoon more than any of the other MonsterVerse films. It works for this film because of all of the MonsterVerse movies, it has the most absurd story. This is an adventure into a brand new world that comes up with an excuse to bring Kong and Godzilla on the same side. This is a movie that knows what it is and it does not hold back on the cheesy plot and the bombastic action scenes.I have a lot more to say about Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. However, I would have to get into spoilers at that point so I will just say this. I had a great time with Godzilla x Kong. I got exactly what I wanted from the movie. This movie has some amazing action scenes and goofy moments that make it more enjoyable to watch, but it also has a lot of heart. This is a movie where I can tell that every person involved in the production had a blast making this movie. Now, I am excited to see what new direction the MonsterVerse will take after this.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

Going ape (full pun intended) in Hong Kong on his previous outing was a step in the right direction. He's no longer seen as the all-benevolent protector of mankind, and he's more than happy to demonstrate that he'll gladly splat humans in planes and warships like bugs if it suits his purposes.When you imagine giant monsters stomping across the landscape, you don't picture overly irritating sidekick characters dropping unfunny one-liners and cracking unfunny jokes. Enough with the tiresome ""comic relief"" trope. No more Bernie, no more Trapper, no more obese Madison sidekick.I've had my fair share of kaiju dreams, and I remember all of them being scary as hell. I'd wake up with my heart pounding away like a piston. There was nothing remotely funny about them. What they were: terrifyingly awesome. And I loved every second of them.Boring family subplot & dense dialogue aside, Godzilla Minus One knew the score. They are not cute plushies that you cuddle with in bed, they are Monsters.

But didn't spent anytime in developing the script, sets or the CGI.The movie seems to tick all the checkboxes, in terms of DIE. We have a teenage lead, who is mute, and shown to be from some ancient tribe, who is supposed to be chosen to help win this war. Appropriately, called *wisdom girl* in one of the reviews, has only one expression of inquisitiveness throughout the movie, never being able to quite justify why she was the chosen on. To complete the ensemble we have female lead, a pilot who is killed off immediately to show his arrogance and high handedness, a sort of youtuber and a vet. If only, Hollywood concentrated on character building and storylines, then solely focusing on diversity angle while making the movie.In this movie, we explore the *hollow earth* which is supposed to be a world of its own deep beneath the surface of the earth. While the concept sounds exciting, as some scriptures also mention existence of such world, in the movie, *hollow earth* is another name for pandora, or rather poorly rendered pandora. Despite being deep inside earth surface, the creatures, the habitat, even trees and waterfalls grow the same way as they would on surface of earth exposed to all the sunlight. At one moment, we see some sort of bright disc like sun, without any explaination.Might be the creators themselves, realized the mess they have created, so they decided to start he trailer with clips of the movie prequel which is never a good sign. To overcompensate, there is a saturation of chest thumping and shaking noises throughout the fight scenes.May be children might find this movie fascinating, because of colors and concept of hollow earth, but there doesn't seem to be any other redeeming factor in the movie.","11 out of 17 found this helpful."

Whilst watching Kong a strange signal comes from middle earth and a team of people decide to go down and see what's causing this signal. And they find out that the signal is a distress signal, but what is calling for help and why are they calling for help?Whilst the team of people is exploring middle earth to find out what this signal is the world looks amazing, especially in 3D. And there are some fight scenes between Kong and other monsters and we also see glimpses of Godzilla fighting monsters as well, but I felt like some of these fights were cut short.One of the humans that's exploring middle earth is called Trapper (Dan Stevens) and the jokes he cracks are good. Trapper is also a vet who helps Kong with his arm after it gets injured in a fight with a monster and he helps by giving him this robotic arm. Again gadgets like these are something I would have liked to have seen more of.Even though I thought some of the fight scenes were cut short I did enjoy the monster battle at the end, but one of the monsters in this final fight is Mothra and I would have liked to have seen her do more.

Hopefully they do not intend on going this way. I like more dark humour and action in this kind of film. Especially in the earlier movies. They were alot darker.

King Kong was awesome. This might be my favorite portrayal of Kong on the big screen. I've never thought him interesting but he actually was awesome in this film.The human characters were on screen just long enough to care about but short enough not to get annoyed by them. In Godzilla vs Kong the human characters scenes went on for way to long.The giant monsters were actually pretty funny. At one point King throws a rock at a monster that is trying to runaway. Also Godzilla takes a nap if a pretty iconic location.The Bad:
Didn't really feel like the giant monsters were a real threat especially once the inevitable team up between the two title characters happened.Overall the film was solid and works best on a big movie theatre screen. Overall It was better then Transformers 2-5 , Pacific Rim Uprising, Godzilla vs Kong. I would say it aligns with my score for Transformers Rise of the Beast and Pacific Rim.","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

This was definitely the worst movie I've seen in a while.I am still giving this a 5 because I liked the journey of Kong through the Hollow Earth and his fight with SkarKing but everything else was terrible, to say the least. The stakes were lacking and the CGI was mid.Overall, a total waste of MONEY! Better go see Dune: Part 2 if you haven't.","6 out of 8 found this helpful."

Seeing this at the cinema was a great ride. Not perfect movie in any form or way, but having a few beers and watching big huge monsters fight is something special.The negatives are that the CGi is not always perfect, but it does not matter too much. Another thing is that the first team going down under seem inadequate. Not really the people (at least not alone) you should send on this type of mission. The third thing is that things get a bit too much. The characters are over the top, the dentist dude is way over the top, the action is over the top. We do not only have big freaking monsters fighting, we have an ice monster aiming to bring in a new ice age, we have some alien things, weird anti gravity technology, and humans just happen to have a big freaking mechanical arm ready for Kong - which of course is a perfect fit. It all culminate in a enormous fight on Earth's surface which is also over the top.Extremely entertaining, but otherwise kinda meh. Still the best of the franchise so far and it is hard to really complain.This is not an intellectual movie, and will never win any awards, but whooooooo cares. You wanted a huge monster movie with big monsters fighting, and that is what you get.8/10 for this type of movie, but a lower score otherwise. Also a must see in the theatre - the sound design is amazing.","20 out of 40 found this helpful."

The major problem is when it comes to the humans. Unlike past installments where the films are 100% serious this film starts to slide into Jurassic World and MCU territory becoming more comedy. They introduce a wannabe Chris Pratt-type character named Trapper to be an unnecessary future sequel love interest for female character Ilene Andrews. His biggest negative is that he gives the movie a cheap excuse to force in classic rock music into scenes where they don't belong. Nobody wants to hear Kiss play ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"" during a kaiju battle. Get that crap outta here! I had to remove 1 star because of this and there being no Godzilla theme.","4 out of 13 found this helpful."

They are easy films to follow with amazing affects and are very funny so I expected the same with G x K. We excitedly ran to our local cinema to watch it and were blown away.The story is so nonsensical and dumb that it was hilarious to follow. The CGI was incredible despite having the lowest budget of any of these films for whatever reason. I honestly forgot CGI could be good due to Marvel constantly shoving bad effects down my throat.The human cast, while still not great were much better than last time. My only real complaint is that Godzilla is once again shafted hard in this film despite his name being the first word in the title. It isn't as bad as G vs K where he only appeared twice an hour apart from each other though.The battles were amazing and very well choreographed which made for a insane final act.If you like fun movies I'd watch this with a friend.I give Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire a 7 out of 10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful."

Since when kong goes to the dentist ? There were parts of the movie that they made it a comedy. That is not good. This is a godzilla and kong film. It's not a crap dc pase IV universe movie to make fun with.The best part of the movie was the final battle but a large portion of the film was boring. At least they could include more monsters but they were more about apes. This was more a kong movie and godzilla was a guest star or something. They even presented mothra in a different way like we used to know her from the toho films and where was rodan ?So i give this a C- and that only for the great indeed cgi battle effects.","18 out of 31 found this helpful."

It's an action adventure movie with, as one would expect, not much sophistication or twist on the story front. It manages to be interesting enough throughout though, and it's simplicity is never silly nor is its unfolding overly predictable. The visuals are the main strong point of the movie, with Kong's ever existing hybrid charisma also lefting things up and introducing hero dimension into the mix. I felt some of the monsters were not as exciting as I would've hoped for them to be (respect, King Ghidorah,) and neither were many of the characters involved in this adventure. One thing I'd like to point out here is that I felt watching this movie in 2D did harm to the experience, as I (strongly) felt that that kind of visuals needs to be watched in 3D in order to do it justice; I don't even know if it does play in 3D, but if it does, then go for the 3D version.

The story, though straightforward and silly at times, isn't terrible-it's simple and serves its purpose well. While the CGI was good for the most part, there were some corny moments.

It's like a Saturday morning cartoon where the action is incredibly unbelievable, but still a bunch of fun to watch.Oh...and there's humans around (Rebecca Hall and Brian Tyree Henry from the first film) who stand around spouting mostly dialogue that is intended to clarify the plot points - and the stakes.

However, I did appreciate the impressive action sequences and visual effects. Kong's character development was a highlight, with the story revolving around him.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is now in theatres and it's probably the most fun, bombastic, silly (as well as dumb) movie in this whole Monsterverse to date. When this franchise began in 2014 with Godzilla and then Kong: Skull Island shortly after, I never expected we would end up with a movie like this one. Look, this movie was made for people who want to see giant monsters fight each other, so if that's all you need from this, it delivers. Here's why this big, dumb movie gave me an awesome experience.Picking up after the events of Godzilla vs. Kong, the majority of this movie takes place down in hollow earth. Still unravelling secrets about Skull Island, a group of new and old cast members journey into the depths of hollow earth, making discoveries about ancestors and possible, current civilization. This continues throughout the movie as Kong discovers a leader of apes, Scar King. This leads to Kong needing the help of Godzilla, who has spent the entire movie charging up at random nuclear locations around the world. Yes, the overall plot is that silly and all over the place, but it all builds up to a 20-30-minute battle sequence that was just pure fun.I will say, as expected, the human story is thin, but I really didn't care, and that's because of Dan Stevens' performance. He knew the movie he was in and he was just having a blast with his character. He livened up the movie when the monsters weren't there (which is also not very often this time around). A nice story continues from the previous instalment about Ilene (Rebecca Hall) and her newfound daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle). But, Kong with a giant robotic glove, Godzilla being the most powerful he has ever been, zero gravity action scenes, and surprise monsters all clashing together just made me smile. If you're looking for something deep, look elsewhere.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire may have been exactly the movie I was searching for at the time, but I can't deny that it worked for me. The movie's premise is honestly just a bunch of nonsense to build up to awesome action, and that was clearly director Adam Wingard's plan from the beginning. This is a movie built specifically for fans of giant monsters and for that, I have to give it up for it delivering that. Will there be a dumber big-budget movie this year? Probably not, but this is an example of dumb done amazingly well. If this review sells you on seeing it, then I absolutely recommend it.","3 out of 9 found this helpful."

Every scene cuts within 5 seconds, even if it doesn't require it, just to try and hold attention. Every meaningless plot point is summarized by a zany side character for easy comprehension. And worst of all - they personified all the monsters to make them relatable.What was previously the only redeeming feature of the sequels (gaint monster fights) has been ruined in the last two films by basically making Kong a human. He's not a giant wild ape any more. He makes traps, he slings his axe over his shoulder and he takes a shower like he's had a bad day at the office. You know you've reached the bottom of the barrel when you're only way to get an audience to side with your monster protagonist is to make him all but human.Hillbilly Kong x Misunderstood Ice Godzilla x Transformer Kong x Purple Godzilla x Giant Ewok is the probably the dumbest film I've seen in the last five years.

"10","/10","Fun, Exhilarating and underrated Storytelling!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9706410/?ref_=tt_urv","unknowman-19320","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur159841591/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2024","Godzilla and Kong stand as two colossal icons in the realm of cinema, and their monumental 2021 film was hailed as a savior of theaters globally, injecting much-needed energy with its epic monster battles and departure from the trend of weighty, serious narratives. Fresh from experiencing its latest installment on IMAX, I'm eager to share my comprehensive thoughts on the film.In essence, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire left me spellbound. It delivered a plethora of captivating action sequences, each imbued with excellent camera work and jaw-dropping CGI/visual effects that seamlessly brought the titans to life. However, it was Kong who truly stole the spotlight as the film's central protagonist. His journey was nothing short of amazing, drawing viewers into his world with expressive emotion and mannerisms that transcended dialogue, making the visual storytelling an absolute delight. From heartwarming interactions with fellow titans like Suko to intense confrontations with formidable foes like Skar King, Kong's character arc was a rollercoaster of emotions, culminating in a satisfying resolution that showcased his growth and resilience.The film's action sequences were not merely excellent; they were downright exhilarating. Each fight scene was meticulously choreographed, utilizing established franchise elements with creative flair. From gravity-defying showdowns to pulse-pounding battles in the heart of bustling cities, every moment was etched into the audience's memory, building towards an electrifying climax that left viewers on the edge of their seats. What truly set this film apart was its homage to the Showa Era, seamlessly blending the franchise's trademark goofiness with modern sensibilities, eliciting cheers and applause from the audience at every turn.One of the film's most commendable aspects was its masterful pacing and intricate plotting. With three intertwining storylines - Kong's Journey, the Human Plot, and the Godzilla Subplot - the film kept viewers engaged from start to finish. Kong's narrative arc was undeniably the standout, but the human plot, while not groundbreaking, showed marked improvement over previous Monsterverse projects. Characters like Jia and Trapper added depth and dimension to the story, while the Godzilla subplot provided a constant undercurrent of tension and anticipation, building towards a climactic showdown that was as epic as it was satisfying.Furthermore, the film boasted a memorable villain whose presence loomed large over every scene. Cruel, menacing, and eerily captivating, the antagonist served as the perfect foil to our heroic protagonists, driving the narrative forward with each nefarious scheme and dastardly deed. The film's worldbuilding was equally impressive, offering tantalizing glimpses into a rich and expansive universe teeming with lore and intrigue.Despite some criticisms online, particularly regarding Godzilla's screen time, I found such complaints to be unfounded. While Kong may have dominated the narrative, Godzilla's presence was felt in every frame, his looming shadow serving as a constant reminder of the impending clash between titans. Moreover, to dismiss the film as mere ""dumb fun"" would be a disservice to its rich storytelling and nuanced character development. From Kong's emotional journey to the human characters' personal struggles and triumphs, the film offered a depth and complexity that transcended its action-packed exterior.In conclusion, Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire is more than just a blockbuster spectacle; it's a triumph of storytelling and visual artistry that pays homage to its iconic predecessors while blazing a trail of its own. With its unforgettable characters, breathtaking action sequences, and heart-pounding suspense, this film is a testament to the enduring power of cinema and a worthy addition to the pantheon of monster classics.","11 out of 21 found this helpful."

Has a bit of a hard time, bless him.The movie works and is just on the right side of sentimental.The humans are good too, delivering the expected comedy turns, annoyance and arrogance where required.More words to meet the silly character limit.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

You've got to remember this is a monster movie. People want to see monsters fighting, and you get those scenes in spades. The human storyline is secondary.Overall, this is a big silly fun movie that checks all the boxes for monster mash ups.

Fans who are going to see this movie are going to see this movie usually because of the Showa era influence that the director Adam Wingard was going for with the flavor, and he did just that with this film in a more modern way.I knew what I was in for when I saw the preview and having seen Godzilla vs. Kong I had a good idea the direction that this movie was going. The preview built up a lot of anticipation and I learned nothing was exactly as perceived from seeing the great looking interesting and action packed previews.This movie is the movie I've been the most excited about seeing this year being a major Godzilla fan and I am pretty easy to please when it comes to these movies, and not the most critical of these kind of films. I am going to mainly focus on what I loved about it with out giving anything away that the previews didn't.First off is how colorful the movie is and the theme of it being similar to 80's movies which there will be times where the great songs reflect that aspect of it. I really loved what they did with the music I had to go ahead and say. The hollow earth truly is a breathe taking world that reminds me of Pandora from Avatar and also similar to Indiana Jones with in it.The movie is far more about the monsters than it is the humans compared to the previous movies and the human characters are more so used to speak for the monsters story where about midway through I enjoyed one of their roles the most in telling the monsters backstory, but I will have to say if this movie even was just the monsters I'd probably still be happy. The human characters however prove to have their place eventually to set the plot into motion, such as Gia who ends up playing a really important role.The monsters truly are characters and have much personality who come with some humorous moments. Kong is like a Cowboy in a way and almost feels like Clint Eastwood to me. Skar King who is the orangutan villain you see in the preview really comes across as kind of an western villain with his attitude and mannerisms. Adam Wingard even said in the commentary from the previous movie that he saw Kong similar to a western character like Clint Eastwood that I thought was great inspiration to incorporate with Kong and Skar King in this movie.The battles are what most people will be raving about and are a blast to watch go down in this movie and we're talking battles that have never been seen in a Godzilla movie before with much inspiration from wrestling and will please those kids at heart who enjoyed their Saturday morning cartoons. Again, we're talking Showa era inspired here.I felt by the end the movie had much heart and I actually found it surprisingly, moving enough. It truly is a epic blockbuster to me, but one common complaint is how viewers would have liked to see more action and I for one wouldn't have minded that. I mean a good movie will have you asking for more and maybe that being the case is valid.This movie is more Kong's story than anyone else with his human counterpart Gia mirroring his journey. Another common complaint is how people would have liked to see more of Godzilla, but with what you get to see with Godzilla left me satisfied enough, and room for what could come in another movie more focused on Godzilla, and potentially one last one from Adam Wingard that I would love to see from him.I was real happy that I saw the movie in IMAX and would highly recommend it for families, as the kids will absolutely love this movie more than likely. It was what was so great about the Showa era movies. It's a great popcorn and soda movie that brings non-stop action with amusement and does have purpose one should understand by the end who gives it some more thought.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

A lot it would seem, most of it needing no justification whatsoever.Unlike the previous film which concentrated on a few ""Stranger Things"" scenarios this one brings back plenty of Titans battling other titans and a few we've never met till now.(No spoilers here, just watch the trailer)It's been 3 years since ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" and in the meantime we've been forced to endure the TV series ""Monarch: Legacy of Monsters"", which was light on scary monsters and heavy on super creeps.Our old favourite nuclear fusion Titan ""Godzilla"" has a new design with purple/pink-colored plates similar to ""Godzilla Millennium"".Godzilla's atomic breath is now on volume eleven after a fight with another Titan that looked a hell of a lot like the one Kong fights in an earlier scene and both are aquatic, one fresh water, the other saltwater.In the new list of Titans is a mini Kong named ""Suko"" and he's a nasty piece of work initially, but learns to love the King like audiences have since the 1930's.In Japanese, it roughly translates to, ""Essential Child."" While Suko is also a Filipino word for ""surrender.""
Go figure?Meanwhile nice Kong is ageing well...growing out his beard and letting his hair down like a millennial hipster.By the time the next Kong comes out he'll have a man bun and be looking for love on MAFS.The release of ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" marks 10 years since this Godzilla universe hit the silver screen and it's also the 70th anniversary of the entire franchise.Even I wasn't alive when this cinematic adventure started.I find the problem with both Godzilla and King Kong in this era is they aren't the same terrifying monsters I grew up watching.Last years Japanese ""Godzilla Minus One"" restored the post WW2 terror narrative, but it's been lost again in the latest Hollywood blockbuster which has turned them into cuddly toys.Still the many Titans (not the Gold Coast NRL team) fight scenes are epic and the carnage they cause makes the structural damage from all the Marvel movies seem like petty cash.Poor Spider-Man and the Avengers have nothing to worry about compared to what happens in London, Rome & Rio, South America.For a moment there it was starting to sound like a David Bowie/Mick Jagger song about dancing in the street.Watch out for: The B. E. A. S. T. Or Bio Enhanced Antatomech Seismic Thunder.Fun Fact: The third Monsterverse film featuring Kong that filmed on the Gold Coast, in Australia, following ""Kong: Skull Island"" and ""Godzilla vs. Kong"".This is the first MonsterVerse film to be shot in IMAX and it looks and sounds amazing!Unfortunately the visual fx budget must have run low for some scenes that look like carry overs from 50's monster films while others are out of this world in detail.Monarch are back giving giant corporations a bad name in a universe that's ever expanding with more monsters and less human stories, so what's not to like about that.""The New Empire"" will be box office number one over the Easter School Holidays with director Adam Wingard proving a good choice to bring back on board this franchise for another 2 hours of terrific Titans.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

I don't think they're that deep or particularly memorable but they are likeable. They have genuinely good chemistry and even if I felt the film could've taken itself a bit more seriously at points, I still found it a lot funnier than it had any right to be. There's also significantly less of them compared to King of The Monsters and Godzilla Vs. Kong and it does wonders for the pacing.Since they're not trying to balance so many characters and subplots it makes the whole thing feel much more streamlined and I can honestly say I was never bored, which was not my experience with the last films. It's very fast paced but more importantly it always felt like there was something important happening. Don't get me wrong it's no masterpiece of writing, the dialogue is still bland and the story non-existent but for what I needed from this film it hit just the right sweet spot.I also loved the fact that there were whole sections devoted exclusively to Kong. In past instalments this time probably would've gone to boring human characters but this is much more along the line of what I want to see. The kills are brutal, the action's fun and even if it devolves a bit too much into CGI noise in the 3rd act I still thought it was fun with some actual sense of scale.After very little anticipation from me in a long stretch of these movies that I haven't really enjoyed this was quite a pleasant surprise. It's not immune to all this series flaws but it's been more than refined enough to create for an enjoyable experience. It's no Minus One but it's a lot more fun than I ever would've expected.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

One second Godzilla is here and now he's here. Kong is doing something important to the story, blink, oh he's done now even though it seems like it should've taken longer. Some of the sound seemed washed out. For example Godzilla's roar just didn't feel loud or intimidating but that could've just been the sound system in the theater I was at.

The movies have been amazing or anything but they have been thoroughly entertaining. After Godzilla vs Kong, we are getting a team-up movie with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Does this continue to be entertaining, or is this finally the entry that bores you?You came to this movie for big monsters fighting and in this aspect, the movie succeeds. There are a great many fight scenes in this movie, especially with Kong. I love the way Kong fights and how you can clearly see how he is strategizing and planning compared to Godzilla's ferocious animalistic style. They also created a new villain for Kong with ""The Scar King"". I love the design of him and his more agile style of fighting. The movie builds up to an epic 3rd act brawl and it is insanely entertaining and worth watching for it alone.The CGI is pretty good considering that this is the cheapest MonsterVerse movie so far. Hollow Earth looks great and Kong looks phenomenal. Godzilla has a new pink design for story reasons and it looks fine. There are some visually great-looking shots by returning cinematographer, Ben Seresin, that capture the mystical nature of Hollow Earth and the Titans. Kong is the main lead in this film and he is the stand-out star. There are many scenes with just Kong and other apes that go on for 10 minutes long with no dialogue or humans and they work so well. Just through Kong's facial expression and body language, you can perfectly understand the emotion and the story that is being conveyed. It is impressive. In terms of human characters, Trapper played by Dan Stevens is a fun newcomer. He has excellent chemistry with returning character Bernie played by Brian Tyree Henry.Unfortunately, the story concerning the human characters is still incredibly dumb. There are many questionable and stupid things such as why they only brought one armed soldier for a mission or why even a conspiracy podcaster is even involved in the mission. The human characters are still not interesting or engaging enough to care about. They tried to incorporate the mother-and-daughter relationship plot element again with returning characters Dr. Ilene (Rebecca Hall) and Jia (Kaylee Hottle) but it doesn't work well because they don't explore it enough. For the most part, Ilene is again the exposition character. It's a shame as Godzilla Minus One shows that you can do big monsters and engaging human characters in a movie.The pacing drops off significantly around the second act where it just has a bunch of humans talking and exposition dumps. Additionally, Godzilla is barely in this movie despite being the first in the title. Every fight scene concerning Godzilla barely lasts a minute in the first 2 acts. It is understandable to show how powerful Godzilla is but it would have been nice to see the fights last a bit longer. On that note, while the fights are indeed entertaining, they are not as well choreographed as the ones in Godzilla vs Kong. Junkie XL returns to score the music for this movie but it definitely lacks the impact that Junkie usually does. The music score is a bit forgettable.Overall, I came to see giant monsters fight and I got exactly that. This feels like a very high-budget B movie and honestly, that is completely fine. Godzilla x Kong is another entertaining movie in the MonsterVerse and I hope more is made in this cinematic universe. The possibilities are endless!","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

Not a great deal more, but it was a fun watch.Both movies basically switched back and forth between three storylines. The big difference for me was that all three storylines in this film held my attention, while only one of them did in the 2021 film. One of the storylines in the former film I didn't care for was the one involving the two annoying kids trying to figure out what was going on, along with an unfunny comic relief podcaster. Fortunately, the kids didn't appear in the new film, and although.""Bernie Hayes"" did, he was a bit more tolerable here. But it's still obvious that he's there just for the comic relief.Although not Citizen Kane, the film did manage to bring together the three storylines satisfactorily, with the typical monster all-monster-battle conclusion. And, as a bonus, a ""guest star"" monster from Godzilla's past made an appearance.Overall, the film was two hours of entertaining brain candy. Like the 2021 film, the special effects were great. And the monsters more entertaining than the actors. As long as you approach it that way, you should enjoy it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

But I got a friend who is, and the trailer does manage to elicit enough curiously within me to go out of my way to see it, so how was it?. Well, that feels like déjà vu, does it not?. Didn't the 2019 Godzilla installment get me to contort my body in all types of ways and yawn up watery eyes thanks to sheer boredom?, well, suffice it to say, it's happening again for a second time. Despite that, I'm willing to give this one the benefit of the doubt as my stomach is rendered uneasy thanks to certain things I've been consuming recently, which also affected my whole body, (seriously, I just feel fatigable the whole day, what's that all about?), as opposed to how I felt watching King of the Monsters almost half a decade ago with my aforementioned best friend who's a Monsterverse aficionado, while being fit as a fiddle. In other words, yes, it's a bit better but not by much. And the reason this movie manages to earn slightly more meritorious qualities is two words, Kaylee Hottle, yes, the taciturn superstar that stole the show once again, she did it on the previous Godzilla film and she did it again here. Seriously, there aren't enough levels of verbosity that can do justice to an encomium that she so ever deserves since her primordial appearance in the franchise two years ago. Her performances are stellar as she plays an intrinsic role to the film which renders her preeminent while everyone else is concomitant, thank you, Adam Wingard, not to mention she's also responsible for some of the more tear-jerking moments in the film which correlates with sentiments of not fitting in, letting go, and undying love for one another. And yes, the whole thing about her not making friends, grades in a state of dégringolade and being an outcast at school is all too relatable, feels like they're calling me out, the only difference is, she's deaf and I'm not, so stop complaining, you inutile piece of.... But anyways, I feel like I gave a fair amount of conferment towards the star of the show already, let's move on to the rest of the cast, shall we?. Now, while they're not bad, they're nothing great either, they're just generic mediocre figures that are so heavily outshined by Jia's character, that if she wasn't here?, this would fare worse than King of the Monsters for me. The supposed ""comic reliefs"", Trapper and Bernie, the easygoing immature vet and a fraidy influencer who wants to prove to people he saved the world once, are not funny nor are they obnoxiously bad, they just don't really do all that much for me. And as for Jia's mom, Ilene Andrews, her presence is only accentuated by Jia's presence for being her cornerstone, which I will commend her for, but aside from that?, she's just as lukewarm as the other two present here. But of course, the price of admission is paid to witness gargantuan mindless monsters beat the crap out of each other while roaring at the top of their huge lungs every 5 minutes or so. And yes, while we do get an abundance of that, it's not something I particularly find to be all that interesting to be honest, overgrown ugly simians (the word rhymes with ""hideous"" for a reason) too dumb to know anything else beyond collateral damage running rampant against each other is a lot more lackluster than I initially thought it would be. Of course, what elevates them from just being soulless primal smackdowns are the subtle themes of survival, respect and teamwork, in order to avoid spoilers, I'm not going to fully expound what took place, only that I find the action sequences, despite being well made thanks to boasting state-of-the-art special effects and adept CGI workers, to be discernibly laborious when compared to scenes with Jia in it, I'm sorry. And I'm watching this in an Onyx cinema hall where the seats vibrate and stuff, that's saying something. Yeah, all in all, it's a decent film, I do think the previous installment hit slightly harder thanks to fairly compelling villains abusing the power of science and intelligence and action sequences that's considerably better thanks to its more sci-fi elements, courtesy of Mechagodzilla. But this one's not too bad either, mostly because of Kaylee Hottle, she brought the previous film out of the realm of just being solid, and now she brought this one out of the realm of mediocrity, much love, she's worth the tickets alone. If the initial allure of mindless monster action and pulchritudinous sceneries to expose the audience to Kaylee Hottle's Jia's more compelling character arc and performance was the plan?, then I'm on board, solid stuff.6/10(845 words)","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

Sadly, no.The budget was there and the monster were great, but this film lacked any real purpose. To the extent the writer / director seemed to get a bit confused at how to play it. It kept lurching from straight action, to exceptional cliche, to tongue-in-cheek humour. The character Trapper being a good example.

"7","/10","Delivers what it promises for fans of Kaiju action with a handful of pleasant surprises along the way","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9705638/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2024","""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is the sequel to 2021's ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" and the fifth film in Legendary Pictures' ""MonsterVerse"". Once again directed by Adam Wingard and starring Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, and Kaylee Hottle, it delivers what it promises for fans of Kaiju action with a handful of pleasant surprises along the way.Following the events of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"", both the giant ape Kong and the giant reptilian Godzilla have agreed to keep their distance from one another, leading to a safer world as a result. Kong has since made his home within the depths of Hollow Earth while Godzilla continues to swim the surface world's oceans only occasionally emerging to attack any invasive Kaiju. One day, Kong ventures deeper into Hollow Earth where he discovers something huge that could threaten the very existence of not only his species but all life on the surface. Quickly realising that he cannot handle this threat alone, Kong attempts to form an unlikely alliance with his fierce rival Godzilla before both Hollow Earth and the surface world is destroyed.Ten years since its debut, Legendary Pictures' ""MonsterVerse"" has managed to give western audiences their own cinematic universe of giant monsters, with Japan's iconic Kaiju Godzilla leading the way in his own self-titled 2014 film. Joining this colossal reptilian from the east is the equally famous King Kong (or just ""Kong"" for short) from the west, who also had similar success after first appearing in 2017's ""Kong: Skull Island"". It was inevitable that these two Kaiju would face off against one another, which is exactly what happened in ""Godzilla vs. Kong"", marking the first time since 1962 that both monsters have appeared in the same movie together. After that fight ended in a decisive draw, it seemed uncertain what direction things would head from there, but in ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"", we see the pair working together in an entertaining follow-up that once again showcases great special effects and that signature Kaiju destruction.Rather than focus on two separate stories at once, this time the plot is mostly centred around Kong by himself. Though he is a powerful and respected figure among the inhabitants of Hollow Earth, Kong still needs to assert his dominance whenever necessary. Much like any gorilla, he demonstrates this through physical combat and by roaring loudly while pounding his chest. However, like any primate, curiosity gets the better of him as he decides to explore further into Hollow Earth to find out what lies beneath. Of course, what he ends up discovering poses a threat to his position of power, which later leads to some interesting lore about the origins of both Kong and the other Kaiju who call this planet home. These scenes are what I would consider to be the best parts of the film, as they allow us to see that Kong isn't just a mindless monster who wants to destroy everything he sees, but in fact a curious animal with a natural instinct to remain at the top of the food chain.Maybe it's the better special effects or maybe it's the better way the mythology is handled but I actually found myself more invested in this story than I did with the previous film. This is likely due to the way the film is told primarily from Kong's perspective, as when we see him learn more about ancient life in Hollow Earth, we are learning along with him. From his surprised expressions to his determination to defeat his opponents, the visuals do a fine job at clueing us in to how Kong must be feeling on this journey into unknown territory. As a result, Kong is a surprisingly relatable character this time around, at least by giant gorilla standards.On the other hand, Godzilla's role in this story has been significantly sidelined in favour of his mammalian rival. Whenever we see him on screen, Godzilla is either fighting off any large miscellaneous Kaiju that dare to appear on the surface or he is swimming around looking for another place to rest. Humorously, it would seem that Godzilla has taken a preferential liking to curling up inside the Roman Colosseum to sleep in the same way a dog might curl up in its own fluffy bed. In any other case, I would be annoyed that the ""King of the Monsters"" has been reduced to playing second fiddle to Kong, but remembering that he has already had two other solo movies that adequately established all we need to know about his character, I wasn't nearly as bothered.As is usually the case with giant monster movies, there are plenty of action sequences and scenes of chaotic destruction that are sure to keep audiences satisfied with what they've paid to see. For example, we see Kong punching his way though large, mysterious creatures who attack him and we watch Godzilla smashing through skyscrapers and other landmarks to destroy any other Kaiju that threaten his territory. Out of all these parts, I found the scenes with Kong to be the most exciting due to him being the more emotionally sympathetic of the two monsters. That's not to say I didn't enjoy Godzilla's scenes at all, as he certainly has some memorable moments too, especially during the film's climax. It's worth noting that most of the time Kong is merely defending himself from opposition while Godzilla is usually the instigator of his large-scale fights.Regarding the human characters, they all serve their respective purpose to the story and nothing more. I didn't really care much for Rebecca Hall or Brian Tyree Henry's roles in the story other than for them to quote exposition that Godzilla and Kong cannot verbally communicate to the audience. Though they were far from annoying, I just wish there was a way for them to have had a more memorable impact on the story other than being the stock humans with scientific knowledge on the titular monsters. It is clear that these two human characters are only there to set things up for the next action scene involving either Kong, Godzilla, or both of them at once, meaning that practically anybody could have played their roles.The closest the film comes to having an emotional moment with a human character is with the deaf girl Jia (Kaylee Hottle), who is able to communicate with Kong using sign language. Without spoiling too much, there is one scene with her and Kong that I found quite touching, which is more than can be said for all the other human characters whose names I can barely remember. At the end of the day, this lack of human drama doesn't really matter because as I said once before; we don't pay to see a monster movie for the human characters the same way we don't go to McDonalds to order a filet mignon. Then again, if ""Godzilla Minus One"" was able to accomplish greatness along these lines, then the potential was certainly there at least.For yet another giant monster movie filled with gratuitous destruction and chaos galore, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is a worthy addition to the decade old ""MonsterVerse"" that promises to entertain with its great visuals and plentiful action scenes. As I said about the film's predecessor, you shouldn't expect anything less from a movie that has Godzilla and Kong's names in the title, and once again that's just what we get. I'm curious to see what direction the franchise will head in from this point forward, as there are a number of ways this story could continue with its already established mythology. Until then, I'm satisfied with simply watching these giant monsters beat the hell out of each other for our own amusement.I rate it 7/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

The story is simple, with loads of classic characters and some epic battles. The monsters have slowly developed human characteristics and mannerisms, which can be good or bad, depending on the person.

The first half goes into this curiosity.The second half is about unveiling the mystery of how the Skar King is connected to Godzilla and Kong.The screenplay journey will not make you happy to the fullest as after a certain point I was expecting a blow but no it takes us to the height of the patience and then it breaks. The last 15 minutes of power packed action blended with 3D specs gives us goosebumps, it's like the SRK & Salman come together for an action in Pathaan.From the technical aspect, the visualisation of the Hollow Earth, the habitation of Iwi Community in the Hollow Earth had been beautifully taken. It makes us believe that these are not fiction although we know its a Fictional Movie.BGM while entrance of Godzilla gives the audience a feel of anxiety as whether Godzilla is coming for war or for something else as its character journey had been portrayed respectively in the screenplay.The basic plot of the Movie is an Evil to conquer the Throne of Power will go to the extreme to fulfill but there are some fearless who turn that into just a dream.This plot we had seen in many movies in different versions but what makes this movie worth watching is how this concept they blend with the mythology of the protagonist characters which makes the audience convince able.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

The first 'Jurassic Park' from 1993 is far more convincing. You can't watch and have an emotional connection with movies like this.If it's supposed to be a cartoon or animation, just say so.If we continue to endorse and support creators who don't care about quality, then it's on us.Perhaps they know that the end is coming for them due to AI and stopped caring.Overall: Not just avoid, but punish movies like this one.

In their latest mashup film.""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" was a bunch of monstrous fun. I went with some of my family members who consisted of three women. They range in a variety of different ages. From eighty-two to nineteen, we were all entertained.I didn't have high hopes that they would all enjoy it, especially when I asked Nana if she remembered who ""King Kong"" was. Her reply was ""Isn't it about a gorilla or something?""
I busted out laughing because of the simplicity she gave this massive franchise with this massive character that goes back decades. This is one of the reasons why I love Nana; she will make you laugh for sure.Well, the gorilla and the lizard showed up and showed out, entertaining all of us. At one point, I didn't know if I was watching an ""Avengers"" film or a ""Kong and Godzilla"" film. The action was jam-packed, and frankly, they were doing things that they shouldn't be capable of doing.There were a lot of parts that were overdone or very wonky. Something made you scratch your head and ask, ""How the heck did they get to this point?"" It didn't make sense at times but just go with it. Shockingly, ""Godzilla"" in all these films has very little screen time. In this film, he didn't even crack double digits. It doesn't matter, though, because you can't tell while you're watching it.A film with a lot going on. That still won't stop you from having fun and being entertained while watching it. It pleases people of all ages, which is comforting to know. Box office smash, so expect another film.I love ""Godzilla"" and especially ""King Kong."" He didn't disappoint, and he made sure to let everyone know he was not to be messed with, no matter who you were. ""Kong"" walked around with the you know what energy the whole film. Try not to take certain scenes too seriously. Just enjoy this film on the biggest screen you can find. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

It's weird to get two movies involving Godzilla coming out within several months of each other on completely sperate ends of the spectrum. You had Minus One, which is a serious war drama about a man seeking redemption. This film is an over-the-top dumb fun monster movie. I know many people have put this film down for being not like Minus One. However, it never set out to be. I have always believed that a movie should be judged on whether it succeeds at what it sets out to do. This film sets out to be an entertaining monster fighting movie. Does it succeed in that? More or less.This film, like all the others, is breathtaking visually. The monster fights are good. This movie does deliver on the dumb action beats. When the movie focuses only on the monsters fighting or interacting it's at its best. I just wish Scar came off as more of a threat than he was. While the fights are still entertaining to watch, you never get the sense that Godzilla or Kong are in any real serious danger, like in past films. While I like the human characters more here than in the last two films, they still aren't that interesting, and bog the movie down by focusing on them so much.That's the main flaw with all these films, aside from Skull Island. Like the Transformers movies, the writers and/or producers of these film think the audience needs the human characters to grasp what's going on and to have an emotional tether to the film, but they don't do that good of a job at making us care about most of them. The best character in these movies, by leaps and bounds, has been Kong. If they ever make any more of these films, they should set the next one in the distant past and have no humans at all. That'd be different.My favorite movies of the monster verse are Kong Skull Island and Godzilla vs. Kong. I would put this film just below Godzilla vs. Kong. If you're a fan of those two films, you should enjoy this alright. I enjoy this more than both the Godzilla movies in this line. I did enjoy myself in the theater for the most part. Godzilla x Kong is dumb fun and there's nothing wrong with that. But, if want something on the level of Minus One or even Godzilla 2014 you're not going to get anything out of this.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

Godzilla on a logical and obvious standpoint is better and stronger than Kong, yet western directors of the monsterverse have some kind of fetish to over glorify Kong and it was blatantly obvious in this movie. It is bad enough we got so much limited screen time for Godzilla who is the main character of the monsterverse while highlighting a big monkey who doesn't even have powers or relative to the plot, an ancient feud with the Skar king. The Skar King's feud was with ""Godzilla's ancestors "" so it's actually his fight but they some how made it about Kong. And Kong riding off with Shimo, who can actually take on Gojira and not to mention is like 100 times stronger than Kong was the most laughable plot.Either way, It's an alright movie with some really bad direction and logic that applies to the monsterverse showcased. I hope they don't do anymore Godzilla x Kong movies cause they are utterly pointless and just a way to try extremely hard to show that Kong is an equal which he definitely is not by any sense of logic.","5 out of 7 found this helpful."

Wanted to emulate the craziness of movies like Thor: Ragnarok, or even the previous Godzilla V Kong, and that was all fine and good. However, it's also evident that they never had much idea what to make with Godzilla in this entry, and as a result his screen time felt much reduced. Most of the occasions he was on screen, though, they made sure for him to take over the show.Most of the fighting scenes also felt quite short, and I don't understand why Godzilla felt so threatened by the villains, but whatever. Kong was the real star of this movie, along with his ""little"" sidekick. The human characters were good enough, and Jia was specially good.In the end, I won't deny I had fun watching this movie, but to me it was a downgrade when compared with Godzilla V Kong.

Overall, a very stupid movie that has a dumb plot because the movie just feels like Kong ft Godzilla, but has some merit in watching with its visual effects, cinematography, and grand monster-filled fight scenes.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction is only good on a macroscale because the movie is only about building this vast mythical world and the massive fight scenes; the direction on a microscale is pretty formulaic and bland as many of the performances just feel like they fill time; the storytelling is not good as the movie does not create a coherent story, it just feels like they force a bunch of plot points together), Decent Acting (Decent to Pretty Good from Rebecca Hall (Plays the lead decently well and holds her own in getting the most out of the rest of the cast), Decent from Brian Tyree Henry (Really tries his best to be the comedic relief character, but he just isn't given good material to work with so he misses his jokes a lot), Decent from Dan Stevens (Has charisma that makes his character likable), Decent to Pretty Good from Kaylee Hottle (Does a pretty good job at being the emotional vulnerability in the movie and how she is a conduit between different groups), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a bunch of formulaic, tent-pole performances)), Bad Story (The concept is so stupid because it just has dumb plot points, like the first 20 minutes of the movie is about how Kong has a toothache; the plot structure is a complete mess as they focus way too much on Kong that this movie feels like Kong ft Godzilla; the character writing for the humans is very shallow and formulaic, the character writing for Godzilla is very shallow as he's just there, the character writing for Kong and the apes is pretty good as its all about finding a home), Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is very stupid; the humor is pretty bad because it has a high miss rate; the symbolism is kinda forced, but surprising present despite how shallow it is; the foreshadowing makes the movie predictable), Decent Score, Good Cinematography (I don't know why they used IMAX cameras but they used it well and helped show this mythical world), Good Editing, Very Good Sound (Really helped bring to life the monsters and titans (especially Godzilla and Kong)), Good to Very Good Visual Effects (This movie is really about the visual effects as it helps bring to life the world, the monsters, and their fight scenes), Pacing is incredibly slow as this movie feels like it drags (the first hour just feels like exposition); the runtime could've been 20 minutes longer to help show the relationship between Godzilla and Kong because it is very forced, Climax is very short even though it is well executed (Godzilla and Kong are only in the movie for like 20 minutes together), Tone is just a stereotypical action monster movie (very Michael Bay-like), This movie is Kong ft Godzilla because the two are only on-screen together for like 20 minutes and their relationship is super forced.","8 out of 13 found this helpful."

I loved that. It didn't feel like it was made for imax at the start, then I just kinda got used to it. Didn't have that much depth, could notice this in close up scenes and parts of the screen looked blurry. Wish I'd seen it in RPX or a similar format for a more immersive experience.Kong is always lonely man, it was great to see him find new apes. Also how did that little monkey survived being slammed around and then being used as a batting stick by Kong lol.This movie had a distinctly video game-like quality, both in its graphics and the action sequences. A lot of green screen. However it was pretty fun, I especially enjoyed the fight in the desert. Also, I wanted Godzilla to lift his feet so bad when he was walking out of Italy. Back to the video game-y feel, like watching Godzilla run was cool, and Kong riding, but it was really video gamey to me. I saw a little of that in the trailers.It was giving me jumanji vibes. The stakes were really high, but the movie felt simply fun. It's arguably the most fun packed installment in the MonsterVerse yet. However, I wished it had retained a slightly darker, more serious tone akin to earlier Godzilla films. While Scar King was formidable, his jokes sometimes undercut the seriousness. The movie lacked the intimidating atmosphere that earlier Godzilla movies captured due to the overall fun vibe of the film.Like I always remember the scene where Godzilla finally showed up at the airport in Godzilla(2014) or when Rodan destroyed the city in King Of The Monsters, or the storm. This movie didn't have those vibes and I miss it. Still pretty fun, but instead of having my breath taken away I was just watching in this movie like ""oh that looks cool"" while laid back in my seat.Another thing not specific to this movie. Scenes like this always shock me, when they're in the jungle and the local tribe in camouflaged. Are these warriors just lurking, standing still in the bushes 24/7 waiting for a trespassers. It's not logical but almost always looks cool.The movie is quite ambitious, especially when it came to the Iwi tribe in hallow earth. There was so much lore and science added into the franchise. It was so compact and filled. I also like that the tribe spoke telepathically; Reminds me of the scene in Kong Skull Island when someone said they don't speak much.Certain scenes felt rushed, such as how quickly they obtained the mechanical arm. It did seem overly convenient and the movie could've benefited from more development. The overall pacing of the movie, with a rush to get to the big fight, gave it a sense of being hurried for me, almost like a speed run through mini-missions to get to this big fight. It felt as though they were hesitant to make the movie longer, and I wish it was extended it by 30 minutes could have allowed for more depth and nuance.I can't believe icy Godzilla just ended up being a lovely pet dog, and Godzilla is sleeping in Italy like a cat. Anyway, so many parts of the movie are great, the action, ambition, and overall fun vibe, making it highly enjoyable for many viewers. While I think it's good or kinda good, I do wish it were slightly longer and had a darker tone. It feels like a departure from the tone of earlier Godzilla films and seems to target a slightly different/broader audience. A lot of people seemed to like it, a lot of kids too.

It's thrilling and there are some great references to Showa Era of the Godzilla franchise. However Godzilla himself is sidelined in this film and Kong once again seems to get more screen time. That being said, Kong is definitely the heart of the film and shines every time he's on screen. The human characters, script and the pacing are probably the weakest elements of the film. Dan Stevens and Brian Tree Henry are the best human characters since they bring a well needed comedic flair. It seems that the rest of the human characters are only really there to deliver clunky exposition that feels like it comes of nowhere and there are times the film is either very slow or going to fast. Like when it has time to breathe it suddenly picks up the speed again and I can barely have time to think.Overall, Godzilla x Kong is a flawed but very fun film that will please longtime fans but newcomers will be very confused or very uninterested.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

I also can't stand putting dumb characters into a movie for ""comedic"" effect.

The visual effects are mind-blowing, especially in how they portray the battles and the aftermath of destruction caused by these titans. While the film doesn't aim to break new ground, it does provide an experience that allows viewers to switch off their brains for two hours, which can be a plus for those just looking to be entertained.However, it falls short in delivering emotional depth or a gripping storyline, unlike the Japanese film ""Godzilla Minus One."" The human characters are one-dimensional and easily forgettable, failing to leave a lasting impression on the audience. The villain is also weak and lacking in menace, missing the qualities needed to stand out as a true antagonist. In summary, ""Godzilla X Kong 2"" is a visual spectacle that, while offering momentary fun, lacks memorability and fails to evoke a lasting emotional impact.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

The Monsters Kong and Godzilla come up against throughout the film are all different each time meaning the film brings to life a wide variety of different species / titans for the duo to battle against. This means no one battle is the same and it is not the same two species fighting over and over again. Next, the story might be nonsensical but it keeps the movie moving throughout and it explains everything to keep all viewers in the loop.

Unfortunately the movie is not able to achieve this due to useless and long boring sections centered around humans and their story arcs. Indeed when the movie shows the monsters it is good (for what it is) with fun and entertaining scenes. Furthermore the monsters are characterized thanks to convincing facial expressions which are able to convey what they are thinking. On the flip side the parts featuring humans are boring and, most importantly, too long. They were present also in the previous chapter (Godzilla vs Kong) but they were shorter and less serious. And so, in the end, if you'll be able to overcome those scenes and they will not become an issue to you the movie will feel fine and fun. If however, like in my case, these scenes are able to provoke a lot of boredom, the viewing can be more problematic. Indeed when the movie flows it is very good, when it features the humans it's the total opposite. In my opinion 15 minutes less dedicated to the humans and a shorter movie would have created one of the most entertaining blockbuster movie of the year.","6 out of 9 found this helpful."

WB is well-aware of what the audience wants - CGI monster fight scenes - and they give it in full. Storyline of the human characters are reduced to contextualizing and driving the narrative toward more titan face-offs. However, despite their little screen time, all actors gave convincing enough performances: Rebecca Hall a tender-hearted mother and Brian Tyree Henry a comedic normie who's not overly cringy. The plot of the monsters is pretty simple as well, but it's revealed gradually throughout the film either by human narration or physical language, which I think is a smart choice for a commercial production. However, too much screen time for titans makes me lose track of how big the creatures are, which is quite underwhelming for a movie about giant monsters - the production tries to make it up by using shaky cameras and earth-moving sound effect, but somewhere along the second act I just don't see Kong as large as he is in Skull Island. Finally, the action sequences are heavily budgeted: ax, spine whip, ice rays, Barbie rays, mechanical boxing glove, flying buildings, destruction of important cultural relics, and most satisfyingly, no human intervention. If you like how the Transformers smashed the pyramids to smithereens, you'll love this movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

There is no stake in the story. CGI keeps getting worse (Baby Kong). Compare it with what we were seeing 10-20 years ago or what Planet of the Apes was doing more recently and you know that they gave up investing in CGI. They try to fill the screen with more stuff, more monsters, more destructions. They should have respected the premise of the King Kong story, which is quite simple. That we might have forgotten animal species on this planet. Not a fantasy with some stupid hollow earth below our feet, with dinosaurs, monsters and magic. It is not fun to watch.

A team up of the 2 most well known modern day monsters with all out action? Normally this should be a slam dunk but I think the problem with this movie is that there is literally nowhere to go with the story that we haven't been.In a nutshell, the scientists working at Monarch detect signal anomalies that are coming from Hollow Earth but can't figure out its origin and who is sending them. They trek on downward, discover the signal's origin & discover that there is a villainous gorilla like Kong who is trying to escape and reign terror on those living up top. Godzilla & Kong team-up, hence the title of the film, many punches and kicks are thrown along with a few wrestling-esque moves and the villain is defeated.Doesn't really sound too bad for a plot. In fact, in this movie, they finally put more emphasis on the monster's story over the human story and let this drive the chaos and spectacle. The bad part is, there really isn't anything new that we haven't seen in the past 3 Godzilla movies & Kong: Skull Island. I'm sorry but there are only so many times I care to watch Godzilla & Kong fight other giant kaiju monsters threatening humanity/Earth before it simply becomes boring. Is the action fun? For the most part it is entertaining and the pure visual spectacle in the IMAX version which opens up from standard letterbox aspect ratio which the previous movies didn't makes for a fun & entertaining ride. But again, we've seen both Godzilla & Kong fight monsters and destroy cities to last us a lifetime.Add to the fact that the cgi visual effects that show us Hollow Earth looks really artificial and weak and you have what amounts to a middling film. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely places where the vfx blends well or looks appropriate but there are definitely clear spots where you can tell it's not photorealistic at all and that is disappointing considering the money spent on this compared to last year's Godzilla: Minus One which was far superior visually.Is there anywhere left to go with this franchise? Not really, unless you just want more monster chaos & action. I think if they put out any more movies in this series, they need to be 90 minutes or less. Any longer and it will just become more and more boring and lead to fatigue.Go see this if you're a kaiju/Godzilla/Kong fan, it will deliver. Wait for it on streaming if you're hoping for something more along the lines of Godzilla: Minus One.","7 out of 11 found this helpful."

One is there to give us a bit of mystical woo woo, and why not.Kong is basically the star of the movie, which is how it should be. Most of the action is well done, and whilst there are bits where the cgi is a bit, well cgi, mostly it's good, and there are some truly stunning visuals.

The film, while visually stunning and action-packed, struggles with its narrative and character development. The returning cast includes Rebecca Hall as Dr. Ilene Andrews and Brian Tyree Henry as podcaster Bernie Hayes, joined by newcomer Dan Stevens, who plays a charismatic kaiju veterinarian.Stevens' portrayal of Trapper, a titan doctor, adds a humorous and laid-back vibe to the film. His character, however, feels underdeveloped and underutilized. Despite this, Stevens' chemistry with Hall provides some of the film's more enjoyable human moments.The film's visual effects are its standout feature, particularly the sequences involving Kong's journey in Hollow Earth and his interactions with a younger ape named Suko. These scenes showcase Weta's impressive CGI work and add emotional depth to Kong's character. However, Godzilla often takes a backseat, primarily appearing during chaotic destruction scenes until the climactic battle.The introduction of Skar King as the new antagonist arrives too late in the narrative, which diminishes the potential for a more developed conflict between him and Kong. Despite the delayed setup, the final showdown delivers on the franchise's promise of epic, crowd-pleasing monster battles. The climactic fight between Godzilla, Kong, and Skar King is thrilling, featuring stunning visuals and high-energy action that fans will appreciate.Overall, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" excels in delivering spectacular monster battles and impressive visual effects. However, it falls short in narrative cohesion and character development, making it a visually entertaining but somewhat shallow addition to the MonsterVerse.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

"3","/10","convoluted mess!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9819609/?ref_=tt_urv","dalton-39176","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120167395/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2024","As a long-time fan of monster movies, I eagerly anticipated the release of ""Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire,"" hoping for a thrilling showdown between these iconic titans. Unfortunately, the film falls short on nearly every front, delivering a lackluster experience that left me more frustrated than entertained.First and foremost, the plot is a convoluted mess. The story feels cobbled together from cliches and lacks any real coherence. The attempt to weave in human drama feels forced and unnecessary, detracting from the monsters that should be the stars of the show. Instead of focusing on the epic battles, we are subjected to tedious subplots involving forgettable human characters who add nothing of value to the narrative.Speaking of battles, the film's action sequences are surprisingly dull. One would expect a film featuring Kong and Godzilla to be packed with jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat moments, but what we get are poorly choreographed fights that lack any real sense of danger or excitement. The special effects, while decent, are not enough to save these uninspired confrontations.The performances from the human cast are mediocre at best. It's evident that even talented actors struggled with the poorly written dialogue and shallow character development. Their motivations are unclear, and their actions often defy logic, making it difficult to invest in their fates.Additionally, the pacing of the film is atrocious. At over two hours, it drags painfully, with long stretches where nothing of significance happens. The movie's climax, which should be the highlight, feels rushed and anticlimactic, leaving much to be desired.In terms of visual and audio elements, ""Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire"" does have some redeeming qualities. The CGI is generally well-executed, and the monster designs are impressive. However, these aspects alone cannot compensate for the film's many shortcomings.In conclusion, ""Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire"" is a major disappointment. It fails to capture the magic and excitement that made previous entries in the franchise enjoyable. With a nonsensical plot, lackluster action, and forgettable characters, this film is a chore to sit through. Save your time and money; this empire is not worth visiting.","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

Wtf even is this? Everything about this movie is either trash, mid, or forced. The script is forced, the acting os forced, the dialogues are forced. In fact, they're so bad I had a hard time not cringing. Why does a monster movie need to be a comedy? Is everything Marvel nowadays? The characters are so cliched and one dimensional. The script is full of plotholes, it lacks explanation and the science in this movie..... It's not even science anymore. One guy even admits in the movie it's just magic. I had a hard time continuing watching this seeing how they were effing up science and logic. I know I shouldn't expect logic in a monster movie but this is beyond limits. The fighting scenes are short, disappointing and never reach their potential. It's like there IS no final battle. They made the monsters more human than the humans itself. They're monsters ffs, they shouldn't be acting like humans. When they can't round up their bs logic, they just skip through it with corny lines. I've been a Godzilla fan since I watched the 1998 Godzilla when I was a kid. I loved Kong since watching the 2005 King Kong movie. This monsterverse reboot was promising, the 2014 Godzilla and Kong Skull Island were miles better than this. It's sad to see these monsters ending up like this.","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

So, bear with me. I'm gonna try and keep it short.First of at all... Even the very beginning of the movie was like a blurry mess. I'm sure they're pretty talented people but looks like the VFX team who worked on this project forced to shorten their rendering times. Even at the very start of the movie, CGI is bad, and nothing near the past Godzilla and Kong movies from the Hollywood. Could've been much much better than this. This one is the least watchable when compared with the others, I don't think I'll ever re-watch it again. Not enough lively details with the CGI, not looking realistic enough. Also, the bigness of the characters doesn't feel majestic enough on their surroundings. Something doesn't right about their proportions and movements as well.Right until seeing this movie I was like, Hollywood is absolutely doing Godzilla movies better than the Japan. Since I liked the Godzilla (2014) more than the Godzilla Minus One (2023). But oh boy, I got sucker punched good with this one.Oh! And also... Lot's of irrelevant 80's music and neon colors all over the movie. I mean, guys! Please! It wasn't like this even with the ones with Millie Bobby Brown present with her Stranger Things background =) This is pretty much why I decided to write Thor: Love and Thunder on the headline of my review btw. That one also was over-colorful just like this one, and also fell down the expectations.My 2 cents...Story was not that bad, somehow acceptable. But it's practice was done wrong at times. Needs some re-writes, re-shoots and re-renders to be GOLDEN.It's not a bad ""one time"" watch if you're able to trick your brain into re-imagining what you're seeing at the exact moment of you're seeing it, and fill the gaps with your imagination =)
I mean if you can accept how the CGI looks, and if you're also into 80's music and neon colors like I do.I don't think this qualify as a spoiler since it can be clearly seen on the poster but... If you're sensitive and not even checked out the poster yet, please stop reading right around here.It was sad to see that the King is Pink. Maybe they could've gone with the Red instead. You know, since no monster is scary in Pink.Felt like I'm watching an ad... A beverage ad... Dragon Fruit flavored... An energy drink brand's =)And It was more of a Kong movie than the Godzilla x Kong. They should've named it ""Mostly Kong x Partly Godzilla"" and not even write the Godzilla first.Thank you. You read it all.That sure shows character !You are a Red Godzilla !!RAWR !!..","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

The story can best be summarised as 'big ape and big lizard vs evil big ape and misunderstood big lizard', with every scene and sequence featuring humans that lead up to the fights consistently crank up the ludicrous levels of over-explanation as to how any of it makes sense. The monsters, after all this time, are put front and centre with Kong leading the charge. The effects look on par with the previous Monsterverse entries, but the fights are far and beyond superior with understanding of gravity and physics traded in for hilariously, stupidly entertaining punching matches.On the other hand, a lot of the actors kinda look like they're clueless about what they're doing, but are decent at selling the absurdity. Although I liked Dan Stevens the most, but I didn't really find any of the characters that interesting. The jokes are the same inoffensive streamlined humour that plagues modern movies and therefore the only laughs you'll get are from the monster fights or stupid science jargon that doesn't make sense. The 'New Empire' itself too is more like an ancient empire, so I gotta ask, what's wrong with the title 'Godzilla X Kong: The Old Empire'? And for a movie that headlines Kong and Godzilla, there really isn't that much Godzilla and that monster kinda feels more like a side character than a co-lead.This is a movie that isn't really supposed to make sense and is by almost every sense of the term, a 'popcorn flick', an easily digestible blockbuster movie. It works purely as switch-your-brain-off entertainment and nothing else.","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

Both the stupidity and sheer scale are taken to new heights whilst finally putting the Titans front and centre. It proves that giant monsters fighting will never get old and is ridiculously entertaining.Fixing one of the most common problems with these films, the human cast is massively trimmed down to only the necessities here. Rebecca Hall is given more to work with, Brian Tyree Henry is a funnier comic relief and Dan Stevens is having so much fun and looking cool doing it.The best performance goes to Kong though, which is a testament to incredibly detailed vfx work on display here. The CG is able to convey his anguish at his loneliness, yearning to find his people and any pain he endures. It really shows that humans aren't needed in these films as Kong can convey all the necessary emotions and most importantly, without dialogue.Adam Wingard's direction has gotten stronger in comparison to the last one. The sense of scale is completely lost at this point but in its place are big monster fights that feel like someone smashing toys together in the best ways. There's several sequences where the Titans move the story forward all on their own, which are always the best part.The music by Tom Holkenborg and Antonio Di lorio really doubles down on the 80s sci-fi vibes with even more synth than last time. When it's accompanying a zero gravity fight at the centre of the earth it helps to turn the whole thing into the biggest Saturday morning cartoon ever made.","9 out of 20 found this helpful."

But, let's be real, the first half kinda feels like it's stuck in neutral, especially when they dive into the whole Hollow Earth thing. And don't even get me started on the climax-it's like they hit fast forward and left us hanging. The characters are badass, no doubt, but they kinda get lost in the shuffle.

The most common criticism was the habit of cutting away from the monster action as soon as it became interesting, but that wasn't the issue. The real issue, which has been expanded on with every theatrical follow-up film, is the fact when they cut away it's to underdeveloped characters that either have no personality or an exaggerated, trope-filled personality, aka ""Look at me! I'm an interesting character because I'm flamboyant and loud and kooky!"".Godzilla x King: The Stupidest Title Yet takes that to a new level. The human characters are cartoons with no resemblance to real people that I might care about. Unfortunately I also don't believe any of the monsters are real because the CG and animation are also cartoonish and therefore not good enough to sell the suspension, unlike the 1/10th budget Godzilla Minus One and unique Shin Godzilla. Those films also illustrate another problem with the Hollywood versions: the monsters are way too big. They clearly subscribed to the ""Bigger is better"" mindset, but it makes them even more difficult to take seriously as living organisms since our brains default to basic grade school science that tells us such things couldn't exist due to their own mass. The monsters in the others are already on the cusp of that suspension, so going bigger is definitely not better.The only interesting and engaging characters in the Legendary Monsterverse are in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

After the excitement of Godzilla vs. Kong, I was eager to see where the story would go next, but it seems Adam Wingard has lost his magic with this installment.I'm usually a sucker for a cheesy story with good cinematography and pacing, but Godzilla x Kong offered none of that. The pacing was terrible, the action scenes were lackluster, the CGI was subpar, and the human acting was atrocious. The film felt like a pointless monster mash, with destruction for the sake of destruction.It's a shame because this franchise started off strong and held so much promise. Instead, they decided to abandon what worked before and create a film that seems aimed at a third-grade audience. Even the human stories, which are usually a redeeming factor, were lackluster here.

This one just caused me to want to revisit any of the Godzilla films featured on MST3k.I swear, these MonsterVerse films get more progressively dumb as they proceed. Okay, they're dumb-fun, just...not *that* much fun anymore.Excluding entry #2, Kong: Skull Island and the 2023 fantastic Apple TV series, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, each chapter sinks deeper and deeper into the Middle Earth of realism. They might as well just animate these movies since they're so far from reality and the stakes couldn't be lower.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire begs you to leave your brain at the door. Basically, there's a new (old?) threat to both of the title characters and the bad boys, bad boys, what are they gonna do? All-but high-five and fight. Duh.I wouldn't go as far to say this movie's bad...IF you don't take it seriously for one minute. It's also not a so-bad-it's-good. It's just there for those who want to see big monsters fight.Admittedly, my expectations couldn't be lower, namely when Baby Kong showed up in the trailers and he looked like he crawled right out of a Super Nintendo. (Spoiler: his graphics didn't improve in the final product and BY FAR was the worst CGI in the entire franchise.) So, the movie could literally go only up from what I predicted. And it did.Mostly ANY Kong scene was worthy of a watch. And mind you, NOT when any human did something to him - I only mean when he was away from all humans and on his own adventures.Funny, I grew up on Godzilla movies and loved them as a kid. I couldn't get enough and while I respected King Kong and loved his three standalone movies (from 1933, 1976 and 2005, forgetting all the other ""sequels/crossovers,"") Godzilla was my jam. In this MonsterVerse, it's the opposite. Kong is definitely King throughout.Luckily, I was able to separate my recent LOVE and AWE for Godzilla Minus One when I watched this latest King of the Monsters film. Yes, they're from separate universes, but comparing them is like asking which is better: Bram Stoker's Dracula and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter or Bride of Frankenstein and I, Frankenstein. You know one's great and the other silly.While this ranks dead-last in the MonsterVerse (see below,) it's still worthy of a watch. It's harmless and may even develop into a drinking game every time you have to say to yourself: ""Yeah, right"" or ""Really? Seriously?""***Final Thoughts: My MonsterVerse Ranking:1. Kong: Skull Island (2017)

While I also enjoyed that film, this side of the Pacific Ocean offers a completely different experience.Now, let's dive into the review.The storyline back in the days was quite simple: a blonde ventures into a jungle where a giant gorilla falls in love. The climax involves the gorilla climbing a tall building in the city before meeting his death.Then, out of nowhere, Godzilla emerges, with a theory suggesting he was sleeping in an oceanic space. Subsequently, other monsters surface, all nourished by nuclear energy, leading to the expected chain of events.A new twist arises with the discovery of another jungle during World War II, revealing the existence of the colossal Kong. As the plot unfolds, we learn that the deep ocean isn't the only habitat for these creatures; there are hidden portals and even a whole Earth within Earth.Moving forward, the film delves into the Hollow Earth theory, unveiling yet another layer of secrecy within this subterranean realm. To uncover the details of this hidden place, you'll have to watch the movie.In an unexpected turn, Godzilla adopts a seemingly invincible persona to confront a formidable adversary, while Kong, who I suspect might start conversing in the next installment, receives an Iron Man-like upgrade.Ultimately, the movie is pure entertainment. Despite any negative criticism, it keeps you engaged throughout, ensuring you won't be bored. So, give it a watch, and the above will all make sense.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Also the Plotline, there was way too damn much going on and this Film has Completely Inferior Visuals compared to the Previous Entries.👎 Godzilla X Kong is in my opinion nowhere near the other Legendary Films, Specifically Godzilla Vs Kong or Godzilla King of the Monsters(KOTH is just Very Slightly Behind GVK, I loved KOTM, but GVK was Such an Experience).👎 The Visuals in this Film at almost 100% of the Time, were not Eye Popping or Amazing at All, Absolutely Terrible Compared to, Godzilla 2014, Kong Skull Island, and Nowhere Near KOTH and GVK.(The Suplex looked Great though 😂)👎 Also, I remember feeling the Power of Godzillas Charge Up Atomic Blast in Godzilla King of the Monsters. Where was that Energy in this? It wasn't the Same Amazing Charge Up, and Godzilla Supposedly had even More Power with the Pink Atomic Blast. Where was the Power Flying Across the Auditorium? It was Underwhelming as Hell.👎 Then on to the Plotlines, there was way too damn much going on, one of the Plotlines was Like Kong Skull Island ........but on Steroids.👂🎵 Another thing, the Score and Music, I liked it very much but it's used so badly in the Film, it's just sort of like Background Noise instead of Elevating what's Happening on screen.🤷 Also, Brian Tyree Henry has a couple of Laughs but he was Very Underwhelming here. He was Absolutely Hilarious in Godzilla Vs Kong. Very Disappointing, although Dan Stevens and He have this Particular Joke together that was Funny though 😂.🙋Rebecca Hall was Ok.🤦🏻 And then you had all this other Stuff Going on just To get 2 Crappy other Monsters on Screen. After Seeing the Titan Mecha Godzilla and Ghidorah from the 2 Previous Entries. D'you think we can go back to 2 Underwhelming Monsters like these?👎 Also, the other Plotline with Kong and the mini Kong, it was crap in my opinion, it just wasn't good.What the Hell were they Thinking?The Only Positives I can Give this Film are -1. The Score and Music(although used very Poorly in my opinion)2. The Suplex off the Top Rope.That's it, there's Nothing Else Good about the Film.Overall, this is a 1 Outta 10 at Very Best. Just be Glad we've Watched Godzilla Vs Kong, Godzilla Minus One, And Godzilla King of the Monsters in Dolby/and or IMAX. The 3 Greatest Entries in my Opinion.","15 out of 30 found this helpful."
"6","/10","It's entertaining but.. not a great movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9721978/?ref_=tt_urv","zahranismailpratama","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur179837703/?ref_=tt_urv","6 April 2024","Appreciate the cgi, action sequences.Apart from that, this film has a lot of thing that I didn't like.I always believed that in films, plot and story are the important things you should have, its the fundamentals. I think you can agree with that.In this film... most of what happens here is just ridiculous. You understand when you see the filmKaiju movies... yes. But that doesn't mean we don't need to have a good 'human character'.In GxK, I don't see a person that are actually smart, important and professional enough to deal with this titans.Scar king? Turns out he wasn't intimidating at all... i expect more from him.That's my opinion.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."
