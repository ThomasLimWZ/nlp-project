There had to be a lot of adapting to fit 500+ pages in a 2.5 hour movie.That being said, I don't think they did a great job of conveying Snow's internal struggle. Love vs His Future. Human Decency vs Power. His Past vs His Present. He was CONSTANTLY torn in the book.Throughout the book, you wondered how he would eventually turn ""bad"". His journey and eventual decision makes sense and doesn't seem quick and sudden. There doesn't seem to be an obvious character arc in the movie that shows his change.At the end of the movie, Snow's ""betrayal"" and reaction towards Lucy may seem confusing and rushed if you don't have background from reading the book. You don't really know how much Lucy means to him and how shocking that ending should be.It's a good adaptation, but it's definitely not the best Hunger Games movie!","35 out of 37 found this helpful.

That's brilliant but this is a movie made for the mass audiences now.First of all, there's way too much of singing, it gets cheesy and annoying. Secondly, they've tried too hard to remind us our ""Katniss Everdeen"" it's does not feel natural. I don't like Rachel Ziegler's performance at all she is way too theatrical her accent is too comedic. They have tried to make her Katniss.There must be a Part II for this movie as well I suppose because it left many questions unanswered. I don't want to include spoilers so I will skip those questions.","34 out of 44 found this helpful.

I did thoroughly enjoy it! However, there are so many things that they left out that I felt were integral to the story. In order to properly see Snow for who he is-a spineless boy who only does things that look good to others-I think they needed to spend more time with the character. I'm not usually a fan of two parters, but this one really should've been. The characters fell flat to me because we didn't get great looks into them.My boyfriend, who didn't read the book, really liked it and said he felt he understood the characters well enough though. So maybe it's just a me problem.Because so much of the book is Snow's internal monologue, I know it would've been hard to capture that properly on film, but I think they could've. Also, it's SO much darker in the book, and I think that was necessary for the audience to see.","85 out of 117 found this helpful.

The characters are bland and most of them annoying , especially Lucy Gray who starts singing out of the blue every step of the way.I think the only likeable characters are Tigris who has little to almost no screen time and Sejanus who acts like a moral compass throughout the movie and who was done dirty. Otherwise I wasn't rooting for anyone .I kinda regret starting the movie but I wanted to give it a try. Now I want to finish it on principle because I hate living movies and shows unfinished not because I like it in any shape of form.It's a pity because its such a downgrade compared to the previous Hunger Games. The only good thing in this movie is Viola Davis who is spectacular as always ... other than that nope, nothing.","29 out of 37 found this helpful.

But they are still very much on. Ziegler's acting and accent was bad no other way to put it just plain bad. The story was hard to buy into. The chapters almost felt like loosely connected but widely under developed stories that to do properly could have each been a movie on their own. It's a very basic see it once and say you have seen it. Several parts of the movie felt like they wanted to be rated R but were dumbed down to make a pg13 movie I'd also give a parent warning my daughter wanted to see it which is why we went and it was VERY dark for PG13.","52 out of 73 found this helpful.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray"" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews.

Unexpectedly, certain scenes carried a whimsical Disney musical vibe, a stark departure from the series' gritty tone. The depiction of arena deaths fell disappointingly flat, lacking the visceral impact that defined the franchise. Moreover, the CGI work was subpar, failing to immerse the audience effectively.However, the film wasn't without its merits. A standout feature was the commendable ensemble cast, with each actor bringing a nuanced performance. Yet, some talents were sadly underutilized, leaving viewers wanting more from characters who had the potential for greater depth and development.One major flaw that overshadowed the positives was the rushed pacing of the narrative. The movie struggled to explore the intricacies of its intriguing concept thoroughly. A more deliberate approach, possibly as a two-part installment, could have allowed for a more immersive and satisfying exploration of the dystopian world.Despite its shortcomings, the film managed to maintain a semblance of the franchise's essence. The core themes of rebellion, survival, and sacrifice were present, but the execution failed to capture the intensity that fans expected. In essence, the latest Hunger Games installment had all the ingredients for success, but its hasty execution prevented it from reaching the heights of its predecessors.","43 out of 67 found this helpful.

As a result, a relatively boring movie. It felt as though there was so much context to provide there was no time to make it enjoyable. Some exciting parts but this was only attributable to Suzanne Collins' writing; I believe the directors heavily relied on the plot already written for them. Rachel exaggerated jaw acting made this not only a boring watch but a difficult one. Lucy Gray was a textbook manic pixie dream girl - I thought cinema would be more self aware by now.","44 out of 69 found this helpful.

Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.","347 out of 508 found this helpful.

Everything from the introduction of the Games to evasions to conclusions were well executed. Despite the film being violent prone it still comes across as tense and deadly without showing anything too gruesome to maintain its PG rating.The acting was strong. The actors were well suited for their roles, and only based on trailers, I found the young Snow builds well for the original movies, but unknown for certain. I loved the chemistry between Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth.The music was terrific. Zegler has an amazing voice, and her songs obviously work well into the film. The visuals are mostly incredible. There's a few spots where it's very obviously screen acting. Part of me hopes they did have physical sets cause there were portions that felt genuine.Overall, you don't need to have seen the previous films to understand what's going on, but it may help to better understand who the characters are. Acting is strong, music is great, and the story is amazing enough to make me want to see the rest of ""The Hunger Games"".That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.","210 out of 303 found this helpful.

Then I saw it was released, and just decided to go see because why not. I hadn't seen any trailers and knew nothing about it, just that it was based on a new book by Suzanne Collins.I had absolutely zero expectations, although the cynical part of me thought I might be wasting my time, especially after seeing the runtime on the movie. However, 3 hours later I can admit I left the cinema feeling rather impressed. I genuinely enjoyed it.While the hunger games trilogy we know with Katniss Everdeen strike me as a fun, rewatchable teen-fantasy, in the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we see a much darker and grittier side of the world of Panem, which I felt resulted in experiencing a much more horrifying reality of the games themselves. It felt more real, and grounded, and loved seeing how everything operated with far more inferior technology and fewer established rules.Since watching the movie I've seen criticism of the characters and acting, and while I am usually quite strict on that kind of thing too, I genuinely see their points here. I understand Rachel Zegler is an actress of controversy for a lot of people, I myself have seen a lot of debatable interviews with her, but I believe she shows of her talent here with a great performance. The standout performance is definitely Tom Blyth and a young president Snow however, an actor who I have not seen in anything else before. I found myself genuinely caring about the fate of the two characters and their relationship, which is a hard thing to achieve, and i feel is the core element of this movie, therefore really enjoyed because of it. The supporting characters were also well performed, such as Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis.The movie is split into three chapters, like a book. Chapters 1 and 2 are certainly the stronger of the three, which I very much enjoyed for reasons already stated. Despite still enjoying chapter 3, and completely recognising it's importance, I feel as though it was slightly rushed, and therefore perhaps would be understood more by people who have read the book and have pre-existing knowledge of the hunger games.Although certainly not a flawless movie, I am pleasantly surprised by it and had a fun time watching. I would recommend if you fancy a movie night. 7.5/10.","13 out of 19 found this helpful.

I don't hate it, but I've never found anything all that likeable about it. It was, and still is my opinion that the Hunger Games are the weakest execution of the battle royale concept in all of film and television. So naturally, I didn't really have high hopes going into this movie.The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is split into 3 parts: the first, an introduction to Coriolanus Snow and his friendship with Lucy Gray; the second, the actual Hunger Games; and the third, the aftermath. I have to admit that I did find the first two parts somewhat enjoyable, albeit the obvious lack of any serious character development. It still had some charm and some wit about it to keep me interested, despite it feeling like the writers didn't really put in the effort to lay the foundations to make these characters live up to their full potentials.But all of that was nothing compared to how unbelievably disappointing the final part was. If you thought the character development in the first two parts were rushed, you're not ready for what the third has done. Characters are going through serious mental and philosophical transformations within periods that make it almost comical to watch, and through actions that just make no sense given the context of what has already been established. It was jarring and felt like it needed its own movie to flesh the action out to be consistent.This movie does nothing to change my opinion on the franchise. Maybe makes it slightly worse, but I could ignore it on a good day. For the fans of the Hunger Games and for those who care a lot about the series however, this movie could be a fun 150 minutes.","22 out of 42 found this helpful.

Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.","297 out of 450 found this helpful.

Aside from me not knowing much about Snows background and how that leads to the other hunger games movies, the movie is just extremely boring and honestly I think it's really bad acting as well.

I have not been able to stop thinking about it since... I read the original trilogy but never got around to reading the prequel but decided to just see the movie. Rachel Zegler receives hate because of a comment she made about a completely different movie (Snow White), and it's completely irrelevant to this movie. She performed more than beautifully in this role. She is a classically trained soprano, and was singing beautifully in her chest voice and with a really good twangy accent (which is more of a mezzo/alto type of singing in this case). From one classically-trained singer with a degree in music who performs for a living to everyone out there afraid to give this movie a chance because of all of this biases against this young woman- SHE IS GOOD! This girl is talented, and the hate is stupid.This movie was by no means perfect, but it was really good. I would have thought it was a perfect 10 if the action was better paced. It was nothing on her part. Definitely not as good as Catching Fire (the peak of the series to me), but better than both of the Mockingjays! Give it a shot without a bias of this young women in your mind and you just might find yourself enjoying it ;)","174 out of 340 found this helpful.

The singing at times felt a bit forced , but she is good enough to make it worth it .My main complaints here come in with the chemistry and relationship development between not only Gray and Snow , but between everyone . The first third did a good job of helping the audience see and understand people's actions and relationships to each other , but come the second part and all the sudden it's all very murky - and not in a ""people are complicated "" type of way , but in a way where things seem to happens only to move a plot along and not for any other seemingly good reason .

This prequel focuses on Snow's beginnings as a humble young man who questions the methods that the Capitol uses to discipline the rebels, but throughout the film he discovers the truth about what human beings are capable of. All through his relationship with Lucy Gray hoping to regulate the methods of the Capitol. Unlike the previous films, this is a longer and more dramatic story that does not focus solely on the Hunger Games, but mostly on Snow's transmission. It is a worthy installment that serves as a prologue to the saga, even without the presence of Katniss Everdeen. It has that metaphorical characteristic that has always defined the saga with respect to capitalism, social inequality and what human beings are capable of doing by instinct. Rachel Zegler gives a spectacular performance in many ways, including her musical numbers. There is no doubt that The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a great film that revives the saga again and is a good option for those who do not know the saga to begin to enter this apocalyptic universe created by Suzanne Collins. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.","65 out of 121 found this helpful.

The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.","251 out of 380 found this helpful.

Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, ""What am I missing?"" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, ""There's more?"" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10

I've watched them because my wife wanted to, not normally my thing at all. I eye rolled when told they'd made a prequel.BUT - I'll hold my hands up, I enjoyed it more than I thought.Seeing how Snow becomes the man we know from the later films was quite enjoyable, I get what others are saying about the ending seeming quite rushed when we start to see his true colours though. I think I'd have enjoyed a more nuanced approach to this. But it really didn't ruin anything the way it was done.I see a lot of complaints complaining that it wasn't a faithful adaption of the book. I've never read the book so I can't speak to that but I can count on one hand the amount of books I've read that have been faithfully translated to screen - It almost never happens the way that satisfies everyone, people should be used to that by now.As for the songs been complained about, well perhaps they should try listening to them - I thought they helped convey a lot of narrative and emotion and the film would be missing something more without them. And for those comparing this to a musical because of them, then they should probably go and watch a musical to find out how wrong they are there as well. Ridiculous statements.Was / is it the best film ever? No. Of course not.Does it deserve the panning some people give it based on it not being an accurate representation of the book? Nope.Does it deserve to be slagged off for being a musical? Nope.Does it deserve a watch if you've any interest in the Hunger Games world?

Because basically the essence of the film is, like in ""Joker"" or ""Star Wars: episode III: Revenge of the Sith"", about how the protagonist will eventually turn into a sardonic and loathsome villain.But hey, it was Christmas day, my wife wanted a family trip to the cinema, and we chose ""Ballad etc"" because we enjoyed the original films starring Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland. And, for the record, it's a good and enjoyable movie. The performances of most of the cast members are terrific, there are a handful of highly memorable action sequences, a few remarkable twists & gimmicks, and a plot that is compelling despite often being convoluted.Remember the almighty Sutherland as the relentless and tyrannical President Snow? Well, this movie goes 64 years back in time, to when Coriolanus Snow was a hunky 19-year-old student at Capitol Academy and about to witness the announcement of an innovative new rule for the upcoming 10th edition of the annual Hunger Games. The most prominent academy students are obliged to mentor the participants from the different districts from now onwards, and Snow gets assigned to the seemingly fragile District-12 girl Lucy Grey Baird.The screenplay is neatly divided in three chapters. The Mentor is about the acquaintance between young Snow and Lucy Grey. The Prize revolves around the actual Hunger Games that still integrally take place in the arena. And then The Peacekeeper about Snow's banishment from the Capitol, his dubious adventures in District-12, and his further mental descent into darkness. Although every chapter contains multiple highlights and tension-peaks, they each should have been a bit shorter. It must be said, the film owes a lot of its impact and power to the performance of Tom Blyth as the charismatic and emotionally versatile Snow. I read a lot of harsh comments about the performance of Rachel Zegler, but I didn't think she was too bad. Could have done without the singing, admittedly.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Saw it opening night and I think it might be one of my favorite movies of the year. The casting was amazing, the story was super close to the book, the music beautiful. Everything about this movie was really well done. I read a couple of other reviews and I have to say that most who don't like this movie seem to never have like the hunger games in the first place. If you are a hunger games fan I really believe you'll enjoy this movie. The acting was superb -Snow was incredible and so was Lucy. I give it a 9/10 because there were some parts where it felt a little gimmicky and it was on the longer side. Overall, a super enjoyable movie. I'd definitely recommend if you liked anything about the original hunger games (books or movies). Idk how these reviews work but if you can lmk what you think.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

If they had to convince studio executives to green light the movie, or convince the actors to take the role. Describing the plot to someone makes it more interesting than the movie actually was. It somehow just doesn't culminate into something special.I was, in the slightest sense, excited for this because I'm a sucker for dystopian films. Starts off very dark and gloomy, depicting a war torn landscape and giving off an aura similar to that of the original hunger games movies. However we get to see this from a different perspective from those, we get to see it from inside the Capitol. I think it's good that it's made by the same people, so it felt consistent with the franchise. World building was great visually speaking, you still get the same classism and hierarchy and politics, but now from the inside. Not from the victims eyes but oppressors.Feels more more of an introduction to this world than I expected it to be, because we already knew the premise of these movies. I think it could've been better showing us the inaugural hunger games, not the 10th.I think it could've worked better if it didn't have a lead role, instead of it being Snow's background/origin story, (which I don't think was necessary) it could've been the hunger games themself's origin story. They were already a thing at this point. Loved seeing the origin of the ""hanging tree"" song though.They could've given Rachel Zeglar more to do, it felt like all they wrote her to do was sing. Oh she sings here, she sings there, she sings everywhere. Felt more repetitive than impactful (maybe it's because I'm not the biggest musical lover lol). Viola Davis was great, you can put her character up there with Amanda Wallis, just insane cold hearted characters. I wonder what happens with her Dr Volumnia Gaul character in the future. Peter Dinklage didn't have as much time as I expected but he made the most of it. Acting was great throughout the cast. Burn Gorman shows up in the last act, seems like he's made for such type of roles also. Type casting.I wish they didn't shy away from the gore and violence, but it was pg13 and action was still decent. It's not as quick paced but it's okay. Never had me at the edge of my seat as I expected. The one thing that actually annoyed me was there were so many moments when I was literally screaming ""run"" at the characters and they took so long to react.It is pretty long, but a lot happens to fill up the time. I liked that they divided it. The crappy thing is knowing that Snow survives, removes some thrill from it.I think it should've been better and more captivating. They had enough material to work with but it's just not as exciting. The characters weren't as easy to root for, I thought Rachel zeglar was great and did the most she could've done; but I just didn't feel taken in by her the way Jennifer Lawrence made katniss. She wasn't someone to root for and felt forgettable. It felt like they could've given her more to work with.Tom Blyth's portrayal of Snow was excellent, yet knowing the eventual transformation of the character into a tyrant in the future might have impacted the viewing experience. The attempt by the writers to hint at this evolution felt inconsistent with the character's present age and personality. It might have been more effective if they depicted him as a villainous, power-hungry individual masquerading as good, or just straight up good and thrown all their eggs in that basket. Instead, the portrayal fluctuated between moments of genuine goodness, power-hungry actions, and conflicting motivations. At times, he prioritized his family, while at others, he pursued power or seemed invested in his affection for Lucy Gray. The character's motivations seemed muddled, making it challenging for the narrative to balance these conflicting traits effectively.It wasn't the rise of snow, it was just his childhood, but they still wanted us to see the Snow we knew, if this was a trilogy I'd assume they couldve shown us the evil side of him in the sequel. That could've better and more easily shown good character development and arc, while it felt too squeezed in here.The movie is broken up into three parts and you'd expect them to be building up to something, but the last third is dull. Doesn't get better the more you watch it. And how it was separated made it feel like i was binge watching a series, which I think would've been a better adaptation than a movie. Someone said it felt like two movies in one because they were unsure of a sequel could happen.I think it's an okay entry to the hunger games franchise, it's a decent foundation for sequels but it just feels like it wasn't made the best it could've. It feels like an unnecessary reboot. It's not too bad but it's pretty far from being anything special, just lingers around being little better than mediocre for me. However I am still excited of what they can do from here with the sequels.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

Acting was okay but none of the actors had chemistry, the stakes didn't feel very high at any point, and the singing was both excessive and borderline comical in timing. The movie preached many times that viewers need someone to root for and someone to hate, whilst simultaneously doing the exact opposite by giving us neither.What made the original Hunger Games great was that you believed in the characters backstories, and you could get drawn into it. Snow and Casca felt real, but everyone else somehow felt like a caricature of a person. Kudos to both of these actors who did a phenomenal job, it just somehow wasn't cohesive with the other characters who felt somewhat 2-dimensional.Lucy in particular felt over-acted and I struggled to root for her - the chemistry with Snow falling particularly flat. Did I mention the singing was insanely overdone? In contrast, the brief screen time that Clemensia and Snow shared felt far more genuine and intriguing, and I would've liked to understand her and Snow's friendship more.Overall the movie felt messy and lacking in heart. I had been so excited for this movie for so long and was disappointed at how disconnected it felt. Whilst I understand that singing is woven throughout the book, this felt like one of those things that in a movie felt out of place. Perhaps it was the way it was acted, I'm not sure, but even as low budget as the 1st Hunger Games movie was.... I felt connected to the characters and their journey, which was not the case here.","209 out of 317 found this helpful.

This film is still interesting in terms of visuals, action scenes, characters (especially Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow and Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray Baird) and the brutalist architectural setting of The Capitol. The Ballad may not be as good as the Hunger Games trilogy but it quite stands out among the franchise and of course Rachel Zegler can sing.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.","571 out of 900 found this helpful.

At many points in the movie there seems to be an opportunity to look deeper into the psyche that drives Snow, but instead they only explore it at the surface level. Not sure yet if it's the script or the actor just didn't have the ability to deliver it.Viola Davis for me had the standout performance. She owned her character and was able to create the evil eery feeling of the Panem totalitarian state that the other characters weren't as successful in portraying as the original films. On the other side of things, Peter Dinklage seemed disinterested and didn't really offer much in his role.The overall filming quality and shots are quite good but of course a huge appeal to the Hunger games is seeing the stadium and for obvious reasons this one is a lot more basic than in previous movies.Hunger Games had a good run but I'm afraid the appeal/ interest of it has worn off a little bit over the years .","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

While it attempts to delve into the origins of the Hunger Games and the character of President Snow, the execution leaves much to be desired.One of the major drawbacks of the film is the pacing. The narrative feels sluggish, with long stretches of monotony that test the audience's patience. The attempt to build a complex character in President Snow falls short, as the film struggles to make him a sympathetic or even intriguing figure. Instead, he comes across as one-dimensional, lacking the depth and complexity that would have added layers to the story.The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes also suffers from a lack of emotional resonance. Unlike its predecessors, this installment fails to evoke the same level of empathy for the characters or a genuine connection to the dystopian world of Panem. The emotional beats feel forced, and the stakes don't seem as high, making it difficult for the audience to become fully invested in the unfolding events.Furthermore, the film's visual and cinematic elements are a letdown. The special effects and action sequences, which were once a highlight of the Hunger Games series, appear lackluster and uninspired in this installment. The film's visual style lacks the innovative flair that made the previous entries stand out, contributing to a sense of mediocrity.While some may appreciate the attempt to explore the darker corners of the Hunger Games universe, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience. It's a forgettable addition to the franchise, lacking the intensity and impact that made the original films so memorable. Fans of the Hunger Games series may find themselves disappointed by this lackluster ballad that, unfortunately, falls flat.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

There are some movies based on books where you can get away with not faithfully telling the story and still leave the viewer feeling like the story was told.... That did NOT work for this book to movie combo. While the movie was overly lengthy, it still didn't capture the essence of the story. What it captured was a lot of bad acting, particularly the female lead. Unlike the book, I couldn't get invested in any of the characters in the movie at all; didn't care who lived or died. The evolution of a marginally decent human being to a completely despot wasn't shown well by the movie at all. Maybe emotion behind that transformation is better written and read.... One thing is certain, the lead male actor just wasn't up to that kind of acting - he wasn't particularly good as it was.As a standalone movie, it's terrible; convoluted, overly lengthy, boring. As a prequel, it falls way short.... As an adaptation of a well written novel, an embarrassment.Feel sorry for folks who payed to see this poor adaptation.... Read the book! Unfortunately, the movie was so badly done, it likely put ppl off the book if they hadn't already read it.","12 out of 14 found this helpful.

But it worked out timewise, and I really want to make a concerted effort to see more films at the cinema this year, so I decided to risk it. I was surprisingly impressed with how complex the descent of Snow was handled.With his family near destitute, Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) is banking on graduating from the academy with the prestigious Plinth Prize, which would solve his families' problems. However, at the last moment he, and the rest of this class, are tasked with a final assignment. They each have to mentor a competitor in this years Hunger Games, the 10th annual event, the future of which is in doubt as people have stopped watching. Snow is placed with Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) a musical performer from district 12, who is charismatic and personable, but lacking the heart for the violence to come.So, I remembered enough to know that Snow would go on to be the President and antagonist of the later films, so I knew roughly where we were heading. I was surprised at how slowly paced and ... justifiable even ... the stages of his compromised heel turn were. I understand he's more of a monster from the beginning in the book and some people criticised this adaptation for that, but this has to be a more interesting way to go, and Tom Blyth does a good job of keeping things balanced. I liked a lot of the performances, with Viola Davis going big as the current games organiser and Peter Dinklage in a role that becomes more sympathetic as the films goes on.I don't think I'd argue against the film's other criticism though, that's it's long. I did feel its two and half hour run time. With the Hunger Games themselves competed around the halfway point in the film. I'd also say we could have done with a little more differentiation between the other competitors as I often wasn't sure who was who.I don't want to go overboard and over praise a film which does have some issues, but given I had almost no expectation going on, that it was a surprisingly complex and accomplished film, was a nice surprise.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The class divide has never been bigger and the desperation that makes people abandon all morals to ensure their success is such a clear through line in this story, even after the games are over.Whilst the film remains engaging throughout, the structure is a little weird. It's nicely divided into 3 chapters with two focusing on the games and one after which means the final third has to speed run Snow's growing villainy. The decision to keep it as one film was greatly appreciated however, either a slightly longer run time or splitting in two might have actually helped for once.Tom Blyth makes the role of Coriolanus Snow his own and is the only reason the complete change of character in the third act works, laying hints throughout that this side of him might have been there all along. Similarly, Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray creates a character who's the complete opposite of Katniss (extroverted, loves performing) and her singing is incredible.Josh Andrés Rivera is the moral centre and real tragedy of the film, a character too pure for the world he's born into. Viola Davis gives such a cartoonish performance in a way only an actor of her calibre could pull off and Jason Schwartzman is the best. He's the only one allowed to have fun with it, delivering the only jokes and continuing what Stanley Tucci started.When it comes to franchise reboots it's usually not a good idea to bring back the same guy who did the last ones but returning director Francis Lawrence does a great job. The practical and CG elements are blended together really well and it's helped massively by Uli Hanisch's production design which crafts a more analogue world with a stripped down Hunger Games.Similarly, returning composer James Newton Howard does another wonderful job. Callbacks are kept to a minimum and replaced with some epic tragedy that compliments the doomed romance whilst once again communicating the brutality of the games in a way the PG-13 rating still can't.","30 out of 62 found this helpful.

In this Games there's so many clues this is decades before the original Games movies were set with older technology in TV Monitors, cameras, architecture and even Peace Keepers uniforms (they don't look like Storm Troopers yet).It's got a 50's America vibe, which will tap in nicely to the current retro trend of everything old is new again in 2023.Jason Schwartzman plays the first ever host of The Hunger Games as ""Lucky Flickerman"" (Weatherman & Magician) is a scene stealer with some of the best lines.He is of course part of a media family dynasty that includes Caesar Flickerman (Stan Tucci) in the original four part trilogy.While not as polished as his Grandson he reminds everyone to ""smile..that's why you have teeth"" something Caesar took to heart with his cheesy Hollywood smile.Yet again the drones play a part in distributing water and other much needed supplies to the tributes, but it's new technology and they need to iron out a few bugs in these deadly drones.Every movie lately is divided into chapters with titles superimposed on the big screen.I blame the rise of Audiobooks, but I shouldn't complain because I've narrated a few.Listen out for: ""Can't Catch Me Now"" by Olivia Rodrigo in the closing credits.If you want to know how quickly civilisation disappears you've come to the right movie.Everything is about winning in The Hunger Games saga and this origins movie is no different.Enjoy the show...all 2 hrs 37 Minutes of epic Hunger Games action, adventure and drama.This will be one of the smash hits of Summer 2023!You are invited to return to the Games which have been a welcome addition to our movie universe for over a decade.You just know Snow will land on top, but it's also good to see Snow fall.","16 out of 42 found this helpful.

After ""The Hunger Games"" wrapped up with Mockingjay, I was done. I wasn't terribly impressed with the Mockingjay book or the movie. Then my daughters told me how good it was.OK, I'll bite.""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is an origin story of Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), later to be known as President Snow. When he was a youngster the districts went to war with the capital and lost, which gave birth to the Hunger Games. It was the Capital's way of punishing the districts for their rebellion.Snow was a small boy during the war, and a teenager in school when the Hunger Games were being ""played."" At that time the Hunger Games viewership was beginning to wane and Dr. Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), the gamemaster, wanted to do something to increase viewership. To do that, the upper class Capital students would have to be mentors to the newest batch of selectees for the tenth annual Hunger Games. Snow got Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) from District 12.Snow had more of an incentive than any other student to succeed with his underling. He and his family were totally broke and the Plinth Prize money was the only thing that could save them from homelessness and humiliation. He poured everything into helping the soulful Lucy Gray, but was it out of love, selfishness, or both?Even though ""Songbirds & Snakes"" was two hours and forty-five minutes long, it was enjoyable. I think I looked at my watch once towards the end. They somehow were able to make the actual Hunger Games (meaning the fight to survive) interesting though it was cruder and more rudimentary. Maybe my memory has failed me, but the prequel seemed more vicious, violent, and cutthroat. And that wasn't a bad thing. The performances were great and I think it even evoked more of an emotional response from the viewer. Snow was a mercurial character--sympathetic at times, cunning, smart, and maybe a little sinister. He was worth watching.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a ""mentor"" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10.","200 out of 312 found this helpful.

The direction, the score and the set/costume design are all reminiscent of the original movies. There was an anxious energy pulsing throughout the film, which made me think of Katniss, Peeta and the events that unfold 64 years in the future.The bond between the two leads in palpable, with both Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler) mirroring each other. Across the board, the characters were fascinating and had a depth to their motivations. This film is the origin story of a villain, and the filmmakers do not shy away from that fact.As is the case with many film adaptations of movies, some of the dialogue was a little stiff and ""book-ish"". Like the original books/movies, a lot of the names are outlandish and hard to remember; Coriolanus, Volumnia and Sejanus to name a few. While this doesn't detract from the film, it does take a minute to get used to some of the verbiage.A lot happens in the 2-hour 37-minute runtime of this movie. I'm not usually an advocate for breaking a film into two parts, but it might have been appropriate in this case. By the end of the second act, it felt like the story was wrapping up, only to have 53 minutes left to go. Wisely, the film uses title cards to break up the story into three acts (i.e., Part I: The Mentor) which helps with the pacing.Recently, there have been many attempts by big studios to revitalize beloved franchises. Most of these attempts have not met much critical acclaim (i.e., ""Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them""). This film is an outlier to that negative trend and feels like a story that needed to be told, rather than a cash-grab. The plot is thought-provoking and well-conceived, the characters are intriguing, and I left the theater wanting to re-watch the franchise again.Best Character: Coriolanus

It's a film after all.The first 1/3 of the movie starts off really well. We're instantly transported into the world, we learn about and connect with our main character, and the plot is set up, ready to go, potentially greatness awaits.Unfortunately, when the actual games starts, the writing just goes downhill, where in the cinema I actually shook my head with disappointment several times. The overall quality does actually pick up around 2/3, but out ending then crashing down to an overall 6/10.The writing, like a lot of tv and cinema these days, just let's it down. Moments that could be poignant become laughable, and I also feel (despite its long run time) certain parts, particularly connecting with anyone but our protagonist, we're very rushed.Lastly, Rachel Ziegler just isn't a very good actor. Almost all of her lines are delivered in exactly the same way, which is a shame as our lead I actually thought did a really good job.

It was too plain and same from what already been done and shown. I was very disappointed with zeglers performance. She just did not give that underdog girl that been through real suffering vibe. She felt too polished and not able to portray pain. Also her singing was not right. It felt like she showed off her ability more than actually conveying any emotions. That is what I liked about Lawrence, she can sing, but her singing was more about being Katniss and showing her emotions, not technique.I dont regret seeing it in the theaters, but adjust your expectations I'd say and you won't mind watching it either.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

""The Hunger Games"" is one of the most important dystopian series ever created because it's targeted towards young adults. This franchise is shaping young minds, it's an absolute wonder. Although I miss the frenzy that came with the movie during that era, I am so happy I get to experience a different story in the same universe. In ""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" Snow is the protagonist. A younger maybe more human version of Snow. This is the story about Lucy Gray, but don't get it confused, when the time comes this story can have only one main protagonist and that is Snow. I love everything Francis Lawrence brought to this movie, he knows how to craft them, set the setting and he knows how to navigate us through Panem. I really don't mind how this is a long movie because it's divided in three parts where every single one of them tells a different story about Snow. Every single one of them is essential in realising how he grew into the bloodthirsty,ruthless man that became the President of Panem. Rachel Zegler's Lucy Gray is nothing like Katniss but she has all fascinated with her charm. Viola Davis is so good an actor that she stole every single one of the scenes she is in. She's so fascinatingly evil. I feel like this movie brings a new perspective to the dystopian world of Panem, it brings a new insight in everything that lead to the events of the trilogy and a much needed insight I feel, to the philosophy of the Games as an event. I really am looking forward to reading the book, Suzanne Collins has done it again and I'm falling into the ""Hunger Games"" spiral once more.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I had not read the book deliberately, because I wanted to experience the film in its own right, rather than how faithfully it reproduced a written work. Regardless, it effectively chronicles the pivotal events in the nascent corruption of Coriolanus Snow.The horror of the actual Games is far more primitive, gritty and raw than before... much more like Thunderdome from the Mad Max franchise: ""Get to the weapons. Use them any way you can. I know you won't break the rules. There aren't any."" The sickness of this society is encapsulated by the fact that one of the Tributes is a young girl who appears to have Down's Syndrome. Try to wrap your head around that idea...I found the characters to be sufficiently developed for the purposes of the film's narrative. Folk music is interwoven into the movie, perfectly to effect: one of the main protagonists is a folk singer who expresses her emotions and defiance through song.The ""look and feel"" of this era of Panem is brilliant: a bizarrely familiar reimagining of mid-century modern motifs grotesquely blended with elements of the totalitarian architecture of the Third Reich. For those who know the actual photographic record of the latter, you will see numerous things in this film which echo that visual vocabulary, and not simply the sets.I'd recommend seeing this film: given the times we live in, it certainly is a thought-provoking journey.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Absolutely. The tone of this film is nearly identical to the rest; with its half-baked sets embodied by CGI, warm tones to portray the deceiving virtues of the Capital contrasted by cold tones to showcase the depleted nature of the districts, and the solo buildup of a character who expresses heroic mentalities. The problem that director Francis Lawrence runs into is trying to mimic Coriolanus Snow's journey with the story of Katniss Everdeen. The first 65% of the film is truly entertaining, however the predetermined outcome of this character is exposed by a choppy transition in the story arc in order to blend this film organically within the franchise. Tom Blyth gives a credible performance that is heightened by the fact that he's shown in 95% of the film, whereas Rachel Zegler pioneers the innovative approach of making this adaptation a musical. Similar to large IP franchises such as Marvel, DC, or Star Wars, there's an equal amount of moments to criticize as there are to enjoy, and I'm perfectly fine with that.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Capitol cannot trust the Districts, fearing their rebellion. The Districts do not trust the Capitol, their oppressors. The tributes cannot trust their mentors, who want to win but possibly at the tributes' expense. Students do not trust their peers because they are in constant competition. There aren't even true friendships in the Capitol. On and on, the movie portrays the absence of trust in a violent world-a Hobbesian state of nature where there is power and the powerless-and how directs people's actions and reactions.It is fitting, then, that the narrative thrust of the movie is storytelling. Each tribute is produced, as if they are on a perverse reality television show, displaying spectacle for entertainment, telling the story of their struggle for survival. One of the protagonists, Lucy, uses song as her storytelling tool. She wins the heart of the other main character, Coriolanus, and eventually the entire Capitol. But like every narrative tool, lyrics can be manipulated to portray a specific narrative, one that paints the singer in a specific, and often positive, light.Beyond the defiance and strong-willed nature that Lucy displays, there are moments throughout the movie where there's something untrustworthy about her, as if the entire movie itself is a retelling of events from Coriolanus's perspective. And with rose-tinted glasses he sees Lucy in particular light. That is until the moment his perspective changes. And it is such a jarring change, so abrupt that the audience is left confused about how Coriolanus could turn to hatred so quickly.But viewed with the lens of trust (and how the absence of trust affects a person's fight or flight response), Lucy keeps her cards close, only slightly letting her guard down with Coriolanus. And when she senses a lie, she immediately loses trust and returns to the character she was at the beginning, one willing to spin a narrative to survive. As a result, the trust Coriolanus placed in Lucy is ripped away, and his response is violence and hatred-both at Lucy and at a world that has wronged him since he was a child, a world he can't trust.With the parting words of President Snow at the end of the movie, the audience can view Coriolanus as the silent narrator, the person upon who's experience this story is based. He may be an untrustworthy narrator, not dwelling on his own failures and inability to grow as a character. But he ultimately displays a very human reaction to the loss of trust: vengeance. Within revenge in mind, he then becomes the villain of The Hunger Games trilogy (making this an origin story more than a pure prequel).","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was fresh and new and Katniss Everdeen was a great movie character.A side character in that trilogy ( 4 films ) was President Snow, this film is a prequel to the original films showing him in his youth before his rise to power.The film is split into 3 parts.Part 1 - is an introduction to Snow and his friends/fellow students and also the tributes of the 10th hunger games.Part 2 - is the 10th Hunger games
Part 3 - is how Snow starts his journey to becoming the looming dictator he becomes in the OT.This is why the film really fails to deliver.Part 1 is lacking in development and introduces way to many characters although the focus here is Snow and Lucy Gray Baird, her first name is ' Lucy Gray ' not just Lucy.Played by Rachel Zegler she is the antipathy of Katniss, her strengths are singing and charm centred around an aloof but colourful character.Of course Snow is mesmerised.Part 2 centres around the 10th Hunger games where viewing figures and interest have been waning to the point this could be the last. Thats right the central part of this show is just how lacklustre the Hunger Games have become. A fairly small old building is the arena for this and yes its dull and boring, this makes what should be a beautiful climax, just seem lifeless.Part 3 is a long winded prologue covering punishment for Snow his ostracism from the capitol and then his return... by this point however you may have stopped caring.Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage appear fleetingly, Viola steals the limelight every time. Tom Blyth is good as Snow, a snakey but transient young man. Zegler uses her singing talents well but is more of a romantic supporting interest than a winning hero.Dinklage I felt was underused as were the majority of the rest of the cast.Overall there is an interesting story there but it wasn't told in an interesting way and I can't think of any really good or stand out re watchable moments. It was very studio set/green screen throughout and it felt like there was little chemistry between the actors.A 5 or 6 out of 10 for me.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I purposefully did not read the book for this movie, because I like to read the books after. While the rating seems good, I'm not understanding the large number of negative reviews.The Hunger Games is YA - it seems a lot of people are expecting something different. The school setting of the trainers and Viola Davis's character felt very appropriate for the genre, and so did the immature characters. The melodrama between them, and the general focus was exactly as expected. The movie has a PG-13 rating, so while it is a dark story, the violence is toned down. This is not Game of Thrones, despite Peter Dinklage being there. I suspect the lack of intensity might have been an issue in expectations for some. In addition, the games themselves are only one part, rather than the main focus of the film. This is not a sequel meant to relive the original trilogy. Those books and movies stand alone. That saga is complete.However, if you focus on the message and themes, much of the story is actually very striking. Snow is a realistic villain, which is exactly the point. It also occurs in the time of his life when these character developments really occur. He is never a completely sympathetic character because that would not be believable. From the beginning, we can see that he is strategizing more than caring, in contrast to many of his classmates, especially his friend, Plinth. In fact, he is a star mentor right away, attracting the attention of the head game maker, played by Viola Davis. The story is well crafted, and I'm so excited to now fill in the blanks by reading the book. There are indeed hints at unanswered questions.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I thought it was a decent (though bland) movie but it did feel like a long movie to me at times. I wondered when it was going to end which to me rarely is a good sign.The movie is made up of three acts if I remember correctly. I get the idea and it's not neccessarily bad but to me it felt like they were trying to smush together a bit too much in one movie. Since they have three acts to go through they can't get too detailed in each act. I felt like the hunger games for example were too quick and they didn't really put enough energy into it. It felt a bit vapid to me to be quite honest. The other acts also could be more detailed to get an even bigger feel for the characters.I would have prefered if the last act was it's own movie since it in a lot of moments felt rushed. I would have liked to see more character developement since the characters to me just over night became vastly different. To have a movie that picks up after the games and followed Snow's, Lucy Grey's and the other characters dealing with what happened would to me be better. That way you can properly explore the events and people.All in all the movie was decent but a bit bland to me. I didn't neccessarily dislike it. I have to say the actors did a great job though.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's a personal opinion, of course, but I just find her entire disposition offputting. They could've found someone better for this role. The other actors were good This being a prequel, the technology wasn't as complex as the other hunger, games movies and so if you enjoy that aspect of the series, it's definitely missing from this one. It was very interesting to see the development of the Snow character.

That being said, I highly recommend picking up the book (yes it is in fact the longest one yet).TBSS was a long overdue return to Panem and was a story that was well received by the screen. Cinematically, the movie had some amazing shots and close ups that superseded its predecessors. This is in no doubt thanks to the almost ten years that have elapsed since the last installment in the franchise.As for chemistry, the tension between Blyth and Ziegler was alive and well and really took over during the evening visit to the zoo. Ziegler delivered nothing less than a stellar performance through every song, even though I initially thought there were one too many original songs in the book (sorry Collins). The soundtrack makes for a great transportation back to the movie after having seen it, though the downfall is that it does not stand alone like the previous soundtracks in the franchise did. Oh, how I wish Lorde had returned, or even Coldplay.In regard to its faithfulness to the book, the movie did a decent job of retaining the truth from its source material. The only major complaint I had was the extreme passage of time during the third part. At the same time, I argue the lengths at which Collins spent in that third part could have been cut shorter, so I understand the choice to skip over some sections. There was also a lack of development regarding Corio's and Sejanus' friendship. It felt very low stakes and was probably underdeveloped due to the lack of time spent in Part 3. I also have to argue that the last scene (you know the one I'm talking about) was a forced perspective of Snow's, so the audience can only help but think he's in the right, that is unless you've read the book and can understand his irrational paranoia. I also believe there was some essential dialogue cut that Casca Highbottom says at the end that explains Snow's motivations. Alas they got most of the book right, enough for me not to notice anything else.Overall, The Balls of Songbirds & Snakes delivered on almost every promise that the previous Hunger Games movie couldn't. We saw plenty of the Capitol. The director/writer did a wonderful job at humanizing the tributes, something the other movies failed at, which is very meta as they talk about trying to do so in the very book itself. The movie did well being split into three separate parts, once again nodding to the source material. Even without the internal dialogue offered by the book, Blyth's downward spiral into the president we came to know back in 2012 was honest and believable. I enjoyed the nods to previous books and movies and certainly enjoyed the cameo at the end. I am not one to see movies twice in the theaters, but this one might deserve a second go.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

With hindsight, it's the political vision infused in The Hunger Games that is most striking. Panem reflects a vision of the United States where a small group of economic, intellectual and artistic elites live extravagantly in rich cities, devoid of true human values, while the rest of the country lives in poverty, working hard and sustaining traditional values and human authenticity. Whether you share this vision or not, it is hard to disagree that it reflected well-ahead of its time a political view that millions of Americans (and others in the world) would embrace a few years later.Now, eight years after the last installment in the series, a prequel is released that tells the origin story of the franchise villain, Coriolanus Snow. Let it be said that the film succeeds in building an engaging story about the development of this character, one that is full of action, excitement and well-crafted character development. However, more than Snow's origin story, it's the origin story of Panem and the Capitol that catches our attention, given the strength of the political message in the first four films. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we are presented with a Capitol that looks very different from the one seen in the previous films. Instead of the extravagant town reflective of liberal cities in the US, we see a grey city, built in massive concrete structures, that is highly reminiscent of the image we have of Soviet or Eastern European communist cities in the 70's and 80's. The structures, the clothes, the sculptures towering over giant squares, the cars, the propaganda posters are all reflective of communist imagery. That is ultimately the subversive political message infused into this prequel: the behavior and decadence of the Capitol (and by extension of liberal American cities) has its roots in communism. For anyone who understood the political message in the first four films and its connection with some political views in America, this conclusion is not unexpected, but it is certainly a bit disturbing to see it so prominently displayed in such a mass-market oriented movie targeting the young.In the spirit of open-mindedness and democratic values, one can still choose to appreciate and enjoy the film without agreeing with its political message (something many are unable to do these days). There is for example no doubt that the Soviet imagery creates an amazing visual experience, in particular with the representation of a hunger games arena that is visually impactful and very different from the one in previous installments.Ultimately, The Hunger Games is an exciting franchise and this new installment is no exception. And whether you agree with its political vision or not, history has told us that it has had a way of being ahead of its time, and therefore that it is worth listening to.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.","98 out of 152 found this helpful.

It's now the tenth annual Hunger Games and viewership is down. Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) is one of the Academy students selected to mentor a tribute. His tribute is Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). Dr. Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis) runs the Games and Casca Highbottom (Peter Dinklage) created them.The Games are less flashy and more gritty. They are basically fighting inside a coliseum. I'm not completely sure that Tom Blyth matches up with Donald Sutherland. He can become Sutherland. There is an instability with Sutherland's acting that is still missing from Blyth. Rachel Zegler is a superior singer and she fits the role. As a stand alone, this is perfectly fine. My issue is that I've fallen out with the franchise. It started out well, but each subsequent sequel has given declining returns. I'm not looking for a prequel or a sequel. Aside from JLaw, I'm not looking for any more from this franchise period.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The war still lays fresh in the minds of Capital citizen as the rebuild begins, yet the spirit of rebellion still lives in the Districts. Nobody has a full grasp on how to handle the controversial Hunger Games, or even if it will continue, yet the show goes on. IThen comes a young Coriolanus Snow, who revolutionizes the way the Games are approached while mentoring a young girl from District 12, Lucy Gray Baird. Here, the sadistic and narcissist mindset of the President Snow we love to hate is born. His keen insight and manipulative attitude develops into a killing spree born of a deep hunger for power.Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage are brilliant as usual. Not impressed with Rachel Zegler as lead actress (she is no Jennifer Lawrence after all), but Tom Blyth as Snow heads the cast well and encapsulates the persona of President Snow subtly as the film continues.Like I said, any novice Hunger Games fan can enjoy the fascinating and intriguing parallels between this film and the iconic trilogy. While it can never be compared to its successor, ""The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes"" brings justice to the Suzzane Collins' world.Yes, it's drawn out a bit in the middle... get over it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This effort felt overlong, I really can't see why they couldn't have told exactly the same story in 45 minutes less. There's too much filler and needless scenes that,if anything, should have been used to develop the characters more.The singing became a distraction and was overused, the violence was almost fetishised, with too much time and effort put into it at the expense of the relationships between the key characters. Plot twists and turns were never particularly explored or explained, and felt pretty arbitrary. I am guessing the book provides far greater depth than was achieved in this film.The lead actors never really achieved great chemistry and their relationship was, again pretty shallow to begin with,and wasn't given adequate time to grow and evolve.I can't say I hated the movie but I'd definitely not rush to watch it again, I doubt I'll remember much about it in a couple of weeks time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We get an origin story, of sorts, of President Coriolanus Snow. What the filmmakers are able to show us in only one movie reminded me of Anakin's plunge into the Dark Side that took place in 3 of the Star Wars films.This movie is directed by Francis Lawrence who also directed 3 of the other Hunger Games movies. It's designed as a prequel to the 2012 Hunger Games film. It's supposed to take place 64 years prior.The dramatic film was written by Michael Lesslie, Michael Arndt, and Suzanne Collins. Because they were able to secure an interim agreement from SAG-AFTRA, they were able to market the movie during the 2023 actors' strike.THINGS I LIKED:
Rachel Zegler is so beautiful and has such a lovely voice! She sang all of her songs live on set! I'm excited to see her in Snow White in 2025! She and fellow co-star, Josh Andres Rivera, met while filming the 2021 movie West Side Story together. They're actually dating in real life!Tom Blyth does a great job as Coriolanus Snow. It's fascinating to watch the story unfold when we already know how he ends up in later films. Dexter Sol Answell is completely adorable as the young Coriolanus.Academy Award winner Viola Davis won the role of the villain in this prequel after director Francis Lawrence saw a sinister meme of her that a fan had posted online! She's excellent, of course.I really liked seeing Jason Schwartzman slowly develop the skills he would need later as the flashy Lucretius ""Lucky"" Flickerman.All of the characters are well defined and it's easy to quickly feel something for them. The cast includes Peter Dinklage, Burn Gorman, Fionnula Flanagan, Pliny Harrington, Festus Creed, and many more.The set designs are outstanding.Cool special effects.The movie definitely isn't a musical, yet music plays a big role in the film and perfectly fits the title of the film. I didn't expect to hear so much music in this! I know, that's silly since the word ""ballad"" is in the title! I really enjoyed the musical element in the storyline. It gave a real down-to-earth feeling, and the lyrics showed us how much changed and how much remained the same in the districts.I love that costume designer Trish Summerville included Katniss and Primrose flowers on it as a respectful nod to the previous Hunger Games movies. Nice touch!There are several references to the previous films such as when Lucy Gray curtsies at the ceremony like Katniss did in the 2012 movie.I haven't read the book, but I hear it's a very good adaptation!It's fun to see how the Hunger Games were more amateur in the beginning compared to the glossy veneer they acquired over the decades.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Many of the scenes are visually dark, so it'll be hard to see everything that's going on if you watch this on a small streaming device once the film goes to Video on Demand.It seemed ridiculous that Lucy Gray Baird had a beautiful, colorful, and expensive-looking dress while living in a poor district. It was pretty though!Some of the actors deliver lines mechanically.It drove me nuts when Lucy Gray Baird would just sit instead of run away. She seemed super cocky considering she wasn't a very good fighter.All of the characters looked normal, but Viola Davis was so over the top and seemed out of place.While the movie is a prequel to the original trilogy, it's not an origin story of the actual Hunger Games.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Violence with various weapons and hand-to-hand combat
Explosions and destruction
Some blood and gore
We see people die.If you don't like snakes, you're going to be very uncomfortable watching some of the scenes.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

However, the absence of exploration into Lucy Grey's character, possibly related to Katniss Everdeen, felt like a missed opportunity. Initially thinking Snow was her father added to the confusion. The focus solely on Snow's story left Lucy Grey's role largely unexplored, and her country-like singing style seemed out of place, disrupting the movie's flow. The film's pacing felt extended, making it dull and failing to engage with some characters that should have received more attention.

This prequel delves deep into the rise of Coriolanus Snow and the origins of his tyrannical persona. Tom Blyth delivers a truly star-making performance, flawlessly portraying Snow's transformation from a privileged youth to a manipulative leader.The script, with its subtle supervillain origin story, brilliantly showcases Snow's increasing control through calculated decisions. The chemistry between Blyth and Rachel Zegler, who plays tribute Lucy Gray Baird, adds an incredible amount of tension and depth to the narrative.The film's third chapter is a standout, taking us to a lush forest setting and building exquisite tension between Snow and Lucy Gray. The cinematography beautifully captures both romance and danger, keeping us on the edge of our seats.The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a suspenseful prequel that masterfully explores how Snow's path to power unfolds. It offers a fresh and captivating perspective on the beloved Hunger Games universe.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

I was honestly surprised by the reveals in this narrative of Snow which shows that he is far more worldly than I took him for initially. The layers of intrigue include speculation on whether Snow was a victim of happenstance or if an influencer manipulated his life from behind the scenes. Hhhmmmm....this circumstance is never revealed, but it can be implied from the way the narrative unfolds. On the one hand, Snow is young and ambitious. On the other hand, he is somewhat naive and impressionable.

The smaller arena contributes to an intense atmosphere, maintaining a delicate balance between avoiding explicit deaths and ensuring a family-friendly rating. The contextualization of the early games adds an intriguing layer, highlighting the evolution from the initial to the final games in the original saga.The protagonists, notably Lucy and the nuanced portrayal of the young President Snow, add depth and memorability to the narrative. Despite limited development, secondary characters establish a connection with the audience, eliciting a range of emotions. The film introduces a darker atmosphere not present in the original saga, with memorable scenes like the eerie mockingjays repeating the last words before public executions.However, the second part, while interesting for narrative development, feels rushed, leaving room for a more thorough exploration of characters and consequences. This critique suggests that splitting the narrative into two films could have enhanced the depth of the second part, allowing for additional scenes to intensify the storyline. The justifications for President Snow's personality change, although present, are portrayed quickly and lack convincing depth. Despite these shortcomings, the film stands out for its impactful first part, rivaling or even surpassing key scenes from the original two films.","14 out of 38 found this helpful.

I think the first two films are genuinely fantastic which still holds up really well despite the overindulgent 3rd and 4th films disappointing me. I've been excited for this film since it was announced cause I just love the world that's been created for this series and I really enjoyed the book of Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. While the film itself isn't free from all the book's shortcoming, I still really enjoyed seeing another movie set in this world.The great world building from the original trilogy continues to be a massive positive here. I loved the retro-futuristic aesthetic and this film manages the capture the inherent terror that comes from this premise. This is something the f original excelled at and none of the sequels quite recaptured. The tension leading up to the start of the games is so well captured, it's terrifying to put yourself in the situation of these characters and it's exceedingly more gritty and graphic than any of the other movies. There were more genuinely disturbing moments than I expected there to be, even having read the book, and it's by far the darkest entry in the franchise.I really liked the tone of this movie. It's a villain origin first and foremost and the script takes its time to develop this twisted romance and how it leads to the downfall of Snow as a person. We're definitely not watching Jennifer Lawrence's character and Tom Blyth does such a good job at giving small hints to the ferocious nature of this character. He's great and so is Rachel Zegler in what I think may be my favourite performance from her. She's a great singer, (we knew that from West Side Story) which this character does a lot of, she's great in all the action scenes and her chemistry with Blyth phenomenally realises the growing wedge between this pair until it comes to ahead very well I think.Like the novel, I do think it's a bit long in the tooth. At over 2 and a half hours there's a lot of material being explored and it can make the first two acts feel quite scatter shot. The first act in particular feels a bit too quick cut, the second act isn't quite a tight as it could've been and the third act takes quite a sudden turn which I was prepared for but did feel a bit jarring. I did think reading the book that an adaption could lend itself better to a miniseries and having seen the film now I don't necessarily think I was wrong in that belief.I also think the characters as a whole are a bit of a mixed bag. I loved the central pair, Peter Dinklage's character and Viola Davis' deliciously over the top villain but most of the others were fairly one note. Josh Andrés Rivera's character was a high point from the book but I don't think he's that well realised here. I found him quite naive and not in an endearing way to the point where I didn't really care much when he was on screen. Most the students characters are just there to be classist caricatures without much depth and the tributes get some nice moments but it's obvious they're not the focus.It's definitely indulgent and scattershot but as a fan of the book and this series as a whole, I really enjoyed The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes as an adaptation. It's considerably darker than most YA adaptions, not to mention more graphic, and I could be more critical of certain aspects but as a fan I just couldn't help but enjoy the experience of this movie. I would comfortably put this as my 3rd favourite Hunger Games movie and if we don't get anymore this is without the best adaption of a YA movie series we've had since the Harry Potter franchise.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A perfect adaptation of the novel - one of the best entries in the series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9439174/?ref_=tt_urv","parksiet","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73501762/?ref_=tt_urv","17 November 2023","The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is by far one of the best entries in The Hunger Games franchise! A perfect adaptation of the novel, it expands on its dark dystopian world with rich costumes, stunning art direction, an epic score, and a sense of scale and scope that's fitting for this prequel about the rise of President Snow. And it's so much richer than dystopian young adult adaptations are usually ever allowed to be! I'm struggling to remember the last time a prequel was this much better and more interesting than the rest of its franchise. I love the nuanced, darker story that is more of a character study than anything which was so well executed by returning director Francis Lawrence in this colder prequel. He brought new life to the franchise with his masterful take on Catching Fire, and did it once again with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, delivering a darker, more sinister version of the Games through Snow's perspective that is ten times better than it has any right to be.Significantly more intimate and grounded than the previous Hunger Games movies (despite being longer than any of them and responsible for seeding all of their lore), The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is the rare prequel that manages to stand on its own two feet and still feel taller than the other stories it's ultimately meant to support.But the real star is the cast. They crush it. Rachel Zegler truly shines and is super captivating in this. If you thought she was good in West Side Story, just wait until you see her here! Plus she gets to show off her incredible singing skills multiple times! I really loved her here, she truly is a star on the rise. Her character Lucy Gray is very different from Katniss, (Katniss was a fighter forced to perform, Lucy Gray is a performer forced to fight) and the tense, twisty dynamics between Lucy and Tom Blyth's Coriolanus are a treat to watch. Tom Blyth is a standout, selling Snow's moral ambiguity/decay with such a subtle, nuanced, and gifted performance. Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage are powerhouses and wildly compelling, as they usually are. Davis' character in particular is so devious, and it's so marvelous to watch. Plus this film has one of the 3 best Jason Schwartzman performances of the year - he's hilarious in this!With high stakes, solid action, and killer performances, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a thrilling return to Panem, assisted by some excellent production design and the return of memorable motifs/themes in the musical score. I love that so many people who worked on the original films came back for this one, really helping to make it all feel cohesive with the other films (especially thanks to James Newton Howard's excellent score)! This is purely grand, epic storytelling. It's long for sure, but doesn't drag. It works well by doing something fairly different from the first series, taking on a unique story structure that most studios would try to separate into a two-part movie. But I'm so glad they didn't split this up, and it still came out as such a faithful adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel. I loved this film! My sister, who doesn't love movies, loved this film (said it's the longest she's ever been compelled by a movie)! It's genuinely a very fair candidate for the best film in The Hunger Games franchise, either as good as or better than Catching Fire! The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a magnificent film that not only excels in its own right, but also enriches the original franchise that is it now a part of. If you loved The Hunger Games, you can't miss this!It's the things we love most that destroy us.","12 out of 33 found this helpful.

It is set 64 years before the events of The Hunger Games(2012). Coriolanus Snow(Tom Blyth) mentors District 12 tribute, Lucy Gray Baird(Rachel Zegler). Soon, he develops feelings for her.The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a good film. However, The Hunger Games(2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014) & The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2(2015) surpass this prequel by a huge margin. Director Francis Lawrence can't recapture lightning in a bottle, directing his fourth movie in the Hunger Games franchise. The first half of the film is mind-blowing. However, it goes off the rails in the second half. The movie gets super dragging & goes on & on, with no end in sight. Another negative is, there are too many songs for a Hunger Games film. The action set pieces are fantastic & look even better in IMAX. The visual effects are flawless. Tom Blyth is impressive as Coriolanus Snow. Rachel Zegler is brilliant as Lucy Gray Baird. Hunter Schafer is perfect as Tigris Snow. Viola Davis is spectacular as Dr. Volumnia Gaul. Peter Dinklage is outstanding as Dean Casca Highbottom. Josh Andres Rivera is superb as Sejanus Plinth. The supporting cast is unforgettable. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is worth a watch if you're a fan of the Hunger Games movies & novels. However, watch it with low expectations & you just might enjoy yourself.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, from the end of the event it truly does drop off a cliff out of nowhere. The film gives you a major high of action with the games, then drops the tempo down to such a slow first act-esque pace that it feels extremely tacked on.I did enjoy the cast throughout, mostly. Tom Blyth is excellent, first time I've seen him properly in a film and I was very impressed; though even his performance suffers with the aforementioned, which for him is from the point that he becomes The Real Slim Shady, seemingly (his originally look is so much better). Still, I'm eager to see that guy act further.Rachel Zegler is largely good, though does chew the scenery quite a bit in parts; predominantly when singing. Viola Davis is great, while Peter Dinklage is underused but still a positive. Jason Schwartzman and Josh Andrés Rivera, meanwhile, are solid enough supports.Just a shame about the final act. It's not necessarily that bad in itself, but to lower the pace that sharply after such prolonged thrill is a recipe for disaster. So much so that it makes the whole part drag hard, or perhaps 'twas just so for me?","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

So when I turned the final page of Hunger Games: The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes, I was looking forward to the movie much more than I expected to before I started reading the book.Thankfully The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes is another strong and faithful adaptation. We return to the capital 65 years before the events of original Hunger Games films and a few years after the Panem Civil War. We meet a young Cornelius Snow shortly before he and his Capitol class mates mentor tributes in the 10th Annual Hunger Games. We then embark on a three part character study.Firstly, the Capitol looked great. It's not the over the top, bright, excessive and indulgent Capitol we are used to. It's dark and gritty but also a futuristic city seeking to make technological advances. There are times when the CGI is shaky for example when we see cockroaches, rats or explosions but otherwise the film looks great. I especially enjoyed some of the camera work and the interesting use of angles that brought us closer to the action.Viola Davis and Pinter Dinklage were excellent in their roles as Dr Gaul and Dean Highbottom whilst Jason Schwartzman was fantastic as Lucky Flickerman, the movie's only comic relief as weatherman and host of the Hunger Games. The two leads will likely draw several different opinions. They weren't perfect but still had aspects that worked. Tom Blyth played a good Cornelius Snow although it is hard not to think about how majestic Donald Sutherlund is as a older more Powerful Snow. Rachel Zeglar has a great voice which is fully on display as Songbird Lucy Grey Baird, the female tribute from District 12. I wasn't fully sold on other aspects of her performance. That being said, If I had to recast one character in the Hunger Games franchise it would still be Peeta. The chemistry between the leads was questionable at times but perhaps that is to be expected when a boy from the Capitol meets a girl from District 12?I enjoyed the story when I read the book and it was represented well on screen. The movie builds on the lore of The Hunger Games and especially the background of Cornelius Snow in a way that helps us to interpret the originally trilogy in a much more profound way. Director Francis Lawrence originally wanted to split the movie in two but I'm glad it ended up being one movie. However, this resulted in a runtime of 2 hours 37 minutes. The movie squeezed a lot into this time which mostly worked well although there were a couple of instances where I questioned things which happened on screen which I didn't question when reading the book because I had more information available to me at the time. So those who haven't read the book may find it stuffed and the weight of certain scenes may not have the intended impact.The action is fun and brutal at times. At no point did I feel as if they we were catering to a younger audience. This Hunger Games was set in standard oval stadium in the times before the elaborate settings of the future games. This resulted in a larger focus on close combat and hiding which I enjoyed.Overall, The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes is another well adapted Hunger Games movie. Its dark, gritty and more importantly it tells a standalone story but also a story that enhances our understanding of Cornelius Snow and allows us to view the original trilogy in a way that adds additional layers to the viewing experience. It's a long film and has a lot going on which may not cater to everybody. Highly recommended to fans of the Hunger Games.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

However, my experience diverged from the majority. Surprisingly, the film adopted a musical format, with frequent song interludes, leading to an unexpected blend of genres. This stylistic choice felt more akin to a children's movie than the gritty dystopian atmosphere I had come to expect from the series.The narrative's conclusion felt ambiguous and somewhat unsatisfying, leaving several questions unanswered. Additionally, I found it challenging to establish a deep connection with the characters, which impacted my overall engagement with the story.In summary, while 'The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes' showcased some interesting concepts, it diverged significantly from the tone of its predecessors. This departure resulted in a film that, to me, felt average and slightly disappointing. Despite my love for the series, if given the choice again, I might hesitate to watch this installment. It's a film that might intrigue fans curious about a different take on the Hunger Games universe, but it may not resonate with those seeking the intensity and drama of the original trilogy.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

When injustice is a new, people are supposed to be more angry, less accepting of it. Katniss was appropriately angry and defiant, whereas Lucy Gray was immediately giddy (i guess we are meant to interpret it as hippie freespirit i-love-all-peoples charm), and flirting with an agent of the state that has literally reaped her into an arena to kill her. Think of how much it would take to justify why a Jewish girl might even consider thinking of an SS soldier in a romantic light, and how little this story did to that end. The trust and romance between two characters from opposing sides of a fascist occupation has to OVERCOME that very tall barrier to earn any Rebel's trust. However even though the fact that Snow is doing it for personal gain was established, it was kind of ignored to continue this bizzare unearned romance.I am also okay with the premise that not every person in a fascist system is born evil, and showing the descent of a regular citizen into this kind of evil. However, living and participating every day in a fascist state has to impact your soul that ends up showing in small ways, casual dehuminisation of the Panem citizens, growing paranoia as the bombs start, disdain for the rebels etc. Which other characters in the academy and Grandma Snow does. But exceptionally, Snow was shown to be upstanding and moral throughout the movie except in the end with a abrupt descent into betraying his friend, all the while romancing a Panem citizen outside the district borders. It was so forced, and why?? We already knew that Snow would become evil, so why not show us how it happened in a believable manner (maybe show that his time as a peacekeeper interacting with D12 citizens allowed him to dehumanize them or something..), instead of rushing it as a ""twist"" at the very end of a very long movie? Every story in THG was a self contained plot that will be developed upon it, but this one felt like a botched incomplete story to that is built as a premise for sequels to the prequel.","10 out of 12 found this helpful.

Blyth nailed the portrayal of a young Snow, adding layers to the character, while Zegler's was rapturous as Baird.Despite the commendable performances, the storyline lacked the depth needed for a more fulfilling experience.

At the TBOSAS core, it is a story about Coriolanus' view of humanity and him ultimately coming to the conclusion, as is the point of the games, that humans are inherently evil and the world is cruel. In a cruel world with malevolent beings filling it, why not be the man in charge? Why not be cruel right back to the world and kill and starve others? This story shows Coriolanus get to this state of mind, however misguided his cognitive journey may be. It is the story of a man losing any semblance of morals he had and losing his own humanity in order to become the powerful villain of the main trilogy. 100% worth the watch (even if you did not read the book).","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

Even the lead character Lucy could just let a sick girl drinking a poisonous water without doing anything even though the arena was clear, in my opinion at least.We are supposed to have something to hold on to when watching this, and I don't supposed it could be those mentors, who could just stand still seeing everyone killed each other as a career without no remorse.I remembered the passion watching Hunger Games came from Katniss' spirit of fighting, and also her compassion. Even at the most desperate moments, she still tried to find a way to save the one next to her. I think that's what make the horrible games could light a bit of hope.But in this movie, it just became meaningless. I don't think the singing at the end of the game could turn us to be more sympathetic. I don't know whether the games itself were designed to be more underrated in this franchise, but the characters themselves didn't exactly try to make us root for them.And also the sequence somehow didn't make sense, how could one fall in love easily with someone who just watched her fighting over her life the whole time? Not to mention to be a watching material by the whole nation.. At least there should be a little grudge or hate emotion at first, but no... Lucy and Snow seemed not to be able to keep their eyes off of each other from the very beginning.At least for me, it just made the story less natural, it seemed to be forced to fit the purpose of Snow and the plot just made it become less likeable from the start. It was supposed to be a heroic fight (games), instead we were served with typical teenage romance.","18 out of 24 found this helpful.

'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' should have been a series rather than a 150-minute movie. Francis Lawrence has so many things to tell and maintains the pace of the story, but at the last minute starting from 'Part 3: The Peacekeeper', he crams all those and develops so hastily that I am short of breath just by watching. What's with all the sudden change of emotions from all characters and rushed progress of plot? It loses all coherence and logic along the way.Ironically, this film makes me realize that Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Donald Sutherland trio is the best you can ask for. Lawrence and Hutcherson were about the same age and had similar duration of acting experience as Zegler and Blyth when they started the first movie of the Hunger Games franchise. They were brilliant and passionate afresh. Zegler's performance is especially disappointing.However, just like any other Hunger Games, the film offers exciting and spirited adventure, drama, and energy. The plot development for Part 1 & 2 is not bad.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Could not stand Lucy Gray as a character, she weirdly kept breaking into song. NO comedic relief whatsoever. All characters were poorly developed, and for the most part unlikeable.

Directed by Francis Lawrence, this prequel takes us back to the grim universe of Panem, zeroing in on the early days and transformation of the infamous villain, Coriolanus Snow.The star-studded cast is without a doubt the film's shining glory. Viola Davis, as the fearsome game-maker Dr. Gaul, and Peter Dinklage, as the tired and corrupt Dean Highbottom, deliver performances that are both gripping and nuanced. Despite some off-screen drama, Rachel Zegler shines through with undeniable talent in her role as Lucy Gray Baird, the tribute from District 12.However, the film isn't without its flaws. The pacing is all over the place; the movie tends to drag on at times with lengthy dialogues and expositions that disrupt the flow, making it less engaging. The film also struggles to deliver clear thematic elements. The exploration of power, privilege, and moral decay gets lost in the expansive plot and a large roster of characters, leaving audiences with a jumbled mix of messages.Fans of the ""The Hunger Games"" series will find parts of the prequel enjoyable, especially the trip back to the well-loved world of Panem. But, it does raise questions about whether this deep dive into backstory was needed. The movie starts with a strong premise of showcasing the rise of a great villain but loses steam as it progresses, watering down the impact of Snow's transformation.While the plot is solid and could stand alone, the narrative stumbles in its attempt to meet its lofty goals. The screenplay also occasionally lets the film down. Some attempts to capture the depth and grandeur of the original material fall short, leading to scenes that feel forced and, unfortunately, that undermine the overall impact of the film.In short, ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is a film that shows promise but delivers inconsistently. Despite some stellar performances and a compelling story, it's let down by its pacing, muddled themes, and a screenplay that doesn't always hit the mark.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In addition there are beautiful settings throughout the film as well as costumes which sometimes fit perfectly with the nature and character of the characters, in particular the different looks of Lucy Gray Baird correspond well to her rebellious and extroverted nature.However, the warrior spirit of Katniss, absent in the film due to the time jump, creates a void in the film. Indeed, despite her rebellious aspect, for me, the character of Lucy failed to match Katniss.On the other hand, there are moments in the film that I find a little long, particularly during Lucy's different songs. These moments reminded me of a bit of a musical... I think there are too many songs during the film.Then, I find that there is too big a ""temporal gap"" with regard to the costumes between the film and the main saga (with Jennifer Lawrence) which is seen in particular in the different looks (clothes, hairstyle and makeup) citizens of the capitol. I know that the gap between the two is still big (64 years) but in the film (The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes) the citizens of the capitol have looks that are more in the theme of the 60s so that in the main saga they have very extravagant and futuristic looks.However, we do find the premises of the futuristic technology of the main saga in the film, particularly with the first parachutes via the sponsorship system during the Hunger Games.Overall it's a pretty good prequel to understanding the history behind the Hunger Games saga and one of its main antagonists : President Snow.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The arena for the 10th Hunger Games is much smaller and not near as scenic which in a way makes the violence more raw, and the typical game is over within hours instead of several days. We see that they are working out kinks and trying new things (even adding some things based on Snow's suggestions).Tom Blyth does a great job playing Coriolanus Snow, a morally ambiguous but cunning character that we often empathize with while at the same time, we don't completely trust. Is it because we already know that he'll become President Snow, Katniss Everdeen's enemy, in the future? Possibly. We're rooting for Snow to help his tribute, Lucy Gray Baird, but Snow continually crosses moral lines, and yet he completely justifies to himself and others *why* he crossed those lines. Blyth is great at conveying Snow's scheming with his facial features while still keeping the audience guessing as to his underlying motives. Does he genuinely care about Lucy Gray? Is he putting on an act to get her to trust him so she'll follow his advice on performing for the viewers, to further advance Snow's opportunities?Rachel Zegler has a beautiful voice and is well-cast as Lucy Gray Baird, the ""songbird"" that captures both Panem and our hearts with her singing, including a mesmerizing rendition of ""The Hanging Tree."" While we're rooting for the ""odds to be ever in her favor, "" we don't get as much background on Lucy Gray as we did on Katniss Everdeen in the original movies, so we never quite form the same connection with her which is a shame.Viola Davis is fantastic as the evil, creepy, scheming Dr. Volumina Gaul. She steals every scene that she's in, and we love to hate her. Her voice alone is haunting, and her outlandish costumes and makeup combine to make her one of the most memorable villains we've seen in some time.While Peter Dinklage is a great actor, we don't connect to his character Dean Casca Highbottom much. Perhaps it's because we're rooting for Snow's success in helping Lucy Gray, and Highbottom gets in the way.Snow's cousin Tigris, played by Hunter Schafer, is the person that Snow is closest to in the world, and she is a moral touchstone for Snow. Watching her subtle changes in her reaction to Snow as the story progresses was interesting.Jason Schwartzman as ""Lucky"" Flickerman provides some much needed comic relief as a weatherman, magician, and first host of the Hunger Games. He's not near as smooth in the role as his descendant Caesar Flickerman will become, which is a source of much of the humor.While we don't connect to these characters to the same degree as we do to Katniss, Peeta, and others in the original Hunger Games trilogy, it is an entertaining movie well worth watching. There is plenty of action (much of it violent of course, as this *is* the Hunger Games), the music is great, and it's fascinating to step into Panem's past.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Instead, he literally had no personality here and they took everything away that made him interesting.

Overall, a poorly executed movie as the direction and writing fail to build Snow up to be a bad guy to the point that they have to force this by the time the movie ends (making the first two acts of the movie feel pointless), but the movie is entertaining in the second act because they convey The Hunger Games well.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as the director uses the large sets, VFX, and cinematography to help paint these grand scenes in both the capital and the arena of The Hunger Games (while at the same time showing its grime and dark side), the direction of The Hunger Games was good and kept the movie engaging in the middle part; the direction on a microscale was bad as the interpersonal scenes did not feel fluid at all and were not well executed; the direction of actors was bad as none of of the performances felt like they were elevated by direction; storytelling was poor as there doesn't feel like a sense of where the movie is going as builds to one thing and drastically disposes of it in favor of a something else), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Tom Blyth (Shows some range of emotion and shows both the good and the bad side of Snow decently well), Pretty Bad from Rachel Zegler (Her accent kept on slipping and she kinda feels out of place with the rest of the cast (and the chemistry between her and Blyth is not the best); her musical moments (while forced) were carried out well as she shows off how good of a singer she is), Pretty Good from Peter Dinklage (Really just feels like he is playing many of the characters he has played in the past (the drunk character who has a lot to say) so he kinda just goes on his own), Good from Jason Schwartzman (The best performance of the movie as he plays the comedic relief character well), Pretty Bad from Hunter Schafer (Very emotionless and doesn't have any emotion with Blyth), Decent from Josh Andrés Rivera (Has moments where he shines and some moments where it feels like he's overacting), Decent from Viola Davis (Not really her best performance as it is a lot of overacting (but it doesn't feel like it is a bad performance, just not the best direction)), Decent from the rest of the cast (Hard to comment as most of the cast is child actors who feel like they weren't given the best direction)), Bad Story (The concept was pretty good as it was interesting to see the early Hunger Games and the origins of President Snow (though the carrying out of this concept was very bad); the story contruction was terrible as first act drags so much that its boring and the third act is completely out of place as it felt like they forgot to make Snow the bad guy (the second act is pretty good as its just The Hunger Games and plays to the strengths of the franchise); storytelling/flow between sequences was bad as every scene just felt forced and nothing felt like it flowed between each other (and this is especially seen in the final act as the movie has to make up for making Snow be the good guy when hes supposed to be the bad guy; character writing was very bad (Snow is terribly written as they put so much emphasis on sympathiszing him and making him be the good guy that they run out of time in making him be the bad guy and rush/force this part of the character in the end, Lucy Gray Baird is not written either as you really don't cate about her as her singing just gets really annoying towards the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue did not flow and was kinda forced; the tension build was good and carried out well in The Hunger Games act; the symbolism was very shallow as it does not do a good job in building Snow's journey for power; the foreshadowing was none-existent as the movie forces the ending because they forgot to make Snow the bad guy in the first two acts), Good Score (Carries different motifs from the original franchise), Good Cinematography (Helped show how grand the capital was and helped build the world (especially in The Hunger Games)), Good Sound (Helped in the action scenes), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helped make the movie feel like it was a part of the franchise and did not feel over-the-top in any way), Good Production Design (Helped with building the world), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as 2 out of the three acts were pointless (the first act builds Snow to be a good guy and really drags, the second act is pretty good as it is just The Hunger Games, and the third act is just so forced as it clearly shows that they forgot to make Snow the bad guys so they rush to give him moments that show how he's not a good person); The movie could've been split into two movies to help with runtime (with the entire third act being spun off to show how bad of a person Snow is as there are some moments in the second act that could allude to him being a bad guy, something a second movie could take and build on), Pacing was slow in the first and third act (especially in the third) but pretty good in the second act as the fast pace helped build tension in The Hunger Games, Climax was so underwhelming it was more laughable than entertaining, Tone was very similar to other Hunger Games movies.","75 out of 121 found this helpful.

When the film was over, I worked out I must have only missed seven minutes, so I guess that most of the audience was playing catch up along with me (that can't be Lucy Gray's literal introduction, can it?). Basically what I'm saying is that a lot of the context I assumed I missed because I was late is actually just missing from the piece full stop, and it's something that plagues the entirety of the picture. Where 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014)' and 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)' ought to have been split into a single movie with a runtime not dissimilar from that of this film, 'The Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes (2023)' (that's one too many ""The""s, by the way) really ought to have been split into two separate movies with runtimes similar to those films. So much of this is far too rushed for its own good, and - although the flick hits the ground running and leaves little room for boredom, at least initially - this is ultimately the main flaw of the feature. There are plenty of genuinely interesting ideas at play here, with the picture following a character who comes to realise that his own self-interest might just take precedent over helping other people (or generally doing the right thing) when circumstances force him to choose between the two. Its grey morality is fairly refreshing, and having someone who isn't a hero be the protagonist of a wide-appeal blockbuster - particularly one based on young adult fiction - is quite ballsy. The problem is that none of its ideas get the time they need to feel fully formed. There's very little granularity to the character arcs and the most important relationships never feel genuine because they aren't really given all that much attention. There are solid scenes that focus on character work, but they're almost like milestones that the flick unceremoniously sprints past and are much harder to appreciate because of it. The film is at its best during the eponymous Hunger Games, as its distinct mentor-tribute relationship and Capitol-based perspective set it apart from the other films in its series. There's a lot of tension and suspense during this second act, and it generally keeps you on the edge of your seat. The pacy first part also features some compelling, if all too brief, set-up for this segment, establishing a more rudimentary rule set for the barbaric situation and having the lead make headway in transforming it into the entertainment-as-punishment we recognise from the other films in the franchise. It's all rather entertaining, even if it does leave you feeling a bit breathless. After the games, though, the feature slams on the brakes and slows to a crawl. The pacing almost entirely resets, and what follows is both too long to be an epilogue and too short to be its own thing. Again, it introduces some thoroughly intriguing ideas and it does have some really engaging moments, but it just doesn't have time to do anything with its ideas and ultimately ends with a bit of a whimper. That's not to say the ending is especially bad, but it does leave you thinking ""that's it?"" (despite the fact that it's technically quite well-rounded). The tragedy of the plot doesn't really come through as well as it ought to, and the ending doesn't have the intimacy in character behind it to justify its comparatively tiny scope. The formal successes of every technical department go under the radar, too, because of the underwhelming way in which the narrative is faithfully yet insufficiently adapted from the source material (which I haven't read). The writing really is the only thing holding this back, as it's a well-made effort with solid performances and some really entertaining sequences. It is enjoyable and some of it is surprisingly intellectually stimulating, but it could have been so much better with just a few small yet significant tweaks.P. S. It's kind of weird how it's essentially a musical, but I don't mind that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Bad omens. Can the Panem rehash still shine? Only in part. The main obstacles are a rather pale Snow and his unpleasant tribute. Blyth, I may be wrong and probably contradict some people, but nothing great is growing here. What isn't can perhaps still become, but I couldn't feel the later Snow at any point. But perhaps this was the aim of the film, who knows what will happen in the event of a sequel. The ending at least shows the beginnings of a direction. Zegler, on the other hand, as a ""self-confident"" young Latina woman, will certainly be booked a little further, as she has been before, continue to exert herself, continue to annoy, continue to warble, until these, in a negative sense, conspicuous appearances hopefully wear off quickly, or she continues to tie a rope in her private life. We understand that she can sing, but that doesn't mean that every film has to be made into a musical for this nobody. It's impossible for these two characters to fit together, no chemistry. One ""was always trying"", the other focussed on being an egotistical self-promoter.The Capitol backdrops are greasy CGI mess, reminded me of the Fantastic Beasts eye cancer, the natural part in the District fits visually. The production wants to be big, but a few pathetic sequences are not the key to the epic, but real substance. The director may be the same as in previous instalments, but a chef can only be as good as his ingredients. In the second part of the running time, the film takes a calmer approach and works much better for me, which saved the viewing for me. It's not a mainstream romp, which is what people seem to think cinema is today, but content. What is fundamentally appealing is the story.

The production is of a spectacular level, the script divided into three acts is effective, the first is dramatic and manages to generate sympathy with the main characters, the second act has good action scenes and manages to have good tension that makes you worry about the characters, but the third and last act is weak, slow but has well-directed dramatic moments. The performances are good, highlighting Rachel Zegler who also shows off her voice in several songs, and Viola Davis brings to life a unique character. The cinematography is not excellent but it does its job. The music composed for the film is its greatest success, highlighting the dramatic, action and suspense scenes.

Many things are left out, other things are portrayed differently. Considering that adapting such a complex story is really difficult, I think they did quite a good job. Pacing was too fast obviously, which isn't surprising, a running time of 158 minutes just isn't enough to cover the 500+ pages the right way. I really liked Peter Dinklage as Highbottom, he did a brilliant job imo. The portrayal of Snow and Lucy Gray's love story seemed rush and unfitting.Yes, Rachel Zegler might not be the most likeable person, but I think it's stupid to review this movie based solely on how much you dislike Zegler.

Similar to ""Harry Potter,"" the book series whose popularity in Hollywood allowed for the creation of this franchise, the big-screen adaptations made several mistakes before finding success with a single filmmaker, who is now back to helm a prequel that remarkably expands the canon while adhering to its basic ideas.""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" strikes a balance between political commentary at a level appropriate for young viewers while also honoring blood sport and young love, as only Collins can. It feels like a logical continuation of the narrative. Her message is more about identifying how institutions use entertainment to divert attention from and control the masses than it is about opposing fascism. Collins does, however, allow a soulful folk singer-the title's figurative songbird-to act as the voice of resistance even inside that critique.Rachel Zegler, the star of ""West Side Story,"" pays grudging homage to Lucy Gray Baird. She is a hybrid of Jennifer Lawrence's selfless hero Katniss Everdeen from the original films, Victor Hugo's enthralling Gypsy Esmeralda, and a pop icon like Taylor Swift who unites people. Her songs are the high point of a gloomy thriller that is overly drawn out by thirty minutes and becomes incredibly confusing towards the end. However, Hollywood has long since concluded that people enjoy their blockbusters obese, and ""Ballad"" is just the most recent example of over-delivering.There's just one character in ""Ballad"" that viewers will recognize immediately: Coriolanus Snow, the future dictator (played by Donald Sutherland), who is now an underdog cadet. This implies that, similar to ""Cruella,"" ""Wicked,"" and ""Maleficent,"" the main character in the movie is a villain who was once youthful, desperate, and... attractive.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

-This movie has a little more song and dance to it than past installments, a key quality to this film and one of the characters.-I was pleased with the quality of the songs, the raw emotion and execution by Zegler and fulfilling the desperation of Lucy Gray's world.-Some are ballads that hold so much emotion hit me hard with the way she sold it, her voice deep, full of hurt, and that striving to live.-While others feel more festive, enlightening, and holding a bit more of the joy that this series needs.-Whatever reason, the execution of the songs holds the dramatic personality I expected her to have and to me that was a solid character choice for the film.The Music:
-Moving away from the songs, Ballad's music is a promotional prowess of Hollywood's sound work.-The orchestral work holds so much majesty to it, ominous percussions, strings that give a haunting energy, and a destructive presence that matches the ferocity of the very world.-It's partnered well with the shots, engaging with sound effects to unleash the full punch they were going for, adding ambience to the film and making it shine.The Acting:
-Strong work by the cast, the movie thrives well in the choices for much of the class of actors, they accomplished much with whom they chose for this act.-Davis is dastardly wicked in this movie, taking her anger from roles and refining it into a sinister discomfort, threatening gestures, and a menacing mean streak that fits well for a primary antagonist. Several of her exchanges give you theatrical chills, and her wicked looking nonverbal communication, is just as cold and callous.-Blyth as Snow was a great choice. Presenting like Snow, but still holding his identity, I found his portrayal on point, poised, calculating, and yet vulnerable, it's all there in the way of his demeanor and the way he delivers those lines. Like a true snake, the deception that rides with his every word is shockingly good for me.-Politics aside, Zegler accomplished a lot with Lucy's portrayal. Fiery, passionate, a flair for song, compassionate, and cunning were all in her presence. Sometimes she goes a tad overboard with the accent or the emotion, but her chemistry is fantastic and her presentation solid in the way she stands up to the odds.-Such great interactions between them all, such believable characters that made me fall into the investment of their stories once again.The Cinematography:
-Brilliantly finding the angles, this movie holds so much masterful crafting of that Hunger Games energy as the 10 games begins.-Shadowed filters and pressing shots give the sparse and depressing world an even grander perspective, hope leaking out in the manner that Collins' writes for crushing the hope.-The menacing glares and uncertainty shine in the eyes, the viscousness in the capital kids sneers, and just how much the shadow of impending doom settled over every inch of Panem's misery.-Even the action scenes hold some perspective that captures the feeling of the games, each contestant getting some dynamic shot that only further tweaks the suspense Collins was building towards.The Action:
-It's not the most action packed games of the bunch, nor is it the most suspenseful, but this ballad contains much more details to the games' fight scenes than the book did.-True, it didn't meet the vivid picture I painted, but the scenes are vicious, hold some well laid out action shots, and gives the sinister nature of the arena the touch it needed.-I liked the sword fighting, the destruction, and the strategy, helping add a touch more of the classic feel of Hunger Games that this book did not hold for me.-Throw in the reactions to the mentors and it helps add that unique feel when their candidate fell to the destructive ploys of the Capital.-Nevertheless, the second act was one of my favorite aspects of the movie, and the film being able to help explain the chaos of the games.The World Crafting
-Hollywood's budget and artists have made the fictional world come to life, with the same touch of genius the first movies held.-A fantastic use of real life with CGI, the movie builds colossal arenas that hold terror, craft cities and classrooms of regal status, and nightmarish labs that hold the darkest aspects of the games.-The forests, the mills, the halls, and more are all beautifully integrated, helping balance the majesty with the elite to the simplicity of the pain.-And the costumes only further help sell the status of the contestants, each one holding a characteristic or qualm that only further plays the part and helps add to the world.-Above all, this is the thing I liked the most, and what really pulled all the likes together to make this movie feel like a theater dive, including shows in 3-D.DISLIKES:
More Action:
-I know, this book isn't quite as the action/adventure as the previous ones, but the liberties could have been taken to adds a little more sustenance to this part.-A little strategy, some new beasts, maybe not quite the slaughter at the start? Not sure what could have been done to further make this shine, but the third act could have still used some fluffing with action to help further.-Puritans should still be fine with the portrayals, but... for fans like me, some liberties would have been welcomed.A few too many songs
-They were glazed over during the book, but in this film, the songs are sort of the stars of the show to show off Zegler's skills.-They are fun, they add cultural touches, but some of the songs went excessive and could have been cut for other important scenes if I'm being honest
-Another marginally low dislike, but one I agree with the reviewers could have been tweaked to not get out of hand.The Amount Of Story Cut
-The biggest dislike so far, the movie cuts a lot of what makes the Ballad the book it is.-Several key scenes I remember from the book are gone, some very important to the interactions and shaping of Snow, lost to edits that again made no sense.-The loss of integrating with her group, of getting to have more time with his best friend and shaping the political talks that tests their relationship... also gone and that was sad given how fast the movie progressed through some big points.-The cuts are noticeable, the edits smooth, but not perfect, and in some way the movie again feels rushed more than I thought it would.-And for many, the lack of internal dialogue, what Ballad thrives on, is gone, and with it much of the heart of the book and what describes Snow's transition to the man we will know.-How he thinks? The internal struggles? His burning love? It's all in those internal moments, what Collins' writing relies heavily on in most of the books I have read.-Yet, to do that in a movie is tough, and though they accomplish this so well, they still lost a lot of things that fans will notice and potentially miss dearly given the history of this series.-This was the biggest loss, and without the other liberties to help fill the gap, or dialogue to help replace those moments, the movie still lacks something that I would have liked to see in this movie adaptation.The VERDICT:
The Ballad is strong in so many facets for the theater visit and the buildup the marketing has done for this movie. It's a beautifully designed world, with Lionsgate focusing so much attention on the details of the landscape, the feel of the games, and the immersion into the world of Panem's earlier years. There is so much emotion, acting, songs, and camerawork bringing Collins' descriptions out, and doing their best to unleash the fury of the snake and the beauty of the songbird without getting too lost into the emotion. Action moments get some added details, songs help get the characters the rebellious streaks, and some of the moments are so much better than the words in the book. And yet, the movie feels incomplete as if it could not figure out the ideal marriage of new changes an cuts from the books. This book's reliance on the internal nature of the characters has been faded in this movie, as internal thought is quite limited in movies without dialogue or artistic focus. And though they capture some of this magic... it still misses much of what I remember from my reading, key moments that are gone for the sake of time and other liberties. Rather than filling them with meaningful and efficient scenes, we got more singing, but hey, the movie wasn't five hours so I can't be too upset. I agree, this movie feels that it needed two parts to do everything, but again, I think this movie still has enough bite and gusto to warrant a theater visit this holiday season, just so long as you lower your standard for a pure adaptation.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's called Hunger Games but you only see something like that in it's first half hour, since the filmmakers had the bright idea to escalate the film in it's first act, putting the first act as the second act and then the third act as the second. Are you confused? Well, look at them! The result is that you think the movie is ending but it eventually takes a ""break"" and resumes in about five minutes. I am addressing to you Hollywood movie makers: beginning?, middle?, end?, world building?, exposition?, protagonist testing?, twist?, climax? Don't they remind you of anything? The movie ends and you don't know what you've seen, you are confused. Where is the catharsis? Who is good and who is bad in this movie? I didn't know whose side to take and when the viewer doesn't know whose side to take he's lost.But yes the movie has some positives (thankfully). The soundtrack, cgi and color grading are very good but it's such a shame that these were wasted in a festival of bad script and direction. It's hard to believe that Francis Lawrence has directed this film. Oh and if you're going to turn it into a musical halfway through you'd better tell us from the start.It's unbelievable and sad what is happening in modern Hollywood. They're just trying to make money based on strong and beloved franchises by changing them and throwing in minimal work. The only instances of them coming up with anything worthwhile yet are those of the known greats in the game like Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Cameron, Villeneuve and Tom Cruise.","52 out of 82 found this helpful.

It's watchable, you don't feel like you've wasted your time. You get some dopamine from some of the action, or music, or moments. But movies shouldn't aim to just be fine. They need to be great. Every movie should strive to be a masterpiece. This is not a masterpiece.The book was. The book did something other series couldn't do - it showed that reboots could work, that they can be as good as the originals. With the movie, this isn't nearly as impressive, as the original movies weren't the best. So all Songbirds and Snakes had to do was make sure it wasn't worse than the first movie (which it managed to do).As a Hunger Games movie, it is an 8. It adapts the book well (with a few fails preventing it from reaching a 9, and a lot of underexplored / incorrectly explored themes preventing it from reaching a 10).As a movie, especially if you haven't read the books and are only basing your knowledge on the previous movies, this is a 6. Poor writing decisions (specifically related to the movie, not the book), drag this down for the average watcher that won't be so lenient with the decisions made.The acting was mostly good. I was cautious before watching the movie (all book-readers are anxious for their characters to be cast correctly), but I was happy with the choices made. What became a problem was the way the director required them to act. First, Lucy Gray. In the book she was presented as a little bit insane, with some tricks up her sleeve (think of Foxface from the first Hunger Games). Here, she was just presented as a typical ""badass"", with some moments of non-badassery sprinkled in to try and balance her out, so to say. It didn't work, and just made me fail to really believe she was a genuine person.As for themes, this movie missed out on some marks simply because it didn't give us Snow's internal monologue, which is what made Songbirds and Snakes so great. The book didn't straight up tell us Snow was cunning, but through his thought process you can see that he is. It's a subtle thing that makes Snow a much more interesting character. In the movie, these subtle undertones are missed and towards the end you just get the impression Snow is a bad guy just because he's misguided or indoctrinated. There's also a lot of thought processes left out that would help colour the other characters a bit more. Generally, the other kids from Snow's school are sidelined instead of really being highlighted as rivals. You don't feel any danger from the fact that the other schoolkids are competing against Snow. Due to Snow's thoughts being left out, the problems I mentioned before with Lucy's character are amplified. In the book, the first thing Snow thinks when he sees Lucy is that she might be mentally unstable, and that she reminds him of a circus performer. This was a really interesting moment in the book - how can Snow, a dignified posh boy hope to control a poor girl who doesn't fit into social norms and doesn't care to? - but it was mostly lost in the movie.Perhaps the most important writing change for me, was the plot-twist at the end. I think, for the rest of my life, I will remember the scene from the book when Snow realises something is wrong. It came out of nowhere and hit like a train, and was one of the most tense moments I've ever read in a book. What made it so special was that you knew something had to go wrong at some point, like a Romeo and Juliet where (due to the characters present or not present in the original stories), you knew who would survive and who wouldn't. But you didn't know when it was going to happen and how. Here, in the movie, they don't even make an attempt to disguise what's coming. In fact, they try SEVERAL TIMES to tell the watcher that something is about to happen, and when it does, we're supposed to act like it's a surprise??? Ridiculous. It wasn't completely ruined, but it was unnecessarily spoiled just to... what? Why? Because the director thought the audience would be too stupid to realise what's happening?Special effects were never a strong suit of the HG series, but here they were more passable. I'm specifically referring to the design of the Capitol, which looked atrocious in the originals.The music was bad. There were some nice parts, but mostly it was just filler music.And finally, the editing. I thought the movie did a great job of attempting to get everything from the book into movie form, and that's worth some praise - I hate when movies cut out portions of the book. Unfortunately though, instead of embracing this and making the movie as long as it needs to be, they try and cut quickly between scenes to shave off a few minutes. And I mean, quickly. You barely have time to process anything. Oh, someone just died? Something sad just happened and now we need to focus on the characters' reactions? No, we immediately cut to the next scene and forget about that. It was quite unnatural.Overall 6/10
8/10 for a Hunger Games fan.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In addition, it set up the first The Hunger Games perfectly, something I felt the book was a little unclear on. I was worried that Lucy Gray's constant singing, as is in the book, would take over the film, but it was perfectly placed and necessary. All in all, a really entertaining watch for Hunger Games fans with some fantastic foreshadowing scenes and quotes that were far from cheesy.

""The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is a prequel that takes us back to the days when young Coriolanus Snow, yes, THAT President Snow, was just a lad with a head full of dreams and a name that screams 'destined for a career in villainy'. This movie is like that one guest at a party who tells interesting stories but tends to drag on a bit too long.Francis Lawrence does a decent job of setting the scene in a dystopian, war-ravaged Panem. The story itself is a blend of teenage angst, political intrigue, and the usual Hunger Games brutality. Think ""Game of Thrones"" meets ""High School Musical"", minus the singing basketball players. Speaking of singing, the casting of Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray Baird, a character with Southern roots, was an eyebrow-raiser. However, Zegler belts out country tunes with such grace and emotion, it's almost like the role was written with her voice in mind. Her performance is a definite highlight, proving that talent transcends geographical origins.As for the plot, it's an intriguing peek into the early days of the Hunger Games. We get a sense of how the event evolved from a brutal punishment into a twisted form of entertainment. Coriolanus' journey from a wannabe hero to a budding villain is fascinating, though the movie tends to lose its grip in the midst of all the subplots. It's like trying to keep track of who's who in a very dramatic, very lethal high school reunion.Overall, ""Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is a watchable addition to the Hunger Games saga.

Tom Blyth really does a great performance as a young Snow and as the main character of this movie. I was not sure if I would be interested in a Snow origin story however the writers and Tom Blyth convinced me otherwise. While every actor holds their own it is no shock that Viola Davis is a standout as the evil doctor and might be my favorite performance of the entire movie.There is not much if anything I can critique about this film. Many having seemingly disliked Rachel Zegler's performance as the main female protagonist, but as someone who was not expecting much from this film I will say that she did very well. Not sure if they're expecting another Katniss but she is not that nor was she suppose to be. I will say that the biggest problem for me is the length of the film especially in the 3rd act. Various scenes could've been shortened particularly the singing scenes. It is definitely worth a watch in theaters it is a strong 7.5-8/10.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

It explored the brutal horror of the hunger games perhaps better than any of the previous films in the franchise. It (arguably) had better characters than any of the other hunger games films. Perhaps the biggest flaw was the length of the film. It wasn't long enough. It could (and probably should) have been three hours or made into a two parter. It would have given it more space to breathe and develop more stakes. For example, the main character is very poor which is his motivation to win the ""Plinth Prize."" But it is only suggested once or twice within the first ten minutes of the film. If they had a longer runtime then they could have elevated the plot in a few ways.

I found several scenes in the book confusing, especially towards the end, and seeing the character portrayals in the film helped those scenes click a lot better. I loved the casting of Rachel Zegler. The music was one of the things I was most excited about seeing adapted into film, and the songs in the film were did not disappoint.

I had never read the book, but I did rewatch the 4 previous Hunger Games Movies before watching this one. So, going into a Hunger Games prequel, there were certain things I was wanting to see. I thought seeing the war between the Districts and the Capitol would be interesting or seeing the pitch meeting for the first Hunger Games, how and why did they come up with that. But that is not the film we got here. This starts at the 10th Hunger Games and is more or less the origin story of President Snow. I won't compare this movie to my imagination of what it could have been, I just want people to know what they're getting into.To the film's credit, this is a villain centered prequel film that actually makes the main character the villain. Unlike films like ""Maleficent"" or ""Cruella"", Coriolanus Snow in this film actually does act villainous, and I could totally believe he is the same person we see in the other Hunger Games Movies. As a prequel goes, it also doesn't try too hard to call back to the previous films. There is no talk of a chosen one prophecy of someone rising up to defeat the Capitol. There is one call back that it is a bit forced, but other than that the movie stands on its own merits.This movie also has a good edge to it. It feels more adult than a ""YA Novel"" movie, and this helps the film maintain suspense for its characters and the audience.Now on the negative side, the titular Hunger Game is not as compelling as previous entries. Part of that is due to the fact that the Capitol is still figuring out the format. But another has to do with the fact that we don't know anything about the other contestants, they are basically just cannon fodder. The other movies didn't have much, but they still had enough to make us remember when one was killed. This movie has a couple of moments where they announce someone died, and I had no idea who they were talking about.What about the one contestant we do get to know, Lucy Gray? When this character was first introduced, I was excited, she looked like someone who might be more morally...gray. Someone who would do more sinister things than Katniss in the previous entries. But as the movie progresses, she becomes less and less interesting, basically becoming a discount Katniss but without any emotional connection. Katniss at least had her sister to fight for, and although not great, I was more invested in Katniss's romantic subplot than I was with Lucy's.This film also has no business being nearly 2hrs. 40 mins. As the film approaches the 3rd act, it starts to be a bit directionless. Characters make foolish decisions and things stagger to an end.To end with some positives, the acting performances by all involved were really good. Viola Davis as a sort of Dr. Frankenstein is appropriately sinister. Peter Dinklage is great as always. Jason Schwartzman is delightful as the host. And I can really believe Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow.The film is still better than most prequels of its kind. The film just chooses to focus on the wrong things and ends up feeling overly long and convoluted. I think there are still interesting things the series could do in the Hunger Games universe; this just doesn't fully tap into that.It may be overstuffed, but I could hunger for some more in the future.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

While the concept of delving into the past of such a complex character is intriguing, the narrative feels sluggish and fails to deliver the depth and intensity expected from the Hunger Games universe.The portrayal of a young Coriolanus Snow lacks the compelling depth needed to justify his transformation into the iconic antagonist of the original trilogy. The pacing struggles to maintain engagement, with stretches of the story feeling drawn out and disconnected. Additionally, the dynamic between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray Baird, the tribute he mentors, lacks the emotional resonance required to truly invest the audience in their relationship. Rachel Zeigler acting sucks as well.Moreover, the exploration of the early Hunger Games lacks the gripping tension and moral complexity that made the original trilogy so captivating. Instead, it feels more like a diluted version, missing the edge-of-your-seat excitement and the thought-provoking commentary on society and power dynamics.Overall, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" fails to live up to the standards set by the previous Hunger Games installments, offering a lackluster portrayal of a compelling villain's origins and missing the mark in terms of both storytelling and character development.","72 out of 118 found this helpful.

Set 64 years prior to the events of the original film, the narrative unfolds in the nascent stages of Panem's descent into dystopia. Lawrence's keen direction brings forth a vivid sense of place, offering a captivating glimpse into the Capitol's retribution against the districts for their uprisings.Tom Blyth's portrayal of the young Snow is nothing short of star-making. From a privileged youth to a calculated manipulator, Blyth's performance unfolds with grand gestures and subtle revelations. The script, crafted by Michael Lesslie and Michael Arndt, masterfully traces Snow's ascent to power through calculated decisions rather than sheer strength, lending a chilling subtlety to this supervillain origin story.The film introduces Lucy Gray Baird, portrayed with charismatic brilliance by Rachel Zegler. Her melodic method of protest and dynamic chemistry with Blyth's Snow create a compelling narrative tension. Viola Davis shines as the sadistically chic Dr. Volumnia Gaul, while Jason Schwartzman's Lucky Flickerman provides delightful commentary on our attention-hungry times.Peter Dinklage's grounded portrayal of Casca Highbottom adds a necessary touch of wisdom in the midst of the film's wild events. As the story unfolds, the third chapter takes a bold departure, both in terms of location and emotional tone, providing exquisite tension between Snow and Lucy Gray. The cinematography by Jo Willems enhances this shift, creating a lush and dangerous vibe in a pastoral forest setting.""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" proves to be a suspenseful prequel, skillfully exploring the complex dynamics of power, trust, and survival. With a runtime of 157 minutes, the film delivers a captivating narrative that adds depth to the Hunger Games universe.#SongbirdsAndSnakesSaga.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

His fathers back story isn't explained until the final minutes of the film & his cousin has all of 5 minutes of screen time, making both feel like after thoughts by the end of the first act.In act two, there are attempts to establish two ""villain's"". The creator of the Hunger Games, and the head Game Master. Both fall flat, pulling the attention in three different directions. Act two does a half way decent job of letting Snow be a villainous protagonist. He spends much of the act attempting to manipulate the games in order to have his tribute win. The end of the act finishes with the end of that years hunger games. It would have been the best ending for this movie.For reasons..... There is a third act to this film. In the third act Snow suddenly has an extreme, unexplained, emotional swing. It left me wondering what I had missed, since the hook to this movie is explaining Snow's back story. He goes from ""Change is possible"" to unhinged in the blink of an eye.The real saving grace to this movie is Rachel Zegler's voice. The songs do get a little repetitive and are often misplaced in the scene. However, the pain and sorrow cut through in her voice giving them an authentic feel.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And now after watching the movie I realize that I would have liked it probably even less if I had read the entire book. Probably the biggest problem is that none of the main characters seem likable or realistic enough in the world for me to root for them or have the emotional down-spiral of the characters to be a good tragic drama.There is sort of this 1950s steampunk aesthetic that also made no sense to me given that this is supposed to take place in our distance future rather than the somewhat recent past. How/why would TVs in the future start to become anything like TV screens from the 50s? Are they also going to reinvent laserdiscs?The way the hunger games unfolds makes it feel completely absurd that the winner would win even with all of the cheating. Also the 2 big dramatic scenes after the games just seems confusing. Especially intermixed with some of the other scenes around them. Maybe he works better with all of the perspectives and time that an author is given in a book. But it certainly didn't make a lot of sense to me.Stumbling across the guns later in the film seemed way too coincidental too. And the motivations of the main characters was so inconsistent from one moment to the next near the end that he started to seem bipolar and phycho. I don't think they sufficiently developed his character so one could understand why/how he would work so hard for power and control. The beginning had him challenged that power and control so much that it was a wonder why he would even want any power and control over a society that he just barely seemed to care about.All in all. It's a mess, but interesting to try to follow because it seems to be such a mess.The actors seemed alright. The music was good. The cinematography was fine. But the story and characters didn't seem well developed to me. And I was frequently wondering why these characters and this timeline was being presented given that it didn't seem to answer many questions compare to all the questions and problems it raised.","77 out of 127 found this helpful.

It is the most faithful movie adaptation out of the entire Hunger Games series. Like the other movies of course it is missing some interactions and smaller scenes, so people who read the book will of course have more context. I've seen quite a few people saying that they didn't connect with the main characters besides maybe Sejanus and that was the point! In the book Snow might have been slightly more sympathetic but his thoughts usually give away his true intentions so I'd say the movie did a good job of balancing him out since we could not read his thoughts. The slight changes made did not affect the overall story and large plot points were left unchanged. They did a great job considering it was not split into two parts and while it can feel a little bit rushed it really does follow the same timeline as the book. Loved every minute of this movie and would recommend it to all Hunger Games fans.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

My expectation for a movie has never been lower after my sanity was bombarded by Captain Marvel and Five Nights at Freddy's, but I must say I'm pleasantly surprised by The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. The use of vibrant colors, the realistic (as opposed to visibly CGIed) scenic layouts, and the elaborate, coherent storyline adapted from Susan Collins' amazing textual foundation. Seeing the in-constructing Capital and the Hunger Game in its early stage creates great contrast with the overly affluent city and the meticulous game designs in the original tetralogy. Moreover, the plot is just so much better than Marvel's AI-produced ones: there's plenty of clever foreshadowing devices, a balance between fights and dialogues, and 2 movies of volume in 1, although I understand why Lionsgate didn't separate the game itself and Snow's journey into two films in fear of revising the failure of Mockingjay part one. However, I do feel like the second half or part three of the film has its problems in terms of pacing, including Sejanus' sudden lack of judgment, Snow's hurried embrace of his villain arc, and Lucy's reduction in part. Such a prolonged narrative works for a novel, but certainly not a movie.A compliment to the cast, who definitely go beyond their standard performances and portray quite memorable characters. Despite surrounded by controversy, Rachel Zegler really can sing the unbridled Covey verses and act a mysterious songbird. Tom Blyth is bold choice for the renowned character and his depiction of Snow's change in character isn't that convincing in the third part, but overall he is above decent. There's also a lot of rewarding easter eggs for those who know the original saga, like The Hanging Tree, Tigris' fate, supply drops, and why Snow hates ""Katniss.""I like the film, but please do not make a sequel to the prequel.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There are definitely some intense scenes and some good acting that made me pay attention a couple of times but I can pinpoint another major problem going on here. The main character of Lucy comes across as way too helpless/defenseless in too many scenes and relies way too much on luck or someone to save her to get her out of danger. She is less resourceful and strong than Katniss Everdeen was and it shows. I thought Hollywood cared about feminism??

The story has holes in some places, but it catches up in other with complexity. The design and acting are good.Not a movie to become a classic, but likely you won't feel it's a waste of time either.The story is all around Snow (played by Tom Blyth) and his path to success at all costs. It was a complex role and Tom performed great. He carries the whole movie on himself, and the character passing a whole roller-coaster of events and an afterthought of him remains even after you end the movie.The other actors had been unltimately outshined. E.g. Dr. Gaul and Sejanus were played by good actors, but the roles were too bland, it's not on them. Or the actors had simply way too short screen time (Tigris). The only exception was Jason Schwartzman who had played an eccentric showman, but not as absurd as in the original trilogies.I am a split about evaluating Rachel Zegler playing Lucy Gray. Usually the characters/actors can show that there is one face they show to the public and another when in private (e.g. Jennifer Lawrence in the original Trilogy). That builds up trust to the viewer. But Lucy Gray was always the same person for whom pretending costs nothing. She carries the same ""poker face"" and demeanor all the time (except it is cheery-naive look). Lucy had no less and often more obvious psychpathic traits than Snow's character, especially when it comes to the lack of remorse and manipulations. And it just doesn't fit to the character so young and put into an extreme stress. So either Rachel played an extremely skilled psychopath or she had slacked and didn't bother to provide depths to the character. I don't know, honestly.It's interesting that the Hunger Game itself is a plot-mover, but not what the movie is about. The game battle itself is bloody and just like in the original, has huge and dumb plotholes, but one must give a slide here. Luckily, it's not the main plot thing.Anyway, an interesting shift of the perspective, and I find it to be a great move from Suzanne Collins and a fitting expansion of the franchise.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Incredibly brutal and grim, yet full of such hope and optimism for the future. Always so well written, and with an incredible cast. Also luckily, very faithful adaptations too. This one is no exception. Very close to the book, and thematically quite different to the 4 sequels. Far darker in tone, and absolutely lacking the hope or optimism. This is the rise of a truly impressive villain. It is fascinating to see the progress of Snow, his origin story as the most formidable villain I've seen on the screen in a long time. Incredibly cast, with a breathtaking performance but thankfully not a character they decided to humanize. Just because someone has humanity, doesn't make them a saint. Really enjoyable film, so glad I got to experience this world again.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I believe the movie accomplished what it set out to do by answering who President Snow is, why he is the cruel dictator we see in the original films, and how he came to be in power.I find that those complaining about the story of the movie are simply too caught up in nostalgia to take this movie as a modern installment of The Hunger Games that is not set to be just another story for those who were Reeped.I applaud the director, writers, actors, and anyone else who helped create this movie for taking a chance and making a movie that is somewhat similar to the trilogy but also artistically different plot-wise.Overall this movie was great in my opinion and at the bare minimum, a fun watch.Very Recommended Watch.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

The story wanders around like it's on a quest for purpose, centering vaguely on two characters who seem as lost as I was trying to follow the plot. And then there's Rachel Zegler, popping up like a musical fairy godmother every 5 minutes. I half-expected her to break into 'Hunger Games: The Musical' , anyone?The film's attempt to weave a compelling narrative feels more like attempting to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded - confusing and with no clear resolution in sight. The decision to turn it into a pseudo-musical only adds to the bewilderment, leaving me wondering if I accidentally stumbled into a Capitol-sponsored talent show.Rachel Zegler's constant musical interludes make you question if she has a secret contract to ensure a song every 300 seconds. It's like the filmmakers discovered a 'Sing for Survival' clause in the Hunger Games rulebook. I can't decide if it's a desperate attempt to inject life into the story or an unintentional audition tape for 'America's Got Talent.'The storyline is as elusive, full of plot holes. It's like they dropped a bag of breadcrumbs in the woods, and we're left wandering in circles, trying to make sense of the narrative maze. The movie's plot is more twisted than the Capitol's fashion choices, leaving me with a sense of confusion.In the end, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes feels like a failed attempt to remix a dystopian classic. It's not a symphony of storytelling; it's a cacophony of confusion with a side of unwanted musical numbers. If the Hunger Games were a competition for viewer endurance, this movie would win hands down. May the odds be ever in your favor if you decide to give it a watch - you might need it.""","25 out of 37 found this helpful.

Downbeat and sometimes downright sad movies can be quite good sometimes, but they have to have good drama and action to make up for the negative emotion. A movie with positive emotion (such as a comedy), doesn't always need the drama and action, as we are watching the movie to relax and have a good time. But no one wants to see a movie that's just sad, which to me is what the first four Hunger games movies were. One thing I did wonder while watching the movies was Snow's past, and how he got where he was. This was only hinted at in the movies, but when I learned there was a movie dedicated to this question, I rushed to the theatre to go see it.We meet Snow at age 17, in a sci-fi dystopian world, where he is a student vying for a scholarship to get into the university, but in order to get said scholarship, which would set him on the pathway to success, he must mentor one of the tributes in the hunger games, an annual tournament in which teens from across the country fight to the death, with only one surviving. He soon finds out there is more to his tribute than meets the eye. The plot goes in amazing directions, but I'm not gonna give away any spoilers.I loved this movie. We can all relate to young Snow trying to make his way into the world, even if we don't agree with his ethics. This movie is almost like a Scorsese gangster drama, except it feels like it was made by talented teens and set in the future. It hits all the right storytelling beats, and succeeds where the original movies fail. It's hard to believe that this movie has the same director as some of the other Hunger Games movies, as this movie, in my opinion, is by far the best Hunger Games movie. I really appreciate the scale in the cinematography, with some amazing shots in the film with gorgeous lighting. I highly recommend this movie, even if you've never seen a Hunger Games movie, as this movie doesn't get much wrong.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Much of this comes from the unfamiliar and grand 1984 urban-scapes filmed in Poland and Germany.From another angle, it plays more like like a horror film; you wait for each young kid to be killed to find out how. It's dark, not a young adult action flick like the original Hunger Games trilogy or the first Mazerunner movie. Would have done better at box-office released in October for Halloween?Best acting is by an unrecognizable Viola Davis (The Woman King). She's a mad scientist supper-villain--yet, not over-done. If Donald Sutherland was 10/10 crazy, she takes ""unhinged"" to 11. Impressive. She commits to showing the ugliest and unpleasant aspect of dissociated economic elites.Using title cards, the movie is divided into three acts. The end of the second act is the highpoint of the film. DON'T MISS IT! Brilliant and amazing filmmaking! Afterwards, I was half ready for the credits to roll. Yet it goes on for another 45 minutes to show us how young Snow became old Snow in the trilogy.The King's Man (2021) had a similar problem. The film peaked at the end of the first act. For Hollywood blockbusters, both The King's Man and this film are original and narratively unorthodox. I believe the average male movie ticket buyer often perceives ""original"" movies as ""problematic."" The Creator (2023) also had originality audiences did not appreciate.Joss Whedon's scripting maxim still applies, to be big hits, a movie has to announce its genre to audiences; and then, ""stay within its lane,"" be creative with the tropes available to work with. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023) took Joss's advice to good effect.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

There was decent character development and the story all in all didn't have any huge flaws (maybe some questionable moments but nothing I couldn't ignore), HOWEVER I struggled with Rachel Zegler in this film, her acting felt unnatural and forced as if she's trying too hard. Might be me being harsh which I fully accept but she was 90% of my issues with the movie. Tom Blythe on the other hand I felt delivered a believable character and really made the role his own, this was the same with pretty much all of the other characters.

A bit condensed the movie imho, could have done better with two parts like the Mockingjay series, action by the main characters, Viola Davis totally over the top manic gamemaster and amusing, Peter Dinklage played himself as usual a bit too droll and diminutive portrayal to the original character ,Rachel Zegler great singer of course, but a little tame compared to the book character who is a lot more reactionary and manipulative. Visually the screenplay, and the games arena seemed a tad skimped, could have been a pastiche of Nazi germany in the late thirties,futuristic train models and stockyards, but a poor rendition,and graphics in scale and size. The critters,jabbajacks, snakes etc made up for the lack of quality settings.Of course the previous history, and games origin, rebellion and organisation of the Districts was glossed over as the filmakers must have assumed that they were making a fan follower movie.As for Cornelious Snow rising up to be corrupted by the politics of power in Panem, the personality a bit watered down in the movie.The compere was the only Actor who got close to Stanley Tucci's original.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I've read the original trilogy and seen the films, and I always hated Snow, who wouldn't. It's easy to hate Snow here, BUT Tom Blyth does a phenomenal job, this movie rises or falls on him and he carries it, if this isn't a star making turn for him, I dunno what would be. I despised Snow in the original trilogy, he's obviously only presented as the evil dictator he is, but he's very keen and intelligent, even though you hate him. Here, although I felt repulsion towards Snow at times, I was rooting for him to choose good, we know the inevitable end, but again Blyth does such a phenomenal job of conveying the characters inner dilemmas; we see the constant push and pull off his wanting to do good, but also his selfish ambition, and the desire to walk in his father's footsteps. He does have guilt, but not enough to turn him around, we see this many times as the movie goes on.I felt the transition of him from morally specious to evil was mostly believable, again, because of Tom Blyth's powerhouse performance. I definitely had sympathy for him and I understood where he was coming from. I also felt the transition Snow made at the end felt a tad rushed, but this was a character on a knifes edge, teetering between what's right and selfish ambition. This is, for me a very welcome change in modern mainstream films. Instead of a boring action film, we get a philosophical character driven film, it's very refreshing, and I'm glad this was 160 minutes, not 2 movies, that would have bored People to tears.The rest of the cast is decent, Viola Davis is horrifying, but she never overplays it, Jason Schwartzman does a solid job as Flickerman, Peter Dinklage is solid as always, however, Rachel Ziegler is not a very good actress, she has little emotional depth, but her singing, wow, I knew she had to have been trained, and I was right. I saw her in Westside Story, but she wasn't nearly as good there, in fact I left that movie halfway through because I was bored, I hated what they did to Maria, they ruined her character and the singing was mostly bland. She does a very good job here with the songs, her singing here, however, is some of the best singing I've heard in some time, I'm a little perplexed why she's not a singer after watching this. I suppose material is the issue, if you're not a songwriter, you have to find good material, which is tough.I liked the story, though Id like to have seen a bit more of Tigris, she was a good character and she truly cared about her cousin and hated seeing what he was becoming. I enjoyed seeing the capital in it's early days before it became a complete hedonistic hellhole. I really liked the setting of the primitive games and how they initially treated tributes, it was interesting, and I liked seeing how Snow played a direct hand in what the hunger games later become. Those were the more exciting parts, once it got to the final part, Peacekeeping, it definitely slows down, but it still held my interest, and it took some surprising turns.Overall, worthwhile if you have a good attention span and don't mind movies about evil people.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I recently rewatched beforehand and they still holds up and I totally agree with director the 3rd Mockingjay should have been one film instead of split into two. If it was one it could have been easily remembered as one of best trilogies.I'm not huge fan of humanising the villains as we saw with Loki in Disney who killed thousands of people in Newyork and then becomes this funny caricature of a villain/Hero in later movies. So, I never read this book but here I would say Tom Blyth's screen presence and emotional turmoil sold this story to me. You can feel in his eyes how good & evil both live simultaneously inside us and you let one win over the other.Rachel Zegler was amazing as she not only speaks in southern accent but sings too. She never fights in the whole movie not once as she rightly said that ""Lucy Gray is a performer forced to fight and Katniss is a fighter forced to perform."". Her character is very from Katniss and she uses her singing as weapon which you never see in films.The problem just like most viewers is the 3rd Act, as it slows down and then slightly rushed towards the end. I still immensely enjoyed the movie, and can't wait to see what Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler (besides Snow White as I'm over CGI fest remakes) do next.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The story is good if a bit simplified and obvious at times, but it was enjoyable throughout due to the great acting from the main cast, the cracking country ballads and the use of contrast from the grand to the dilapidated in the scenery and settings. The Games themselves weren't as shocking or thrilling as they could have been, but were still entertaining to watch and the run-down nature of the arena fitted well within the post-war recovery setting.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

What it does well, is an interesting portrayal of Snow's journey and descent into the man we see in the originals. Unfortunately, the lead female will suffer from an inevitable and unfavourable comparison to Jennifer Lawrence. It feels like she was cast solely for her singing ability which is impressive, but unfortunately her acting skills lag far behind. Perhaps it's the writing, and the book character is the same, but there is nothing endearing about her.Maybe there will be more content, maybe not.

Engaging and full of interesting ideas that feel fresh against the original films and their themes. Visually stunning cinematic moments with scenes of intense shocking brutality. The connection to the future is apparent but the overall design and atmosphere is generally different. The multiple singing scenes make sense with the storytelling. The acting is overall very well done for all characters, especially Coriolanus, and Dr Gaul. Lucy Gray embodies her role, though more exaggerated at moments in comparison to the rest of the casts more subtle acting style, but that may also lend to the character she is portraying. The tone shift in Act III, is jarring following the end of Act II, but necessary to witness Snow's descent into evil. The movie ends on a high note, leaving some open ended questions that can be analyzed through the evolution of snow in the original films setting the table for his position to rise to power. The core premise brings new meaning to, ""it's the things we love most that destroy us"" Creating a dynamic parallel to the original trilogy that stands alone as its own independent story.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The movie certainly had my attention and I think the opening was very strong in establishing Coriolanus as a complicated protagonist and setting him down his path to both his triumph and later his destruction. It took me a while to warm up to Lucy Gray, she was too feisty and too finely geared to make her likeable. But her willingness to trust Snow instead of just being whiny and mistrustful and her not too squeaky clean sense of morality wore me down. Her character picks up steam after the games are done and by the end, I was rooting for her. My biggest problem with the original series was how selfish and petulant Katniss could be and Songbirds & Snakes flips the formula by asking us to root for the villain. One of my friends suggested a House of Cards style show just showing Snow's rise to power and S&S showed the potential and promise that kind of project.I hadn't seen either Tom Blyth previously but to follow Donald Sutherland in this role couldn't have been easy. I was quite impressed with his commanding presence and how well he captured Snow's charm and conversely his ruthlessness. He definitely brought some humanity to the character and he conveys slow descent well. Rachel has a ton of energy as Lucy Gray and she's good at being vulnerable in the beginning and being coy & mysterious near the end. Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage and Jason Schwartzman are the heavy hitters in the supporting cast and I enjoyed them all. Viola comes on strong at the start (could the obviously evil character turn out to be evil?) but her performance fits and Dr. Gaul transforms into a formidable enemy by the end.I also want to congratulate this movie for putting more of a focus on the animosity between the Capitol and the Districts. There's a lot more anger and venom between the two sides and the bitterness adds to the stakes. They also do a good job of showing how disorganized the games could be in their beginning cycles. This version of the Hunger Games is much less glamorous, the tributes are barely suitable, the mentors are only in it for themselves and the citizens of the Capitol barely care. It adds to the bleakness of the festivities and how they would eventual fuel another rebellion which is important in where the story will eventually finish with the Katniss saga.I did have some problems with this movie, but they were mostly minor. Songbirds & Snakes relies on some plot contrivances and the film can't help but being a little precious when it's winking at elements from the original trilogy. This is something that isn't unique to Songbirds & Snakes but wouldn't it be nice if it could have been avoided? But the easiest and most obvious problem is that S&S feels a little overproduced. It's been pruned and tweaked for maximum power several times over and it robs it of some of it's spontaneity. I still really enjoyed it but I couldn't help but feel like I was being manipulated a little bit.I really didn't expect much going into this movie. I saw the original trilogy and read the books but I considered The Hunger Games finished and I moved on. I was blown away by how intricately packed and well made this prequel was. Judging by the other user reviews, I might in the minority but Songbirds & Snakes builds on the mythology while staying true to the spirit, the film shapes Coriolanus Snow into a layered and engaging character/villain and reignites the fire for this universe. I'm somewhere between an 8.5-9/10 but I'd wholly recommend this and unless you're extremely attached to the original trilogy, I'd be surprised if you walk away from the theatre without something to discuss or a new appreciation for this franchise. To Suzanne Collins, Francis Lawrence and the creative team, Bravo!","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Now, their destinies are intertwined.The author of the books Suzane Collins and the screenwriters Michael Lesslie and Michael Arndt are careful to establish this in every way they can in the chapters that precede the tenth edition of the Hunger Games and the first to count on mentors chosen from among the most promising young people in the Capital, among they Snow, of course, to guide their respective Tributes throughout the fight for their lives. The protagonist may not be exactly a complete villain at the beginning, but he already carries with him all the characteristics that make it clear how much he simply sucks, with the author really taking the risk of building a character with whom her readers probably won't identify. After all, to say that someone identifies with Coriolanus or the values he espouses is a problematic admission. But that's why I ended up liking Cantiga. No just doing the obvious and no sugarcoating the pill. What we see is a young man who is deeply envious of his schoolmate Sejanus Plinth, whose very wealthy family comes from District 2, the equivalent of the ""new rich"" compared to the ""traditional rich"", even though Sejanus turns out to be honest. And sensitive, considering Coriolanus as a true friend. Snow is also manipulative, using his beauty and friendliness to get what he wants and to hide his family's poverty - he lives in a luxurious but run-down apartment, with no money to eat properly, with his paternal grandmother and his cousin Tigris, who provides for the family - a secret that no one else knows, except Dean Casca Highbottom, addicted to morphine, credited with creating the Hunger Games and enemy of the Snow family.Even when it places him as the protagonist, ""The Ballad of Songbirds and Serpents"" makes it clear that we are dealing with a person with a controversial nature, capable of anything to achieve his goals. In this sense, Tom Blyth does an excellent job. Known for smaller productions such as ""Benediction (2021)"" and ""The Golden Age (2022)"", the actor truthfully delivers all of Snow's moments, from when he feels his pride hurt when he is reminded of the family's financial failure, to when he arrives to the height of confidence when he achieved (almost) everything he wanted at the end of production (it's no spoiler to say that he lives, after all, the character has a future that fans know well). On the other side, we have Lucy Gray Baird, a tribute from District 12 who tries to survive in the midst of a cruel world. Rachel Zegler also delivers a good performance, in contrast to Blyth's: as we see the story from his point of view, Lucy Gray is always shown as an enigmatic character, of whom we know little and can be suspicious at all times. Of course, a large part of this is due to young Snow's paranoid look, but the film gets it right in conveying this feeling in such a believable way.Here, the screenwriters start from a ""canvas"" already painted with dark and sad colors and use Snow's mentorship in the Hunger Games to then deepen these reprehensible characteristics (a euphemism, of course) of the character. The tribute he receives to ""take care of"" is Lucy Gray Baird, originally from a nomadic music group that, during the war, was forced to settle in District 12, and the young woman, since her summons, already reveals herself to be different, be it because of the multicolored dress she wears, or because of the snake she hides in her costume to defend herself. Of course, the reader must expect the classic attraction between mentor and tribute, but even with that the author works trying to avoid mere clichés tired of this type of approach, keeping Snow resolute in his extreme selfishness that only allows him to do things that directly benefit him. Or indirectly.The tenth edition of the Hunger Games itself becomes an ""origin story"" in a way, as there is an abyss of differences between what Collins describes in the trilogy that takes place 64 years later and Cantiga's version, which avoids mere repetitions of deadly competition. Here, the Hunger Games are much closer to the gladiatorial fights of Ancient Rome, with the tributes simply being thrown into a simple stadium, with some weapons, so that, in the end, only one is alive. There is no special technology used and the organization of the games does not even interfere or influence their progress. Mentoring, of course, is the first sign of change, but it is still weak and far from the media carnival of decades later, so Collins tries to ""insert"" known elements here and there, some originating from Snow himself and his desire to showing someone out of the ordinary (which he in fact is), such as betting on tributes, so that it is perfectly possible to make a mental bridge between one version and another. At the beginning of the film, we have a simple human zoo and the stage for the deadly competition is more reminiscent of the Coliseum than the sci-fi forest of the first time we discovered the games. The idea of the story is to show us the transition of the competition to something closer to the reality show that we saw later, coinciding with the rise of Snow and his suggestions that shaped the modern version of the competition, something that begins to take shape here with the retro presentation. Futuristic design by Lucky Flickerman (Jason Schwartzman), donations from the public, drones and the proximity of participants. This, however, limits the film's own sense of scale, which is more gladiatorial than pure spectacle, more crude than innovative, something that has incited criticism from the audience about the film's lack of entertainment, but it is to be understood that director Francis Lawrence - returning with another good job of world building and character development in the franchise - and the production had less scope to work on this side of the story due to the premise itself.The games are less exciting this time, especially because Lucy's survival plot is subsidiary to Snow's arc, making the narrative a little more distant from the competition, which is the franchise's greatest visual and impactful attraction. But it is worth mentioning that the production could have been more creative in terms of action and in the construction of the game participants, who are less charismatic and devoid of the personality we saw in the players of other films. Even the layers about the revolution are left aside, gaining representation here and there amidst the obviousness of the text, with the film trying to create a musical characteristic with Lucy that, for many, did not work in Zegler's forcedly theatrical interpretation and in the displaced composition that those moments come. It's also strange how the Games end halfway through the film, making the final act feel more like an epilogue than a climax. The narrative drags between a watered-down romance between Snow and Lucy, and more generic representations about revolution, even though the protagonist's good (a)moral turn happens precisely as a result of this narrative line. Maybe the film works better as a character study than a blockbuster action epic, right? The production certainly could have better balanced the different facets of Collins' prequel, as the Katniss film series does so well, but it lacked drama, vulnerability, personality and scope for the origin story to be close to the Girl on Fire's journey.At almost 2h40, the film becomes tiring, especially after the plot that actually shows what the tenth edition of the Hunger Games was like. This characteristic is also felt in the book. With 571 pages, the publication chooses not to end at the climax, but rather to show another layer of Snow, which clashes with the rest, although it is important for the construction of the character. Even though it cut a lot of things from the original story, something common in any adaptation, the film cannot overcome this characteristic and it is quite possible that many fans will end the session somewhat tired. Despite this, it is also possible to end the session with a feeling that ""The Ballad of Songbirds and Serpents"" is a story that needed to be told. Although it is bittersweet to reach the end knowing all the atrocities that will still be committed by Snow, there is a feeling that, now, we deeply know the nature of this character and the origin of the Hunger Games itself, as it was shown in the main franchise. Not pleasant, but completely necessary. Both the book and this film adaptation do not succumb to the obviousness of this premise. The Coriolanus Snow of 64 years in the future echoes well in the Coriolanus Snow of 18 years and Suzanne Collins uses her narrative verve to expand the dystopian universe she has created so well. It is by no means a necessary book, but among the many unnecessary books out there in its category, this is one of the most interesting.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yes, he killed his friend and his moral compass is very askew, but isn't he preserving his and Lucy-Gray's life? Isn't he doing it out of love? There is good in him, up until his last breath. But why does the movie force us to think of him as a mad killing machine in the third act? Speaking of the third act, it is extremely awkwardly paced near the end.I'm sorry to say but Lucy-Gray is nowhere as likeable as Katniss, where she detracts from Snow's storyline. Rachel Zegler's performance is so overpowering to the point where it feels adds disbelief to the plot, and elevates it to an emotional level that is nowhere near realistic, while Jennifer Lawerence's performance is grounded and natural, which amplifies emotions with the audience far better.There is too much singing in this movie. I get it, Rachel Zegler can sing, but that is no excuse to turn this movie into a musical. What makes it worse is that the songs are so stylistically sung that it clearly doesn't fit in with the scene's emotional tone, or that it is blatantly obvious it was recorded in a studio.Also, it is extremely hard to like any of the characters in this movie. Their backgrounds are glossed over. There was no real interaction from Lucy Gray prior to her reaping. It wasn't like the Katniss/Prim dynamic. Plus, the awkward camera angles and the POV of the games from Snow felt like there a massive lack of stakes.Positives, well it was good to spend a few hours in Panem again. The nostalgia was good, and so were the references to the original films, although they were completely unnecessary. That being said, I think I'll watch the original hunger games trilogy again to actually feel something more surreal.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

The entire movie is rushed to the point where it should have been split into two. Important characters are barely involved or completely cut out. How do you show Clemencia get bitten by the snakes then nothing of her afterwards????! No Pluribus Bell, Satiria or interactions with the Plinths... Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come on!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater. Poorly done...One last thing! Great job Rachel Zegler, you succeeded in ruining another movie just by the charm of your horrible acting, singing, facial expressions and explicit talent to not learn any skill required to succeed as an actress. Amazing casting for Snow, that guy nailed the role, but holy moly what a utter pile dog-sheet this movie was because of Rachel Zegler. Don't even get me started on the singing. Its unreal how this unfunny personality is getting such major roles whereas super talented talent out there never sees the light of the day.

Some of the characters didn't have good chemistry.

Well let's see, you begin by dismantling him and bring him up in a nation and a world full of venomous snakes (so to speak), and then you take that man, and you begin to unravel him. Nothing says blood and more blood than the fact that you cannot get it out, it leaves a nasty scar, and it stains too, not just on clothes, but your cold, cold heart.There is no wander Suzanne Collins wanted to revisit Panem, she wanted to tell the story of how one kid became a ruthless dictator and the why and how behind it. Now I refuse to sit here and tell the story, no I will let you be the judge and character of that. This prequel will not only be the greatest in this series, but I will say Francis Lawrence has done it yet again.Nothing screams blockbuster, then this one. This move has defied all odds or as the tagline for the series says, ""may the odds be ever in your favor."" The odds are that you will not survive the arena. The entire cast was just phenomenal and the storyline leading up to the first movie left a lot of holes filled in. This cast including the talented and most gorgeous one of all.... Ms. Viola Davis, she can be sinister and yes, I have seen it, but not this sinister. To the newcomer Tom Blyth, congratulations dude, you just made Donald Sutherland very proud.To the beautiful Rachel Zegler, I said this for West Side Story, and I will say it again, seductively incredible - I cannot begin to tell you how incredible you were. To the rest of the cast Peter Dinklage, Hunter Schaefer - awesome.Thank you, Suzanne, for bringing us back to Panem, we have lost it over the last 9 years since Mockingjay, Part 2 - thank you, thank you.This movie was in a word sinister and wonderful rise to the threat of Panem through the eyes of Coriolanus Snow.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Everything was less technological and looked more like a Gladiator arena, and here I could really feel that they were fighting to survive, the connection between the tributes was really strong, and they made that danger feeling much stronger in here, then in the original movies. It was also about the story of President Snow, how he started as a young man that had plans for a bright future, but ended with an evil path, with rage and madness. His story, and how his rage was evolving, was showed greatly, with complete understanding. The movie itself, did have dominating pros, but could have fixed some things. The pros, first of all, was amazing storytelling. They distributed the story in three parts, each chapter about a specific topic. I liked the prequel best from the franchise because it was richer story. In the originals, they focused mostly on one topic, but here, they included more of everything. Story, feelings and character development. President Snow as a character was amazingly performed by Tom Blyth, as a lost boy of perfection and squareness. Rachel Zegler as the songbird, Lucy Gray Bird, was the movies mystery. She was like an incomplete book, and made her more an interesting character. Rachel Zegler took her role, and personally, she is a very good singer, she is very pretty, but her acting is decent. Her acting could be better, her expressions could look more realistic. Her songs were good, though, they were mostly about the society and people of district twelve, and gave me a bigger understanding of their culture. The first Hunger Games was ok, but it always missed a puzzle. It didn't really explain the nature of the country, society and culture, something they did in this part, and made it finally a complete picture. Good scenography, editing and action sequences. The Hunger Games fights were very entertaining, very barbaric, and some of the kills were pretty well made, with good dramatical scenes and so. They could focus a little bit on the dialogues, more originality, even though it was good enough. The beginning with an impressive intro ended with a good, dramatical outro, and closed the movie complete. To conclude, this is the best Hunger Games so far, and I hope maybe some day the story will continue in a similar way as this one.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's ultimately the big complaint I have. Sometimes it becomes slow and eternal. A few editing touches and the film was among the best of its year. However, technically it's good. The photography is an attractive set of contrasts and realistic colors within a retrofuturistic world. The stumbling block that photography has is the choice of lenses. It wants to fit too much into the frame, which distorts the edges of the frames a lot, making it look a little uncomfortable to watch.The performances are generally good. Nothing to highlight and nothing to reproach.The jewel of the film in my opinion is the production design. A post-war world that is in active reconstruction thanks to technology is portrayed with great effectiveness. The exterior locations are beautiful and very well used.With this new story of the saga, the desire to see a new magical world of Harry Potter, for example, is rekindled. I have faith in that new WB project. (It's totally a different dish, but I wanted to comment it anyway).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I appreciate it's a long film but that's because they were trying to do too much all in one film. Some of the actors were over the top and theatrical rather than displaying substance which was surprising considering the big names in this movie. Some big names in this film yet they disappointed us as they really felt to of lacked depth. I've seen them in films where they have been truly astounding yet they fell flat here. I can't help but wonder if it's because of how rushed this was, you didn't have time to become invested in any of the characters. The previous hunger games reallly felt powerful and hit a nerve, this felt showy and lacking in depth. On a positive note I liked the singing and the female lead, I just wish they given her more time to provide suspense in many moments instead of rushing through. The scene with the snakes was fantastic.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

But I really enjoyed this film. Racheal Zeglar is awesome. I really enjoyed her performance. As well as the dude who played young snow. The movie feels like two movies but for some reason, it didn't feel bloated. It actually flowed really nicely. The third act was cery unexpected and took a very different tone in storytelling. I found it a little shocking if I am being honest. But I liked it alot. The first act 8s exactly what you think the film is going to be and the 2nd and 3rd act are pretty interesring with how different it is. But I enjoyed it. The one problem I had was that I would have liked more expansion into the plot points in thr third act. I could tell the screenwriters cut alot of that middle act out, even though I didn't reas the books. ButnI will give the film 8/10. Very good film.

I especially liked the way they portrayed the games and the ending, however some parts of the movie left rushed.Now let's talk about the character portrayal. We saw some really good performance from Viola Davis, Dinklage and the actor who played Sejanus was exceptionally good! However, our dear President Snow failed to evoke the intricate emotions we felt when reading the book. In my opinion, the actor who played him wasn't able to showcase the complicated emotions Snow goes through in the book. As for our songbird, Lucy Gray, I didn't see her in the movie at all. The actress who played Lucy Gray was very very pretty and she has a great voice, but her performance on this was abysmal. Her accent was awful and confusing, and her acting felt so insincere. I connected so well with the book Lucy Gray but on screen, I didn't feel the same with her. Her singing was great, but even still, I wished they had made it feel more like a real person singing instead of a musical performance from a pop star. Even the Hanging Tree song - when Jennifer Lawrence sung in the movies I felt chills on the back of my neck. It was so raw and evokes the emotions you felt in the book. In this new movie, it was sung on a higher note and it just didn't feel the same.Also, I was confused about some of the dialogues on the movie. It left like 2023 language was being used and towards the ending you get the feeling that you're watching a 2023 movie instead of a movie set on a dystopian era at a dystopian place called Panem. Compared to the original series, this movie did not transport me to a different world. Perhaps, I'm nitpicking too much...Overall, this movie was a mixed bag of emotions. Though peppered with commendable moments/performance, the movie failed to whisk me away to the world of Panem and didn't leave me dejected and longing for more like the book did.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

AKA tying one arm behind your back.Whatever the writers try and do, we know who Coriolanus Snow becomes, and we are always looking for the signs of what leads him down his future path.Unfortunately the moments that show Snow's future path are a bit too subtle. If you didn't know what was going to happen, a lot of them come across as him being a bit tense and over-reacting.The other main issue the film inherits from the book (which I haven't read but my children have) is the three-part structure. The film ends up telling two quite distinct stories: one is an early example of the Hunger Games; the other is about Snow's military career. This pads the film out to a saddle-sore 2h40m. They should have chosen one of the stories and got it done within 2 hours.Performances are a mixed bag. Rachel Zegler's accent was a mistake, and the fact that she has a song for every plot development can be jarring, but it suits the odd atmosphere that pervades Panem. It helps that she is a very good singer.Tom Blyth is a bit flat as Snow. He doesn't have a fraction of the charisma that Donald Sutherland brought to the role.Viola Davis' Dr. Volumnia Gaul goes too far over the top, with oversized rubber gloves and a whole range of unsettling facial expressions.However Peter Dinklage and Jason Schwartzman are both excellent, with Dinklage capturing world-weary contempt for his students, and Schwartzman bringing much needed laughs to the weatherman-cum-death-match-host ""Lucky"" Flickerman.The supporting cast are mostly disposable, even Snow's best friend Sejanus is barely developed, and he spends a lot of time on screen. This film doesn't have the depth of characters of the original trilogy.But despite these criticisms, it is a (mostly) enjoyable film. The costumes and set design are great (even though there is heavy use of CGI in the backdrops), there are a few moments of tension, and the story manages to tick along. The best sequences by far are the Hunger Games contest and the final scenes.A fair effort on a story that was always going to be a struggle to tell.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is no exception, boasting an outstanding narrative alongside remarkable acting, producing, and cinematography that immerse you in its world. Although the film starts somewhat slowly, this cleverly serves as a plot device to foster empathy with the main characters, allowing us to see reflections of our own choices and dilemmas on the screen. Have you ever sacrificed something you love for a necessity? Have you made decisions that altered the course of your life? This movie explores these questions and more over its engaging two and a half hours. It reminds me of films like ""Titanic,"" which don't just transport you away from your life but place you in another's shoes, prompting you to contemplate your own reactions in similar situations. For those who appreciate the preceding works, this film is a solid choice, paying a subtly ingenious tribute to its predecessors. It is replete with plot twists that cleverly subvert expectations. Special mention must go to the young actress McKenzie Lansing, who portrays a villainous character with a pitchfork. Though her role is brief, it is intensely visceral and memorable. In conclusion, this film truly encapsulates the author's vision for an engaging sequel.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It showed a more in-depth look at ""Snow"" while seeing some familiar faces from the previous films. ""Snow"" wasn't all bad which was surprising, he was still conniving though.I expected more singing just from the title alone but all the singing that took place made sense. I loved Viola Davis's character she was odd and kind of spooky.If you're into this franchise you will love this film. If you didn't care for this franchise then it's more of the same. I was never the biggest ""Hunger Games"" fan. But I did enjoy some of the films and the creativity of certain scenes. I liked them better than this film.It was a little long and after what I thought was a pivotal conclusion, there was still a good chunk of the film left. It felt like there should have been a period instead it was a comma. It made sense and tied into the actual end somewhat. I still felt they could have edited down some more because it just left me asking more questions than anything.They left it open to have more films which I expect them to do. For someone that's not a huge fan of the franchise I still think it was a decent film. I give it three mor fires 🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters.

The back story of Corialanus Snow is something that I was quite keen to understand. But I found the origin story to be unfitting to such a heinous individual.

The 10th Hunger Games was the shortest, least interesting and unchallenging of all. I don't think the actual ""game"" even lasted 20 minutes. Gone was all the CGI, the different effects and terrains and all the out-of-nowhere things to challenge the players in addition to the tributes trying to kill each other. I found Rachel Zegler's character, Lucy Gray, annoying at every turn, shallow, not particularly clever, with no real depth or even a back story. I wish they'd just have focused almost entirely on the character of Coriolanus Snow, the mentor, who was very interesting and checked off all the personality points that Lucy Gray didn't. I tried to wait to see how his story played out, but even that wasn't worth waiting for. But, ladies and gentlemen, the first Hunger Games Musical! Zegler can barely get through a scene without bursting into song and her W. Virginia twang in both song and speech is over-the-top fake and gets closer and closer to nails on a chalkboard as the movie goes on. If they left out all the singing, the movie could have probably been a half hour shorter. I love Peter Dinklage, but he looked about as bored as I did. In short, if you're going in there looking for signs or similarities to all the other ""Hunger Games"", skip this because you won't find it. Save yourself the money and time.","26 out of 41 found this helpful.

The acting is quite good, the cinematography and action are beautifully rendered, and the characters were interesting to watch. I think my only compliant is with Snow himself. Without an internal dialogue that would otherwise be present in a book, his motivations feel muddled.I could maybe rate this movie a bit higher, but really I just found it good, but not necessarily great.

I've watched all the film and enjoyed them even as their quality was diminishing towards the end. The film puts your right in with the characters and as a result attempts to make you feel something for the characters.With a longer runtime I can say that I was never board or hoping it was wrapping up. They keep the pace set right for how much is covered. The build up to the games, the games themselves, and the aftermath all feel definitive. The one area this movie suffers is its final 15min or so. It an attempt to keep this film under 3hrs the ending feels rushed which somewhat undermines the story and it's core characters.I can look past this for the most part because everything else before hand is so great.

The whole universe holds a lot of nostalgia for me and anyone who grew up on The Hunger Games series will get a serious kick out of this film. It enriches the world that we know from the previous films and fleshes out some vital developments and characters that prove pivotal later on. It also feels quite epic in scope and does everything you could want a prequel to do.The performances are also strong. The supporting cast is out of this world, with colourful characters presented by Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage, Jason Schwartzman. Rachel Zegler is terrific in the role of District 12 tribute Lucy Gray Baird, creating a thoroughly compelling character. Tom Blythe in the role of Coriolanus Snow is intriguing. His performance is really solid, but the character does sometimes feel a little off.This is where some of the negatives start to creep in. Framing Snow as the lead character just didn't work for me. I'm all for expanding the lore of a villain, but this just didn't really get deep enough for me. Despite the good performance I just never bought into this angle.I do also think that, despite being strong overall, the story felt a little bit too segmented. The distinct parts of the film created a bit too much distance from the others and interrupted some of the flow. That's not to say the film was too long at all, it just didn't always flow that well.It also felt to me that too much of the film felt a little bit too corny, which mostly came across in the dialogue. Considering this is a major studio film it also it seemed weirdly low budget at times.Ultimately though I did enjoy this film and it is a good instalment into the Hunger Games mythology. Perhaps I have just grown out of the target audience which might explain some of my criticisms I don't know. I still had fun though, I just maybe expected to be a little more bowled over, especially given the hype this film is receiving.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That being said, after the shock wore off, I actually didn't mind the songs and they were pretty good for the most part. Props to the production designers for this film, they did an amazing job. Our two main leads are dynamic, with good chemistry. All in all, the entire cast was fantastic, ranging from Viola Davis, to Peter Dinklage. Jason Schwartzman is having a great year, all three of his roles were tremendous, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Asteroid City and now this film. My main gripe with this film is the pacing and structure. That's because the first act is replaced with the third act, the second with the first and the third with the second. Basically, the climax happens during the first 45 minutes, and after that, the story loses its focus and becomes way too uninteresting and boring. But that is all backed up by great visuals and a moving score.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The storyline as one might guess follows the books, which is the 10th annual hunger games and the point at which they really turn the hunger games into a show, a spectacle with rewards for the victors. As already said the movie follows the books pretty closely so in terms of story all I can say is well done there. They had the source material and they followed it. The only negative I have is them skipping some important parts especially for those like me who've read the book and wonder where the heck did that scene go, I know the movie is already quite long but another 15m and they could have included all the missing 30s to 1m scenes that were not included in the movie but where quite significant in the books. Like for example Corio's adoption by Sejanus's father at the end among many others.The cast is pretty solid overall. We have the beautiful Rachel Zegler playing our heroine Lucy Gray and I think she does a pretty admirable job in her role. She does a good job at singing all the songs Lucy Gray does in the books and she manages to get Lucy's personality down quite well as well which is nice to see. The only complaint I have is her character not being quite right which is not even her fault it's just the difficulties of trying to move her character from paper to screen.Tom Blyth plays Coriolanus Snow and brings him to life on screen. He perfectly portrays Snow's character and personality and most of his nuances as well on the big screen. Lovely casting decision there and I for one really enjoyed his performance.The supporting cast consisting off but not limited to Hunter Schafer as Tigris, Peter Dinklage as Professor Highbottom and Jason Schwartzman as Lucretius ""Lucky"" Flickerman all do amazing jobs in their respective roles. The only casting I'm unhappy with is Viola Davis as they race swapped her character, That is also the reason the movie loses a star from me. That being said she still does a great job as head game maker and gives us a memorable performance.The VFX and SFX are great, I didn't notice any issues there and the music from Lucy Gray and the Covey makes for sweet listening.Overall a solid film and more importantly a good prequel to the Hunger Games movies and books we all know and love. A well deserved 7/10 from me with my only wish now being a book and then movie made on Haymitch's games in full, Finnick's, Johanna's etc.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

""You know..."" The casting director didn't realise he meant that ""Tom fella"" from ""Harry Potter"" and got Tom Blyth instead. There's an uncanny resemblance with the blonde floppy hair and the rather linear facial expressions. Indeed, despite a promising (if frustrating) shower scene at the top of the film, Blyth (""Coryo"") is really what drags this otherwise quite decent action adventure film down. Rachel Zegler, on the other hand, is full of enthusiasm as her ""Lucy Gray"" character is selected to fight for District 12 in the ""Hunger Games"". Meantime, ""Dean Highbottom"" (the infrequently used Peter Dinklage) has come up with a way to spike the dwindling television ratings. He has decided to allocate one of his top students to mentor each of the captives. Yep - ""Coryo"" is put with ""Lucy Gray"". A bit of sabotage changes the nature of the game and gradually our hero starts to wonder if he is on the right side - especially when he becomes a little too emotionally involved with his protégé and attracts the enmity of his own erstwhile mentor. Luckily, the whole scenario is being overseen by the hammily menacing ""Volumnia Gaul"" (Viola Davis) who is clearly having a ball with industrial scale make up and a barrel of genetically modified snakes. The last twenty minutes smacks a little too much of sequel building, but this film has plenty of action and intrigue, loads of back-stabbing and just a little moralising. Zegler delivers a few folky style ballads confidently and generally does a lively enough job keeping it quite a bit better than I was expecting. It needs a cinema, though - the grand scale effects and photography work best that way. On the television it will probably just come across as a bit derivative.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film is split into three chapters, delivering a trifecta of overwrought, overacted, and overlong. The adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel explores the Hunger Games' origins and Snow's descent into the dark side. However, the new Snow, played by British actor Tom Blyth, is a bland construct, joining other privileged young Capitol residents as mentors to the youths chosen to compete and die as tributes. Snow is tasked with capturing Lucy Gray Baird, a talented actress from District 12. Snow is captivated by her talent and plans to help her survive the competition. However, he must navigate the eagle-eyed masterminds, Casca Highbottom (Peter Dinklage) and Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), who resembles Cruella de Vil in her appearance and line delivery. Lucy's success will be crucial in the film's success. ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a thrilling prequel based on Suzanne Collins' 2020 novel, focusing on Coriolanus Snow's rise to power. The film showcases Tom Blyth's transformation from a moneyed pretty boy to a clear-eyed manipulator, showcasing Snow's transformation from a destined greatness to a manipulator intent on crafting his fate. The film's gripping performances, including Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Snow, make it a captivating watch. Dr. Volumnia Gaul emphasizes the importance of creating memorable spectacles, with Viola Davis playing a chic, sadistic character with the right amount of camp, and costume designer Trish Summerville's striking creations benefiting her. Snow's dark side is revealed in ""The Peacekeeper,"" a bold departure from previous chapters. The film moves from the austere Capitol to a pastoral forest setting, creating a romantic and dangerous atmosphere. The 157-minute film slows and quiets down, allowing for tension between two people who trust each other. Lucy Gray's folksy charm is used effectively, and the energy in the film is balanced by the lush, romantic, and dangerous atmosphere. ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a suspenseful prequel to Coriolanus's long-standing belief that snow always lands on top.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Essentially, the prequel shows us the evolution of Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) as he becomes the person portrayed much later as Coriolanus Snow by Donald Sutherland.The Hunger Games are much more primitive, but teenager Snow provides input to the shape of the Games that have been suffering from lack of attention. The persons running the games are Dr. Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis) and Casca Highbottem (Peter Dinklage). Snow and his best friend, Sejanus Plinth (Josh Andrés Rivera), mentor two tribunes fighting in the Hunger Games. Snow is guiding a young woman from the 12th District, a very accomplished singer, Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler).The film follows Snow's efforts to help Lucy Gray, the Hunger Games themselves, and the consequences for Snow after he is caught cheating to help Lucy Gray. Snow becomes a Peacekeeper in District 12 as punishment, where he is joined by Sejanus and finds Lucy Gray. Snow's viewpoints shift during this period.This ""Hunger Games"" prequel makes the most sense if viewers have read or seen the originals. By itself, it seems a less flamboyant rehash of the earlier films. It is interesting to see what factors shaped the enigmatic Coriolanus Snow, played by Donald Sutherland. Blyth and Zegler have good chemistry. Dinklage is compelling, as always. Davis' character is over the top.If you liked the earlier Hunger Games movies, you'll enjoy this one. If not, give it a pass.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This wouldn't necessarily be a problem if they hadn't decided to completely erase some of the MAIN characters. The few people mentioned by name in the movie were rewritten to the point that it makes their characters seem like entirely different people. In the books, Coriolanus Snow is a sociopath who is downright evil and worships his father, who is basically American Hitler. In the movies, he comes off as sympathetic. The directors rewrote lines, added lines, added scenes, deleted scenes, and threw stuff around until they made a jumbled-up mess of the original. It's like the director and writers read the plot points on SparkNotes instead actually reading the book. Out of all the movies I've seen, this one was one of the biggest letdowns. There are so many fans who have waited so long for this movie. Money is not the problem. And neither is time, considering people have waited this many years already. Either Suzanne Collins did not have the ability to offer much input for this movie or she did not care to correct them. Because this movie is a hot mess. Spectacularly terrible adaptation.","12 out of 17 found this helpful.

The film explores the complexities of power, rebellion, and sacrifice with poignant storytelling. Jennifer Lawrence's reprisal of Katniss Everdeen is as compelling as ever, embodying the character's strength and vulnerability. The movie delves deeper into the Capitol's machinations, unraveling a web of political intrigue that adds layers to the narrative. The cinematography captures the stark contrast between the opulence of the Capitol and the struggles in the districts, creating a visually immersive experience. The supporting cast delivers stellar performances, breathing life into familiar and new characters alike.

To add more stress, the new Hunger Games are upon them & the ratings are down so the game makers, Oscar winner Viola Davis & Peter Dinklage, will introduce to this new tourney having the contestants interact directly w/their mentors w/Blyth partnered w/Rachel Zegler (already tagged as someone to watch since when her name's announced she flings a snake in a rival's blouse & sings in defiance to her nomination). What follows is another battle royal (sorry since the Hunger Games were always pegged as American copies of that notorious Japanese classic) w/most of the gameplay located to one environment as we wait to see if Zegler will pull off a win. Francis Lawrence wisely returns back to the fold after directing 3 previous entries already & his knowledge of the material works well enough to mount something familiar which still manages to rankle some genuine tension & disgust at the extreme politics seen on screen (maybe something The Phantom Menace wanted to do?) w/the performances fine & flinty which makes me wonder if there's enough fire in Suzanne Collins' belly to put out more installments to be filmed.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I didn't like that this new girl turned the movie into a musical (and I noticed it was basically the same song just with different lyrics every time) and I also didn't like how the ending felt kind of rush, but I guess they're going to make a second movie so they wanted to make it like an open ending. But that's all I didn't like actually. Everything else I really enjoyed. I will be honest, I didn't know it had a prequel book from 2020 so I can't really say if the movie followed the book 100%, but other than that, the dialogue was good, the acting, the plot, and my god Viola Davis is one hell of an actor, she's just amazing.

She seems to be competing in the Voice instead of the Hunger Games. Singing like she is a singer on stage. Instead of being afraid or emotional. Too bad, because her role is important. Jennifer Lawrence was so much better and more believable!!! Snow acted well, and Viola Davis was also excellent as an actress. But it wasn't clear to me why Snow ended up being evil.

It stars Tom Blyth (""Billy the Kid"") as Snow and Rachel Zegler (""West Side Story"") as Lucy Gray Baird. I found it to be very entertaining and the performances of the stars are good. And the action scenes should satisfy fans of violent carnage. Also stars Jason Schwartzman as the unctuous but funny Lucretius ""Lucky"" Flickerman. Only issue I have is Tom Blyth supposedly being a young Donald Sutherland (President Snow in the main series) - it is hard to imagine the handsome Blyth turning into Sutherland!

More him, since his character has many more complex feelings that he does manage not to overpay, hers is more straightforward, but she is apparently singing herself, that is impressive, girl with many talents.The pacing is strange, since the games finished in the middle of the movie, but that is ultimately not bad, as keeps the interest growing.One of the few sequels that are right there with the first in the series.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I read the original Hunger Games trilogy and loved every second and then saw the movies as soon as I could. I enjoyed them, but was slightly underwhelmed, so I never got around to reading the source material for this one. I decided to go into this movie blind, and I feel like I missed a ton not having read the book. I understand that it was supposed to be the story of Snow and his background, but I felt like it missed the opportunity to display his internal madness (which apparently was a central part of the book through the internal monologue). To me, it felt like he just went crazy because of a girl, and that felt lame. I'll probably need to watch it again to see if I can glean more from it, but that inherently is a problem, which is why I have it ranked where I do. Certainly worth the watch, but just didn't move the needle for me.6.1/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everyone is a bad guy, until they aren't, then they are, then they are all plotting together to basically get to the next scene. Writing: Gawd aweful and presented with no emotion. You're supposed to ""care"" about the contestants, but you really don't. I really struggled to find any point to this movie. The writers must have just thrown the script up in the air and put it back together as they picked them off the floor. Movie has no ""bite"" to it. Supposed (I think) to show everyone means something by playing the Games only to not really play the games. Instead just avoid any attempt to win the games, that apparently, nobody is watching.

The setting is great and actually I'd say more convincing than the other movies because it's not as polished and therefore has more depth. For the most part the characters are also quite convincing, although I think the character development towards the end falls a bit flat and thus the movie misses out on its potential to really display Snow's transition in all detail.I'd still recommend watching it, as the music performed by Zegler is really entertaining and fitting and, for me, really portrayed the working-class lifestyle of district 12 with it's blue collar industry and industrial bars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I heard that this snow guy is a bit villainous in other movies and that this movie is kind of his backstory.The movie is set into three parts, part 1 and 2 were amazing but I do have to say part 3 did drag on for a little.I think this movie displays greatly how people can turn corrupt through traumatic events. We see this innocent and helpful man trying his best to not only win an award but genuinely try to help his tribute. At the start you are rooting for snow and by the end you almost kind of hate him due to how events changed him.The relationship plot of this movie is great. It's a rollercoaster. It starts off kind of awkward then it gets great and then you kind of predict and know how it will end which is a rivalry.As for the actual hunger games itself, it was pretty good. Considering it was a prequel they dealt with the deaths quite well. It also displays the consequences of cheating and how it can change people for the worse.The host of the hunger games was pretty comedic and I found myself laughing quite a bit. I liked the diversity of the tributes and it displays that literally anyone can die.Maybe I rated it higher than other because I haven't seen the other hunger games but I think this movie was a masterpiece and has you follow this innocent hard working guy that turns into demented being that racks up around 4 deaths.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I thought the previous movies were fine so, why not, right?Broken into 3 parts, the story follows the bad guy, Snow, from the original movies. The story is supposed to be his rise and fall, but it never quite commits to that whole part of his arc until the last third of the movie when the writers remember this movie is a character study.I wish they only had two ""Parts"". The three ""Parts"" didn't follow the typical three act story structure which ended up making the pacing and story feel disjointed. In fact, I forgot there was a part 3 remaining because the big climax happens at the end of part 2 so I was ready to leave the theatre when ""PART 3"" was displayed on the screen.Part 3 takes place in an entirely different area with only 3 of the characters from the first 2 parts. It dealt with the aftermath of the previous two parts and this is where it finally got interesting. Suddenly charters were changing, forwarding their own goals, and cautious around people they once trusted. I genuinely would have enjoyed an entire movie based on the 3rd act alone.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the cringe. There's some melodrama. I wasn't the target audience so take it with a grain of salt, but when the female lead is introduced, she sings at the top of her lungs at the reaping ceremony. You later find out she's a performer, but being introduced to her like this had me literally looking away from the screen in second hand embarrassment. She also sings at the top of her lungs during the climax of the movie during the hunger games which felt a little cheesy.In act 3 they also start referencing the previous movies A LOT out of nowhere. Within 10 minutes they start randomly singing the ""Are you, are you"" song from the previous movies, they look in the sky randomly and say ""look, Mocking Jays!"" And then pick up a random root and go ""this root is called Katnis!"" - it was bad. Stop that.Overall though, I had a good time and if you liked the previous movies and read the books, you'll probably enjoy this movie too!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While I'm not the biggest fan of the original movies, I still see them as very entertaining. The problem here is the lack of focus and missing some really easy focus points. This movie is really easy to save by simply focusing on one of the storylines more, but it derails itself by being more or less 2 movies in one, and I would have preferred this to be split so we really got a situation where we could dive deep into the world and it's characters instead of a surface level look.Coriolanus Snow is a young man training to become leader of the capital. He and his fellow classmates are assigned to make the 10th Hunger Game more interesting by making the contestants famous before fighting.The biggest issues with the movie to me is the aforementioned lack of focus. The movie is very easy to fixed by focusing on some of its elements more, since they are actually interesting. Making a movie about the first fame Hunger Game is such a good idea. What went right and wrong, how would they turn the people and the ideas, and some of these elements are here, but are never in the forefront. The same could be said about the journey of Snow. He has to turn into something, but that journey is not clear or well-made. The first half of the movie his barely in focus, and by the end, the journey he makes in the second half doesn't match the first. It's a mes. Even the romance aspect is rushed. The movie wanted to do too many things at once, and the result makes a movie that is barely about the things it's about.The characters also lack depth and story to really make us care and root for them. Snow's character is poorly explained, since everybody goes along with his idea, even people in power! Why? He's a kid! The lack of emotions and attachments really got to me, and it bored me.Because the movie becomes boring. It got to a point where I simply didn't care anymore. It goes from one thing and derails into its own sequel, and without the focus it feels uneventful, and it becomes too long, split this movie into 2 with more focus, and you have 2 decent movies.There are some good performances and shots though and some really gripping scenes, some involving guns, some with mockingbirds, it's interesting that the movie feels this well-made while the script doesn't, I think the grandness despaired for me. The Hunger Games isn't big yet, and it can be felt. It seems more boring and lifeless, and that's the point, the problem is that we, the audience, also fell that.I also need to question the Katniss moment from the first Hunger Games. It bothers me that she started a rebellion when she did. In this movie, there is even a Katniss type character doing a similar event to hers. Why didn't that start a riot? Who knows.While some of the performances are good, the dialogue is terrible and the actors don't have a lot to work with, sadly. It makes them look bad, but it's easy to distinguish that it's not the actor but their material.This movie with a way too long title is a mess. I really wanted to like it and while there are elements I did like, the story told just simply didn't grip me at all. It was a boring and too long experience, and the problem for me is that I can see the easy fixes, which means the team missed it somehow.","36 out of 61 found this helpful.

This could've easily been a two-parter.My favourite casting choices were Lucy, Gaul, Highbottom and Sejanus. Coriolanus was acted well, but I kept thinking how he was too tall and old looking, and I didn't like how fake the blonde curls looked when his hair was still long.The costuming was great I thought, and I loved the academy uniforms with the skirts over trousers.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While the film endeavors to engage a diverse viewership, its foray into musical sequences presents a double-edged sword. The narrative, rich with potential for emotional depth and thematic complexity, might have benefited from a more restrained approach to its musical elements. Arguably, a singular, impactful musical scene could have sufficed to convey the depth of emotion intended, without potentially overshadowing the storyline's broader themes and pace.The movie shines in its technical and aesthetic aspects. The costumes and makeup are meticulously crafted, enhancing the visual storytelling and helping to immerse viewers in the world of Panem once more. The action sequences are well-executed, striking a balance between spectacle and the story's darker themes.Performance-wise, the cast largely delivers. Viola Davis stands out in her portrayal of Dr. Volumnia Gaul, bringing a delightful complexity to her character that captivates the audience. Tom Blyth, as a young Coriolanus Snow, provides a nuanced and compelling look into the psyche of a character destined to become one of literature's most notorious villains. His evolution from a character driven by greed and ego to the monstrous figure we recognize in the subsequent films is both convincing and chillingly portrayed, underscoring the talent of the young actor.The film does not shy away from exploring themes of occupation, reprisal, and the darker facets of human nature, making it relevant and thought-provoking. Through a sinister and despairing lens, it scrutinizes the mechanics of power and control, resonating with viewers familiar with the franchise's critique of authoritarianism and societal inequities.While ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" undoubtedly has its charm and moments of brilliance, its appeal might be somewhat narrowed by its targeted demographic and creative choices. Nonetheless, it remains a worthwhile addition to ""The Hunger Games"" saga, offering both entertainment and a platform for deeper reflection on the themes that have made the series a cornerstone of young adult literature and cinema.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That I love and will hold deer from now forward.I first found the book accidentally, bot knowing there was another chapter to the hunger games out and even that had come out recently. Took it without a thought and loved it.It has its cons, like not having delved deeper into the Snow's woridview and his never stopping thoughts, maybe like seconds to every sequence would've been nice. And a bit more into Lucy Gray's character, interacting little bit more with the world.And still I think the film is amazing, because I still loved it even with these, though small, noticable details, even when comparing to the book's depiction. Amazing take from the book. Francis Lawrence did as always, with few exceptions in that always. The cast too, great performance with a few meticulous edges. For some characters you don't need something more to them, because there is something that is central in the plot and it must stay there not get distracted. They work even that way.The atmosphere was like I imagined when reading, if not then next to that what imagined. Some details and looks and deets were left behind, but first. That's how it is, when they have to make it shorter, which for me longer would've been even better, but that's me and second. Not leave the more important actions out. The important is to make the whole world as it was created and to make it work in people's eyes. I'd say it works, there is thrill, there is suspense, but you have to listen and watch with your whole body and instincts, because every way of talking of a character and some of their moves, show how they are, how they work and what are they, also what they think they are or others are. It's how a character is being acquainted to.So if you want some tension, some good character exploration from the characters themselves, some suspense in the actions forward and a movie with chapters, exploring its story's different stages and development - plus if you want well delivered book adaptation of the same name, then go and watch it, unless you don't like songs in movies - characters that are singers (therefore they sing, because it's what they usually do - not all the time, of course, it's not a musical) , unless you tend to hate adaptation, although try it, but stop judging just because you expected not to be annoyed that much, well you may see if want to go or not, watch the trailers!Thank you for that adaptation and may the odds be ever...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Fixing just this character would have made this film close to greatness, because almost everything else was good. The casting, the acting, the sets, the story.Tom Blyth was great, Viola David too. Most other characters were filler, but they were cast well and did their job. As opposed to the original trilogy of films, this felt more grounded, more mature. It wasn't perfect, but I enjoyed the film.There were three parts of the movie, the third felt the most rushed and frankly I would have probably liked the film more if it were not part of it. It would have also brought it to a normal length; I hate these modern three hours productions. If you can't tell your story in 2 hours, that's a problem. The story was intriguing, documenting in a tense and oppressive way the rise of a villain, I think one of the most entertaining types of tales out there, but the rushed third part muddled that a bit.I can't believe I am saying this, but this deserved a split into two films. As such, you are left with a bitter aftertaste, like someone took something that you felt had coming from you. Enough to turn one into a villain.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was like a clean slate for me, because it was not so anticipated, from my side; so just start watch and whatever will be...will be. Hardly remember Panem and the main characters from the Trilogy, but i remembered president snow as A Character (that was played by Donald Sutherland).Can't say that I remembered him as one of the biggest villains that the cinema has ever seen, so it was not very clear why do we get this movie, that President Snow is his main protagonist / antagonist. Unwillingly, I've started almost three hours of watching and finished the experience pretty satisfied. It was a good movie, with great acting performances and stood by its own, while telling a story with subtext. Don't think I remember it, as i haven't remembered its siblings, but it was pretty solid.The characters were pretty freaky. Peter Dinklage was Dean Casca Highbottom and for the few times he came in the frame he was excellent as usual. Viola Davis as Dr. Volumnia Gaul was nuts. Not easy to swallow this pill and I am sure she was to be less grotesque, or maybe not, but she accomplished the mission, as for her acting skills and impact on the movie.Both actors in the leading roles were fine and especially young Tom Blyth, that took the chance to make a name for himself. Cant say that he was too interesting or I was too interested to see his transformation, but he made it pretty well - the movie didn't and while pacing slowly into the next and third chapter of the movie, suddenly Francis Lawrence started running.The director has told a story about the hunger games and the privileged young people that were chosen to be mentors and how snow was part of the competition, but when he needed to flip into evil, the process was too short and too quick in relation to the progress of the film's pace.As part of my personal conclusions of the several days watching of this movie - it seems that it doesn't have a lot of right of existence, as part of a cinematic universe. Take the fact that the last chapter (which was divided into two movies) doesn't grant the permission to make another one and yet... a prequel was born...cause, money...you know.It's a good old 6.5 and probably will be forgotten until next reboot or whatever movie they will invent.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

With this being an entirely new story I approached with some trepidation not having read the novel and was pleasantly surprised. I saw on the credits that Suzanne Collins was on board as Executive Producer and it shows, as we get a story much in keeping with the look and feel of the originals.Without wishing to give away the plot suffice to say that the actual hunger games play a lesser part in the story. Instead we concentrate on a young morally ambiguous Snow, played excellently by Tom Blyth. Viola Davis is excellent as the chief game maker, with a good supporting turn from Peter Dinklage. Although I would have liked a bit more of his character. It is a good origin story that stands on its own two feet and allows for a further story to be told before we get to the original and on this showing I would welcome it if the producers are inclined to go for it.I want to make special mention of Rachel Zegler. At the time of writing she seems to be getting a lot of hate online. I don't know why, and I'm not inclined to bother looking into it. What I will say is that this is the first time I have seen her in anything and she is also very good as Lucy Gray. Lucy is not a Katniss clone so don't expect a fierce warrior as portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. Lucy is a musician, much more vulnerable and placid in the hunger games arena. However, she is important in the development of the Snow we come to see in the original trilogy. Lucy as a musician gives Rachel the opportunity to belt out some songs and wow can she sing, what a voice.This isn't going to go down as a classic movies, but neither did any of the originals.

I enjoyed it. Whoever did the casting did a great job as the actors cast really fit their roles well. Particularly, Tom Blyth as Snow - fantastic performance. Rachel Zegler as Gray did an excellent job as well. Both Viola Davis (super creepy as Gaul) & Peter Dinklage (very believable as Highbottom) were great, as usual.The grandiosity & lavishness of the Capitol on the big screen contrasted with the ruin & squalor of District 12 was impactful. The pacing was good - action scenes but also a very character driven story. Taking us along for this cinematic ride makes it easy for viewers to see how the younger Snow becomes the man he is when we meet him in The Hunger Games book 1.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

If i had not done this, i would have found this movie intolerable. The only reason i was invested was because of the fresh smell of Katniss Everdeen hanging above me. Without the prior films this movie doesnt hold up in terms of engagement. This being said, because of my fresh rewatch i was pretty invested in this story and actually found it really interesting and well construted. This film has great production value, great cinematography and an alright cast.Alright cast... alright. Some of the performers were... not alright. In fact they were quite... bad *cough* Rachel Zegler *cough* The poor writing was no help to her case.I found the film score to be incredibly weak as well. James Newton Howard had a great opprotunity with a hunger games revival to make something awesome. It was not awesome.I Left the theater feeling unsatisfied and BAD. This film leaves you feeling bad. Some good things going for this film, but some downsides as well.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As a prequel, this does a wonderful job of setting up characters later seen in the movie franchise, but if viewed as a standalone it falters to shine on its own.The trailer promised a wondrous spectacle but probably due to its drawn-out screen time some sequences lack spunk, especially after The Games are concluded. It's also perplexing that with its extended screen time, a lot of character motivations are glossed over, and the final act is rushed through. The Hunger Games was mostly uninteresting and this can be tied to how we're given less time to invest in the characters, and also in how quickly the games take place.The infusion of the songs is done splendidly and Rachel Zegler's voice pierces through in those scenes.Tom Blythe gives a rousing performance as Coriolanus Snow and Rachel Zegler delivers as Lucy Gray even though she sometimes leans towards theatrics. Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage are this movie's shining light, stealing the scenes they appear in, and it's a crime they didn't get more screen time.In conclusion, this prequel blazes from the hanging tree with good performances and setpieces but is doused by its script and screen time.6/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was completely sucked into this film - the story, and the characters were so easy to love and hate that I felt completely transported into Panem and watching Snow evolve as a young man through this film was both stupendous and heartwrenching. The obvious desire for power over humanity becomes glaring when you see how a man's ambition can supersede his very heartsong and Lucy Grey is the perfect heroine to test the valiance of such a man.When you see how easy it is for the madness of war and the degradation of a society controlled by totalitarians who seek only to control populaces using tactics that divide and conquer, it's easy to find the similarities with modernity and how swiftly the descent into madness and gradually becoming the essence of 'evil,' occurs. I highly recommend this film for all people who enjoy seeing the nature of humanity when tested by the ultimate atrocities and how love conquers only when we allow it to.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

And I did!I loved this movie. It was dark and mysterious, and very different from the trilogy. You kind of root for Snow, but then, you know who he is so you aren't sure what parts of his character to trust.The movie shows the early Hunger Games, which are primitive and lacking in viewership (no surprise). The main character, Coriolanus Snow, and his classmates are given assignments to mentor the tributes (children) and come up with ideas for the Games.The movie is in 3 parts. I really liked that they made the film long enough to give the different themes time to sink in. I thought it was the perfect length. I suppose the singing could have been a little more engaging because some of the songs were slow but I thought the style fit the period/feel really well.It makes me wish that Collins would write another book in the ~60 years between this and the trilogy, so we can see more of how the Games developed.There's a lot of detail to miss on a first watch. Must see again!!","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Those rating the movie with poor ratings because it was different than the book are ridiculous. Of course it's different than the book, it's based on a screen play.

Despite high expectations, the film fails to capture the essence of Suzanne Collins' gripping trilogy, leaving audiences yearning for the intensity and emotional depth that defined the source material.From the moment the opening credits begin, it becomes painfully evident that Rachel Zegler's Hunger Games is marred by a sea of cringe-worthy performances that even the most forgiving viewer will struggle to overlook. The cast, including Zegler herself, delivers a collective display of wooden acting that undermines the gravity of the dystopian world they're supposed to inhabit.","43 out of 78 found this helpful.

So I think one big missed opportunity is with the plot around the Mentor Program and Corio Snow. Something that has always stuck with me are the servant master relationships we hear about during the American Slavery period. Famously, Thomas Jefferson had a very romantic time with one of his slaves. There should have been more about Lucy Gray, what does she really feel, does she feel grateful? Do they really fall in love or is she playing him? Yes there is that in the beginning but the movie never has the guts to say, these people are in a deep love for each other even though its a sick relationship with an extreme power imbalance. Perhaps they could show her having the power over a foolish Snow. She gets him to rig the games for her and yet has a soft spot for him by the end. Snow could be scandalized by being shown addicted to his ""lesser human"" girlfriend and therefore his cheating allegations and exile would impact him because he would be deeply grieving feeling that he would never see Lucy again. Lots of ways they could go with this.Also there is just not enough done with the 1960s TV premise. What if this was the first Games in Color? People in The Capital would see the red blood of kids for the first time, would that make a difference on how Panem sees the kids? So many characters could bring you a deep feeling through their eyes of seeing all this awful trauma.How Snow relates to the people on District 12 how it made him change The Hunger Games in how he did how it made him see the people of Panem as human beings and yet how he rationalized seeing himself as worthy of dominating and controlling them at the end, is stuff that can take the viewers on a ride of terror and imagination.The premise, theme, storyline and dialogues of this movie in the right hands are Oscar winning. Too bad they failed on most execution. Another movie that could be life changing wasted in the Hollywood machine. At least it was watchable and had some cool world building so 5/10.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

What movie is ever needed? A movie should be judged for its intrinsic qualities, not by the need that it supposedly fills or lacks, and for me the movie was definitely a welcome surprise.To be honest, Rachel Zegler is so irritating in interviews that I was expecting to hate the movie because of her, alone, but given the singing requirements for the part, I can see why she was chosen and that she was probably a good fit for the role. She didn't run away with the spotlight, but she held it, which is all that the supporting role required. (The main character is not Gray; it's Snow.)I thought that the world building was sound. You'd expect a movie set 64 years before ""The Hunger Games"" to depict a less advanced society, and the movie does a good job of unwinding the level of technological development of Panem. There are no elaborate game arenas. There are no game pods. There are no high-speed trains. As you expect for a society recovering from a devastating war, life is hard even in parts of the capital. There seems to be a much smaller gap between the capital and district 12. Of course, district 12 is poor, but the people aren't portrayed as near starvation as in the original. They've been living under the tyrannical regime of the capital for only a short time, and the capital and districts haven't yet settled into the dreadful equilibrium shown in the original movies. The residents of district 12 have a nightlife and some basic freedom compared to the residents of district 12 in ""The Hunger Games."" All of this could be expected from a society finding a new modus vivendi.I never gave much thought to the development of the world of ""The Hunger Games""---I just took for granted that the peace of the movie was imposed and let the story develop on the stated foundation---but the movie answers basic questions that could be fairly asked of the original. Were the people of the capital just morally or ethically inferior to the leaders of our world? (Are they just less hypocritical?) How were the Hunger Games received? How bad was the war? In something of a surprise, the movie portrays the Hunger Games as of low popularity because on some level, they offend the moral sensibilities of the people of the capital as well as the defeated people of the districts, and the starting point of the plot of the movie is an assignment for the characters, students in a school and leadership academy with a wide range of opinions of the games, to devise ways to increase the popularity of the games before the games are simply permanently canceled by Panem's president. The movie builds toward a philosophical explanation for the purpose of the games, to perpetuate the status quo by reminding everyone of their respective roles in the world: in the world view supported by the games, the world is divided into victors and vanquished and is stable as long as everyone remembers their places.The original movies and books didn't really try to provide much of a justification for the games beyond Snow's account of hope in his conversation with Crane, and the speech didn't really explain the development of the games because the perspective represents a view of the games as an entrenched institution and not the kind of view that could have been used to promote the games to an ambivalent capital public. The movie offers interesting, new perspectives on the purpose of the games, a perspective that could have unconsciously driven at least the promotion of the games if not their unconscious embrace by the public, as well as giving a bit more depth to Snow, who is torn between the higher ideals of Tigress and some of his classmates and his personal fears, something like his own, internal hunger games.In short, the movie was a lot of things, but it wasn't unneeded. It's definitely worth watching.In more general terms, I found the acting and effects to range from competent to excellent. In fact, the characters come across as much less caricatured and much more nuanced than the characters of the original movies.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I wish Lucy Grays and Snow's relationship was developed a lot more and the complexities and intricacies of it was explored. Like, she leaves him so suddenly (which I understand the symbolism and motive behind) but we get no warning as an audience and it takes away from the whole villains-are-slowly-forged-from-circumstance message of the book/movie. If we were to gradually see Snow become worse and worse (which we do, but again it's these really rough jolts and jumps) the ending and his ultimate fate as the dictator later on would have been made so much more impactful and meaning-full. We don't get to see his fondness turn into liking turn into love turn into obsession for Lucy Gray, so we're left so confused as to why in the freak he is so balls to the walls ready to cheat, bribe, murder and commit treason for her? In the book, he sees her as so enigmatic and charming and that draws him to her at the start, but her helplessness and her dependence on him in the games is what makes him start to crave the power he feels when he's in control of her life, and if that was shown, the audience would understand the ending so much better. However, it was good; the set design was so realistic and convincing, the costumes were really accurate to the book yet still creative and fun, the acting was very entertaining and believable and Rachel Zegler does a stupidly fantastic job with her singing and Appalachian accent. It's a spectacular movie, I just wish there was more.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The problem is this is an incredibly boring villain origin story. Do we blame the book? I read it and it's not great so that's part of the problem...Despite the book's failings I think so much could have been done with the movie, characters better fleshed out, maybe a way to know Snow's inner dialogue would have helped. Anyways Hunger Games fans like myself will watch the movie and probably like it. I gave it a five for the actors who did the best with what they had and a nicely done dystopian world. There's too many misses to mention, but nonsensical plot lines, poor costuming, and lack of real chemistry between the lead characters are top of my list. Like many others have said: I would have much rather seen a Haymitch back story. Maybe that's next!","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Although, this way I knew what was coming, what was going on, etc. I feel that yes, there were details, not thoroughly explained, included, which I never really like, as it makes movies feel lashed together.The film was very long, as they tried to put everything from the book in it. I liked the characters, I do think the casting was spot on, everyones portrayal felt like the characters in the book, the sets too! They made the music come to life in a great way also!The problem with it is actually whats the best in it...how muvh they tried to stick to the book. I liked the book and I like how it come to life in front of my eyes. However, I do know that ~300 pages worth of story greatly explained in a book cannot be put into a film completely as it is. I'm glad they didn't change much, maybe they should have concentrated on a few bigger things and expand them (character development, etc) or explain the smaller things a bit better, maybe just leave out if it's too much detail.The ending was like this in the book!! It's meant to be confusing! The whole story for that matter. That's why it's a fresh angle. And for criticizing the singing and why it's in there...I cannot even begin.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

As holiday and awards seasons approach, the theaters will be overflowing with new releases. We've been seeing the trailer for The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes for months now. It is a prequel to The Hunger Games movies that starred Jennifer Lawrence. Now, we get to see how the world that Katniss revolutionized came to be. Here's whether this prequel proves its worth.The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes takes place 64 years prior to the action of the original The Hunger Games movie just before the 10th Hunger Games is about to begin. Our main character is Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), a bright, ambitious young man determined to win a cash prize that will help him restore his family's stature in the Capitol. Snow becomes one of the first set of mentors for the 24 tributes for the 10th Hunger Games. Snow also comes up with a plan to revitalize the Games and provides counsel to the head game maker, Dr. Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis). Meanwhile, Snow is assigned the feisty tribute for District 12 Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). Lucy Gray has a magnetic personality and a beautiful singing voice. Snow uses his ingenuity to help Lucy Gray try to survive the Games. Singing, snakes, and child-murdering hijinks ensue.The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes like its title is too long and a bit convoluted. At 2 hours 27 minutes, this movie really could have used a trim. In fact, while the story is told in 3 chapters, it is pretty distinctly 2 movies. There is about an hour and 15 minutes that feels out of place. Despite that, this movie is never boring. There is so much going on that your attention will be held for the entire runtime.The cast will hold your attention. Even though I don't think she is that good an actress, Rachel Zegler makes you care about Lucy Gray. Moreover, she is beautiful singer. She gets to do a lot of it in this movie. The songs aren't great, but her voice is beyond. Tom Blyth does a good job as Snow as well, but it is the supporting cast that overshadows the two leads. Viola Davis is doing the absolute most in this movie and I am here for it. She relishes every moment of screen time and when she is not on screen, you will be thinking about her. Davis is perfect here. Jason Schwartzman and Peter Dinklage also get to ham it up and add some spice to this movie. I could have used more of both. The production design and visual effects utilized throughout help to build the world of Panem. This dystopian era is portrayed very vividly. It is a feast for the eyes.Ultimately, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a very entertaining movie. Even though it is too long, it is able to keep your attention with moving songs, a virtuoso performance by Viola Davis and great production values. You'll get your money's worth if you choose to go to the theater. Grab a big box a popcorn and return to the world of Panem.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I actually fell asleep in the theater for the first time in my life, and that's what compelled me to write this. I understand the importance of singing to the story, but it doesn't match the tone of the movie AT ALL. We're just bursting out into song like it's a 2010 Disney channel movie. I feel like I got whiplash every time she started singing because of how wrong it is for the tone of this film. Additionally, I felt embarrassed for the actors during several of the dramatic scenes leading up to the games. And then you get to the actual games...I don't know that I've ever seen a film with such an unearned display of violence. It's genuinely brutal. I normally applaud a film that has the balls to kill a kid. It's usually unexpected, and when done well, it creates incredible tension. In this movie, you're expecting kids to die, which somehow just adds to how distasteful the actual violence is. It's completely unearned. We've had random singing, terrible dramatic acting, scenes that feel like TikTok fan fiction, and everyone in the capital is twirling their moustache like a Bond villain. Whether the writers like it or not, this movie is WAY too campy to allow for this kind of brutal violence and social metaphor.I don't even really want to get into the last 45 minutes, or whatever it was. The main guy acts like a sociopath the entire film, and we know who he becomes, so I don't feel I'm spoiling anything by saying that he continues to be a sociopath, and everyone acts accordingly. And it's boring, and confusing. So its boring until it's violent, and then it's boring again, with a little bit of pointless confusion sprinkled on top.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

It is a prequel to the Hunger Games Katniss was involved in and it talks about how President Snow became the president of the 13 districts. To me the best part of the whole movie was Lucy Gray, played by Rachel Zegler. There has been a lot of controversy about Rachel, but I must say that girl can act and sing and was in fact, perfect for this role. Her version of The Hanging Tree was amazing as well as all the other songs she sang in that movie. The guy who played Snow was really good too and when you watch this, it makes a lot of sense why he ended up being the way he was in the first 4 movies. Without a doubt, story wise and action wise, I would say this is the best Hunger Games movie like almost everyone else is saying. I give The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes a 9 out of 10.

One of the major letdowns lies in the portrayal of action sequences, which, in my view, failed to captivate and fell short of delivering the excitement one would expect from a film of this genre.Moreover, the movie's problem-solving elements left much to be desired, earning it a resounding 0/10 in this department. The narrative seemed to lack the depth and ingenuity necessary to engage the audience on an intellectual level. As a viewer, I found myself yearning for a more compelling and intricate storyline, but sadly, 'The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' fell short of meeting these expectations.While I understand that opinions on films can vary, I felt compelled to share my perspective on what I consider to be a lackluster cinematic endeavor.

I went into the film having read and seen the original Hunger Games series many times as a teen and adult, and I especially love the fictional world of Panem.I think people got lost because the film is trying to condense a massive novel with rich worldbuilding and relationships into a 3-hour format which outright omits many stories. When Mockingjay released, many fans were disappointed with the slow pace of the films; but rewatching the series back-to-back shows how perfect that development was. With so much plot to cover and so little time to do it, some of Ballad's performances felt rushed, especially when it comes to representing internal dialogue that was described at length in the novel. Therefore, I'm not making any statements about the performances. That's your task! Go watch it!I left the film wanting more from the world, characters, and differences between the historical periods it takes place in. The Ballad thoughtfully reframes our perception of the other films and the characters within it, but only if you keep an eye out for it. There's still plenty of mystery that propels the story. There are many profound moments when you go into Ballad without reading the novel first, as you connect the dots between the main series and see how they came to fruition. This is clear in the deep worldbuilding of Suzanne Collins and the production design throughout the film and series. American, Roman, and post-Soviet architecture fuse together to illustrate decay and oppression globally and throughout history. Together, these reinforce the central theme of the film (in contrast with the original series) that we are all capable of committing violence, delving into the moral dilemmas which influence us. While the original series takes on a clear moral tone, the exploration of individual and societal morality in Ballad makes it a particularly timely piece. If you miss out on that, I implore you to think about it.The production design, while living comfortably within established Hollywood styles, is wonderful. If you have an eye for set, location, costume, and lighting- there are plenty of inspired details. CG is minimal and rightly so. I only noticed it once, and that lends to the tasteful fusion of historical and contemporary style that gives The Hunger Games the grit we are used to. Perhaps with a longer running time, we'd see more of the locations that make the series so distinct like the Seam, daily life in the Capitol, and districts 1>11. Ballad still lacks some of the ruggedness it needs, starring characters with perfect makeup in a literal human zoo, and fresh-faced folks on the brink of bankruptcy- that definitely took me out of it.I think the goal of a PG rating was ill-advised, especially as the real horror comes from the story's psychological elements which would leave a young person impacted anyway. Despite that, the composition and direction use our own imagination to make the most of that PG rating, presenting death theatrically, but not unbelievably.Oh, and the pacing isn't slow. Like, at all. Sure, it's not the overly-fast-paced media we've become so accustomed to, but it's filled with action and even the slow scenes take place in well-designed locations to keep your mind busy.Overall, I just wish the studio gave more screen time to this delightfully crafted piece, perhaps splitting it into parts. Definitely a must-watch for any fan of the Hunger Games.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Normally, it's a perfect series with both a strong plot and an original old film, but this new film is both empty and long. Moreover, the atmosphere is so different that it seems a lot has changed in 65 years (compared to the original film). There's no similarity in the setting, and I find the setting quite dull; it's a major mistake.Characters: The actors weren't bad at their jobs, but they weren't good either. Definitely, the acting in the first film was much better. I can say that the actors were a bit inexperienced, and especially, they couldn't convey fear. There were no scared expressions on their faces; it was as if they were playing a little charming game.And finally, thanks to them for ruining the perfection and indispensability of the film.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

But so many 1-5 stars... is it the same quality as Twilight or what?I enjoyed the movie and found it refreshing since it's not purely about love or the games themselves but rather about Snow and his character extremes. It is not overly dramatic to say that he is who he is because of betrayal or love issues... not at all. He was who he was since day 1, the most cruel person is the one who pretends not to be. I would gladly watch a sequel.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I know it says ballad in the title but that does not justify the commercial musical songs that are thrown in there to distract from plotholes.Blythe gets way too much screen time and nevertheless the character development from nice guy to evil Snow falls down from the sky like a dead mockingbird.It's a painful watch that made audience sitting around me cringe at their kissing scenes, because it all seems forced and chemistry is lacking.And why did the make up department decide to give Zegler a YouTuber 2014 Glam Up ? A girl from District 12, come you all can do better.This is nowhere near the previous movies. The extras did well though, a better performance than most actors.","13 out of 20 found this helpful.

The dialogue was so confusing, and the characters made no sense. Every scene something didn't make quite sense. Wether it was a characters reaction, or his motives. And it doesn't help that the main character is so stupid to look at. It seemed like they tried to make him look complex all the time or cynical, but he just ended up being really unrelatable. But probably the thing that annoyed me the most was the chapter thing. Why did they make it in to three chapters, when the ""chapters"" just blend into eachother. Maybe the gap between chapter 2 and 3 made sense, because that he was transferred. But the chapter 3 screen was so short, that it didn't seem as if, we were going to a new chapter of the story. Because the new chapter just started so quickly. The movie also tried so much to be a kind of masterpiece, but that didn't work either.","14 out of 22 found this helpful.

Is it emotion? Is it calculation? I ponder these questions often especially when turned inward. I am a social, yet solitary, individual, that can be multifaceted in what drives me. This dichotomy is helpful for me because I can see things from an outsider's point of view, and from being among others.What is that point of that paragraph? Where is the movie review? Why are you still reading? Something drives you. In this film, I, like most people, wanted to see the early development of the character from the previous films. I volunteered as tribute and got my ticket for opening night. But, with all of my reviews, I went for more than the ""oh so that's how it happened!"" moment. Would I understand the complexities, or would it be simple?I was delighted to find it very complex. Without spoiling, stimuli will always have a factor in a person's choice. But when that choice does not go as intended, it can be natural for a back pedal to lead toward another choice. A person's desire to keep pivoting to save face can lead to the most unfortunate consequences. People... tell the truth. The story can still be told without being an episode of Three's Company where everything was based on misunderstandings. (I'm dating myself here).The title is very apt and ironic, but I'll let you interpret it as you see fit. All those words have literal, metaphorical, and symbolic depictions. It was fun re-arranging my perspective. I promised no spoilers but my perspective did end at a very specific conclusion that I wasn't entirely pleased with.So, I ask again what drives a person? Watch and find out.I enjoyed this film, and do recommend it, for both escapism and the over analyzing I love to do. Just ask my friends! :)","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

It plods along at a snails pace, and nothing ever happens.The acting is shocking even in it's best moments, you would think it's a cast of child actors with how hammy and fake their reactions are. The lead woman is just shockingly bad, almost like she is loading emotions when needed and you can see the loading times. Her random bursting into auto tuned song was so weird too. It never made sense, she just randomly sings and for some reason that saves the day every time.The leading male does an ok job but again not enough to say it's good enough.And eesh the story is just nothing at all. It's a movie where start to finish, absolutely nothing happens or has impact other than the 3 heavily focused maguffins which might as well have big neon signs pointing at them that they will shortly be used to move the glacial plot forwards.This feels like they googled a few key words from the originals and just crowbarred them into this abysmal movie.

Rachel Zegler's singing and acting are excellent, though do take a few minutes to get used to, and certainly I get why some say that there are too many musical interludes here. I acknowledge that some of the things she's said show that she's not the best feminist yet - let's please keep in mind, she's 22 years old. I would definitely say she's well on her way. Give her some time to have more life experience and reflect on these things more, and I'm sure she'll get there.It has been 8 years since we last got an entry in this film series. Some would say that the moment has passed. And that this does not have enough new material to justify making it. That it smacks of corporate greed. In my opinion, this was the exact perfect time to make another one. Allow me to explain why.This is the first of these to be made after the PG-13 rating was pushed so far that it could properly allow for coming extremely close to showing the bloody violence that the subject matter requires. While this is not as intense as certain parts of the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, it is very obvious that it came out after that one, rather than shortly after the first one. The action and tension are the most visceral yet, and each death hits you like a sledgehammer. They're also the most clear and well-staged, easy to follow with one very effective long take.Some of the central issues that this franchise provides social commentary on have become worse and/or visible to a general audience. Regular people are forced to work ridiculously hard for less than a living wage, while the rich live a sheltered existence - it's very telling that several major characters in this feel no fear of actual danger, but instead consider their potential embarrassment to be a fate far worse than the certain death of 23 teenagers that had no way to avoid becoming Tributes.The youngest generations find themselves in a world where they have to be constantly camera ready, and the gig economy provides what little they have to live on. They either grow up too quickly or seemingly not at all, while their elders, those with significant power, who have created the current terrible conditions, judge them harshly, sitting in their ivory towers, insisting that it couldn't be any other way. 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow is influenced by several people in his life who try to encourage him to go in specific directions, and the potential for the future that he and his peers at least hypothetically hold is underlined; to either create a better society, or destroy all hope of it for generations to come - to let nationalists completely eliminate civil rights of anyone they deem lesser, or to wrestle back control.Those reporting on deadly conflicts may not actually care, or feel they have any skin in the game, and might treat it with little sensitivity, provide no context and simply try to get great ratings. There was never a long period of this movie that did not make me reflect on incredibly sad recent news stories. I understand that this is a negative for many, and I 100% respect those who disagree with the following; I don't go to movies to turn off my brain and be completely distracted from tough reality. I go for something that will help me process it better. And this absolutely delivered that.I recommend this to anyone who believes they can handle it - you'll know a few minutes in. 8/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The emotions. The OG cast gave stellar performances, eveybody was cast perfectly and conveyed what their characters were going through. The Ballad felt somewhat empty. None of the characters were compelling enough. I found Lucy Gray to be too perfect, her relationship with Snow was rushed and lacked depth. The supporting performances were also mediocre, nowhere near as good as Haymitch, Effie or even tributes like Rue. In a minute of watching Catching Fire I felt more emotions than in the whole Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It's unfortunate since that's where the strength of this movie should have lied. It is obvious that the games themselves aren't that entertaining to the audience anymore after watching the trilogy.

It's well-made, that's for certain, and the actors are trying extremely hard to believe in the world the filmmakers have put them in. But it just smells so...Hollywood. DOA. It's like looking at a corpse of a Hunger Games movie. Clearly, it's going to make a zillion dollars, especially internationally (I saw it in a semi-packed theater in Madrid). It's almost like what Disney is doing to Marvel -- inventing pre- and back-stories that actually don't need to exist because they add nothing to the canon, nor do they change the way you see the other movies. No additive comprehension. The Games themselves were much, much too short, and they solved the problem of the games themselves in a deus ex machina way that was deeply unsatisfying. I'm super impressed with Rachel Zegler, because she clearly is a talented musician who learned probably 10 different songs for this movie...but in the end, the whole thing feels like a borderline musical meant to appease an imagined audience consisting mostly of teenagers. In other words? Weirdly gimmicky. I found the whole thing boring, and kind of stale. Give it a pass. You'll be fine.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Katniss everdeen started out as this quiet, archy loving girl until one day when all of that changed. My mind switched from ""This is a good book,"" to ""I need to finish this book."" I grew more attached to the book because I could really connect with the characters and know how they are feeling. The characters had so many unique personality traits that made each one of the characters different which is what I liked most about it. Some people might call a character they don't like ""dry"" ""boring"" or even ""plain"". I could never describe a character in this book in any of those word but that is just a small part of why The Hunger Games is so good!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was a fan of both the original series books and films. I haven't read the book this latest film was based on, and after watching the film (as much as I could stand), I likely won't bother.What the previous books and films did well (for the most part) was convince you a world where society was so broken that people would watch children slaughter each other on tv was possible. They built a universe with a history, characters, and circumstances that made sense, despite their extreme nature.But this film did none of that. We're introduced to characters, the protagonists, who immediately seem absurd. It was like they were trying to channel Harry Potter in a world that was never about magic, but instead about human evolution under extreme forces.One of the protagonists starts randomly singing while in Renaissance Faire cosplay within the first 20 minutes. People in the audience sing back-up. Why?! It was sentimental, saccharin and just silly. We don't even know these characters yet, but should buy that they're singing sending the protagonist off to die?I tried to continue watching, but none of the actors even seem to be in the same room as each other. Their interactions are unbelievable; Rachel clearly does not understand the tone of these stories and seems like she's been involuntarily transported from a Broadway stage. I didn't make it past the tv introductions of tribute and mentor scene, not even 30 minutes in. I can't stand terrible films, and this one just wasn't worth my time.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Set several decades before, we learn how Anekin become Dart... okay wrong movie... but the same basics happens here. And the rising Hollywood star Tom Byth delivers a very convincing interpretation of young Coriolanus Snow. However, you cannot say the same for the female lead role in Rachel Zegler who portrayed a country western signing version of Lucy Gray. The unconvincing character portrayal failed to deliver any convincing chemistry that the story require. And there is question around the lack of technological advancement outside of laboratory. Nevertheless, most of the movie is a good story. It is not as epic as the Hunger Games movies in the past, but an adaption of a novel that serves its purpose well.","4 out of 21 found this helpful.

The acting across the board is fantastic with Tom Blythe stealing the show. The music, cinematography, sets, storyline were all superb. The only flaws in my opinion were the romance between Coriolanus and Lucy left a lot to be desired, the pacing was a little weird in the 3rd act, and Rachel Zegler really seemed to struggle acting when she wasn't singing (which luckily she was singing a lot). Having read the book, part 3 had weird pacing in the book as well so not too much discredit to the film, and Rachel Zeglers poor ability to act was covered up mainly by Tom Blythe as well as all the other fantastic supporting actors. I was truly enthralled the entire time and it made me excited to see a movie in the theaters for the first time in what's felt like forever.

It was almost like this was a musical because Lucy Gray sang about 6 times. This movie would have gotten a 4 star review if it had ended 45 minutes earlier than it did. One of the only good things about this movie were the actors. The acting was good. There was sooo much killing that was completely random and unnecessary. The Hunger Games arena was too small so the fighting was very close up and gruesome.

It falls flat because the author decided this story required ""adult pathos"" to justify its existence, and, most unfortunately, writes that pathos like a 12 year old making their first big foray into Wattpad. Other than a few vaguely satisfying beats in the (very short) Games sequence, there's nothing here but incredibly amateurish melodrama, and that's all true-to-text.All the best parts of the political intrigue and action/adventure that make the first trilogy so engaging are completely absent, or present only as cameo-style, utterly embarrassing call-backs to those 10-year-old stories that actually interested you. The romance was the worst part of the original series, but here you're begging for it because if it's not the current on-screen focus then you're probably watching a bizarre musical theater kid wet dream where Everybody Has To Stop And Be Impressed By Your Heartfelt Singing That Happens To Be Precisely Suited To The Collective Emotional Moment And Isn't That So Cool. There are literally five or six EXTENDED musical sequences that serve absolutely no plot function, but are wielded by the author like plot points nonetheless, because she's got nothing else to offer while moving the story forward.This flick may not actually be 525,600 minutes long but you could sure fool me by the end. Hard pass.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

The movie leans heavily on shallow acting and a fairly simplistic musical style that might find an audience among certain viewers, but for me, it didn't quite click. Spending three hours on it left me wanting more. I was expecting a deeper level of storytelling and quality, especially considering the high bar set by previous installments in the series. While it might resonate with those seeking more straightforward entertainment, it lacked the intricate storytelling and character depth that made the earlier movies so compelling.

There are some good moments, few and far between, I was feeling pretty bored half way in and was hoping it would end, but no, it goes on... and on. Overall the dialogue is pretty rigid and unnatural, the plot is a bit of a mess, the acting is pretty bad from most - Rachel Zeglar especially cannot act. It might have been passable if they'd replaced her with someone who didn't do a Zoey Deschanel staring gurn all the damn time.

Despite its attempt to delve into the origin story of President Snow, the film struggles to captivate audiences. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition that lack the gripping tension characteristic of the franchise.The choice to center the narrative around a young Snow feels misguided. While exploring the evolution of a villain can be intriguing, the execution here feels forced and fails to humanize the character. Donald Sutherland's charismatic portrayal in the earlier films is sorely missed, leaving a void that the new lead fails to fill convincingly.The film's production design is commendable, successfully recreating the dystopian world of Panem. However, the visual elements alone cannot compensate for the weak character development and a lackluster script. The absence of a strong female protagonist akin to Katniss Everdeen is particularly noticeable, depriving the story of the resilience and depth that defined the previous installments.Furthermore, the film's attempt to provide social commentary on privilege and power lacks subtlety, coming across as heavy-handed and didactic. The subtleties that made the original trilogy thought-provoking are sacrificed for a more straightforward narrative, diminishing the intellectual engagement that characterized earlier films.Despite a few redeeming moments, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" ultimately fails to capture the essence of its predecessors. Fans of the franchise may find it disappointing, as it struggles to live up to the legacy established by the original trilogy. While the film has its merits, it pales in comparison to the thought-provoking and emotionally resonant storytelling that made ""The Hunger Games"" a cultural phenomenon.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

I went into this optimistically excited to see Snow's rise and fall with power. I wasn't disappointed as the performances were captivating and engaging throughout. I enjoyed the story and the precedent for the Katniss and future Hunger Games. Definitely worth watching!People who red the book for this say it is a little fast paced and should have been made into multiple movies. However, from the stand point of not reading the books, it felt well paced and made you feel for the characters.Sure it can be annoying when a film adaptation isn't a direct mimic to the books, but this was a great movie and doesn't deserve some of the bad reviews that are being given.","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

I found his depiction fascinating, as he navigated the delicate balance between being a jerk and a good guy. For those of us knowing the story of the original Hunger Games movies, this installment allows us to understand the roots of his character's attitudes when he is older. Blyth's performance added layers to the character, making him more complex and intriguing, and is one of the rare events where we might feel sympathy and loss for one who at first may have seemed unredeemable.While I appreciated Rachel Zegler's portrayal, especially if the books have emphasis on Lucy Gray's singing, I wasn't as enamored as some other reviewers seem to be. Zegler's back-woods accent, while almost authentic, occasionally felt a bit distracting. Nevertheless, her performance contributed to the overall narrative, and she represented the character well.The movie's pacing was a notable strength. It struck a fine balance, being calm enough to allow for the exploration of the complexity of Snow's development. The deliberate pacing also gave room for a few humorous moments, some well-executed action sequences, and, of course, engaging Hunger Games action.We watched the film as a family and remarkably, none of us ever felt distracted or bored, proving the film's ability to maintain interest throughout. This is a rare quality in a longer film, and it speaks to the movie's ability to captivate a diverse audience.In summary, 'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year so far. It was crafted with care, evident in the attention to detail and the well-developed storyline. The performances, especially Tom Blyth's, added depth to the characters, making the movie a compelling and thoroughly enjoyable.My go-to way of judging a movie is how we feel walking out after it's over, talking over the high and low points. All of us had only good comments for The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, and we all agreed it's certainly one of the movies to see this season.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie seemed to go on forever, and I found myself fidgeting with my phone multiple times since I was bored with all the dull scenes.Much as in the literature, the characters speak in a similar manner. The acting is top-notch. The scenes are paced appropriately. Still, you don't care about a single plot point since the film is so dull.In comparison to the previous Hunger Games films, this one was terrible. My excitement at the announcement of a new Hunger Games film was palpable because I adored the first four films in the series. There was just too much graphic and pointless violence in this film.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

The film in itself is not bad but it is far too tightly screwed together it could use more immersion in the development of various characters. Even though the action is packed, it is still long drawn out and you can't help but look at your phone to see what time it is when you are sitting in the cinema. Tom Blyth plays the role of Snow fantastic, but I can't say this about Rachel Zegler, she makes the film seem like a musical, she generally just doesn't fit into the film as Lucy Gray, she lacks this ""bad ass"" thing that Katniss/Lawrence had. Overall, the film is nice to watch if you need something to ser when you're bored, but I can't recommend watching it in the cinema, it's not worth it.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

I personally never read the prequel, but am definitely inclined to do so now. Overall very entertaining and engaging if you're a fan of the series.

I had no trouble with the music as it played a big part in this movie (songbirds) so if it was viewed and too much, that would be the viewer's loss. I will own this one since I have the original 3.

I could not have asked for a better movie adaptation, gave us hunger games fans what we wanted and gave Snows character so much more depth. Tom Blyth and Rachel Ziegler played the leads perfectly, could not imagine anyone else as Snow and Lucy Gray. I can not fathom how anyone could dislike this movie genuinely. Having read the book as soon as it was originally released, I was so hyped for this movie and it lived up to my expectations. The movie was quite lengthy but it needed to be to cover all that happens in the book; it could be said that it felt rushed however I think the pacing matched the vibe and atmosphere of what was happening in the book, it was all life and death situations which naturally would feel fast paced.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Going into this I had set my expectations low based off of what I read going into and seeing the previews. I was totally off wrong on this one. This is a Prequel to the original Hunger Game films and tells the story of a young Snow who ends up becoming President of Panem. This movie is probably the darkest in the movie series with very brutal kills for a PG-13 rating. I would also say the film does a great job of showing how Snow goes from being good at first to the crazy President of Panem that we all know. The only thing that this movie doesn't do well is with pacing. The movie was very overlong at 2 hours and 30 minutes. There could have been some scenes that were cut or at least trimmed down. I really thought our young Snow played by Tom Blyth did a really good job. Also our character Lucy Grey played by Rachel Zegler was amazing. All in all this was a very solid film and I really enjoyed it. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes gets a very good 8 stars out of 10.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Movies and their characters rarely gives me icks where I feel disgusted seeing them. Dr. Gaul and Casca gave me the icks whenever they pop on screen, especially Dr. Gaul. I love this movie so much, this movie makes you realize that not everyone, aka Snow, never just turn out evil. There is a reason for it.Don't get me wrong, there is no justification in Snows behavior of why he acted the way he acted when he takes over as president. However, I understand why he turned out that way. One just simply should not do people that way and what happened to him involving Lucy was wrong and what Lucy did to him was wrong.I sympathize with the situation that Snow went through with Lucy but I don't sympathize with him at all. Again, no reason to be acting like that. Yes, Snow got his heart broken and was done wrong by Lucy. Totally understand his anger. So what? Move on! There is more fish in the sea then on earth. Snow should have found someone else to fall in love with. No reason for him to be holding onto old crush, his 1st love all the way into his old age (80+) and then 60+ yrs later go after a woman from district 12 who reminds him of Lucy.As far as Lucy goes, she also was no angel herself. Her and Snow was not all the way trustworthy. Lucy was a snake in her own right. I felt she used him to win. Was her love for him even real? I don't think so. Other then that, such an amazing film that I can watch over and over again.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

I don't remember anything about THG series its been years since I watch those movies but i loved every second day this prequel story.. It had an amazing cast, some good cinematography, highly tense and thrilling moments and a gripping story which will keep you engaged from start to finish.. What I love about dystopian stories is the subversion of rules we have today now in real world.. The term dystopian itself means in terms of fiction is 'a society running by some elites of the world in near future where normal rules of humanity don't even apply' as you can see even in this movie elites don't even see contestant as humans but rather as a means of exploitaion for their own entertainment.. They were thrown into an arena where they have to kill each to survive. There are some heavy dialouges in this movie which will make you realize that in the face of death humans lost their humanity and morals in a blink of an eye..

Despite the 2 hours and 37 minute run time the story is rushed and relationships/plotlines were not developed.The romance between Snow and Lucy was developed slowly yet deeply in the book and their relationship made sense. In the film you have to use your imagination (go figure) to see how the two could have fallen for each other in such a short period of time. There was absolutely no chemistry between the actors in the film and their casting was terrible.In the book, Lucy is extremely likeable and Snow's motives are developed with much more depth. In the film, Lucy is underwhelming at best and not likeable more often than not.The voice actor whom sings in the audiobook does wonderful renditions of the songs in the film, which leads the films versions to be very disappointing.Sejanus was annoying in the book but was a likeable character, in the film Sejanus is just annoying.The casting/acting were terrible in this film. I half expected to find out that this was the director's first film and that the casting director was an intern.Lastly, Maude Ivory was a truly missed opportunity. Maude Ivory in the book was so cute and likeable yet in the film she is just someone onscreen.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The idea of seeing how the main antagonist from the previous films rises to power is so intriguing.Rachel Zegler gave an amazing performance and she has a phenomenal singing voice. The film would have lost a lot of charm if her performance and character was not present. The costume design was fantastic as well, as you really get an eerily dystopian distinction between the rich and the oppressed citizens.I thought the CGI was a little shaky at points. The titular snakes needed either more practical effects or just tweaking how they looked in certain lighting.Through other online reviews, I have heard that they left some important details or features from the book.

That Suzanne Collins made it clear that there was only the three books, and she didn't want to do anything else until she was ready was a welcome change from an entertainment industry that likes to squeeze as much money out of popular things as fast as possible. With this in mind, I can applaud The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023) for being respectful of the original trilogy while also trying to expand the narrative in prequel form.While not a completely necessary prequel, it was still interesting to see how early versions of the Hunger Games were run. Of course, our knowledge of how they eventually evolve into something worse is only staved off by seeing just how Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) ""lives long enough to become the villain."" Having not read this book yet, the over 2.5-hour length of this movie felt a bit much a times as they tried to cram everything into it.Still, through an ironic twist of fate, movies about the Hunger Games are still entertaining for the same reasons the Hunger Games are entertaining. These characters are bizarre, but interesting. Rachel Zegler was the best choice for the role of Lucy Gray, which should come as no surprise for anyone who saw West Side Story (2021). Even the famous actors (like Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage, and Jason Schwartzman) add the gravitas needed to make The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes not just another prequel cash grab.The Hunger Games prequel that deserved to be made, I give The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes 4.0 stars out of 5.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I wasn't *not* a fan, because I did like it, but after the second installment I kind of checked out of the whole thing. Then I saw this. I even mistook the trailer for a sequel to the new D&D movie, because that's just how different it was from the others. Understandably, this may upset many people who loved prior Hunger Games movies because this one could really be it's own thing with how completely divergent it is from the originals. However, I think that's what makes it so great. Don't get me wrong, I despise it when a movie, especially a reboot (which I somewhat consider this, like a prequel-boot), strays so far from the original that it's basically not even related anymore, but for this movie it's done so beautifully. Especially for newer audiences who maybe did not watch the original Hunger Games. Maybe I'm going too far with the following comment, but would some agree that for someone who has not watched the previous movies that it would be a very nice introduction to the franchise?In summary, the movie itself is an amazing one, but a problem that I did not have, but many may is that it does seem moreso like it's own movie than anything, but for those who are willing to take that risk, you really won't be disappointed.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Snow didn't seem to lose his mind. He just seemed to be turned into a being of pure evil in the last 10-15 minutes of this USELESS 2.5 HOUR MOVIE. I wish I had not wasted the time on it.

Now, with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, we're transported back in time, decades before the events that shaped Katniss Everdeen's life, to witness the rise of a young man destined to become Panem's most feared figure - President Coriolanus Snow. As the 10th annual Hunger Games approaches, 18-year-old Coriolanus, a charismatic yet ambitious student from the privileged District 2, finds his life taking an unexpected turn when he's assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird, a tribute from the impoverished District 12. With the Capitol revelling in the spectacle of the Games, Coriolanus is determined to make a name for himself by guiding Lucy to victory.However, Lucy proves to be no ordinary tribute. Her rebellious spirit and captivating singing voice challenge Coriolanus's preconceived notions of District 12 and the very nature of the Hunger Games themselves. As the two navigate the treacherous arena, a complex and unexpected bond develops between them, forcing Coriolanus to confront his own prejudices and the harsh realities of Panem's oppressive society.The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes masterfully captures the essence of The Hunger Games universe, delving into the dark origins of the Games and the moral complexities that lie at their core. Director Francis Lawrence delivers a visually stunning and action-packed spectacle, while screenwriters Michael Arndt and Michael Lesslie weave a compelling narrative that explores themes of power, loyalty, and the human capacity for both cruelty and compassion.Tom Blyth shines in the role of Coriolanus Snow, effectively portraying the character's transformation from a self-serving young man to a ruthless leader. His portrayal is nuanced and layered, revealing the cracks in Coriolanus's carefully constructed façade as he grapples with his growing empathy for Lucy Gray.Rachel Zegler delivers a captivating performance as Lucy Gray, infusing the character with a blend of vulnerability, resilience, and a touch of defiance. Her singing is a potent symbol of resistance in the face of the oppressive regime; it is both beautiful and haunting. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Ayomide Adegun and Hunter Schafer delivering memorable performances as gamemakers Sejanus Pliny and Tigris Snow, respectively.The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a visually stunning film, with cinematographer Mark Gordon capturing the grandeur of the Capitol and the brutality of the Games arena. James Newton Howard's score for the movie perfectly complements the narrative by adding layers of suspense and emotion. The film's editing is crisp and effective, seamlessly weaving together the various storylines and maintaining a brisk pace throughout. The dialogue is sharp and witty, capturing the essence of the characters' personalities and the political machinations of Panem.Offering a new take on the dystopian world and its inhabitants, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is an exciting and thought-provoking prequel to The Hunger Games saga. It's a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, leaving you pondering the complexities of human nature and the dangers of unchecked power. It successfully expands the dystopian world of The Hunger Games. With its strong performances, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking themes, it's a must-see for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

They watch wrong movie, for them they just need to watch film like lala land.Edit: I'm going through the review and I found people that read the book praise the movie, there's also many who read the book feeling dissatisfied. Though I don't read this particular book, I've read enough book and seen enough adaptation to say that this is a worthy adaptation. You can't expect movie to have the same degree of quality as the novel, that won't happen.

He is mesmerized by District 12's Lucy Gray and her singing. Coriolanus wants to achieve back his family's lost glory and he wants to do it through Lucy Gray. He along with his best friend Sejanus are sympathetic towards the tributes and wants to do the right thing, amidst the rebel's constant attacks. What truly happens post the Hunger Games, the impact it has on Coriolanus and his friendship forms rest of the story.This was indeed a lengthy film and unlike the earlier trilogy, this doesn't feature the Hunger Games for that long. Probably, that is what got me a bit restless as the drama took a whole 2 parts to settle in. It is only in the part 3 where I was able to invest properly as the story focused on Coriolanus, Sejanus and Lucy Gray. What the film did succeed in getting the dystopian world setting despite the Hunger Games segment not being that intense. This still manages to set up the story for the sequels to take over and there is enough mystery intact to stay interested.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I only really went because I was offered a ticket and the premise of the series was mildly interesting to me. I heard how long it was when we showed up to the theater. I thought there was no way my attention was going to be held on this movie for that long. My movie tastes are really not dystopian films. I am a diehard horror fan, my favorite sub genre being torture. Horror is what I live on, and it's hard for a movie without intense gore and scares to hold my interest for even a regular movie length, let alone a long one. I have no idea how it did it, but I was fixed on the screen the entire movie. Interested and invested. There were some sickening scenes, none of which were visually too gory, but the undertones and set up made them impactful all the same. There was some darker humor in there that made me absolutely cackle, however bad I felt for laughing at it. I really, really don't know how they did it but they held the attention of a torture movie fan for over 2 hours with a PG-13 movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter series in terms of popularity among teens and young adults. The first three books, ""The Hunger Games"", ""Catching Fire"", and ""Mockingjay"", were published in consecutive years, 2008. 2009, and 2010, and were subsequently made into massive box office hit movies, the first in 2012; ""Catching Fire"" in 2013""; and ""Mockingjay"" made into two films, Part 1 in 2014, and Part 2 in 2015. Each of those films starred Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12 (located in the Appalachian region). In 2020, Collins released a prequel, ""The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes"", that was set some six and a half decades before the events of the first three novels. And in 2023, that book too got made into a massive opus of a movie.Although Lawrence's character of Katniss Everdeen is absent here, THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS AND SNAKES does get into the meat and bones of how one character, Coriolanus Snow (played in the three films before this one by Donald Sutherland) came to be what he became in the main trilogy. As played by Tom Blyth, Snow is assigned to be a mentor to a District 12 contestant named Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), an itinerant mountain girl and folk music singer, to help her win the tenth edition of the Hunger Games. This sets him up to be closely monitored by the Games' prime mastermind, Dr. Volumnia Gaul (played with rather vicious relish by Viola Davis), and the games' creator Dean Casca Hightbottom (Peter Dinklage). Zegler manages to win the Hunger Games, but many complications between her and Blyth ensue afterwards, as do his relationships with, among others, rival Sejanus Plith (Josh Andres Rivera).As directed by Francis Lawrence, who helmed CATCHING FIRE and both MOCKINGJAY films, THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS AND SNAKES, aside from being Dystopian in ways that I think would have been hard for even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell to imagine, is quite hair-raising in terms of its action sequences, occasionally imperiling the credibility of its PG-13 rating. It is also quite a long movie at almost two hours and forty minutes, though that length is offset by the action sequences, and the breaks into Appalachian folk music that Zegler's character indulges in, and which earns her the support of the Hunger Games viewing audience. Zegler, whose role as Maria in director Steven Spielberg's beautiful 2021 reworking of WEST SIDE STORY is one for the ages, does a very good turn as Lucy Gray Baird, with her folk-singing voice being very much reminiscent of Mother Maybelle Carter, Joan Baez, and Linda Ronstadt; and although this role isn't quite on the level of what she did for Spielberg, it is nowhere near the hot mess that her detractors (of which there seem to be far too many), and she really gets into the role in the District 12 ""bar"" sequences.THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS AND SNAKES, even with its weird complications, twists, and turns, earns a rating of 8 from me.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

He is handsome and charming, and though the Snow family has fallen on hard times, Coriolanus sees a chance for a change in his fortunes when he is chosen to be a mentor for the 10th Hunger Games only to have his elation dashed when he is assigned to mentor a girl tribute named Lucy Gray Baird from the impoverished District 12.The plot is set in the 3 chapter structure. The first 2 are rather well paced showcasing the origins of Hunger Games, how they were created being full of mostly well executed suspense and action scenes as well as character development.The 3rd and the final chapter feels a little anticlimactic and somewhat rushed...The performances are rather strong leading with multi talented, young yet charismatic Rachel Zegler, which plays the character of Lucy Gray Baird a singer chosen from district 12 as a tribute.She becomes assigned to Snow as her win guaranties his success in social ladder claim.I must say I feel sad for Zegler that she has been blacklisted in Hollywood after her silly remarks about the new version of Snow White adaptation.At age 22 she had her whole career in front of her and now going the arthouse career route might be difficult to say the least. Very talented singer in her own right, she actually sang life all the songs, which are performed in the movie. She has that endearing quality and yet also possesses some strength, which makes her very watchable. I hope the Hollywood power players will grant her a comeback after her ego find humility, as she hugged the proverbial cactus long enough...;).Tom Blyth as young Snow displays duality clearly having daddy issues,which create deep need to fulfill his ambitions no matter what costs.Viola Davis as Dr. Gaul conjures an inner witch within, opting to dive in towards theatricality over ultra realism. In supporting cast Peter Dinklage stylized on to morphine addicted Jesuits-priest teacher, brings depth in his choices.The production and costume design works very well stylized on rather analogue technology, as digitized electronics perished in war due to presumed Electro Magnetic Pulse weapons, brings the Hungar Games back to basics.The insignia of Panem looks to have Freemasonry
symbology, as the new world order post Apocalyptic reality is without religious connotations.The costumes of the elites specially male are wearing both pants and dresses symbolizing unity of sexes are all well throughout.The peace keeping units having United Nations clear inspiration are adding additional believability specially in act 3.All in all this prequel is rather entertaining, apart from somewhat misstep in pacing in act 3.When chapter 2 finished with finally of Hunger Games, which keeps the audience quite engaged, going toward character driven chapter 3 feels little anticlimactic, but specifically the fans of the original source material should be satisfied, considering that this film adaptation apparently follows the book adaptation faithfully.Recommend!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everything is either poorly done or then very overacted, over dramatic and pompous. Starting from acting, to costumes, to special effect, writing, everything, it was either poor or mediocre. It felt like I was watching an over length episode of a lousy stream series which is cancelled after the first season due to poor view ratings. Then some extra things like musical style singing to reflect the story with dramatic fashion was totally overacting and way too overdramatic. Just an example of weird decision to add extra drama into the movie. Everything felt so out of the place.Other reviews have also mentioned that the scenes were loosely connected. I also felt it was like that. Not to mention that it was very difficult to follow what really this movie is about. The story is so confusing. I had no idea after the movie that what the districts are there fore, what is the Capitol, what are these mean looking soldiers and how they fit into the concept of Capitol, what these hungergames are really for and so on. The amount of open questions was like vast. Then the sheer amount of talking with completely meaningless dialogue. Oh my God.After the second part, the movie is split into parts by the way, I was completely lost that what the story in the movie is actually all about. Then some story lines are concluded with super lame fashion. Just suddenly something is happening just for some reason to kill the characters so that the storyline can be concluded.This kind of movie makes me really think that how the movie industry is going so wrong with big budget movies. Somehow I believe that at 80s or 90s with this budget, people at the industry would had made something way much better. In this movie, there is virtually nothing spectacular, nothing to see explicitly at the cinema. This movie is a total filler into stream service catalog what you may watch into some point at home and then just close the movie because it's so lousy. Maybe stream services are killing the cinema industry inside out. Who knows...","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

I do think that original fans will likely appreciate this movie more than most. However, you don't need to be a hunger games lover to enjoy the movie.

Ironically, the film is set in a rush while the book is written at a slower pace. While the film lasts 2 hours and 37 minutes, extending it to 3 hours, similarly with Oppenheimer (2023) movie, could have allowed for a more thorough exploration. Nonetheless, the adaptation works well.Adaptation Details: I read the book and noticed that the film focuses on the most important parts of Coriolanus Snow's thoughts and other of course important details, but it leaves out some smaller details. The director did a good job handling these important parts, making a well-rounded portrayal even though certain elements were left out.Directing and Cinematography: The direction of Francis Lawrence has improved significantly, and the camerawork is outstanding with its camera shots. The visual elements of the film - its colors and camerawork - create an extremely genuine and thrilling mood and atmosphere for the movie.Intense Scenes and Storytelling: The film is filled with tense moments, which increase the audience's engagement. With themes of trust at its core, the narrative is engrossing and skillfully executed. Well done.Acting: The cast performances were impressive. Despite some online criticism, Raechel Zegler's portrayal worked well for me, especially her ""anti-Katniss"" character contrasting with Coriolanus Snow's similarity to Katniss. Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow did a gread job portraying his character. Josh Andrés Rivera's performance reminded me of Matt Damon and he did well; I also liked Lucky Flickerman's performance with his witty character that brought a blend of Effie Trinket and Cesar Flickerman's essence from the original Hunger Games films.Music and Soundtrack: The film featured lively and entertaining Covey music with bittersweet lyrics. Moreover, The James Newton Howard-composed score, which paralleled the style of Ludwig Goransson's score for the 2023 film Oppenheimer for me, was outstanding and consistent with Howard's work on the four prior Hunger Games films.Accuracy and Production: This film, in my opinion, out of all five in the Hunger Games series, most accurately captures the essence of the franchise as depicted by Francis Lawrence, like maybe about 9/10 accuracy. Hence, Suzanne Collins' as executive producer's role in this movie was evident.Overall: I was considerably impressed by The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. I am optimistic about it. The film effectively depicts the essence of the franchise and fills the Hunger Games dystopian world, its characters, and its breathtaking music with new perspectives and topics that could be brought up to the discussion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I also did not care about any of the characters or their well being. I had no reason to feel emotionally attached to any of them. By all means do what you want and check it out but for me it was a huge yawn.

He was tied to the Hunger Games, yes (and that's the only reason they're a part of the movie), he fell in love (that's why it has a bit of that in there as well), the movie has a look into his family/friends/authority relationship, early thought process, mid thought process and his final choice. He had events happen to and around him and choices along the way to make and those made his life go in a particular direction. And I for one think that it was very interesting to see his mind and soul change gradually from one thing to another and to see his reasoning behind it and which actions had impact on it.If you watch this movie as just another part of the Hunger Games series you've already watched, you'll end up giving it a 5 and being bored and disappointed that the ""games aren't the whole movie"" and that ""they're not as ""spectacular"" and ""grand"" as they were in other movies"", that there's no ""never ending, dragged out love story"". But neither of those things are the sole point of this movie. The point is Coriolanus Snows' journey and how his decision changes and adapts after certain events and how it ends up being solidified and think most people missed that.This movies' most accurate description/title would be ""The Life Of Coriolanus Snow"" or even ""The Rise And Fall Of Coriolanus Snow"" (hence I wrote it in the title) and I think the movie is great, interesting and very well made and I would recommend it as a watch. Some parts could be better, sure, but overall, it's pretty good. Try it :)P. S. Most of people's complaints are that it's ""long"" and that it's ""dragged out"" but let's be real, they were just expecting/wanting another movie with 2h long arena fights and they kept waiting and waiting for that to happen and it didn't. If you are one of those, go watch Battle Royal (it's really good if you haven't and want precisely that).","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

On the other hand, the movies based on the trilogy are so powerful and energetic that they have turned Katniss into a symbol.And now, a few words about this movie:
My expectations were, rightly so, enormous-at least 7, maybe even 8 stars. After just half an hour, it became clear to me that this film is simply a waste of time-nothing substantial! Boring, slow, and overacted. Those interested in the series should watch and stick to the movies based on the trilogy, and skip this one.

And what is the story here, star-crossed lovers or rags-to-riches rise of a fascist dictator? The director doesn't know, so why should we care? Finally, if the plot is the latter, then it's really hard to care about the rise of a evil character. And Lucy Grey isn't that much better because she makes many questionable choices and not the ones she thinks are bad. Skip this film and rewatch the OG, which is almost a flawless script and film.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Of course Snow is utterly besotted, and must make some unpleasant choices along the way; as those familiar with Panem know, the odds are not really in your favour.Along with Zegler, Tom Blyth is a promising newcomer as Snow, but it is the senior brigade of Davis, Dinklage and Schwartzman who dominate proceedings.

The stink bomb that sucks in this movie is Rachel Zegler. Yes she was born with a beautiful singing voice (lucky) but she's not much of an actor. At best she is very paint by numbers with zero nuance or charisma. She pretty enough and can sing but I bet had they looked a little harder, they could have cast someone much, much better.

My lack of investment in this series can not be understated, but even I was looking forward to seeing Panem built upon - what it actually provides on that front, though, is practically null, and when you remove the context the audience is already familiar with, it completely fails to sketch a decent picture. I haven't kept it a secret that I wasn't particularly enamored with the filmmaking in those original entries, however, the way they crafted their world easily outshines any equivalent effort here. District 12 was a tactile place, where the hardships and inequality could be seen and sensed, especially when contrasted with the Capitol, which felt properly different. In Ballad (not writing that title in full), it wouldn't be remiss to assume these two places aren't fundamentally distinct. Yes, the Capitol is technologically more advanced and has the structure of a sprawling, concrete city, but you don't feel that. The outside world is never emphasized, and as such, apart from the mustache-twirling villainy of the Capitol population, it doesn't distinguish itself from the 'lower' districts. From all that you can gather here, District 12 is comprised of an industrial complex with surrounding plains, and the most we ever see of civilian life in here is a crowd at a bar having a pretty good time. This is very much a problem when you consider how the driving force in much of the characterization is the moral push-and-pull some figures from the Capitol are experiencing. According to some, there are pressing matters of inequality and injustice that need to be addressed; yet we don't see much of what those issues are supposed to entail outside of some troopers being nazis. Those troopers are in the Capitol too, and usually enforce their policies fiercely, even in that environmental - again, no palpable basis of inequality is established.The Hunger Games themselves are also, to quote Gaul here, ""dull, dull, dull..."". The nonsensical and often arbitrary construction of the Games in the originals always bothered me, but at the very least they made for some engaging scenarios. Here, you have to thank those rebels for messing up the battlefield, or this would've been even more uninteresting than the repetitive forest: you get some stone, some marble, and a bit of debris. Enjoy looking at that for a while. The action does help elicit something visceral out of this bland arena, utilizing some lengthier takes to assist in providing a proper sense of space during the frantic fights - but outside of these specific scenarios this is not eager to do anything of equivalent value with the camera. The sense of space is even lost in the arena itself, where, despite its simple structure, the positions of the tributes are consistently unclear. Do they just disappear, or are they wandering about in a place we've not been shown?I have no clue how well the book is written - and I wouldn't use that knowledge to judge this adaptation, anyway - but this is stuffed to the brim with story beats that come off as bafflingly unmotivated aside from their presence on the preexisting pages, dots to be connected with no need to consider how and why these junctions work (assuming they did in the book). Especially in a character study this is a major issue: if I can't grasp someone's reasoning or motivation, it's hard to understand and connect to them. It felt as if Snow was simply hopping from one side of his moral quarrel to the other, which is a shame, because I take a liking to these gray areas (in particular in this instance because the Capitol is otherwise an utterly one-dimensional antagonistic force).There are some beacons of light to be found, mainly in the practical sets and some of the performances: Davis is delightfully diabolical, Schwartzman consistently hits his comedic marks and Zegler gets plenty of opportunities to use her vocal chords (and if you get second-hand embarrassment during song in a film you're boring, by the way). The whole thing is just entertaining enough - as you might hope from a blockbuster - but not enough to distract from its glaring problems. Ultimately pointless and unsatisfying - in other words, another Hunger Games film.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

This movie does an amazing job of describing the events that lead to Snow's character.

I got to see it will Dolby Atmos and I must say, the subtle usage of music that is undisturbing yet powerful really proves that the sound is even more important than the visuals. I don't mean to disgrace the visuals and cinematography. The iconic Hunger games camera shake and cold-corrected color is not present in this movie, and to be honest, I'm quite glad.

Viola Davis is embarrassed by this one. She should remove her name from the credits. If this aligns to the book, then it is written to cash in on a previous innovative story. Now it's full of its own cliche's and makes one think the original story didn't age well. Maybe it could have been better with real headliner actors as the main characters vs supporting roles. Peter Dinkledge proved he couldn't carry this one despite him being the only interesting character. They should try this one again because it is either too serious or too dramatic. There are no heroes and the singing is a distraction despite being good music. It just isn't appropriate to the story.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The producers learned a hard lesson, but now it seems like it was even too hard for them, cause ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" feels like it has adapted two books into one movie, even thought it didn't.This movie has some serious timing problems. It's definitely too long, but at the same time manages to make you feel like the second part of it is too short and should be extended. I feel like it should be separated into two movies. One about the 10th Hunger Games and the rise of Snow (this doesn't really need much more, that the first hour and a half of this movie) and another one about how he turned from an ambitious boy in love to a overambitious manipulator and tyrant (this one definitely needs more time and depth).The most frustrating thing about the new Hunger Games movie is that literally every element of it is interesting, but still none of them is really well done and fulfills its potential. The main character is interesting, writers try to make him deep, they almost succed, but then they don't have enough time to finish the job, cause the movie cannot be even longer than it actually is.In the end, I feel so much wasted potential that it makes me angry, even thought I'm not really emotionally invested in the franchise.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I didn't see it possible for me to like a book about Snow in her youth, so I didn't really expect much from this book, but as it progressed, the story completely captivated me, I couldn't stop reading, everything seemed exciting and very interesting and I was very curious to know how everything was going to be resolved.It's quite strange and I must say that I was surprised by the fact that I empathized and became attached to Snow, that is, from the original trilogy we know that he became a bad person, but in this book, despite the fact that the author respected the character and did not He victimized him but showed us that duality and that questionable morality, even so you come to love him. Although it is true that Snow had a very difficult childhood and youth, full of shortcomings, that does not justify his actions, he really trusted the Capitol, he liked belonging to that society and in fact he wanted to obtain the power to control it. He was a calculator, he did everything in order to achieve his goals, in short Coriolanus Snow does not do a stitch without a thimble. However, despite all this I wanted things to go well for him, it made me happy when he achieved his goals and it made me sad when something went wrong for him.In the case of Lucy Gray, I really couldn't connect with her, I understand that acting and manipulating others was her game to be able to survive in that cruel world, but I wasn't moved or interested in what she thought or felt. In the end I didn't care what happened to him.Sejanus was a quite contradictory character, at the beginning he seemed too perfect to me and
good to be real, then he started taking some dark dyes and he no longer knew what to think with
Regarding him, he could only believe that it would end very badly.I loved Tigris, the grandmother, Ma, the classmates at the academy, even the agents
of peace, each of these characters was complex, they had their hard part but also the
emotional and sentimental. On the other hand, those of the flock did not inspire me at all, I think they do not know
developed enough to get to know them.And the ending left me speechless, I really didn't expect that or not at all, some things
were quite predictable, however I would have liked to know more about how things
They ended like that, everything happened very quickly and I was left with several doubts.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This was so much so that I had to write a review when I never have before. I saw a comment about the plot having too much context for one movie. I could see that being an issue and I would have been fine with it being a movie with 2 parts. I was so happy to see the Hunger Games franchise back and loved all the information about Panem and how the games began. Someone said they didn't connect with any of the characters. I don't think you're really supposed to as this is about the villain in the main trilogy. I love when there's a movie that explains a character and why they are the way they are. I love his character...I don't love him. I felt it was a lot more grownup than the other movies. The Hunger Games was in it's beginning stages so it wasn't as big and drawn out as the normal series. I also saw a comment saying the main character was dressed weirdly for the time period. She stated that it was her mothers dress and she wore it to feel close to her (this could've been easily made but probably took a lot of time and was probably made for a special occasion). Also, a lot of comments about the amount of singing even though she was referred to as a songbird throughout the movie. I think her singing is what drew people to her. It wasn't boring at all. I think some people just have small attention spans. I'm going to see it a second time. I loved Hunger Games as a tween and I love this as a 26 year old. The extended context and information on the series and the development of the character was great. I feel like franchises need to take notes from Suzanne Collins on how to do a good job with extending a franchise.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I hardly ever write reviews but thought this needed one. I am a moderate fan of the original movies and never read the books. I enjoyed the first 2 movies quite a bit. The last 2 were not great with the fourth being awful.I really enjoyed this one. I would put it right behind the second one as my favorites.ProsSnow was awesome. I thought the acting was superb. This guy is going to do some great things in Hollywood. The writing for his character was top notch. Lots of things to uncover on why he became what he did. Story lines that seemed ""left out"" seemed intentional to show what not knowing everything can do to a person. He clearly carried the movie.Other really good performances. I forget names. Snows best friend. The Game of Thones guy, the host of the games and the game master.I really liked the retro vibe of the settings mixed with all the nature. CGI was apparent but not overwhelming.Cons or so so stuffLucy. I'm 50 50 on her. I liked the storyline but her acting was good in some areas but strange in others. A little overactedThe singing. I've read a bunch of reviews and don't understand the vitriol in the negative reviews. I didn't think the singing was too much. It was part of her character and her background. What made it so so was the facial expressions during the singing parts. See previous comment on her acting. The facial expressions and what not were wayyyy over acted or dramatic even during the slower more chilling songs.There were a couple of things in act 3 towards the end that I didn't understand which at first I was like WTF is this but after thinking more about it. I think it was part of what could drive Snow bonkers to begin with.Overall 8 of 10. I would watch another one on continuing Snows character. It's worth seeing in the theater but I wouldn't feel that I missed a visual spectacle if I had just seen it at home.Thanks for reading.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I just wanted just to skip forward the part III after 2 minutes. Part 3 was interesting, but felt rushed.I totally disliked Lucy Gray. She was an heroic singing gipsy and as such, a complete cliche. She came over as an game NPC with preprogrammed texts. Snow was more interesting, because he had conflicting motives. However, he didn't have the script or time to fully make use of them. The relationship between them seemed forced. The music was nice, but it was too present like ' Hey, remember what we're singing! Don't you forget it!'.Some good parts: I liked the visuals. The theme seemed for me 1950's Russia, and even though I wondered how they could forget lcd-screens and went back to tube-tv's, it was actually nice.I'm kind of in between 5 and 6 stars.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I adored the characters, the story, the songs and so much more. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes displayed the importance of the opportunities given and the choices we make, shape the world around us and who we become. Francis Lawerence provided a fantastic sequel based off Snow giving more depth to the future president of Panem. The cast was by far the most infectious part of the film, with everyone providing great performances, especially from our leads Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler and Viola Davis. Tom Blyth (Coriolanus Snow) had such a powerful performance here and must say I'm excited to see where his career goes from here. Rachel Zegler (Lucy Gray Baird) sang her heart out in this roll and will say I absolutely adored her character, and the songs she sang were perfect. James Howard Newton wrote and composed a great score for this film setting the tone for every scene perfectly.Overall was very pleased with this film and easily landed as one of the best in the Hunger Games franchise.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Drinks read, phone off, room dark. After listening to the iconic Metro Goldwyn mayer soundtrack, I spend the next 2 hours watching ""The Hunger Games"".To me, the film was fascinating. Of course, I had read the books and read all about Peeta and Katniss, two teenagers navigating their way through a district sown with distrust, poverty, and dictatorship. They lived in a gruesome reality where the future hopes of children could be easily extinguished- god forbid their name would be called out at the annual reaping.Yet, while fascinated with how a movie studio had transformed written text into a cinematic reality, I found there to be gaps. There were breadcrumbs as to why a system was in place, and why President Snow cut such a cruel figure as the leader of a system which distributed wealth unfairly and held too-tight to their warped ideal of governance over those they had defeated in a past war.Snow the man could not be seen in the original Hunger Games trilogy. I could liken him to a chess player; a man undisturbed by emotion and instead roused by both logic and a disturbing allegiance to convention.But just as every good person can become bad, every good person can become bad, in very general terms. In ""A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"", it was fascinating to see how the cruelties of both life and human nature force people to make decisions that change who they are innately. I believe this affects all characters, from Coriolanus Snow to Casca Highbottom.To those who haven't watched ""A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"", I implore you to if you are the type to enjoy both action and psychology. And I implore you if you are fascinated with the idea of the system being a propellant in human downfall- that our actions are not only attributed to us, but to our environments.In terms of casting, I believe every character was chosen well. The actor who played Coriolanus, Tom Blyth, was masterful in his use of facial expressions and body language. Rachel Zegler, who played Lucy Grey Bird, was talented vocally, in both singing so passionately and taking on a twangy Southern accent.I also really appreciate the lighting of the film. I feel like the film industry has collectively agreed, behind our backs, to stick to depressing grey lighting comparable to that of Tim Burton. However, this film used both warm and cool tones, and different levels of brightness. For merrier scenes, there were warmer, brighter colors that strengthened this happy feeling, and vice versa. The amplitude of the emotional high and lows was increased. And I think this is how a film should be made, if audiences are to be engaged.The different location were also well constructed. I liked how some structure of this film felt 'antique' compared to the modernity of ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy, but also that some structures in the capitol were in much better condition compared to the time Katniss inhabited. To me, this illustrated the ways in which we can be influenced by glamour and glory to feel attached to our reality, when in fact, this reality might not be sustainable.Kudos to all the people behind this movie.Nice.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is truly accurate to the book and it makes you have conflicting feelings about the main character, as he is known as the villain in the main series but the main character in the movie. It is outstanding how they managed to portray Snow's origin story, first feeling sympathy for him but slowly recognising the character shown in the original franchise. I must commend them for all the Easter eggs and references to the original franchise, it truly elevated the level of detailing and subtext the franchise is known for.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

But I knew it is a ""prequel"" and I figured I didn't need to be super familiar with the other films' plots. Correct on that. The big surprise was how music was worked into the plot with the singing of the main character, played by Rachel Zegler (of the newer West Side Story). Her songs, and other incidental songs in the film, are often in a modern bluegrass/roots music style. They sound excellent in the film and really draw you into a story I otherwise would have found predictable for a dystopian/sci-fi aimed at a youth audience. I stuck around for the credits. The on-screen performed music is all performed by the great Dave Cobb. Also additional incidental tracks are by Sierra Ferrell, Olivia Rodrigo, and others. The film music is great and really makes for a cool theatre experience with the images and sound. And it's always great to see Hunter Schafer's star rise further. I'd see it again, just for the music. Really well done! 👍","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

That was another big failure in this movie. Put that together with a rushed script with no flow and the best is 5 out of 10. And the shift in Snow's character from the beginning to the middle to the end was not played well, fragmented, and definitely not believable.

I Recommend to watch this movie, I have not been able to stop thinking about it since... I read the original trilogy but never got around to reading the prequel but decided to just see the movie. Rachel Zegler receives hate because of a comment she made about a completely different movie (Snow White), and it's completely irrelevant to this movie. She performed more than beautifully in this role. She is a classically trained soprano, and was singing beautifully in her chest voice and with a really good twangy accent (which is more of a mezzo/alto type of singing in this case). From one classically-trained singer with a degree in music who performs for a living to everyone out there afraid to give this movie a chance because of all of this biases against this young woman- SHE IS GOOD! This girl is talented, and the hate is stupid.This movie was by no means perfect, but it was really good. I would have thought it was a perfect 10 if the action was better paced. It was nothing on her part. Definitely not as good as Catching Fire (the peak of the series to me), but better than both of the Mockingjays! Give it a shot without a bias of this young women in your mind and you just might find yourself enjoying it ;)

Tom Blyth did a shockingly great job. His portrayal was urgent and nuanced in all the right ways. So beyond what I expected. I doubt he will be nominated for this but he should. Looking forward to more of him in the future. Josh Rivera who portrayed Sejanus was incredibly moving. Rachel Zegler did justice to Lucy Gray also. I maybe would have wanted a bit more sinister and less campy Dr Gaul by viola Davis but she was still wonderful. Dinklage and Schafer too. I just felt everyone involved really worked hard to tell a tense, difficult and heartbreaking tale of the Hunger Games origins.

I hate Peeta and the awkward romance. Katniss in the first movie&book is great, and the set up of the second games is astonishingly interesting. The third book/movies are terrible except from conversation with Snow, and Coin at the end. I don't understand how people can give this movie 1-3 stars and like the mockingjay movies.That being said, I absolutely loved the book of the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It explores philosophical and moral dilemmas and worldviews, different characters representing different ideals. It barely has any romance, which I appreciate. And we get a deep dive into the villain's psyche and inner dialogue. We do not get to see this in the movie, which is a shame, but I still think it is a great adaption. It distills the essence of the book without leaving essential stuff. I would however recommend both reading the book and watching the movie, for the best experience.I was thoroughly invested through both part 1 and part 2. People who complain about this round of hunger games being boring, seem to miss the point about this being the first ever hunger game where anything actually happens. I still found it exciting. I disliked the whole of part 3 in the book, and most of it in the movie. It's just slow and frustrating. The singing sounded out of place until this part. The movie did however finish really strong, fully landing the concept, establishing Snow as a villain, showing that his good side succumbed.9/10 because I thoroughly loved the parts I didn't dislike. 7/10 if I were to be objective, because it is a solid movie.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Let's say they had it easy plotwise, as the writer really took her time to write another book after finishing the original trilogy and created a very special prequel to lead up to the events that the fans know. If you know who the main character is from the beginning, this is such a special journey to find out what events made him the person he is in the original trilogy (or the original 4 movies). The characters are well written, the actors make them come to life and give them a (singing) voice with mastery, the movie is both packed with emotional and intense moments. Everything is very cleverly portrayed, in a dynamic and faithful way which may not have been possible without the work of the author as this film's executive producer.I'm a big Hunger Games fan and my expectations were very high, and they were not only met, but exceeded.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Mind you, I love post-apocalyptic dystopian fare like any other regular chap, so I thought I'd give this film a go. But well, this is the kind of post-apo yarn where folks are always impeccably dressed with perfect hairdos and teeth, because hey, you may live in a soul-crushing totalitarian society and still care about your physique, right? This made me think of ""Logan's Run"" (yes, I'm old), which is a compliment I guess... kind of.I particularly enjoyed each time we see Mr. Hottie show off his impeccable torso and abs (5 times in about 2 hours and 30mn, it must have been in his contract). At that point I also decided to mindlessly enjoy the ineffable Peter Dinklage (not his torso and abs though). I felt some schadenfreude at seeing him go through the motions of a Song of Ice and F..., er, a Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, heartily quaffing wine while philosophizing about the Snow family. Good old times... Speaking of which, what kind of name is Coriolanus Snow?? Ah well, rather than try to make sense of the Shakespearean ref I heartily enjoyed all the wordplays and witty metaphors based on snow (""Snow always lands on top""). Finally the subtle Christian imagery (he gets bitten by a snake, get it???) revealed this flick to be a deep meditation on good and evil in this fallen world of ours, human nature, and white teeth. Especially white teeth.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Culture? Isn't it what they have been saying for the past ten years? Cultural appropriation is bad; if you do it, you are nothing but a bad person, a bigot, and a racist?Yet, here in this movie, one of our protagonists Lucy Grey sings country songs in rhythm and blues voice even though she is from New Jersey, and the daughter of a father of Polish descent and a mother of Colombian descent. I believe that is the definition of cultural appropriation, am I wrong?Despite an interesting premise, the execution of that premise is amazingly poor. Apart from Zegler and her fake and inadequate accent, the acting in the movie is what makes you continue watching - if you have not stopped already after the one-hour mark. Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis do the most of the heavy lifting, but their characters are not in the center of the plot. Therefore, there is little that they can do to save the film.And the singing is the worst part of the film. Each time they start singing, it is just cringe and embarrassing.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Directed by visionary filmmaker, Sarah Director, the film successfully combines action, emotion, and political intrigue, making it a worthy addition to the franchise. Jennifer Lawrence reprises her iconic role as Katniss Everdeen, and her performance is as captivating as ever. Lawrence effortlessly portrays Katniss's evolution from a reluctant tribute to a symbol of rebellion. The emotional depth she brings to the character adds a poignant layer to the film. The supporting cast, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne, provides strong performances that anchor the story. Newcomers to the franchise, such as rising star Isabella Archer in the role of young Coriolanus Snow, bring a fresh perspective and complexity to their characters. The film's cinematography, led by acclaimed cinematographer James Wells, captures the stark contrast between the opulence of the Capitol and the harsh realities of the districts. The visual style remains consistent with the established aesthetic of the Hunger Games universe while introducing new elements that enhance the storytelling.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Let's turn him heel in the last 20 minutes after 2+ hours of seeing him as a bad guy.""Honestly it was so stupid.

I would have a hard time naming a better person to play Coriolanus or Lucy Gray. But the casting for Dr. Gaul is what made my jaw drop.

As a newcomer to The Hunger Games movies, I found this prequel to be unnecessarily violent. Despite being rated PG-13, it showcased more violence, bloodshed, and killing compared to several R-rated movies I've seen, raising concerns about its appropriateness.The movie was not only gruesome and brutal but also left an uncomfortable impression. The atmosphere depicted a world where everyone turns on each other, devoid of characters to genuinely root for. This lack of relatable protagonists made the entire experience cringe-worthy and depressing.While I acknowledge that the themes align with the book series, the level of discomfort surpassed my expectations. Exiting the theater, my friends and I shared a collective feeling of unease. If the subsequent movies continue to portray such intense violence and the bleak depiction of humanity turning on itself, I may choose to skip them altogether.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

In fact, this is in my top 10, as crazy as that may sound.But now onto why that is. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023) exceeded my expectations a million times over. I absolutely loved every single thing about this.Let's start off with the cast. I'm surprised that I haven't seen much mention of Tom Blyth's portrayal of the infamous President Snow, as he was truly staggering. I knew that this wouldn't be the kind of movie to receive Oscar nominations, but I genuinely believe Blyth's performance was worthy of a nom it was that good. As for Rachel Zegler, not only did she provide us with a passionate and emotive showing, but her singing was beautifully enchanting. Heck, I'm getting goosebumps right now just listening to the soundtrack! There are also some noteworthy supporting performances, primarily Viola Davis', who completely transforms into the sinister, manipulative Dr. Volumnia Gaul, in both appearance and psyche. Her unflinching determination in her ghastly work will leave you terrified of her whenever she is on screen. Additionally, Jason Schwartzman does an impressive job of echoing Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Caesar Flickerman in the original Hunger Games films as Lucky Flickerman here, as he is just as snappy and exuberant as his counterpart.Essentially the entire cast is great. Admittedly though, some of the actors and actresses playing the other students do underperform to say the least, but it's a very minor scruple that I have with this feature.This picture doesn't drag at all, and that is due to an excellent decision to have title cards at the beginning of each act. It may seem like a small thing, but if it wasn't for that, everybody who hadn't read the book, including myself, would've expected the film to end with the ending of Act 2, but thanks to the Act 3 title card, we immediately expect the movie to continue for another 40 minutes or so. If it wasn't for that title card, we would've been sat there for the next 40 minutes or so thinking ""when is this gonna end?"". The reason I mention it is because I think if it weren't for that, this would've received noticeably worse ratings, as a lot of people would've found this to be a drag, so I believe these title cards are vital to the film's positive reception.I talked a little bit about the soundtrack earlier, and it is a wonderful one at that. I listened to it on repeat for hours after I'd seen the movie. Rachel Zegler's songs (which she sings live on set) are the standouts of course, after all they're probably what this installment will be most remembered for, but even the other songs are fantastic to listen to, and I'll probably be adding a lot of songs from this soundtrack to my personal playlist.The costume design is exceptional by the way, definitely the best of the series. You've not only got the iconic, kaleidoscopic floral dress of Lucy Gray, but there's also brilliant costumes for the likes of Dr. Volumnia Gaul, Tigris Snow, etc.I could go on and on and on, but I really ought to stop here. To summarise, this is a captivating and majestic installment in the Hunger Games franchise that will never leave my mind.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

Never read the books. Didn't enjoys everything about the movies before..Except the performances and story as a whole of the Hunger Games world.I will say this movie performances, especially who plays Snow, Viola Davis, and Peter Dinklage was great! The main lady Rachel was pretty good too. Her role was interesting.Let's talk about Lucy Grey. I don't know this character or how much she plays in the books. But it seems from the movie standpoint, she was a free bird. Someone who just wanted to be free to be themselves.She didn't want to be part of the HG and was tricked. So I get why she was confused by everyone motivation.Going to talk about Snow. It was good to see how his character changed little by little. A young man with a legacy, really scared to admit who and what his family is about. And his own motivation to be more. Not wishing at first to offend. But gradually doing so and so much more.His turn was interesting and would had made for a better series on streaming than the movie. Great performance.Since this is Hunger Games, I will say the fights were really good. Not overstated because doing the time of this HG, technology was just coming up. No elaborate computers and stuff.The tech still have issues and created problems.Also I loved where the mentors themselves was allowed to send things, of course due to sponsors.The arena was too big, more self contained. Which made the fights interesting.For those who afraid this movie might not be violent enough... well you are in for a surprise. This movie is more violent than the previous installment. Way more.Again, very good movie for me. I think it helps that not everyone in the cast is super famous aka Jennifer Lawrence. Sure you have Peter, Viola, and others who might be famous but not on Jennifer level imo8//10. Solid movie.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Two and half hours is plenty of time to develop a little backstory on more characters than just Snow. In the original films, I feel like they were able to help people get to know and understand a lot of the main characters. In this prequel, the only people we really come to understand are Snow, Tigress, and Plinth. I wish they would have showed more of the past of Lucy, the original game maker, and even some of the other hunger games tributes. Even the game maker with all her creatures-I wish they would have given even a line as to why she's into that stuff and how she got into it.As for the singing, I found it all very annoying and cringey. Most of the songs actually have a positive tone, which is strange for such a dark story. Lucy also chooses to sing at times that are really weird and don't make sense. She's also exaggerated-her southern accent, her personality, her facial expressions, everything. It's like I'm watching a musical rather than a serious movie. It's also like if you go to Disney and see performers put on a show and do a musical number for guests-it's that over the top. Also, I wish Lucy just used a flat, America/midwest kind of accent-that would have made it 100% better.Lastly, without giving spoilers, Snow makes some decisions that impact his trajectory and I wish they would have had some more lead up to those decisions. Like there isn't enough character development to get him there on some of those early decisions. I think things all end up making sense in the end, but it was a tough journey for the audience keeping with the story to get there. I know some reviews say the movie is true to the books and even some people behind me said ""that was so good!"" So maybe I just don't like the story. You'll have to decide for yourself.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

To be honest, the screenplay is quiet good, and it felt like a full story. But complete is an understatement when the novel which is it's obvious source is about 50ish hours in comparison to 157 minutes. Nitpicking asideI enjoyed the movie, Rachel Zegler though, either you have the accent or you don't make up your mind. Tom Blyth as Snow was a treat, Peter Dinklage *chefs kiss* --- but the real star Viola Davis an absolute gem on screen.So over all I didn't hate the film, but i certainly have my opinions. My biggest one is this.Blyth and Zeglar have zero chemistry on screen together. Apart they are fine, together not so much.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is also easy to find some Katniss Everdeen in the astonishing Lucy Gray. What to say about the Rachel Zegler's voice... just incredibly melodious.Moreover, there were many references that I could have found in this prequel which was completely pleasant to watch.I totally recommend this wonderful and meaningful movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a ""mentor"" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I've seen the movies but when they were released and forget almost all of the storyline before walking into the theatre for this one. This movie is 100% standalone with only there being some Easter eggs for long time fans. Either way I loved the character dynamic between snow and Lucy gray. Phenomenal performances all around. The movie is split up in a way that some could find jarring but I loved it. It kept me engaged and interested throughout the whole 2 hours and 38 minutes. You become really well invested in the characters and start to care about the decisions they make and at times overthink why they made those decisions. This thinking makes the movie have a longer lasting impact as you're still thinking about movie details long after it ended. While everyone can imagine they would make similar or different decisions in the scenarios the movie provides it doesn't ever feel like the audience was cheated out of a story. Every decision has weight and you can clearly see the precursor for why those decisions were made even if you don't agree with them. To have multiple people leaving the theater with different interpretations and inciting conversation like this is something not every movie can do. After awhile of thinking the movie makes more and more sense the more you think about it. This is also an important time in my life so I guess maybe in the future when I'm looking back at this my opinion might be different. This is a phenomenal movie that doesn't depend on you being a huger games fan. It works phenomenally as a standalone movie.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The pacing was rather odd. At times it would feel like the film was rushing through scenes and then at other times, spending way too much time on scenes that don't really further the narrative or show off the characters in any meaningful way.The performances were good but the side characters performances stood out so much more than our primary protagonist.The production and costume design was great, as was the soundtrack.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie, released in the winter of 2023, is based on the novel by Suzanne Collins. This riveting story takes the audience on a journey with Lucy Grey Baird, who is chosen at the reaping to be the female tribute for the annual Hunger Games. This gory game is a form of entertainment, as people watch dozens of tributes get slaughtered and killed until only one remains. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes illuminates ways in which the Seven Media Keys are inherently supported or likewise, inherently contradicted. While a full assessment of President Snow is requires for a proper assessment, one can look at the movie as a whole in order to identify qualities of the Seven Media Keys within it.The first Media Key is ""living a balanced life"". This movie provides thought-provoking and an interesting story line. I would argue that consuming this movie would contribute to the first media key, as many fruitful conversations would be sparked through watching them. Not only would the media be consumed while watching, but further contribute to social interaction and commentary. The nature of the plot includes moral and ethical debates, and themes such as sacrifice, love, and leadership.The second Media Key is ""attitude awareness"". It is important to look at what attitude or set of values a movie portrays, as it has high influential capacity. This movie does not contain a positive attitude as a whole. The characters Lucy Grey and Snow do show sacrifice and hope for one another. However, the end of the story shows abandonment and lying. These are not values I endorse, and would not want to be influenced by. In general, the movie does not glorify these values, which I do see as important to emphasize.The third Media Key is ""Dignity of the Human Person"". This movie centers around the Hunger Games, which degrades the human person in many ways. People are seen as players to be killed senselessly, rather than individuals with rights and feelings. The Capitol, the population of ""haves"", consume the Hunger Games as media themselves, and have no concern for the ""have-nots"". The Capitol abuses their power and wealth for the downfall of the tributes. The entire population is impoverished and struggling, and are disregarded entirely. This in no way affirms the dignity of the human person.The fourth Media Key is ""Truth-Filled"". In accordance with media key three, this movie does show the damage that uncontrolled power and wealth possesses. While the movie does not inherently display major truths, through the horrors of the Hunger Games, the audience can clearly see how the unchecked and disturbing features of The Capitol's behavior are contrary to truth and even basic natural law.The fifth Media Key is ""Inspires Us to God"". Much like the fourth media key, there are endless aspects of this movie that do not show God. Homicide, cheating, lying, and violence are all major themes of the movie. One of the main characters, Lucy Grey Baird, does keep her sense of hope in the good throughout the movie. She acts as the light in the darkness. While no theological aspects are ever shown, her strength shows the love of God in the midst of terrible suffering. Lucy Grey always tries to do the right thing, even if it goes against whatever unjust rules might be in place around her. This is very Christ-like, and she is willing to go to great lengths to hold onto her personal convictions.The sixth Media Key is ""Well Made and Skillfully Developed"". This movie has many high quality aspects to its production. There are several scenes that require heavy CGI, for different backdrops and even injuries that are included in the plot. However, there are stunts, elaborate costumes, and fights that are the result of live performance and hours of training. It was riveting to be able to see the result of both skillful editing, and practice by the actors. Another integral aspect is that there were many adolescent characters, including one with Down Syndrome. I was impressed by everyone's high caliber performance, which proved how well made the film was.The seventh Media Key is ""Motivated and Relevant to Experience"". This movie is not relatable in many respects. In our modern society, we do not maintain an atrocity such as the Hunger Games. For many, this movie might not seem relevant to experience. However, in the movie, Lucy Grey struggles with the internal suffering of isolation and decision making. As the audience, we feel sympathy and even relate to this character who tries so hard to act justly, even when her own life is at stake. So much of humanity can relate to feeling isolated and alone, which is shown while each tribute fights for their lives in the Hunger Games arena.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are references that are in here that are subtle though.Major Props to Tom Blyth for his portrayal as President Snow. He did a good job leading the movie. I will say that his character could have been handled better, and with better build up to how his character could have ended. Nevertheless, the place that he ended up in this movie was believable.Rachel Zegler did a good job as well. The relationship she and Snow had in this movie was believable, and interesting to see. I will say all things considered, she wasn't given too much to do in this. But regardless, still enjoyable to watch.Shoutout to Viola Davis, and Peter Dinklage for being that antagonistic force in this movie. Both were electric on screen, and contributed well to the overall story.I will say that the way this story is a little bit disjointed. I almost felt like there were 2 different visions for how they wanted this movie to go. It felt like they tried to find that balance between the visceral action of the Games itself, with the overall character development, and it ended up not always meshing well in some places. For me, if they doubled down on soley focusing on Snow's character, and why he is the way he is, I think it would've been a better movie.But overall, I liked it. I thought was pretty good. The action was good, and savage at times. The musical score, and soundtrack paired well with this movie. The story, even though it was all over the place, it made sense.Very respectable B-","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie had some of the best acting that I've ever seen since The Shawshank Redemption, but there aren't many times that only one shines. This movie was also way too overstuffed for a two hour and thirty minute long movie, but there wasn't a part that I didn't enjoy. If it was me then I probably wouldn't go see it in imax or something alike. The movie is definitely the goriest and most intense of the hunger games so if you can't handle that sort of stuff then this movie definitely isn't for you in any way shape or form.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I liked the world building aspect, showing us where the Panem of the original movies came from and how Coriolanus Snow became who he ended up being.I will say I did find The Ballad of Songbirds And Snakes slightly too long, and some parts of the movie did feel like they dragged - almost too much in the way of exposition and scene setting.Things I loved - the aesthetic of the film, the way that the filmmakers showed this was Panem before The Hunger Games we all know from the original movie series, and gave it a kind of 1950s Americana-meets-post-war-Eastern Europe look was a great way of visualising we are seeing the past in this universe. The Panem we know in original Hunger Games is definiely futuristic but not a million miles away from our own world, so putting their past into a visual style we could relate to worked brilliantly. My theory on this is that after civilisation collapsed and those left began to build Panem relying on items and records that were left from the ""old world"" to develop their technologies which is why some things look like an almost pastiche of what we know from our civilisation.Anyway, moving on, I think Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth were perfectly cast in their roles. Lucy Gray is a character you can kind of root for but she isn't entirely innocent, and the young Snow is almost likeable and you feel sympathy for him at certain points in the movie, even though we all know what he will eventually become. The musical parts with Lucy Gray singing, in some ways almost made parts of the movie feel like a musical, but actually I found it really worked, though I am aware many others hated those parts.Supporting roles were well defined, and I enjoyed the nod to the original Hunger Games movies with characters like Lucky Flickerman who clearly must me an ancestor of Caesar Flickerman. In fact perhaps he is the one the high chair is for that Lucky mentions on the phone at one point in this film!The actual Games we see in this movie are a much less slick and polished version of what we have come to know. They've only been running for 10 years, and with the Capitol rebuilding still after the Dark Days there are none of the huge and realistic arenas, themed on certain environments and climates etc. They're literally thrown into what looks like an old sports arena and have to make do with what is there. The violence is much more perhaps primative because there isn't the technology or quite as much manipulation from gamesmakers as we're used to.At nearly 3 hours this film does feel over long, but the story is interesting, its visually very striking and the soundtrack is great. Overall I really enjoyed it, though I can understand the mixed reactions of others because it isn't quite like the original movie series. I'd love to see a sequel to this prequal, though we would have to wait for another book first.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I went in having low expectations and was blown away. Seeing Snow's backstory is beautiful and terrifying and a true dive into what makes a villain. There are many ways to view the ending and let's you theorize how and why Snow rose from poor citizen to president. His time throughout this story shaped him throughout his whole adulthood and brings a poetic twist to the original Hunger Games. Sympathizing with a known future villain is amazing and a great way to create and expand a villain.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I don't know, there's just too many possibilities.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

This was a great film except a little slow moving to the characteristics of the characters. I liked there was no action. It focused on Lucy Gray and Corey Snow. I think they could have gone into the love story a little more. I had a lot of questions at the end. I'm want to know where Lucy went. How does this relate back to Katniss? There are plot holes. It would have been better if they referred more towards Snow's character in between the this movie and the hunger games with Katniss. It might explain why Snow has such animosity to Katniss.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Adherence To The YA Source Material May Make Or Break Your Enjoyment Here","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9463329/?ref_=tt_urv","zkonedog","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7826013/?ref_=tt_urv","29 November 2023","""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is by no means a bad movie. It is entertaining, engaging, and has flashes of brilliance. The Hunger Games prequel also is an adaptation of a young adult novel--and such theme focuses may make or break your enjoyment of it.For a very basic overview, ""Songbirds & Snakes"" focuses on Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), the individual who will ultimately become the Donald Sutherland-played villain of the originals. Mentoring District 12's Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler) in a very early Hunger Games iteration, Snow falls for her (or is that the other way around?) and the two form an unlikely pairing that will ultimately lead both of them in very different directions.As I mentioned, there were parts of this film that I truly did enjoy. In some ways, it is a star vehicle for Zegler, whose singing talents are truly special. Seeing such an early iteration of the Hunger Games competition is of course interesting, and there are a number of ""easter eggs"" for fans of the original films to smile at.However, I will argue that ""Songbirds & Snakes"" fails at its primary mission: to show the trajectory of Coriolanus Snow from well-meaning Panem student to the sneering Sutherland villain. The strange thing is, the film doesn't outrightly fail at this task--all (or at least most of) the steps are indeed present. But they are handled with a very YA sensibility befitting the novels they are based on. In other words, the themes and arcs of this movie are best invested by a tween, teen, or younger audience, I think. Some of the material is very much ""on the nose"", while at other times it comes off as a bit lacking in true follow-through of the Snow character mission other than ""well, we know he's going to become the big baddie, so..."".Granted, the original Hunger Games set largely has those YA approaches baked into it too, but the inclusion of Jennifer Lawrence's super-serious Katniss was a tonic (at least for me). As good as Zegler is as an entertainer, she is not in the Lawrence acting category (at least not yet).Perhaps others will not have as much of a ""sophistication"" problem with ""Songbirds & Snakes"" as I did. But other than never being bored, the flick failed to draw me into its key tenets of existence because I felt it was constantly shooting for only the approval of a much younger audience than I.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Much to my disappointment and embarrassment, it was a huge waste of our time. I wanted to like the movie, but honestly, watching the trailer was the best part of the entire film. It just didn't hold up. The movie was far too long (could easily have just been two parts split between the time in the Capitol and the time in District 12). It wasn't very well done, not very well acted, which is a shame because I think this was the best book in the series. And Rachel Zegler...while she is stunning was not a very good Lucy. She was cheesy and boring, not compelling. I mean, personally, maybe I would have liked her more if she weren't such a little brat concerning all things Snow White, but such is life.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I hadn't read the book yet when I watched this movie. Readers say that the film is faithful to the main material almost word for word. That's why I will write everything I liked about the plot as plus points for the book.As a prequel, I loved where the story positioned itself regarding the hunger games. I loved that the anger and pain of war were still alive here, while it was an established culture and entertainment in the main trilogy. I loved that games were not a cultural acceptance, but an innovation that people still question morally. I loved that they were making games so amateurishly and simply because they were decades behind from the main story in technology and experience. I loved that Snow, as a villain, was a real character stuck between what life had thrown at him, the system, and his loved ones. For a youth literature work, I greatly appreciated both its fiction and characters.In terms of the decisions taken during the shooting of the film, I loved their aesthetic choices. Considering the futuristic atmosphere of the original series, I liked the atmosphere of the 80s and 90s America in this story, which takes place almost 70 years in the past. Casting was perhaps the biggest problem in the main trilogy. Here, the harmony of the cast with the roles was very successful.In conclusion, I think this movie is not appreciated as much as it deserves.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Then, there's ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,"" which, for lack of a more genteel expression, hits more bum notes than a drunken karaoke session at your local pub.One can't help but feel that in its desperate clamor to be heard over the cacophony of contemporary cinema, this prequel performs a juggling act akin to playing the violin whilst riding a unicycle - admirable but fundamentally flawed. Its overture promises a symphony of suspense and socio-political commentary, yet what follows is akin to an orchestra tuning its instruments ad infinitum. The melody is lost amid a discordant clamour to check every box, creating a tune that feels more like a forced medley than a harmonious composition.Directorial decisions aside, the plot - if one might be so bold to call it that - seems to have been co-composed by a committee intent on merging ""The Hunger Games"" with ""Frozen,"" complete with inexplicable singing segments that leave one wondering if they've accidentally switched channels. This bewildering inclusion not only fractures the narrative but also screeches across the viewer's sensibilities with the grace of a cat sliding down a blackboard.Despite a cast that tries valiantly to inject some life into this pallid affair - with special mention to Tyrion Lannister's portrayer, who appears as out of place as a penguin in the Sahara - the film ultimately suffocates under the weight of its own vanilla ambitions. It's a cinematic endeavour that's all noise, no substance.In conclusion, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" swings wildly for the fences but ends up striking out, delivering a performance so out of tune with its original melody that even the most ardent fans might find themselves yearning for the sweet silence of the end credits. In the grand scheme of things, it serves as a stark reminder that not all that glitters is gold, and certainly not all that sings is sweet.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Sure they took liberties, both small and big, especially towards the end. However, by ""liberties"", I mean leaving some things out and simplifying others - that's perfectly acceptable.On that note, the movie was both long and rushed at the same time - that can be considered a sign of quality.

The scenes, the clothes... was exactly like how I imagined it.I understand that the movie is fast, I mean, the movie is long but the story is told quickly. The book is so big that you would have to do a 5 hours movie in order to explain everything. But even with that, I think they did a great jobe with selecting what to put and not to put in the movie. Again, the book is really big, is difficult to do a 2 hours movie.In conclusion: of course the book is better than the movie, BUT the movie doesn't disappoint. Actually I think that the movie is more enjoyable if you read the book first, because then you understand the background and the reason why characters do certain things.As I said, the movie was an exact photo of my imagination while I was reading the book.

So hats of to the director for a great job there. However if you are looking for a similar storyline to the first 4 movies you would be disappointed. This movie is dark compared to the others, but this is to be expected as this movie is about a person who will do anything to be in power. Willing to kill anyone to become powerful. It's a great reflection of the capitol and society as a whole. So to anyone who thinks this movie was boring you obviously were not paying attention. This is an action packed movie. At every Twist and turn has a new insight into the hunger games universe. However the ending did seem a bit rushed. But the action was great and so was the story line. Overall a great movie for a difficult time in the world.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

We meet the game maker Dr. Gaul, who is probably the most interesting character in this film...in all of her vile evilness.

Nevertheless, I need to give a shot out to Viola Davis & Rachel Zegler for impersonating believable and unique characters. Acting was definitely on point.Although third act could be more fleshed out to provide more context and develop (even further) the romance between the protagonists, the movie does a great job in creating a satisfactory character arc for Snow, whom we learned to love and hate. The transition of his character from young-adult to president of Panem is nicely executed.If you liked the original hunger games saga you will love this one.

I remember reading the original trilogy in my early teen years and watching the movies as they came out with palpable excitement. This time was different however, because I went in theaters this time without much knowledge of the prequel this was based on and no expectations. Long story short, this movie touched me a lot differently than the originals and I connected with the message of the films more as an adult.At the core of these movies and books is a look at humanity: the good, bad, and ugly. A fictional world that teenage me gawked at as impossibly cruel. And yet, we've had gladiator arenas and concentration camps - among countless other horrible things.I enjoy media that makes me think and this movie did its job. Originally I gawked at the long screen time, but it went along quickly save for a brief portion of the third act.There are a lot of mixed ratings for this movie, but I left the theater with a buzzing brain and a heavy heart.

I guess the point I'm trying to get across is that I'm pretty familiar with this franchise and genuinely enjoy its content.One thing this movie does right are its performances. I know a lot of people haven't been too fond of Rachael Zegler lately, but you still have to admit that she's a phenomenal actor. I've loved her in almost everything I've seen her in, and I really hope to see her in more stuff. While this may not be her greatest performances ever (most of it may have to do with how the writers characterized her, or adapted her (assuming they kept Lucy Gray true to the original book). I think a lot of people who haven't read the original book may go into this film expecting that Lucy Gray is the main character, and while that is mostly true this film is really Snow's story (which I'll talk about more in the next paragraph). I don't think I'm familiar with Tol Blyth as an actor, but I still think he did a good job with what he had (again, he's performing exactly how the writers envisioned him).Probably the biggest complaint I've heard about this film, especially from critics, is how this film ended. A lot of people felt it was rushed and out of character. I'm gonna try to explain it best without spoilers, but I actually didn't mind how they ended this film. Contrary to popular belief, I really don't think the ending was rushed at all. What everyone knows by now is that Snow is the main villain in the mainline Hunger Games films, so it isn't a spoiler that this is a villains origin story. We get to see the fall of a man who questioned the morality of the Hunger Games, to the rise of someone who'd choose his family's legacy over the person he loved the most. I don't think Snow was ever truly developed to become good, because Snow was never going to abandon his family legacy in the first place. It's a tragic ending, but what did you expect? This is an origin story of a villain, and I for one thought it was well done.I don't think this is the best Hunger Games adaption, but I still think it works well as an origin story, and it easily fleshes out the world of Panem even further. I love how this film shows us how corrupt the Capitol is within this universes' government, as we get to see how the Hunger Games in this time period slowly differ from its original purpose (which was still screwed up either way) and start to become a form of entertainment. We get to see this through Lucy and the other District members when they are forced out of their home and onto the battlefield. What I really like about this movie is the fact that the Hunger Games aren't the same as the one's we were familiar with in the original films, this is not only an origin story of President Snow, but for the Hunger Games itself in a sense. The Hunger Games get develop as the story progresses as if the Games are a character itself, and I think this film does this very well. This goes beyond the Districts as Snow is fleshed out within the Capitol. We get to see more of the Capitol and learn to hate it as the story progresses. It's important to flesh out the Capitol's corruption as well, as it expands what we knew about the Hunger Games from the original films.I thought this film was pretty good, definitely as good as the original films in my opinion. I still think this movie is pretty flawed, there are things that could've been explained better, and yea, maybe Snow was a little underdeveloped now that I think about it, but I think that with the runtime that they had, they did a really good job with Snow's development, which is something most people will disagree with. I think if you're a fan of the books or movies, then you'd probably love this, if not, then this movie might not be for you.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think the shots in the ballad of songbirds and snakes tend to look a little bit too dreamy, and a little too 'good' for its predecessors.

Yes, we all loved Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, but she didn't look 16.Despite the shortcomings, the development of many characters, and their relationship with the main character was well-developed without dragging the story.

The original trilogy, both in book and film form, held a special place for me, despite a noticeable decline in quality with each successive movie. The first film, in particular, captured the raw intensity and dystopian allure of Suzanne Collins' world, setting a high bar for its sequels.Unfortunately, my anticipation quickly turned to dismay as I watched the latest installment. From the outset, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" felt like a disjointed attempt to recapture the franchise's former glory. Even with powerhouse talent like Viola Davis in the cast, the movie struggled to find its footing. The narrative lacked a clear direction, often meandering through various subplots without ever fully committing to any of them.One of the most glaring issues was the film's pacing. The story seemed to lurch from one event to the next, never allowing the audience to fully engage with or understand the characters' motivations. This erratic pacing left many plot points unresolved, contributing to an overall sense of incoherence. In particular, the moral ambiguity of the characters felt half-baked. They would commit heinous acts only to express regret moments later, making it difficult to discern their true natures or empathize with their struggles.The performances, too, were a mixed bag. While some actors delivered compelling portrayals, others appeared lost, as if they themselves were unsure of their characters' arcs. This inconsistency further muddled the film's already fragmented narrative. At times, the actors seemed to grapple with poorly defined roles, resulting in performances that felt forced and unconvincing.Another perplexing element was the film's frequent use of musical numbers. There were numerous instances of seemingly random singing, which often felt more like filler than integral parts of the story. These segments disrupted the flow of the narrative and gave the movie an odd, almost surreal quality, akin to a teen musical rather than a dark dystopian saga.The screenplay itself did little to salvage the movie. The writing came across as lazy, with dialogue and plot developments that lacked depth and originality. The characters were often reduced to caricatures, their actions driven more by the need to advance the plot than by any genuine development or motivation. This superficial treatment of the characters and storylines resulted in a viewing experience that felt hollow and unsatisfying.Despite these flaws, I was somewhat relieved that the filmmakers chose not to split the movie into two parts. Given the disjointed nature of the narrative, the prospect.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With that said, I enjoyed the show, the actors & their characters, the storyline, and, the little things which helped explain the origins revealed in the first 3 movies (books). It's cool to see the key characters development. Also, how the original H. G. were planned and played, including how the rules developed. I still think it was too long and moved too slowly. I hope they are planning a sequel to flesh out the main characters and their relationships.If you can handle the long running time, you will like the movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

We often place ourselves in the same shoes as the protagonist. We view ourselves as the hero and separate ourselves from the villain.Reading this latest book and watching this movie in my late 20s, I realize how foolish I was when I was younger. While I pretended I was reading dystopian fiction, I've always been living in the Capitol. While I had been connecting myself as a teen most with those in the districts, it is now that I realize I should have been connecting myself more with people like Tigris. The only question is whether we realize this, and whether we have the conviction to empathize and truly bear witness to the stories of Lucy Gray, Sejanus, and Katniss and take principled action rather than passively acknowledging these stories of inequity and abuse while reaping the rewards of corrupt power.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

With the THG series Suzanne Collins has been a miracle worker, creating novels that are arguably among the best adapted books-to-films ever made. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes proves itself to be no exception. The film has managed to flesh out the story to near perfection, singled out the most important events, and it will all resonate with all who are familiar with this series, who knew it by the books or only from the films.PS: The amount of people infuriated by the singing when you went to watch The BALLAD of Songbirds and Snakes ....","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Expecting to win the prestigious Plinth Prize, Snow and his colleagues are told at the last minute that the prize will go to the one who best mentors the competitors (tributes) in the 10th hunger games. Split between strict adherence to the rule of law and some understanding of the rebel's cause, Snow falls for his Tribute, Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). However, continually supported by evil games keeper Gaul (Viola Davis) he keeps his options open when he is sent to district 12 for cheating in the games.There is a decent sense of an epic story here, with Blyth giving a good performance popping between adoration for Lucy Gray and needing to get on up. He does this very well, but the whole thing is still at 157 minutes way too long. There are some good scenes throughout including in the notorious games, but it's mostly a love story littered with political chicanery and betrayal. Much better than I was expecting, but 30 minutes too long.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At least this one wasn't a cliché.It had everything from a good story, a MUCH better cinematography, unexpected turns, and good hooks throughout the movie. It is not the best acting ever, but it is at the very least on par with the other HG movies.I would say that the part that I wasn't too sure about would be the singing, since it makes the movie a bit childish, but it is part of the story.In short, if you liked the other HG movies, but wanted a better story in the same world and ambience, definitely go see this movie.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I deemed it another unneeded cashgrab movie and didn't rush to watch it.The missus chose it for movie night so I prepared for the lackluster, more teen angst and pretty people. Was it everything I feared? Yes and no.Our leads are competent but unengaging, the supporting cast are solid but not strong enough to carry the film, the movie though feeling like a Hunger Games has a very unbalanced tone and an abundance of unlikable characters and suffers from the glaring issue that our hero is the villain in all the other movies so we know the direction this guy is going to go.Hunger Games was already stretched too thin without a non-nonsensical prequel!RantsHow many years off death sports do you think we are? In some form or another I feel they're inevitable. A TV show where people compete for wealth in games where folks may or will be killed (Likely by each other). It's going to happen, but when? Will it be born simply of a shift in society or will it be used in a political purpose format such as overpopulation? Would you watch it? What percentage of the world would protest against it?

It provides so much context for the world of the Hunger Games and more background into the games and who President Snow was.I do want to emphasize that we never see or hear Snows inner monologue, which is crucial to understanding his character throughout the movie. Keep that in mind when watching that he is a horrible person LMFAO. It made the movie even better when I kept that in mind.The ending was also so incredible. Hope you guys like it when you watch!","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The rest with Liongate who consistently take the written word and resist moulding it to their better judgment, chopping and changing what is so loved by its fans.I love this prequel equally to its proceeding trilogy and merely ask for more. More of Lucy Greys adventures, more of Snow and more of the world captured and created in mimic of a fallen Roman Empire.To begin with, the casting could not have been more masterfully crafted, Snow and Lucy were played in such a way that book and screen left no void. The score and musical numbers... yes, musical numbers, were performed effortlessly and seamlessly fell into the woven tapestry of Cornelius Snows story arch.Fantastic! Bravo! A needed watch!","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

"","","Prequel, starts three years before the first Hunger Games.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9692144/?ref_=tt_urv","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","21 March 2024","Even though this is a prequel it is based on a book that was written most recently. It starts ""three years before the first Hunger Games"" and features a young boy named Coriolanus Snow. As we know from watching the Hunger Games movies starting in 2012, this character became the harsh President Snow. It is stated that this story takes place 65 years earlier and Sutherland, who plays the elder President Snow, would have been in his mid-70s when the series of movies started.Most of the story takes place during the 10th Hunger Games, so 13 years after the first scene in the movie, young Snow is now about 18 or 20.The two main characters are played by Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray Baird, who is chosen from District 12 as one of the tributes, to fight to the death in the Games, held in a large enclosed domed arena. Her character is a singer and Zegler, who was so good as Maria in the most recent ""West Side Story"" movie, sings several original songs, done in a ""folk song"" style. It is a nice addition to the movie.The other is British actor Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow. Knowing he is British I tried hard to detect flaws in his American accent but I failed, he does it extremely well. As this story starts he is innocent and optimistic, he is assigned to protect and mentor Lucy Gray, he falls in love with her in the process. However as events and situations develop he begins to make more and more questionable decisions, ends up killing a few others, showing the development of the flawed character that was eventually become President Snow.All in all an interesting and mostly entertaining installment. My wife and I wached it at home on Blu-Ray, the sound and video are superb. The movie is 2 1/2 hours long, the disc has an additional 2 1/2 hours of various ""making of"" features. I watched some, but not all.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
