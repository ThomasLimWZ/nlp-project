So it does not live up to the positive buzz from the early screenings. It's nowhere near being one of the best comic book movies of all time. It's not even in the conversation for being one of the best DC movies. But I did have a lot of fun with it.A lot may depend on your feelings of Ezra Miller. Younger Barry Allen was really annoying, but I think that's the point. I had no issues with them in the role.The stand out for me, was Michael Keaton. When Batman is doing his things and Danny Elfman's iconic score is booming, it's a joy. But make no mistake this is not Batman 3, it's a Flash movie that features Keaton's Batman.Supergirl was good, I enjoyed her, and if she gets a stand alone, I'd watch it. There were some surprises, that I'm amazed have not leaked.It feels it's run time at times and some of the CGI is very dodgy, especially during a certain moment. Considering what they were going for, I can't believe they released it like that. The CGI at that moment is my biggest complaint.They get away with a lot with its rating including nudity and a fair amount of bad language, including the F bomb.I'm not sure if I'll watch it again, but I had a good time, watching this one time.","512 out of 677 found this helpful.

The story is similar, but does change some major parts. The Flash is, for the most part, an enjoyable film with some really good performances, especially Sasha Calle and Michael Keaton. Not a huge fan of Ezra Miller as the flash, but the biggest issue with the film is undoubtedly the CGI. At times the graphics are poor, other times they are horrendous and unnecessary. The film would have been better had they taken a bit more time with the look of the film. Overall, a decent film with some suprising cameos, some really entertaining moments, but looked cheap.","393 out of 560 found this helpful.

One major drawback is that a movie this big has both really good and really bad VFX. Apart from that, this complete fan service aims at not taking the story forward into the DCEU's newly planned future, instead takes Barry Allen on his usual time travel to save his mom and him learning the repercussions of his action, the hard way.This harmless PG-13 movie sticks to the basics and plays safe to the core. Adds a bunch of cameos from DC universe to get us fans riled up. The narrative ranges from meh to ""oh that's fun"" and the director Andy Muschietti hardly fails in hitting the mark. He clearly knows what he intends to do with this script and plays to it's strengths. Ezra Miller indeed is good as The Flash is an added advantage and rest Michael Keaton's return as Batman takes care off.Special mention to all the cameos as they simply were that good. Needless to say, the film is worth watching for them. Sasha Calle's Supergirl has very little to do and she tries to make most of what is offered to her. The visuals during the time travel and the reveal of multiverse was well done. The humor ensures to lighten the tone while keeping the mother-son sentiment intact. Not sure what DCEU's future holds for us fans, The Flash succeeds in entertaining for most of those 2.5hrs.","310 out of 453 found this helpful.

Now with that in mind, I have to say 'The Flash' is about as much as I can enjoy one of these types of movies. This was a very fun ride I'm happy to admit.The movie is basically fan-service on overdrive. Anything a mega-fan has always wanted to see is likely going to show up at some stage in this movie. If that's your kind of thing then you are going to be in heaven.I found the pacing good. The movie is just short of 2 and a half hours but that time goes by pretty quickly. As usual in these types of superhero movies I found the final battle scene the weakest the film had to offer. It got messy and convoluted and it was really the one part of the movie where I lost interest.Of all the superhero movies I've seen this is probably the one least focused on the villain. He really does feel like an after-thought more than anything. The movie is far more about Barry Allen and his mission. Which makes it surprising to me just how much I enjoyed the film, because the one thing I do often get out of these films is enjoyment from the villain.I think people are going to have a good time with this one. It doesn't feel like the usual copy and paste template that the MCU has been throwing out for 15 years now and it is certainly a step up from everything non-Batman that DC has been doing recently. I really enjoyed this. 8/10.","443 out of 683 found this helpful.

Superwoman really worked for me. Michael Keaton was good. Ezra Miller wasn't hyper annoying. I could've done without the updated flash effects and the suit but not too bad. It's funny, fairly interesting and the plot isn't super convoluted or especially ridiculous (for a superhero movie).Saw reviews complaining about inconsistent CGI quality. For most of the movie I couldn't figure out why; clearly an artistic choice. But then Chris Reeve pops up and yeah, that was pretty bad. I think it's the result of applying the stylistic effects they'd been using on the still-alive actors to an already not awesome deepfake but whatever the reason it was jarring and not necessary. There were a lot of nods and Easter eggs they would've been fine skipping.So not perfect but nothing ruined it for me. Batman in the beginning really didn't sound like Affleck to me. They gave their Batman a healthy dose of Christopher Nolan Batman that I could've done without (what possible reason is there for having vents on your breastplate. Do his pectorals generate too much wind resistance when he flexes?)Anyway worth seeing. Stands up well with the other DC movies, such as they are. I really don't see what the problem is if you liked all they other stuff. This is easily better than Aquaman and Justice League and Snyder-bloat Justice League. Yeah Ezra Miller is going through an annoying as all hell/total trainwreck phase lately. But hey, who hasn't sorta kidnapped an Indian and hoarded guns and acted like a total b!#h@$$ after they got arrested for something stupid and avoidable.. yet again, then whined about it/their/thouest pronouns to someone that made the mistake of addressing them with respect? That old chestnut. Just a steaming hot mess of human being but considering all that he's gotta be pretty talented since I was still able to enjoy his character in the movie.I wouldn't be expecting a sequel though. Oh yeah, Michael Shannon was predictably good also, though not utilized all that much.","141 out of 226 found this helpful.

The DC films in the last ten years have been hit or miss though. You could never tell if a film was going to be good or not. Well, hearing everything that could happen in DC's latest release, The Flash, I had to see it for myself. I'm happy to report that after seeing it and sitting on my thoughts for a couple of days, I can confidently say that this is one of DC's better films in the last 5-10 years and the emotional core packs a great punch.Having lost his mom in the past, Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) decides to use his super speed to run back in time to prevent her death and prevent his father from being wrongfully accused of her murder. In doing so, he ends up in another reality where he meets another version of himself, another version of Batman, and another version of an alien from Krypton. Also returning is the villain Zod, from the film Man of Steel. This was a fun ride to take and the action is great, but the storyline involving his mom is what worked the most for me and brought me to tears by the end. If for nothing else, the writers cared very much about the mother-son relationship.Everyone seems to be talking about how awful the CGI is as well, but I personally found certain sequences were meant to feel like an animation instead of looking realistic. Maybe that's just me, but I was able to forgive most of the effects because I felt that way. Still, I do agree some more polishing may have been needed. Still, the CGI did not take me out of the movie as some critics have been stating. In fact, without giving anything away, certain elements needed CGI that could only be done so well in the first place, so I gave them a bit of a pass. The furthest thing to think about when talking about this film is the visual effects though, so let's move on.I must say, yes it was cool to see Michael Keaton with the cape and cowl once again, but with all the cameos sprinkled throughout this film, I am starting to think I'll miss this world a bit as they get moving in another direction with DC. Although funny, this film felt most like Man of Steel in terms of care and effort being put into the story and tone. This film set out to be an emotional story before being a fan service fest, which I appreciated. All the cameos throughout the film just felt like the icing on the cake.The Flash is a film that I pretty much had no expectations for so I am surprised how much I enjoyed it. Ezra Miller carries this film with a very solid performance, Andy Muschietti delivered as director, and Christina Hodson and Joby Harold truly wrote a compelling story arc for Barry Allen. Does the film get a little much by the end and overstay its welcome in terms of bombastic visuals? Maybe, but if I'm going to nitpick that, then I have a lot of things to nitpick as well, but none of them really bothered me. I was here for a good time and I got a little more than just that, which put a big old smile on my face. If you're thinking you're interested at all based on what you've seen so far, I think you'll like this one. I recommend it.","214 out of 341 found this helpful.

I think in this case, it kind of did, and I had fun. There are problems here for sure, and maybe it'll all fall apart in my mind the more I think about it. But I had a pretty good time with this, and while it might not have been as filling or satisfying as a proper piece of cínèmá, I feel like as far as unapologetic crowd-pleasers go, this is one of the better ones.It has fun with a time travel plot, and also dives right into all that multiverse stuff that's all the rage at this point. We may be at a breaking point soon with movies that spiral off into different universes/timelines, in the process bringing back actors to roles they haven't occupied for years or even decades, but I know I still get some enjoyment out of this kind of thing. In a couple of years, who knows - there's a good chance fatigue will set in around this latest trend, but unlike a lot of cinematic trends/sub-genres, this one has at least inspired universally loved movies and even Oscar winners (like Into the Spider-Verse and of course Everything Everywhere All At Once).The Flash is a movie that's desperate for you to like it, and I can see that turning some people off. But others are probably going to like it a lot, and I imagine it'll do well at the box office. As for the future of DC, that's all up in the air, it feels. Anything can happen now, and we'll see whether that's a good thing in time. I'm also interested to see how fans of previous DC movies react to this, given how divided the fanbase is (and how fractured all the different DC universes are, what with the extra worlds of Robert Pattinson's Batman and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker).But The Flash? It's fun. It's entertaining. It panders sometimes. It looks a bit like a video game at points (also plays out like one at times). Its humour generally lands, but not always. I'll probably never watch it again, but I had a good time watching it just this once.","247 out of 418 found this helpful.

The way he strikes a pose before he starts to run is completely ridiculous. They should have made this with Grant Gustin. He is by far the best Barry Allen/ Flash. There's no chemistry between Ezra/Barry and Iris. The whole premise of the movie is an season of The Flash, the TV series, when Barry creates The Flashpoint. No originality whatsoever.

Funny, endearing, finally a DC film with pretty good special effects too and although a bit silly in places it ultimately has got almost everything right.Ezra Miller is quite convincing and it's great to see Michael Keaton back as Batman but almost in a ""Hugh Jackman as Logan"" kind of role.There's quite a lot of this multiverse stuff these days and whilst this will never be as good as the Spiderverse take it's still good and serves very well to underpin the tragic human story element of the film.As good as most of the Marvel stuff and way better than the recent Marvel stuff..Recommended, go see it!","17 out of 23 found this helpful.

After all the silenced controversy of its protagonist, one of the most promising films of the last stage of DC comes to light. The film was quite promising, and on balance... it falls short. Join me to find out why without stripping a single spoiler.Let's start from the essential: the script. The story is basic to be a contemporary superhero movie. It contains humor, which feels excessive in the middle of the film. It has a lot of action, from the very beginning of the footage, which is appreciated. But eventually we get to the topic of fashion. On a personal and subjective note, I'm already sick of the multiverse. At least be original and rename the concept! The next movie that dares to close down and make fun of this concept will have my wholehearted support. Anyway, this applies to using time travel of course, and showing a couple of rather impressive cameos.The direction is quite interesting. It has very daring use of angles and lenses that work very well with the story. The photography is effective and the edition is quite precise. The soundtrack is one of the great elements of the film that knows how to deal with nostalgia, but at times it feels too patchy. The acting is decent, as is the costume design.The controversial element of this film is undoubtedly the visual effects. Surely the effects are present in almost the whole movie and almost half of them are pretty bad. The human figure has no real references neither in movements nor in logical details. I have seen video games from outdated consoles with a better visuals than The Flash.Anyway. The Flash is a basic, action-packed movie that tries to be fun and emotional but fails too much in VFX, an element that its target audience is unforgiving in the year 2023.I end by saying that if Muschietti had come even a little closer to The Flashpoint Paradox, this movie would have been a masterpiece.","253 out of 437 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The Flash is a great superhero film, with great performances and a good Flash story, most importantly a fitting ending to the DCEU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9121185/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2023","The Flash has finally arrived, a film I've been looking forward to since it came to fruition back in 2019 after many years in development of different directors/writers. Flashpoint would be the inspiration behind the film and that got me excited as I love the graphic novel, this isn't a direct adaption, its inspired and has Barry Allen traveling back in time to save his mother as the plot point but after that, everything is different and honestly it works quite well in how you'll be in for a ride that you'll be unprepared for like The Flash in the film. Ezra Miller has been a topic of controversy for two years and I understand why someone would choose not to watch it for him but his performance is great in this and he's better than ever as The Flash. Then came the marketing, making Michael Keaton the main Batman with him reappearing as his character from Tim Burton's two Batman films, Sasha Calle as Supergirl and the first trailer brought back Michael Shannon as General Zod and Antje Traue as Faora-Ul which was the villains for ""Man of Steel"" which was the start of the DCEU, it feels fitting that they're back for the ending (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will be the true conclusion). It also stars Ron Livingston, Maribel Verdú and Kiersey Clemons. With Ben Affleck along with other actors from the DCEU making cameos.Barry Allen uses his super speed to change the past, but his attempt to save his family creates a world without super heroes, forcing him to race for his life in order to save the future.The Flash is directed by Andy Muschietti from a screenplay by Christina Hodson, she wrote Birds of Prey prior to this so she has knowledge of the universe. Henry Braham served as a cinematographer for the film and shot The Suicide Squad prior to this aswell for the last two volumes of Guardians of the Galaxy. Benjamin Wallfisch did the musical score for the film and it's a good soundtrack, music fitting each scene both light hearted and darker, also the more suspenseful scenes. I think it was nicely edited. Andy Muschietti's direction was great, I really liked his vision for the project and how he wanted to make the project his own and fitting to the DCEU. I don't have any criticism towards him, great visual storytelling and it felt like he gave great direction to the actors.The Flash met my expectations, it was a great superhero film which brought plenty of satisfying and joyful moments. I love the characters and DCEU, I think they did a good job at putting an ending to it. With the speed force and time traveling, we got the multiverse in film format (after seeing it in Arrowverse and Titans before), and I don't want to spoil anything but you'll surely find it worth sitting through. The Flash offers a lot of things to like, the visual effects could and should have been better though, the final battle sequence against General Zod deserved ten times better effects and a more detailed location. I also understand why Michael Shannon didn't quite like it in this film just because of how one-dimensional Zod is and how there are almost no deep themes, I wouldn't say there are no themes though as there's one strong theme that's executed perfectly on screen and in writing, the theme of loss. There was emotional depth in the film through the loss of Nora, Barry's mother, it was executed perfectly and performed perfectly by Ezra Miller. The writing offered some great comedy, plenty of laughs from me and the others in the audience on the premiere, Ezra Miller had that comedic timing. Overall, I think the writing was great, much better than her work on Birds of Prey. The dialogue was great and so was the characterization. I really enjoyed the first and second act, they were golden. The third was fine but could have been better. The action sequences were great, all of them! Again, here the visual effects could have been better, but the action sequences were well thought out. It was also nice to see Michael Keaton back as Batman, he was great! I also liked Sasha Calle as Supergirl, good performance. This is a film I'll rewatch, without a doubt. Great superhero film!","331 out of 616 found this helpful.

It perfectly adapts the source material to the current characters of the Snyderverse and bridges the gap between the old and the new DC universe that began with a more colorful and characteer-driven Aquaman and Wonder Woman movies (in spite of the flaws these may have).The screenplay in this movie, that is the story and character arcs, is absolutely gold. It is witty, funny and splendidly well-rounded. All the jokes land perfectly and it is all thanks to the great performance of Ezra Miller, which would be more acclaimed if it weren't for the bad reputation that preceeds him.And perhaps a bit surprisingly, every other character introduced and ""returning"" do a fantastic performance, elevated by their characterization. Audiences should be really satisfied with the directions they took every main character in this film.I don't want to get into spoilers so I will just mention that the costume and set design is incredibly imaginative. The story is inspired by a famous Flash comicbook but it is modified enough to be more relevant to the current iteration of the Flash while maintaining the core messages and themes. And in some aspects, actually improve the story itself. All amounting to a climax where the emotional payoff is earned.It is obvious the care and effort that was put into this movie in almost all aspects except one. One that seems to be the weaker link in all DC movies: the subpar CGI. I don't doubt the talents of the CGI artists at Warner Bros, but there's something happening behind close doors. Either time constraints (which seems unlikely given DC doesn't pump out as much content as Marvel), lack of workforce or simply budget constraints? (again, highly unlikely given the budgets these movies have). It's unfortunate because it is subpar enough to break the illusion (is very noticeable when you see shots of Flash's costume switching from CGI to physical costume on a close-up). But is imaginative enough to be overlooked.And again, the heavy lifting is done by the story and characterisation, which is stellar. Add there the performances and visually stunning action set pieces and you have great entertainment. The relationships between the characters is well defined and come full circle in the end, I applaud the use of every character and their comic book iteration and I thank the good and restraint use of the easter eggs and references which the nature and trailer of this movie clearly disclosed there would be (so that wasn't really a spoiler)All in all, this is a great direction to take DC on and in some ways, this movie feels kind of James Gunn-y: the characters are compelling, some wacky and hilarious, others more subdued but also witty; the relantionships between them are earned and emotionally satisfying and the story is character driven; and things like the editing and music-heavy montage scenes (not saying they are uniquely Gunn, but they reminisce of GUnn). And most importantly: the movie has something compelling to say. Which may sound obvious, but a lot of superhero movies lately have lost track of it. Surely they are visually stunning and action driven, but we can't forget the characters and their flaws and strengths, and exploring both is always a great idea!

Dealing with love and loss ... and time travel (you know, the important stuff). But the script and execution seemed a bit, dare I say it rushed.If I were to wax lyrical, which I will, might I say that there's one key lesson to be learned from the theme of this movie that perhaps wasn't followed by its makers?It's no spoiler to note that the idea of going back in time to adjust the past and thereby repair the present is a sweet temptation. But when we remove that limitation of linear time, binding us to our past mistakes, trouble seems to stem out in all directions. OK, so my analogy is that by relying heavily on CGI to theoretically create anything that one's imagination can conceive, the temptation is to consciously turn everything up to 10 (or 11 if you're in Spinal Tap) and conjure up endlessly amazing experiences. But we're linear beings, for the most part. We need common reference points to know where and who we are. Otherwise, we go off the rails.That's what I felt was absent from the The Flash movie. Too much of what could be but not enough of what is. We're left disoriented and, ultimately, a bit disengaged.If I were to go back in time and change something I would have spent more time focusing on the drama of having two Barrys in existence - excellent FX work and acting here. But that'd mean less time for Batman (good stuff) ... and Supergirl (more good acting) and less of the smaller character parts (funny performances, all). OK. Let me readjust.

I'm convinced WB conjured up a crucial plan to recover this film and the overall stigma behind it with one main aspect. MORE Batman. Not just Batman but Michael Keaton's adorned classic version. While he was already going to be a part of the film before in some amount, I truly believe that the re-shoots and rewrites amped his involvement in the overall stakes and story much more. Well it clearly worked and the hype surrounding the film has been completely due to Keaton's Bat. That's not to say the story and other aspects even including Miller aren't solid as well.I was lucky to see the advance screening a few weeks back and it was an experience to remember. This is easily the highlight entry in the DCEU. It soars in visuals, emotional depth, and nostalgia tenfold. This may be a Flash film but Michael Keaton steals the show returning to his classic iteration of the Bat. It's like he never took a 30 year hiatus. The guy is just so iconic it's unbelievable . The way he is incorporated is perfect for the plotting and the stakes. Miller himself is also very captivating in the film as well as Affleck. Michael Shannon once again gives a great dark horse role as well. The casting of supergirl though I cannot say was a great decision. She is without a doubt the weakest link imo.The visual spectacle is without a doubt the reason to watch this and no matter how heavily cgi laden it can be, it manages to usually look crisp and colorful. To see Keaton in his signature batwing moving around in an updated time is something to behold. It's crazy to see something that couldn't have been dreamed of in 89/92.Overall it's awesome to finally get this film and to see so many exciting aspects come together to create the long awaited standalone flash film. Even though you have to wonder without Keaton back how intrigued people would be...","162 out of 316 found this helpful.

This film seems like it was targeting a teenybopper demographic that enjoys this type of nonsense.It was all middle-school humor, tacky special effects, silly plot twists that spent all its time racing from one poorly-thought out story element to another, from one only modestly satisfying nostalgia shout-out to another, yet ends up as rewinds of movies you've already seen, but with appalling VFX and a messy story that even the amazing Michael Keaton couldn't save. It was repetitive and underwhelming, and full of narrative inconsistencies and unjustifiable leaps of characters' logic.The multiverse's bottomless stockpile of do-overs and variant replacement characters was already getting on my nerves in the Marvel films, and this DC film suffers from the same bad case of multiverse overkill, instead of telling an original or thrilling story. The stormy seas of production hell are clearly evident as this blur of nonsense runs out of steam as it drags to the nearly two-and-a-half hour mark, that the end result barely feels like a final draft. It's easily the weakest of the recent movies about multiple universes. It's a generous 6/10 all for Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle's screen time and outstanding performances.","48 out of 86 found this helpful.

Directed by Andy Muschietti, this film aims to satisfy fans' hunger for thrilling superhero action. However, while it boasts moments of entertainment and pays homage to the source material, ""The Flash"" falls short of reaching its full potential!Acting and Characters:
Ezra Miller, who previously portrayed the Flash in the Zack Snyder Justice League, returns as the Scarlet Speedster. While Miller's acting talent is undeniable, his portrayal in this film is somewhat disconnected. The character feels awkward and lacks the gravitas expected of a lead role. This sentiment is reminiscent of the humour found in Joss Whedon's ""Justice League"" reshoots. In contrast, Grant Gustin's portrayal of the Flash in the TV series demonstrates a more mature, relatable, and charismatic hero, which resonates better with the audience.The chemistry between Barry Allen (Flash) and Iris West, portrayed by Kiersey Clemons, feels somewhat forced, lacking the depth and connection needed to fully engage viewers. This creates a sense of strangeness, leaving much to be desired in terms of character development and emotional resonance.Visual Effects and Cinematography:
While the CGI in ""The Flash"" is not without its flaws, it manages to achieve a decent level of quality overall. Some sequences impress with their attention to detail, while others appear lacking or even cheap. Ultimately, the visual effects fall somewhere in the middle, earning an average score of 5 out of 10 for my taste. It's worth noting, however, that the film's aesthetics, including colour grading and environmental design, bear a resemblance to Joss Whedon's take on the DCEU, rather than the visually striking world of Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel.""Plot and Storytelling:
The script's originality is uncertain, given the significant departure from Zack Snyder's vision for the DC Extended Universe. ""The Flash"" attempts to deliver a captivating storyline that can stand on its own, but it struggles to live up to the high expectations set by Snyder's treatment of the character. While the film offers moments of entertainment and serves as a gateway to the multiverse, it fails to provide the same edge-of-your-seat excitement witnessed in the Flash's pivotal time-reversal scene in ""Zack Snyder's Justice League.""Character Cameos and Tributes:
Regrettably, the inclusion of cameos and nods to other characters within the DC universe leaves much to be desired. Though ""The Flash"" attempts to widen its scope by referencing characters from various storylines, it falls short of delivering a satisfying number of fan-pleasing appearances. While ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" successfully brings back two heroes from its previous instalments, ""The Flash"" could have benefitted from a more expansive and impactful roster of cameos.Verdict:
""The Flash"" is an ambitious superhero film that, unfortunately, fails to fully meet the expectations of fans, particularly those who hold the character dear. While the movie offers moments of entertainment and serves as a gateway into a multiverse of possibilities, it struggles to deliver a compelling and cohesive narrative. If approached with zero expectations, ""The Flash"" can provide a passable way to spend 2 hours and 24 minutes. However, for those seeking a cinematic experience that meets the high bar set by previous superhero films, it may not satisfy their demands.Conclusion:
""The Flash"" leaves much to be desired, falling short of its potential despite the best efforts of its cast and crew. While the film offers some enjoyable moments, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive narrative and strong character connections. Nonetheless, the desire for more stories involving the Flash remains, and it is hoped that future adaptations will address the shortcomings and provide a more satisfying exploration of this beloved superhero.","21 out of 38 found this helpful.

Especially the last cameo is so awesome.Its not like other DC super hero movies, it took lot of fun and entertainment than stick to story and beating the villain. Put behind all the DC heroes images and just enjoy the popcorn entertainer.I am not much aware of DC/Marvel comics, just known these guys from movies only. This is definitely be the nice watch for the weekend, if you set your expectations right. Give a try.","21 out of 38 found this helpful.

Some of these visual effects are absolutely abysmal, potentially the worst I've seen in a movie of this scale. It's honestly on the level of 'Son Of The Mask (2005)' or 'The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl 3-D (2005)' at times. Truly, truly terrible stuff. There are some sequences that are more convincing than others, but too many of them are legitimate eye sores. That's not a dig at the visual effects artists, by the way, who were all very likely doing their best with the time they were given and were also very likely underpaid for their work. It's more of a dig at the studio and its odd decision not to grant the VFX houses more time despite the fact that production on this film spanned the entire nine seasons of CW's 'The Flash (2014 - 2023)'.After a bafflingly bad opening movement, the movie does admittedly settle into its own somewhat entertaining rhythm. The second act of 'The Flash (2023)' is surprisingly successful. It isn't great, of course, but it's relatively pacy and features a handful of enjoyable action scenes. The two cameos that are spoilt in the marketing work fairly well, with a certain someone proving he's still got it even after all these years (though the actor in question has been doing good work for his entire career). Ezra Miller turns in far better work then when they played that wizard with the rubbish hair cut, somehow making Barry more irritating than before but also imbuing him with a new semblance of responsibility that ties in nicely to the story's fairy potent emotional underpinning. However, their efforts aren't quite enough to make you forget all the awful things they've done in real life (nothing would be), so there is a strange sort of second-hand guilt that arises from watching them on screen.Where the picture starts to falter once again is in its final third, which starts out modestly enough but eventually escalates into all-out insanity and begins to awkwardly explore the morally iffy side of its multiversal premise. Again, the ugly visuals rear their even uglier heads here and the very fabric of the film itself starts to (admittedly somewhat appropriately) unravel. The frustrating finale reminds you that the movie has been about IP all along, not genuine storytelling, and that any success its second act may have is either accidental or a result of it being the segment that the DC suits meddled with the least during production. Ultimately, the affair's potential is all but entirely stifled by studio-mandated audience pandering and a callously dismissive approach to the importance of a well-considered narrative.Again, some of the picture really isn't all that bad. In fact, it's actually pretty good; I honestly can't say that I didn't enjoy parts of the middle portion. However, it's bookended by some really poor storytelling and contains more than one laughably bad set-piece. The visual effects are sometimes so poor they look like they've been rendered for a cheap PlayStation 3 game. The movie just feels fairly soulless, too.If you want to see a far, far better adaptation of the Flashpoint storyline, just watch 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013)' instead.","289 out of 469 found this helpful.

I promise. The story is actually a surprisingly decent retelling of the famous Flashpoint storyline. Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle both deliver solid performances and Calle especially surprised me with how likable she made her Supergirl. Unfortunately, this isn't a movie just about elderly Batman and Supergirl, it also includes the title character: Barry Allen, aka The Flash.Ezra Miller was a poor choice for Barry Allen even before the controversy. The actor doesn't really mesh with the role, whether it be in comparison the Barry from the comics or Grant Gustin's interpretation on the CW show. And Miller's awkward style only became more unpopular after videos of abuse towards fans and accusations of disgusting crimes came forward. So, the fact there's two separate versions of Ezra in the lead roles of the movie might be too much to handle.On top of Miller's mistakes, Flash's troubled production hurts it. After so many reshoots and revisions under so many creative heads, the final product feels a little disjointed, not to mention unfinished(especially the visuals in the first half). The fan service at the end of the movie also fails to land.However despite all this, I still enjoyed The Flash. With more polish it could've been really good. Plus, the CGI reached ""fun bad"" levels a lot of the time and watching it with friends made it enjoyable to make fun. And at the very least, Michael Keaton gets to fight Kryptonians. That's a decent draw on its own. Come for Keaton, stay for some decent moments, tolerate Miller's acting, and you can have fun with this film.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Miller's performance in Justice League didn't really capture me but in the Flash, Miller is excellent, playing two versions of Barry Allen. Even though the film is very ambitious for the first film outing of the Flash, it touches upon the Flash's origin story in a meaningful way while also showing a more experienced Barry Allen that is no longer just the comedic relief.The film's strongest aspects are its emotion scenes. Maribel Verdu's Nora Allen (Barry's mom) isn't in the film much but she is so delightful that the audience can't help but empathize with Barry Allen on his quest to save his mother.The portrayal of Barry's speed was refreshing as the world around him warps and bends. Unfortunately, there were a few glaringly bad sequences in the film with awful cgi that WB didn't fix, likely since the film was first screened for early audiences.Personally, I wasn't impressed with Keaton's Batman in his prior films but he was great in this one. Andy Muschietti's directing brought out a great performance from Keaton paired with spectacular action scenes. Speaking of Batman, Ben Affleck was excellent as an experienced Batman this time around. This truly felt like the first time the DCEU was connected. The scenes with returning DCEU cast members felt like I was watching an episode of Bruce Timm's Justice League cartoon. Sasha Calle's Supergirl was really entertaining as she brought a more serious edge to Supergirl that I didn't expect. Unfortunately, she was a bit underutilized but I'd be happy to see her in a future movie down the line.Besides the uneven CGI, the film's ending felt like it undid some of the character development. I'm trying not to spoil it but let's just say that the film is all about learning a certain lesson not to do something and then at the end of the film, that happened anyway, albeit to a lesser extent.Overall, it's a miracle that this film turned out as good as it did. This is truly a great comic book film experience that will please fans.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

Using as a sturdy framework Geoff Johns' Flashpoint Paradox storyline (already adapted into an animated feature a decade ago) has our speedy hero, Ezra Miller, going back in time to save his mother, Mirabel Verdu, from being murdered & his dad, Ron Livingston (subbing for Billy Crudup) being blamed for it but by doing so he inadvertently causes a paradox where General Zod, Oscar nominee Michael Shannon, is about to dominate the Earth & the defacto members of the Justice League don't exist yet w/Michael Keaton's Batman appearing to right the wrongs (even though at this stage of the game he's retired from crime-fighting) & Supergirl, Sasha Calle, not Superman has landed not in Smallville but in the Iron Curtain where she's being kept from sunlight to quell her powers. Knowing he must do something, Miller along his doppelganger from his arrived timeline, band together to fight the good fight, no matter the cost. Already on its way out of theaters (a shame!), the rumors & rationales on why it failed (audiences are fed up w/DC's waffling since a new reboot is underway, superhero fatigue, unsubstantiated hype, Miller's offset shenanigans?) sunk this one before it even got its sea legs (which I presume will find an audience once it hits streamers) may go down as the biggest 'f'up from a major Hollywood studio in quite some time which is a shame since it is undeniably fun, moves like a coked up hummingbird & has charm for days but since we don't march people into theaters at gunpoint (yet!) this will be forever known as awkward bookmark in the continually re-written book of DC.","40 out of 81 found this helpful.

The 'member berries are what made this movie. Had it not been the nostalgic cameos, this movie would have sucked.Having said that, Michael Keaton and Supergirl stole the show (in my opinion). I would watch any DC movie if it had them in. I really hope these comic book movies can figure out the cgi issue. It's been abysmal as of late.

The energy that this movie brings is quite impeccable, and for a good reason, because it's a goddamn movie about Ezra Miller turning back the clock. No doubt, the movie may face backlash because of that name, but Ezra is ridiculously great as Barry Allen/The Flash. The emotional core and comedic wit that he brings to each character is subtle but incredibly effective, immersing the audience in the story. Another highlight is none other than Michael Keaton. Seeing him as Batman once again brought back my childhood nostalgia. He still has it, and he truly owns that character. Ben Affleck and Sasha Calle were both good in their own right, as they brought something different to the film.Obviously, The Flash isn't without its flaws, and because my conscience is always clear, I don't have any problems highlighting some of the issues. General Zod was extremely wasted in the film. While it's understandable that the multiverse is an ongoing concept and his actions may have ongoing implications, there was still room to focus a bit more on his character so that he doesn't come across as a one-dimensional villain. The CGI throughout the film is generally good, but there are some faults, especially when it comes to the scenes involving two Barry Allens. It's hard to ignore the moments when it's clearly Ezra playing the character versus when it's a deepfake on a double. Despite the flaws, they only have a slight impact on the overall enjoyment of the film. That being said, The Flash is a great love letter to the comic book world, filled with cool Easter eggs and references.","71 out of 154 found this helpful.

On top of that, they played very nicely with color, lighting and camera angles to give us some really nice shots and also one of my favorite aspect of the movie: Slo-mo shots. They make so much fun and in combination with the extraordinary sound design it is just amazing.The VFX are pretty decent most of the time but definitely not always. The few cameos we've got were also a nice little touch but nothing special.At some point the movie is a little bit confusing and you need some time to process and think about it especially after the ending. This could be a positive point for some and for the others not, that depends on what of a person you are.Some might say that this movie is a copy of Marvel and just because Marvel introduced the Multiverse, DC also needs to do it. I really don't know if that's true so I would be sceptical and cautious about these hypotheses. Of course it seems like this is the case but we will probably never know.In conclusion I would say this movie is definitely worth watching in cinemas.","33 out of 79 found this helpful.

The movie has some really good moments that stick out, but the story as a whole fell flat. Barry making dumb decision after dumb decision is basically the premise of the whole film. A lot of the ""emotional"" moments felt forced, which may have been largely due to Ezra Miller's acting. Michael Keaton's performance was the highlight of the movie, and, without him, I don't think this movie would've been worth the watch. The movie tried very hard to be goofy, and it did succeed at that; however, it almost succeeded too much at that. I will say that it does provide a great deal of fan service for DC Comics fans. Worth one watch for sure, but not much after that.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

I'm a middle aged woman (not necessarily wiser (lol) but from the Christopher Reeves superman in late 1970s to to present day Marvel cinematic universes I've seen them all.So fast forward to this flash film 2023 and I can't help the bad reviews are mostly based upon some yes very dodgy CGI and Ezra's very chaotic personal life.Initially I thought he was the wrong choice for Barry Allen, probably because loved the TV series so much and thought lookwise just couldn't see him as the flash but, the flim changed that for me.When I tell you I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had everything I wanted, humour, some sensitivity, some good action scenes and wow the famous cameos I'm living for. Was the CGI bad in parts, absolutely, probably the worst I have seen in a movie actually I don't understand how a movie costing that much couldn't have spent more money on making it look good, it was like it was coming out of the 70s at times.But that aside, honestly I don't know what more people wanted. At over 2 hours I sat entertained throughout. I really didn't want it to end.DC movies for me have for a long time lost it's way but for me this made me think there is hope.So it's a solid 8/10...the CGI let it down but honestly I could have given it a 9. I would even watch it again.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

Some have been overcome and others have not. That doesn't make it a bad movie at all. It is not his fault that he cannot satisfy every longing of the viewers. So it's a good movie and that's all. A comic story, moments of impressive action, emotion that silences the room, madness of the good, nostalgia that moistens the eyes and an ending with a farewell flavor.

No I still think it's the Zack Snyder's Justice League. I went in with an open mind considering all the Ezra Miller troubles. But really only saw it to see Michael Keaton as the Batman again. Most of the people I know that are seeing The Flash are because of Michael Keaton. But back to the movie. It started real good. Had some laughs, some good action. Unlike other people, I didn't think the cgi was bad. Somewhere in the middle i started losing interest. The scenes with the room mates, that could have been left out. Then the ending just didn't do it for me. I'm sure the writers went through several versions of the story to get the final one. But dang it could have been better (without getting into spoilers by original Barry keeping his powers). The younger Barry was fun for a bit, then became annoying. Sasha Calle as Supergirl? I liked her. Suprised me, but I would see her again if she got the chance. Miller did fine playing his roles.The scenes going back into time were pretty bad not necessary the cgi, but the execution. I didn't care for how they did it. The time travel multi universes stories are getting tiring. The cameos towards the end were fun and i did like the effort they put into it. I give that a 10 out of 10. It was great seeing some of the great hero's and what could have been. But overall, the story was ok. Would i see it again? I'm sure when its streaming. It had some good laughs, but another missed opportunity by DC. But it was sure great to see Michael Keaton as the Batman again.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

First of all, it was very impressive technically. The way they were able to make the two Flashes interact was amazing. And the story was involving and well done-- although I feel like they lost the tension a bit during the ending. It was a little confusing and drawn out too much with going back in time several times, etc., etc..The heart of the movie is Michael Keaton. He is fantastic. The movie is worth it just for bringing him back to the screen as Batman. His acting is phenomenal. I don't know why, but his phrasing, his pauses, his facial expressions-- there was not a false note anywhere in his performance.It moved me far more deeply than a comic book character should. And since then, I've been trying to figure out exactly WHY it was so moving, and I think I finally figured it out. I'm 65 now and feeling my own mortality. And to see Keaton (I don't know how old he is but I'm sure he's as old or older than I am) do this role as well as he did with all its physicality, is truly inspiring. It gives hope to all us old farts. Hey, I'm not dead yet!But it goes beyond that. I think all of us-- all men, anyway-- are still young boys inside, to some extent, and secretly we like to imagine ourselves as Batman. But I can't really imagine myself as Christian Bale, or Val Kilmer, or George Clooney as Batman. I can, however, imagine myself as Michael Keaton as Batman. I think it's because Keaton seems like ""just an ordinary guy."" He's an Everyman and kind of an underdog, whereas the other actors were always somewhat bigger than life before they put on the mask. Keaton makes the Batman character US. Which is why I think he's the best Batman and always will be.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

And yet this was entertaining. It was a decent, without going too far into decency, with some nice action and a reasonable (by superhero standards) story.Remember, this is not only a multiverse story, but a time travel story as well. None of these ever come close to making sense and are more often attempts to reset a franchise. And this does it too, spectacularly so. But at the same time, it was fun.It all started with an attempt to adapt Flashpoint, which is complicated as adaption go, because it has so many characters and epic changes to the world. So they did what they did in the series and trimmed it down. So far so good, but it kind of makes you think why watch movies at all if the comics are so much broader? The idea of the multiverse, but this time, has already gone stale, but the movie had started it was hard to stop. Therefore join Barry Allen in an alternate dimension from where he is bound to come back from, so there will be no consequences, right?Enter the reset. Several actors have to go. Somehow both Henry Cavil and Ben Affleck got the boot, even if beloved by fans. What do they have in common? They are both loyal to the source material and adamant about it. Message to all actors: do not shake the boat, do not try to control the narrative, no matter how good or safe you feel about yourself, you must never change the story, or else... you will not be considered a team player. I guess that extends to directors, as most movie ideas fronted by people passionate about the material are not accepted, even when bringing lots of money would they be made.I thought Ezra was fine as the Flash, I liked how they introduced Kara Zor-El and Keaton's Batman. Michael Shannon got some extra Zod time. The action was good, although the logistics of it were ridiculous - then again, aren't they all? It was fun to see Nicholas Cage's Superman, fighting a giant spider! And a lot of other timeline heroes from the past, too.What I didn't like: the CGI was terrible, especially when showing people, worse than 2010 games animatics. Ron Livingston being reduced to the ""dad in prison"" role. I mean, it's a paycheck, but come on! I disliked the Iris character AND the actress. It helps amongst all the characters and cameos to remember this is a one character arc story, with everybody else just extras.Bottom line: for the expectations I had, this film was great! There were no major issues with it, only small ones. It was both light-hearted and dark where it mattered, thus breaking the mold of the dreary DC films from before or the artificially comical Marvel ones. I kind of hate the politics of it, but that's Hollywood today. We should only focus on the movies.","23 out of 47 found this helpful.

I'm pretty sure it's not one of the best superhero movies ever, it's the worst cgi superhero movie of 20's.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

At some points CGI is awful, looks like from a 2013 game and I don't understand why - what the hell happened? However, if you prepare yourself that CGI is bad, you can go through the movie without disappointment.2. Ezra Miller as two versions of Barry works amazingly in all dimensions. The technical aspect of creating dialogue scenes is great, I didn't feel any disconnection when two Barries were talking and standing together. Well done.3. The best action scenes are these with Michael Keaton. His Batman is stunning, how he moves and behaves is pure enjoyment. They actually made him interesting, satisfying and worthy to watch. It's not cringy or whatsoever.4. Supergirl is alright - she is neither bad nor good. I wish there was more space for her. She doesn't have any kind of pay-off, she is there to make the universe more pleasuring in way of multiverse stuff.5. I like the humor, the jokes weren't forced or oversaturated like in MCU.6. The story itself is decent. We can clearly understand the motives behind Barry's activity. The story is emotional and I can feel what the character is feeling. The structure is different because it reminds me Top Gun: Maverick - there is no big villain but a mission what Barry needs to accomplish. It's a crazy journey full of heart what lets the Flash grow as a human being. I wasn't having any major problem following the story, I just feel there is a room to improve.(After watching Across the Spider-Verse, I can notice Miles and Barry have something in common so I'm guessing the ending of Beyond the Spider-Verse might be very similar.)7. There is one post-credit scene (at the very end) - don't watch it because it's a stupid joke. It doesn't tease anything honestly.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

The cheap CGI, the plodding scenes, the cast member who is more notorious for arrests than for skill.And we have no relief from this, for while the creative team was given carte blanche on cameos, we get only the one Flash--when we should have had a significant beat to thank those that carried the franchise for so many years with fans.Meanwhile, most fans undoubtedly went for Batman. Keaton rocks it. And we get two other live Batmen, with the final one perhaps the ""reset"" to the franchise we've been promised?An older actor now, but certainly popular and suave. Plus, he's had the suit on before. (Sorry, not giving spoilers, though I'm pretty sure people know which three live Batmen returned to help out.)A slight distasteful moment as we even were given two Batmen from beyond the grave.But, honestly again, why is the best thing about a Flash movie, Batman? And was that where the huge budget of this film went? Because otherwise, it felt very CWDC. (Or worse, made me long for Grant's Flash--the superior brand.)","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

The movie was Soo funny and even emotional!! It truly lived up to the praise it got by people like Tom Cruise!!In part due to the outstanding double performance of a lifetime by Ezra Miller, this film took to great emotional and humourous heights!!! He truly filled his role with all the perfect witty humor and so much heart and seriousness!!! The lightning injected action was Soo cool at times! And the Batmans especially Ben Affleck and Micheal Keaton near equally complimented him in making his first film a truly resounding and profound one!! Barry Allen's pain for his mother could be felt and the plot was very well built involving genius and overwhelming use of time travel that really built for shock value and connected the overall plot very well!!!Andres Muchietti really grew out of his IT fame to deliver an outstanding spectacle that was truly the MOVIE EVENT it was hailed to be!!! And the DC cameos were just blissful, pure fanservice to the history of DC in Film!! Despite all the troubles and deplorable decisions of Warner Bros. To Superman and Henry Cavill, This film came out as truly special and very pleasing!!!The Flash was truly a must see thrill ride for DC!!!","23 out of 48 found this helpful.

There's not much more to say. Because it wasn't the best i felt like the characters were shallow and almost undeveloped.I laughed a couple times throughout the movie but not a lot. There's really not much more to say except nicolas change as super man? I dont know what was going on there.There was super girl in it to but she wasn't a great either. I feel like she was just there and didn't do anything else.I really liked the newest batman and some other DC movies but this felt like i could compare it to captain marvel.

The factors that hurt it the most are the extremely poor computer generated images (CGI) and downright awful special effects as well as a genuinely unlikable lead character. We all know about Ezra Miller's offset insanity and criminal behavior but in front of the camera his Barry Allen is as agitating and annoying as any character in recent memory. Surprisingly, the Supergirl character wasn't bad. What was good was Keaton's Batman and unfortunately he wasn't suited up very long in the film itself.

While the film has its flaws, in the end it tells a human story filled with fun action set pieces, and humor. Characters have motivation, story mostly makes sense, and was nice to not have any hidden agenda. The humor mostly worked for me and doesn't fall much into bathos (think Marvel humor) but gets corny at times.Acting - Ezra Miller playing two characters, and exhibiting a range of emotions called for, he does surprisingly well. Sasha Calle was really good and hooe to see her do this character again. Michael Keaton steals every scene he is in and it doesn't feel like it's been 30 years since he donned the cape and cowl.Supporting characters are fine. Zod could have been any villain and isn't given much, but Michael Shannon does great with what he's given.CGI is hit or miss, but mostly a hit. No spoiler, but if you remember the dancing baby desktop animation from the late 90s, prepare for that to be a meme in reference to a scene from this film. That was a laugh out loud moment.The story mostly works and don't have any real complaints except it felt too long. Trimming 15-20 minutes out would take this up a star.The screening was full (of course it was, it was free) and a cross section of fans and casual viewers, I'm sure by design. The reaction during and after the film was very enthusiastic.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

What universe am in that this film is getting 8s 9s and 10s from audience members?The Flash is pure fan service for the sake of fan service, and it's not even good fan service. All of it just serves as a distraction, and poor excuse for terrible writing, terrible storytelling, and atrocious pacing.When this movie starts, you better brace yourself because it doesn't stop! Maybe this is intentional? Maybe it's supposed to be fast and chaotic as to give audience members a feel for Barry's life. But that can't be because any sane person can see that is the poorest form of storytelling. This film jumps from scene to scene with no cohesive thought or balance. They took a collection of scenes and let a monkey edit everything together.The only time, the only time this movie actually stopped, and showed some sense was in its conclusion. Barry finally stopping and seeing the chaos and destruction he had caused in the multiverse, but because everything beforehand was set up so poorly that it just didn't matter anymore. Then that ending just threw whatever good was in that sequence away in the dumpster.Now, NOT everything here is bad. The best this film has going for it are the performances. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman was great. I was very happy to see him one last time as the caped crusader. Michael Keaton's return was also great, though the explanation of why he was the way he was during his introduction was so weak. Ezra Miller (despite the trash human being, he may be) still does a great job as the Flash/Barry Allen. Michael Shannon's return of General Zod while great was just why? He was absolutely inconsequential in this film. Literally, any villain could've been in Zod's place. But I suppose it could be perceived that the real villain of this film was Barry himself, I guess. Lastly Sasha Calle, I enjoyed her immensely in her small role as Supergirl/Kara I don't know if they have decided to have a Supergirl in the future of the DCEU, but I will be more than ok to see her reprise this role. Also, all the good moments this film had were in the trailers.There are other issues I have with this film, such as the CGI. While it wasn't poor, I hated the style. It looked so fake and cartoony it just clashed with everything else in the film. During the opening sequence at the hospital the babies literally looked like dolls. It was hideous it bordered on uncanny valley levels of bad. My friend laughed at it continuously, and I'm pretty sure that sequence wasn't meant to be funny, or at least if it was, I didn't find it funny. Which will lead me into another issue, comedy. Nothing was funny here. All the jokes were so poor and ill placed. I couldn't tell when the movie was serious or if it was supposed to be joking. The audience I was with barely laughed either.Then there's the run time. I felt the entire 2 hours and 24 minutes, and for a movie that was so fast-paced, it was incredibly slow. In the middle of the movie, I looked at my phone to see only 1 hour passed. I couldn't believe I had another hour and 20 minutes to go.Uh, what else... there's a post credit-scene that's used for comedic purposes but was unfunny and a waste of time to sit and wait for.Overall I can't recommend watching this atrocious poor excuse of a DC film but if you like fan service for nothing more for the sake of well fan service and can turn your brain off to literally everything else then I'm sure you can have a good time.I don't know how my fellow audience members felt about this movie but I'm almost 100% sure I heard one individual say ""this sucked"" as he walked out so maybe I'm not alone just in a vast minority.IMDb: 3/10

And in this latest movie, he runs circles around the plot too! But don't worry, we need a Zack Snyder cut to fill in those plot holes. Despite that, it's still a fun ride. The action scenes are electrifying, the humor is on point, and the new characters add a spark of freshness to the franchise. Plus, who doesn't love a good time-traveling adventure? Just make sure you don't blink or you might miss some of the plot holes.

Ezra Miller makes a good fist of something Tom Hardy has made his own - playing off convincingly against another version of himself.

Good?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9123589/?ref_=tt_urv","markxddotmp4","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59881274/?ref_=tt_urv","16 June 2023","Everyone and their grandma already knows about this movie's troubled production, mainly focused on a certain actor's criminal affairs (not naming any names). This halting the release and had people wondering if this would even release at all or just be one of DC's abandoned projects. But through many hurdles, the movie is finally out and all I can say is that it's good... for the most part.To get this out of the way, Ezra Miller is a horrible person and I obviously don't condone his actions or behavior. I wouldn't even object to Warner Bros. Just cutting their loses and shelving this completely, almost like a certain other project (not naming names). But to stick with it even despite the controversy so quite admirable. This was made before the allegations surrounding Miller, so I can't exactly fault the production before it was public knowledge. Luckily the movie was enjoyable enough for me to believe who I was watching was Barry and not Ezra.The story itself is pretty basic when it comes to time travel movies, which isn't all that impressive in the superhero genre, but I can say that I enjoyed the movies ideas of using the multiverse and exploring it through the concept of time travel. For the most part, the movie doesn't completely fail like most blockbusters which try using time travel and eventually break the rules they themselves set up. Except for one end gag that certainly raises a plot hole, but I digress. For the most part, they use the time travel/multiverse gimmick to tell a more personal story of Barry wanting to save his love ones. Not wholly original might I add, even the Butterfly Effect does it better, but within the superhero context, it certainly was an attempt I can applaud. Especially for having some genuinely sad moments here and there. I just wish the movie focused more on that aspect than having to have ""epic battle"" with faceless henchmen and super villain. It would have made the story a lot more memorable for me if it Soley focus on Barry's dilemma regarding his past.Next is the visuals, whoo boy... were they pretty rough for this movie. I seriously was wondering if I was watching a movie or if this was a presentation for Injustice 3. Especially towards the beginning, it was pretty hard to not notice some of the animation, even Barry himself looking like a video game character. Now, not all of the CGI is in this rough state and has a couple of moments where it actually counted, but these moments are very few and far between really awkward looking animation. But, since the movie doesn't take itself that seriously, wonky CGI helped the humor land a lot better then it could have on its own.Finally, I wanna get into the acting of the movie. First off, Micheal Keaton as Batman stole the show for most of it. Despite having not as much screen time as our main lead, he has may more presence then most of the other actors. This sadly goes for Sasha Calle as Supergirl. She doesn't have a whole lot to do in this movie, which is a shame with the marketing hyping her up and had me excited to see her with Keaton's Batman. I guess you need something to distract from having a real villain in your cast. Speaking of which, Ezra was actually fine in the movie. The premise of paring him with a younger more annoying version of his character weirdly worked for me. Don't get me wrong, the movie really hammers it home about his obnoxious personality and it can get grading at points. But having his foil be a older Barry that's self-aware of his stupidity made the dynamic a little more bearable and had some pretty good jokes. Don't know if it made me forget about his crimes after the movie though.Anyways, The Flash could have been a disaster and through all the odds, all the allegations, and all the negative publicity around it, it somehow wasn't a dumpster fire. Was it the best superhero movie ever made? Nope, that belongs to Spiderverse. Is it the best movie DC has ever put out? No, Dark Knight still holds that one. Was it an enjoyable movie you could probably have a few laughs at and have a good time? Maybe? I don't know, I'm tired.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

It's fun and awesome, filled with so many cool scenes and connections. It feels like a DC fan thinking of all the craziest ideas they would want to see. The well-placed comedic moments all work. It's highly entertaining.I watched The Snyder Cut again before this movie, now knowing the plans to reboot with James Gunn. I don't understand why they would make this decision. They have built something special and there is so much more they can do with it.And this is coming from someone who has been repeatedly underwhelmed with most of the recent DCEU movies. I don't mind hiring James Gunn to run things, he's proven himself multiple times over. But why in the world would you start from scratch? How have we not seen a Ben Affleck Batman movie? He IS Bruce Wayne. Why would you not keep Henry Cavill when he wants to stay? It's baffling.I guess there's no point dwelling on what's out of my control. But if there is any possibility to make them continue rather than start from scratch, I think it would make a lot of people so happy.My personal list of DCEU movies I will continue to rewatch: Man of Steel, BvS Ultimate Cut, Wonder Woman, Zack Snyder's Justice League, and The Flash. Now that's a damn good pentalogy.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 6/15/2023)","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

It is awful. It looks as if several effects houses worked on several different scenes, each using different software or methodology. It is SO jarringly bad. Remember the awful Cavill mustache removal debacle? Or the Tron 2 Jeff Bridges deaging fiasco? That was nothing compared to this. Its as if they inserted the unfinished workprint, or substituting the storyboards for dailies. The acting and storyline is fine. The CGI is atrocious. If this was a 10 million dollar movie then okay. But this is a CGI effects driven movie. Instead of having Ezra act both Barry parts they periodically did that about 20 percent and it was completely believable. But The other 80 percent is bad bad bad. I mean fans were miffed when mustachegate occurred. To paraphrase the Joker, ""if they think that is terrible, wait""'ll they get a load of this."" The chronobowl scenes were the absolute worst. Did they not learn from Snyder Cut Justice League? Fans will wait And pay more for it to be done right.This could've been a top notch movie beating out Spiderman No Way Home. Ezra Miller was great. Heck all the actors were. But the CGI...the technology is there to do it perfectly and it isn't new...why put out this embarrassing mess?","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

We were informed that this version wasn't the final version, specifically the end of the movie, but I think that also included the visual effects in general, because some of it looked unfinished, and I have also read on different medias that the VFX team just had wrapped the visual effects a couple of days before. At the end, it felt close to complete, though.Anyway, this movie, about Barry Allen who uses his super speed to change the past, is an okay action movie. The concept itself is alright - to go back in time to change the past. Nothing new, but we were able to see some familiar characters and events, and that was a nice touch. This was a big deal, but I felt that the story, or at least the execution overall, was a little poor for this concept. The reason is mainly because of the pace and the simplicity. It felt quite rushed, and I think the big picture kind of missed something. I just couldn't settle down properly in several scenes, and then it sometimes could be hard to catch some important elements. I think most of the action scenes were great, though, especially with their fantastic sound effects and the sound design. However, when some scenes actually didn't feel that rushed, I think the comedy unfortunately took too much space from the seriousness, even though it was funny sometimes. This movie didn't take itself too seriously, but to me there were also too much of the ""funny"" parts. Anyway, no matter how bad or good this movie was, it was a crazy ride, especially on the big screen.In conclusion, the concept was familiar and the action scenes were great, but the story execution was a little poor due to rushed pacing and too much comedy. The movie was an enjoyable ride, but there were some areas that could have been improved upon.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The storyline follows Barry Allen discovering while as the Flash he can go back in time and change things. He thinks using this power to save his mom and keep his dad from going to prison is a good idea...until he gets trapped in that time without his powers. He will need to call on some old friends, who end up being new friends in this universe, to help him stop an invasion, get his powers back and get back to his universe.This movie is directed by Andy Muschietti (Mama) and stars Ezra Miller (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), Ben Affleck (The Town), Michael Keaton (Beetlejuice), Sasha Calle (On Swift Horses), Michael Shannon (Take Shelter) and Ron Livingston (The Conjuring).The storyline for this picture is well written and had a lot of clever intricacies. The cast was outstanding, well selected and the characters are fairly well presented. I will say they could have written a better script for Keaton and Supergirl was just okay. The CGI was out of this world...but overdone in too many scenes. I enjoyed the opening sequence with the babies, every scene where Flash runs and the costume was great. However, the world where he chooses timelines was way over done, especially the end where the show multiple universes and the impact of his actions. However, the family dynamic, comedic content and solid characters make this film worth a watch. I would score this film a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

On the positive side, the fast-paced plot immediately grabs your attention, but the negative aspect is that the quick start took a while to resonate with my emotions truly. Overall, DC, you've created a movie that's enjoyable but falls short of being truly outstanding.I must admit that DC movies are usually more miss than hit for me, but this film manages to provide enough screen time for other DC characters like Wonder Woman and Batman to shine without detracting from the main star. The plot is a bit hazy, with Barry Allen attempting to change his mother's fate by running away from his problems. It's relatable in a way, but in all seriousness, he runs so fast that he ends up time-traveling. This opens up different universes, adding a sense of uniqueness and drama while contributing to Barry's growth and the emotional impact of realizing his mother's fate.As mentioned earlier, DC fans who have followed all the Batman and Superman movies from years past will have a Leonardo DiCaprio-pointing-at-the-screen moment.One of the film's highlights is the action, although there aren't many fight scenes. The scenes where the Flash runs or saves the day provide an enjoyable experience. There's a particular scene with Batman that made me appreciate his fighting skills even more. Additionally, the comedy is a bit cheesy, but that's what we expect from Barry Allen. I had a few laughs, but in some scenes, it was evident that they were trying a bit too hard for a chuckle.The film's faults lie in some of the clearly visible CGI, which looks off. The apparent threat in the movie wasn't as strong as other elements, especially when compared to the antagonist in the Flash series. There were certain aspects that left something to be desired. The pacing during the interval felt stale in comparison to the beginning and climax of the film.This year seems to be all about cliffhangers, as the movie ended well and is worth watching, especially for DC fans. I would rate it 3.5/5.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

But I gave it a chance and watched it and despite the negative reviews, I have to admit that by all means, it isn't a bad film and actually lives up to the hype that was built since the first trailer released.Most of the characters shined in this movie with their stellar performances and it was emotionally satisfying to witness how far Barry Allen has grown since his debut in the Justice League.Michael Keaton's return as Batman was absolutely spectacular and nostalgic and watching him back in action after 2 decades complemented by the use of Danny Elfman's theme was a treat and fan service executed perfectly.Some of the major issues the film had included some weak and sloppy CGI, annoying dialogues and jokes from 2013-Barry, and a couple of plotholes that still left me puzzled in the end.Regardless of the problems and Ezra's criminal shenanigans, The Flash is a decent film and a popcorn flick that can be watched to have a good time. It delivers well on the nostalgic elements, sheds more light on the DC multiverse and even gives a fitting conclusion to the DCEU in favour of James Gunn's new DCU reboot.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It basically rides the trend of every superhero movie that has come out in the past year. They all have a story that deals with time and multiple timelines. This movie unfortunately was released after ""Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse"" and it basically does a lot of what that film did but it did not do it better.There are many scenes where the faces of the characters (mostly the flash) are obviously CGI. There are also scenes where The Flash stops time and it just looks very animated. Namely the scene that involves multiple babies. This didn't take away from my experience but it was noticeable on numerous occasions. There was also a Spanish song used during an emotional scene that didn't fit. It was very random and confusing.Ezra Miller was enjoyable playing different versions of himself and showing his range as actor. He delivered some serious emotional moments as well as some silly comedic moments.Sasha Calle as supergirl felt like a weak attempt at including ""Superman"" into the story and this film would have worked better without it. I didn't hate her character, she was just okay.General Zod was another character that didn't work in this film. I understand why he was included and how he was used to tie together this multiverse idea but he wasn't exciting.The character I had the most fun watching on screen was Batman. Every version of him was just amazing and exciting to see. Every scene that involved Batman felt crisp and well done while The Flash had many clunky scenes. On a side note, Michael Keaton's involvement in this film should have been kept a secret. The trailers continue to show too much ruining movie experiences.There were some cool cameos in this film but as I stated before it has been done before. I expected more from this film considering the amount of times it was delayed. There were some cool scenes and action sequences but this movie needed a better story. The characters just weren't strong enough for the audience to care about them. Sometimes less is more but sometimes a character has such a small role that it's much better not to include them (Iris West).In the end I just felt like I've seen this movie already with different characters. I still look forward to the next film I just hope it goes in a different direction and leaves the timelines alone.","141 out of 238 found this helpful.

Warner Brothers were hoping people will forget Ezra Miller's various brushes with the law.By the time it was released in the cinemas. The audience had already seen Spiderman: No Way Home and Dr Strange 2 so were familiar with the multiverse and fan friendly cameos.After appearing in other superhero movies, The Flash gets his own standalone film but with various other superheroes thrown in.Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) goes back in time to exonerate his father. He was wrongly convicted of killing his wife when Barry was a child. His dad claimed he was out shopping for a tin of tomatoes.Despite warnings from Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) not to mess with time. Barry places a can of tomatoes in his mum's shopping s his dad does not have to later go out.Only time has changed not only from the moment his mum did not die. The timeline has changed entirely.In the new present there is another Barry Allen who is more of a slacker. Eric Stoltz was not fired from Back to the Future. Batman is played by Michael Keaton and there is no Superman.For someone like me, Keaton was the pull. The chance to see his take on Batman one more time, over 30 years after he last played the part. There is a portion of the film that is purely for fans with multiple Superman's including a CGI Christopher Reeves.The plot which is mainly borrowed from Man of Steel is really not that interesting. That is a shame, The Flash has a lightness of touch. It has a lot of nostalgia value but the main story is lacking.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I have to say, I don't mind the use of CGI, no matter what people may complain about. In fact, I thought the CGI was acceptable, adding to the overall emotional and fun experience of the film. The story between the mother and son was particularly well-crafted, tugging at my heartstrings throughout the movie.I must admit, there were moments that brought me to tears. The filmmakers really knew how to tap into the emotions and create a truly immersive experience. But it wasn't all tears, there were also plenty of moments that had me bursting out in laughter. The balance between heartfelt moments and humor was spot-on.The movie also had just the right amount of action. It kept me on the edge of my seat, eagerly waiting to see what would happen next. The pacing was fantastic, never dragging or feeling rushed. The action sequences were visually stunning, making every moment a thrill.Now, I have to address something. It's disheartening to see so much hate in this world, especially when it's directed at actors for their real-life mistakes. We're all human, and we all make mistakes. Let's focus on the talent and hard work that goes into creating a movie like this, rather than nitpicking and spreading negativity.In conclusion, The Flash movie deserves a perfect 10/10 rating in my book. It touched me on an emotional level, made me laugh, and kept me thoroughly entertained throughout. It's a reminder that we're all flawed, but that doesn't diminish the incredible storytelling and craftsmanship behind this film. Kudos to the cast, crew, and everyone involved in bringing this amazing movie to life!","15 out of 31 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, apart from him and Keaton, much of the rest of the film felt phoned in. Even the production values were surprisingly poor. A lot of people are complaining about the CGI and justifiably so - this would have looked bad 20 years ago so it's pretty inexcusable in 2023 from a studio with this kind of resources at its disposal.Casting felt really off even in some of the smaller parts, with many of the actors (looking at you Ron Livingston and Sascha Calle, among others) feeling like they weren't even up to the task of delivering in their limited screen time. Some of them (Shannon is an example) were so flat that you had to wonder whether they were even in the film at all and you weren't just seeing some AI rendition of their likenesses ripped from previous films.The plot, at its core, would have been alright if this wasn't several films back in the line of superhero movies that tried to play with time travel and alternate realities. I can't speak for everyone else, but I've definitely found it increasingly difficult to care about these free-for-all cinematic universes. The saving grace of this film is that there's at least some emotional resonance driving Barry's decision to go back. It still pales in comparison to the gravitas driving End Game, for example, but it was something. Unfortunately here the reality jumps just become tiresome by the end of the film and the relentless fan service isn't enough to hold it together.All in all I was a little disappointed in this. The DCU doesn't have a great track record at this point but I was kind of hoping based on the trailers that this might be one of their better entries. Unfortunately it ended up being just another poorly executed mess. It wasn't Black Adam bad, but it wasn't that good either.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

You don't really have had to watch any of the other DCEU movies to enjoy it just have an understanding of who the villains were in those movies and basic general timeline of the DCEU. It was an unexpected awesome sendoff for one of the main characters in the movie. If you're totally unfamiliar with first Batman movie a lot of the nostalgia won't resonate with you. Despite all his personal issues Ezra Miller is a good actor and pulled off the quirky lead of this movie perfectly. However it you are tired of time travel/multiverse gimmicks to fix bad script mistakes in previous movies, I recommend waiting till this is available to stream as a part of a subscription.

Ezra, well - with all his ongoing issues, I can't lie - he was brilliant in this film. He's clearly in need of help in his personal life - but as an actor - he is a genius and extremely talented. Great cameos from past DC superhero's. Some of which will surprise you. Loved the story as well. My only criticism is - if I'm being picky is - sons of the CGI is a bit ropey - which I was slightly disappointed with. Other than that - this movie is flawless.

Let me tell you, this flick packed a punch, mostly soaring high with its electrifying storytelling and captivating performances. Yet, I can't help but address the elephant in the room - the atrocious CGI in one particular section. It's like they reached for the stars but stumbled into a digital abyss. But hold your horses, because this film deserves a fair shake beyond its computer-generated blunder.Once you look past that blemish and dive into the rest of the movie, prepare to be blown away. The actors shine like supernovas, delivering remarkable performances that will leave you in awe. The action unfolds in epic proportions, sweeping you into a whirlwind of adrenaline-fueled excitement. The writing flows like a mighty river, effortlessly guiding you through a sea of emotions. And amidst it all, the humor lands with impeccable timing, providing much-needed levity, while the drama strikes chords deep within your soul. Oh, and let's not forget the delightful brushstrokes of nostalgia that grace the screen.It's perplexing, though, how a film that spent ages in development could stumble in such a crucial area of visual effects. Perhaps the tumultuous real-world events overshadowed the significance of refining those rough edges. It's a regrettable misstep because this film has so much to offer. I, for one, am tired of the superhero shuffle, yet ""The Flash"" manages to break the mold and captivate.The Flash 2023 may stumble in one section, but it ignites a spark that resonates throughout. Prepare to be enthralled by its pulse-pounding adventures and immersive storytelling that transcends the shortcomings.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Flash does many things right with a story that takes itself seriously when it needs to, but also delivers many funny moments. The movie has tons of action and truly gives you the sense of speed you would expect from a Flash adaptation. Ezra Miller is surprisingly good here, and if you can look past his off-screen controversy you might find Miller's performance really enjoyable. If this is a deal-breaker for you then his portrayal of Barry Allen isn't going to win you over because you're basically getting a double dose of Miller. Most will probably say that Keaton's Batman was the highlight of the film, and I have to say that this part definitely hit me with nostalgia berries. Sasha Calle's Supergirl was fine, she looks great for the part but I wanted a little more depth from her character.We need to talk about the CGI though. To say the visuals were sub-par would be a vast understatement. There are times when the visual effects actually look pretty good, but then there are too many times where it looks absolutely cartoonish, especially whenever they try to fully render people or animals. For a film that cost over $200 million to make I have to wonder how much of this went to the visual effects. The director trying to hand-wave this away as a ""stylized choice"" just sounds like a poor excuse for these terrible CGI sequences. There are new PS5 games that have better graphics than this. It felt like an assault on my optic nerves.Aside from the bad VFX, there were some interesting cameos, some of which made me wonder how much footage Warner Bros has sealed away from the public. The plot does get a little messy and it feels more like a send-off for the DCEU rather than a true Flash movie. I thought the villain didn't get enough attention since they were trying to spend so much time handling the multiverse aspect. It's almost like there were 2 or 3 separate scripts being mashed together for the story. I certainly liked this more than Shazam 2 and Black Adam. This film is already expected to bomb like those other two did though, so I think James Gunn and WB need to seriously consider doing a full reboot of the DC Universe. This movie came out way too late in the Snyderverse era to be truly relevant, and with the new DC film universe on the horizon too many people will find it hard to care about a film that won't really matter going forward.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Movie Review -Horror film specialist Andy Muschietti attempts to exorcist the DCEU from the dark clouds with their latest superhero saga, ""The Flash"". DC is pretty late to join the multiverse zone compared to Marvel, but they had something that Marvel didn't have. Yes, No Way Home did bring Sam Raimi's nostalgia back, but we can never forget that DC's Superman and Batman are far older and better known than the MCEU. The Flash tries to cash in on that nostalgia goofed up in a multiverse defined by time travel with a reference to the iconic ""Back to the Future"". That's how crazy things are here, but then there's a lot of crazy fun too. The Flash doesn't hit like a lightning bolt, but fair enough to provide you with a kick. Yes, it's too messy to enjoy, but the whole point of getting your logic right rests peacefully with that twist in the end.The Flash has a super-pacy opening sequence as The Flash (Ezra Miller) is called by Alfred (Jeremy Irons) to help The Batman (Ben Affleck) save the city from a disaster. There is a sweet cameo by Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) to make the opening sequence even better. The Flash then unknowingly unleashes the power of travelling back in time. That gives him an idea to prevent his mother's death, but it traps him in an alternate reality without metahumans. To save the world from General Zod (Michael Shannon), Barry enlists the help of his younger self, who has now got his powers, to turn things back to normal. A screamer follows as he meets the Batman of that universe, played by none other than Michael Keaton. A Kryptonian castaway, Supergirl (Sasha Calle), joins this super team to beat the mighty Zod since there is no Superman (Henry Cavill).You know, Doctor Strange could have fixed things in ""Infinity War,"" but he didn't. Because he knew that some things cannot be fixed; they are inevitable. He did travel and saw everything that could happen or could have happened from a different perspective to realise a universal law of factuality. MCEU did not bother showing us all his attempts that might have failed; rather, they just finished the whole thing in half a minute. But the DCEU has made a whole multiverse film on the same topic now. The Flash is about the whole process-every different attempt he would do to change things in the past so that his present, aka future, can be different. But little did he know that he was giving birth to new problems and new timelines. Technically, it's a child's play to watch a whole movie based on this idea and that too, for about 145 minutes. But like I said, the entire strategy somehow finds a solution in the end, even after the so-called happy ending, which is highly deceptive.The Flash has some things going against it, and Ezra Miller's performance is the most visible thing out of a whole bunch. We are used to the first Barry, so we know what he is and how he is at times. But the second Barry, aka the younger version, is not just irritating but also childish on occasion. Ezra is the only guy who has a full-fledged role in the film, so his failure as an actor does great harm. Sasha Calle couldn't have replaced Henry Cavill in any universe, but in her own small role, the cute little girl has done somewhat decent. Ron Livingston hardly appears, Michael Shannon isn't used well, Maribel Verdú walks in between, and Kiersey Clemons is barely noticeable as Barry's wannabe girlfriend. Ben Affleck disappears after a good start, but maybe that's why we love Michael Keaton so much. Seeing two Batmans together would have been a dream moment, but was it practically possible? Keaton wears the suit and cape again to take us back to the 90s' memories, so we should be thankful to the old man.The Flash was a difficult film for the visual effects experts, as they had to create that circular handler that is the centre of this time travel. They made it like a sports ground, so I'm not sure how people will take that. Though it starts looking better with every next viewing, especially in the climax. The cinematography and background score are okay with less effort to be remembered. The Flash slashes through many rough jokes, while some are hysterical enough. I mean, who cuts horns from Batman's mask? To sum up the negatives, I'd say The Flash is a pretty overslaughed and overlapped flick. Those Supergirl smashes look cartoonish; those ""I am The Flash"" and ""I am The Batman"" quotes are too outdated now; even the villain's conflicts are radical now. Some fresh meat and fresh beer, and this popcorn flick could have been so much fun. Andy Muschietti comes from a horror background to make a superhero-horror drama in DC's new wave. The horror is different from monster-driven and ghost-driven films, though. Overall, it's a decent attempt, if not good, uplifted by some crazy fan-driven cameos and nostalgia. Going in for the old Batman? Well, don't be so sure that you'll only get him. *Lips locked*RATING - 6/10*","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, it is entertaning for the most part. I have seen taglines calling it the best DCEU movie, and one of the best superhero movies of all time. It isn't, in fact it isn't even in the top 20. It would rank above WW84, but below Aquaman. It's plainfully average.The good things about the Flash is the acting - especially by Ezra who gives a great performance as Barry. Now I will try and keep all the chaos from the actor's life out of this review, since I'm here to talk about the movie, and nothing else. Ezra is a very charasmatic actor, and it shows here through Barry. Barry is a very compelling character here, he has flaws, and conflicts which help drive his motivations. Michael Keaton as Bruce is also amazing here, despite him not having a great deal to do. Sure the action scenes involving Batman were remarkable. Seeing the 80s Batman perform that kind of hand to hand combat was a delight to see. Sasha Calle as Supergirl was.... meh. The character doesn't do that much and she doesn't have that much screentime either. She is just there. I would like to see more of her, as I think she would fit well, but overall, she was.. ok I guess.The bad is clearly the CGI. It is awful, and I mean awful. I have read the director's comments on it, and it's nonesense. The visuals are horrific and take you out of the movie almost every time. The story is predictable and plain, but there are some emotional moments here and there. The music is generic, the cinematography is fine, but nothing special.Overall, The Flash is average, it won't win any awards or be remembered. It was a mess, which tells me there is a much longer version out there, since it rushes from A to B.6/10.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The «multiverse/time travel» storyline has been beaten to death already by Marvel lately, but this is easily the worst iteration yet. Ezra Miller portraits a very awkward Barry Allen that appears to be «on the spectrum». It was bearable in the last movie, but not in this one.. There's just to much of him. Batman and Supergirl make appearances, and both do fine showings.The cgi in the movie is abysmally bad.

not bad, the motivation of the hero is clear, unfortunately in our time we lose people close to us people close to us, and there is a desire to bring them back.Then the time travel begins, and we can say that the rest of the story may
seem simple, the scriptwriters have twisted the comic book story, I expected something more dramatic, which could give more emotions.The principles of time travel are described in terms that are understandable to everyone, but they don't they don't try to go into something deeper. The jokes were funny, but not everything was were not all on point.The downside is the graphics, some moments are more like a video game than a movie, and it a little bit off, but in general the movie is tied to the story and not to the explosions and everything other.I liked Ezra Miller's performance, he plays 2 different people well, from Michael Keaton
It feels like he wanted to return to this role.As for the cameos, the number of them is interesting, I wouldn't say that there are a lot of them, but the selection I liked it, especially the man who played his role here.Moving on to the movie's music, I liked it overall, it turned out well, but it's not a case that I'll add a lot of songs to my playlist like I did with ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", I can single out the soundtrack that plays closer to the end of the movie, it's a good song.The end of the movie was both sad and left a positive impression right before
before the credits roll.Overall, I liked the movie, I had a good time watching this movie,
it's funny, entertaining, it has a moral that you can understand, my rating
this movie is 7/10.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Sasha Calle's Supergirl is the best thing about this","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9123156/?ref_=tt_urv","gcsman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66541531/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2023","I went to this primarily to see Michael Keaton again as Batman, and Sasha Calle as a new version of Supergirl. Keaton was great as always -- he is such a skilful actor -- but the only problem was that he had less to do and say than I was expecting (having o/d'd on all those trailers that featured him so much). Could have used more of the best Batman ever, but obviously the scripting choices didn't go in that direction.But now Sasha Calle's Supergirl? This Kara Zor-el is a strong, free character with her own agency who can and does stand independently of the others around her, and Calle plays her perfectly. In just a few scenes, Kara is developed as a character of depth and complexity that we end up caring about. She's the best takeway from this rather fractured movie. The Supergirl suit, adapted from the style of Henry Cavill's Superman version, is just great, and so are the renditions of her flying scenes, which I don't take for granted. For any superhero with flight as one of their powers, it's critical to get those right. Those scenes are smooth, powerful, as good or better than anything we've had before. Just the bits with her 'standing' in midair -- it all looks very natural. The battle scenes too. And it doesn't matter at all that she's not the blonde, blue-eyed version that every previous Supergirl has been as long as the nature of the character is honored. (but Nic Cage playing Superman? That's an issue.)For the tital role, Ezra Miller is actually a capable actor, but he choice to play Barry Allen as a kind of a jittery young nerd is a big step away from the source material of the comics (or the CW TV series). That approach didn't really appeal to me in Justice League (2017) where Flash was introduced, and ultimately it' s not much better here. On the plus side, the best part of Miller's work is that the two Barry Allens from the two timelines are side by side for almost the whole thing, and it's surprisingly convincing. You forget that they are the same person. The CGI team came up with a depiction of the 'Speed Force' realm that looks different from anything on screen before, though it doesn't make sense that Flash can sort of stop and look around at different alternate timelines seen all around him while time-travelling. I see this effect is now called the 'chronobowl'. OK, whatever.I think though there are two basic problems with the whole movie. One is just that it's coming late to the party. It's a kind of addendum to the Justice League world, but that was 6 years ago already and is now old news. By contrast, Aquaman (2018) followed JL almost immediately and benefitted from it. The second issue is just that Miller is really a character actor, not a lead-role actor. I constantly had the feeling that this was a misfit.I've rarely felt this conflicted about a movie. For Sasha Calle's sake alone I'd like to rate this whole thing higher than I did, but the rest of it -- the details have a kind of patchwork feel which I'd guess may be the result of too many years in development and being passed around through too many hands. The bits of humor often fall flat, and the details of the plot weave their way into kind of a mess. And I have to say that I thought Kara's fate was was ugly and disturbing, suggesting that we weren't supposed to view these alternate-timeline characters as anything more than paper dolls to be thrown away whenever they liked. I felt like we'd been sucker-punched. They gave her a strong introduction, built her up into a character of real stature who we care about, then just tossed her away. That's a kind of betrayal of trust with the audience. Finally there's a riot of cameo overload and callbacks from previous DC players that puts it so far into the meta realm that there's no recovery. But that's the essential problem with the multiverse: if anything can happen, who cares what happens? (to quote Gene Siskel.) It puts emotional distance between the viewer and the characters that feels a bit unsatisfying.Bottom line for me is, go to this to see Supergirl! Calle is the only one who comes out of this production with a well earned boost in profile, and I hope we get to see more of her, but I'm worried that we won't, unfortunately. DC has already walked away from Henry Cavill, maybe the best Superman ever. Now it feels like they're going to walk away from someone else who's also made a hit and would gladly continue if given the chance. I read that three different versions of the ending were filmed, with one of them where Kara and Keaton/Batman are alive and well back in Barry's 'original' timeline. That's the version I want to see.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Storyline is very intriguing and there's a fine balance of heartwarming story with comedy. Comedy is not overdone like the Marvel films. If DC can continue pumping out films like this, it'll easily beat marvel since that's obviously been saturated by lackluster films. People should just watch the movie and see for themselves.

He wasn't playing another broken down, bitter old man, he was a recluse who made peace with his past and was happy to live in a world that no longer needed Batman.Supergirl was underutilized, but Calle's performance was good and the character was unique, not just Caville's Superman but a woman.The nostalgia was utilized well if a bit too much at times, but it never beats you over the head the way the latest Star Wars movies did.Miller as a person is very problematic, however their performance here, especially against ""himself"" as two different versions of Barry was really good.The special effects were really bad at times. They should have been more subtle and used their human actors where they could.The time travel/multiverse concept here was handled well and I loved the zoetrope time bubble concept, but this is where humans, not CGI, would have been better.The movie added layers to obvious story beats such as the reference to Back to the Future that also showed that things were different. This made telling the origin story not just a rote retelling of events.I read complaints that they overused the time travel aspect in the final battle to go back a few minutes and correct mistakes. They did it twice.The ending was hilarious, as was the post credit scene that didn't feel the need to set up another movie.John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein have got a wild resume of big hits and misses. I've enjoyed all of their work and hope this doesn't hurt them.It's a real shame that this movie was a failure. For everything it doesn't do well, there's a lot to like and I was entertained the whole way through. I read the reviews and honestly feel like a lot of the criticism was overblown. It's well worth checking out even if it marks the end of the current DCEU.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Miller, reprising his role as the Flash, brings a certain charm to the character, while Keaton's return as Batman is a nostalgic treat for fans of the older Batman films.The plot is engaging enough, revolving around Barry Allen using his super speed to change the past in an attempt to save his family. However, this creates a world without superheroes, forcing him to race for his life to save the future. While the storyline is intriguing, the script could have been tightened up to provide a more cohesive narrative.Unfortunately, the film is let down by the performance of the actress who played Supergirl. Her lack of facial expressions and robotic demeanor made her performance feel more akin to an AI NPC rather than a dynamic superhero.The biggest letdown, however, was the CGI. For a film that relies heavily on special effects, the quality of the CGI was surprisingly poor. The facial quality of the special guest stars was particularly disappointing, and the overall quality of the CGI was subpar, to say the least.Despite these drawbacks, ""The Flash (2023)"" manages to be a better film than it has any right to be. The performances of Miller and Keaton, coupled with an engaging plot, make it a worthwhile watch for fans of the superhero genre. However, the poor CGI and lackluster performance from Supergirl prevent it from reaching its full potential.Overall, I would give ""The Flash (2023)"" a 7 out of 10. It's a film that has its moments of brilliance, but is ultimately let down by subpar CGI and inconsistent performances.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

There is one thing I would like to point out, though, about Barry being annoying: it was on purpose, and is even addressed in the movie. Older Barry blatantly yells at younger Barry for it.As for the CGI, it never even occurred to me that it was bad until someone else pointed it out to me. Some of the best movies ever made have bad CGI by today's standards (ie. The Terminator, and Ghostbusters), so I never really pay attention to it. I understand that because we do have the technology to make it better now, many are upset by it, but I also understand that it was done that way on purpose. I know for most viewers it didn't work out, but for me I guess it did.The movie was very thick on fan-service (which can be a negative for some people), but I am a huge DC fan, so I enjoyed that.The story wasn't spectacular by any means, but was still well-written and well-executed, although the ending was a bit up-in-the-air, leaving the viewer with questions. I suppose, though, that we all have questions about where DC is going (and maybe, if you're a DC fan like me, worries, too), so the ending leaves it open for those questions to be answered in future movies. I just hope the answers are good ones.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The Batcave looks fantastic. Then comes Ezra Miller and in the opening sequence he's even funny. Then he goes on and on with stupid jokes and after 20 minutes you have 2 of them. He's the main character of the movie and you just hate him for being so annoying. If only they could have cast Grant Gustin to give this movie a more serious note. It looks like they convinced Keaton to put the cape ( you know the real cape ) back on and then desperately looked for a plot. Also, they weren't able to cast Cavill, but they could have at least ask Brandon Routh or Tom Welling or even Dean Cain. Instead they cast some Girl as Kara. She's not as bad as Miller but she is just no Superman replacement. So the movie goes on and on and it seems to never end. A chaotic mess. They should have asked Tim Burton for advice. I love DC but they should stop trying to compete with Marvel. Of course you compare The Flash with No Way Home and it does not stand a chance at all. Huge Disappointment.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But on his return to the present timeline he gets knocked off course and finds himself stuck in an alternate timeline where Superman is not around to stop Zod's invasion of earth.I was not expecting much when I went in to watch The Flash, so I was pleasantly surprised when I walked out having enjoyed this so much! The Flash is sort of like the DCU's version of Avengers Endgame in that it references and rewrites various events from movies past... and not just recent movies either but ALL DC related films or shows going back to the 50s. The humour can be a bit on the nose at times, but there's also some genuine comedic observations about the other Justice League characters. Although the overall plot is quite emotionally heavy and deals with loss, grief and the role pain plays in our development as people, the story is told in a light and breezy way making it very easy to watch. Generally time travel storylines get very confusing, but the explanations given in this film are quite different to how other films deal with time travel and I found it slightly refreshing. It did start to get a little confusing right near the end with what was happening inside the time bubble thing and worlds were crashing into one another but outside of that small sequence, everything else made perfect sense to me. It was great to see Michael Keaton return to his role as Batman. There are a few other interesting faces that show up and events refrenced from movies past and I don't want to spoil it for others but it was fun pointing them all out. That was also the movies biggest let down. The CGI was generally alright I thought but the faces on the de-aged characters and the ones with actors whom have passed away looked noticeably fake. Not horrible, just not great either. I get they were trying to do a heartfelt homage to Reeves but the poor CGI made it look almost embarrassing. I also think the return of Zod was... underwhelming. I get Zod was not really that big of a part of the overall story anyway as it wasn't about him, but if you bring the original actor back then at least give him more to say and do!Final Verdict: Action packed, funny, emotional when it counts and just an all round easy watch. It does start to get a bit self-indulgent right towards the end, the CGI at times was iffy and the humour didn't always land but its one of the better DCU films in a long time! DC fans should love it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Based on The Flashpoint (with a lot of changes), which I love as a comic album. Even tho they changed a lot I felt the tune of the comic in it.Ezra was not as bad as I thought, and I believe that a lot of hate towards his acting, is more about him as a person of camera, which I chose to not think of.Keaton was very good and I found myself sitting with a nostalgic smile a lot.The only actor I really didn't like in the casting was Iris. I found her very boring and not very engaging.In difference of many others, I actually liked the CGI in the running part too.Script wise:
I have to give it a little minus, since it felt that you should already know some of Barry's backstory. It's presented a bit rushed in the movie, and that can definitely create a feeling of being messy.But I liked it.It captures my emotions in different directions and I like that every DC movie doesn't have to be pitch black, just because The Dark Knight -trilogy became such a success.I like it, and I wish this universe would have got more movies!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Won't say I was pleasantly surprised but its better than I thought it'd be. The entire movie looks like it was made by little kids lemonade shop earning, an absolutely insult to people with eyes. Adding that to the bold and dimwitted excuse by the director for the story state of visuals, this could easily be the worst looking superhero movie of the 2000s. Because it really is just an excuse cooked up by a thirdrate hack with zero filmmaking knowledge who shouldnt be anywhere near the directors chair.The good surprise all came from Ezra Felon Miller, who I wasnt a fan of as Flash. But in some weird way he makes it work, which is astounding since there are two of them and the other one is an even more insufferable version of him. But both version work, their contrast and perspective and role reversals work. The additional treat was Michael Keaton back as Batman, not in all his glory but in the most Michael Keaton way as possible. The easter eggs from the '89 movie was peppered throughout, nostalgia bait or not it worked on me. The fight scenes were appalling and I swear this is the final time but the whole big battle in an empty field fight is the worst thing Ive seen in a superhero movie. Honestly I imagine the Morbius theatre looked more packed than this. Sasha Calle as Supergirl was decent enough but Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot just keeps getting worse as times go on. Ben Affleck is a terrible Batman and Bruce Wayne, he was only ever good in half of BVS, people need to wake up and see for what he is. The twist at the end was very neat and dare I say as a concept was better than the actual Flashpoint comics for me. Wont spoil but you'll understand when its revealed. And be sure that is high enough praise for me, when I say its better conceptwise than the actual comic that everyone loves.Ezra Miller carries the film, the nightmare opening act aside he was really solid. Esp in the more nuanced scenes injected with just enough emotion. Its a shame that both he and the concept was stuck inside a movie made by a D-grade moviemaker pretending to be a C-grade moviemaker. I literally have no respect for the director of this film, couldve really been quite good if made by someone with half a vision.RATING: 6/10(Was expecting a 2/10 movie)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Every second of Kenton's screen time was well worth the wait. The time-travel-Butterfly Effect plot line is endearing, and the gravity of the situation was at times palpable.The Bad: Ezra Miller's Barry Allen is a Stooge - like the 4th, less funny of the Stooges. The goofy schtick was painful, and played out by 20 minutes into the 2+ hour film. For a character that is purported to be super smart, all of his screen time was spent showing us how dumb he really could be. Enter the multi-verse, and now viewers have to endure multiple Nutty Barry Allen's. It overshadows the Good.If I could dissect the elements into entirely separate films, I would say Michael Kenton's Batman / General Zod: B+ - Barry Allen / The Nutty Professor: D-. Mash the two together, it's an almost-watchable film, but really not worth the pain and suffering.","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

The audiences however heard that 71 years old Michael Keaton might be rephrasing his role as Batman, which made older generation very excited.Both rumors came true to fruition.Keaton indeed is a supporting character and CGI is as awful as early rumors anticipated.It's very hard to emphasize with characters when we clearly see that they are computer generated renditions of the actors. At this moment in development of filmmaking art there is clear distinction between video gaming and genuine film experience.This is why first 'MATRIX' is still considered one of the best movie of the genre, not only because of great concept and performances, but because visual fx created for the film (epecially ""bullet time"") are still being used to this day by other filmmakers. Then again we don't go to the cinema to see special fx. We normally want to escape in to the world of make believe and switch off our awareness of our own daily struggles and experience characters through medium of silver screen.But want if the lead actor isn't very convincing and although he has to perform two roles in the movie, should we be hard on him, or more understanding that perhaps having dual performance might simply be too difficult task for him/her. I feel Ezra Miller who reprised his role as Flash, tried to do his best, but simply behind the lines he speaks, there needs to be clear inner objectives, which actor attaches real inner emotions to, which in turn audience will feel on the emotional level.Sadly Ezra's dual performance (he also played a younger version of himself) lacks in this department.To be a 'Method' actor you don't have to be Daniel Day-Lewis and live for 6 months in the forest hunting, to be able to portray an Indian with conviction. It is about attaching some real inner objectives behind the dialog which actor is saying. And there are different approaches to internal method acting, some like Lee Strasberg will use emotional intelligence, other acting teachers like Stellar Adler will opt for imaginary stimulus, which triggers real emotional responses from the actor. Some external actors due to their thespian stage technique, might come very close to believability, however should we be hard on Ezra that the dual performances he given as the Flash feel forced and simply not real? I would say no...the technical task of performing two characters is simply very difficult technically and so even truly exceptional actors would have difficulty with this task.Perhaps the strongest aspect of this otherwise forgetful visual extravaganza is Sasha Calle who plays the SUPER-GIRL.With the background in her character she displays wonderful mixture of suppressed emotions, which are joy to observe. And of course having wonderful Micheal Keaton as supportive character brings depth and nostalgia to some who remember him in his prime.He still got it though in every sense of the word. THE FLASH' isn't awful, but specifically by the end it becomes very narratively messy indeed. And considering that the main plot evolves around son trying to safe his deceased mother, as someone with experience in this matter I was hoping to connect with material, sadly I felt like Ezra instead of feeling the actual emotions of grief, only pretended and technically let the tears follow on cue...and trust me, we know as the audience when you as the actor are honest in your emotions and when you technically force it, as it is in this case.I would love to recommend this one, but make sure you don't expect too much, especially by the end it resembles video game, which makes us switch of from drama which unfoldsf.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But it couldn't overcome the negatives-the lead actor being average at best with enough baggage to sink the Titanic and EXTREMELY POOR CGI-possibly the worst ever in a big studio movie. The public criticism of the CGI was not overblown-action sequences resembled a video game and superb actors from recent DC movies seemed computer generated.Should you watch it? Absolutely for the decades of IP nostalgia. Should you pay for it? Absolutely not. Like most Warner Bros DC movies its flaws are too great. Action sequences resemble video games, it has a below average main actor plus a side cast with computer generated mouths or faces.

She has already turned 10 years old, and probably only the lazy one did not scold her. A great start for Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"", a promising sequel and a team action movie ""Justice League"". A fan's dream that went awry. As a result, in 2023, the viewer has the long-awaited (actually not very) finale of the Snyder Universe and the subsequent restart after Andres Musketti's film ""Flash"". It is known that the film was redone several times, something was added, something was removed. It is not surprising that by the time of release, the picture approached with caution and a lot of potential problems. On top of everything else, attempts to somehow attract an audience after the announcement that the superhero team franchise would be relaunched seemed doomed to failure, as the fees showed. With a budget of $200 million, the film collected a little more than two hundred, turning out to be a failure. It seems hopeless, but everyone decides for himself.For me personally, this is a one-time movie. Yes, for one, but he still remembered positively in some moments. And the most important of them is the central theme of Barry Allen, the main character of the picture, a man who is trying to turn back time and bring back his mother who died many years ago. This is one of the central plots of the Flash hero in principle. And it's not bad that this theme was chosen for the solo album. And even though the implementation looks quite controversial, the film can't take away a good line of Flash's longing for the deceased mother. This grief became decisive for the young man, made him insecure, a little twitchy, funny and creepy, but still a kind person who, having received his superpowers, decides to fix everything at all costs. Longing and feelings of guilt are perfectly conveyed in the picture. Ezra Miller's performance is impressive in some moments, and meeting his mother in the finale is worth a lot. The creators approached the topic of son and mother with all responsibility, in my opinion, they conveyed the relationship of two very touchingly.The rest of the picture is trying to stand on a par with other blockbusters about DC superheroes, but it does not leave the feeling that everything that is happening is somehow local and does not have the scale that we saw in Snyder's films, Wonder Woman or Aquaman. Despite the great timing, in which there seems to have been enough time to reveal the characters, this does not happen. You do not get into the story of Supergirl, you are not impressed even by Michael Keaton's Batman, who was an excellent embodiment in Tim Burton's films. Yes, the fan service has been delivered, there are a lot of comic book stories here for fans, you will get to see a lot of cameos. But for a non-immersed viewer, this only breeds a bunch of questions, and the film is obliged, in my opinion, to avoid such by explaining and telling who is who in this story.The visual component leaves a lot of questions. Especially closer to the final. I have heard the creators' statements that a lot has been done as an attempt to show how Flash sees everything at super speed and so on, but I am inclined to believe that the guys simply did not master high-quality computer graphics. And of course it's a shame in 2023.Feelings are contradictory after viewing the picture. There is good humor, there is frankly bad. Plot moves do not cause strong emotions. As a separate picture, the film is probably not bad, but you will hardly want to watch it again. His main decoration for me personally, I repeat, was the theme of his son and mother, attempts to save the world of young Barry, who lost his family, and at the moment of an important choice, this guy becomes a responsible person who is ready to make an adult decision, understanding what it threatens him with.7 out of 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

That's before we get into the CGI looking like 2008 cut scene on an Xbox 360. You would have thought they learned their lesson with the terrible Green Lantern uniform CGI but I guess they didn't. Maybe one day we will get a Flash movie with a decent cast and story but not today. I honestly wouldn't waste your time watching this if you haven't seen it yet.

The movie has gone through countless changes over the years and not all of them for the better.This production is interesting, at some points very impressive but at others absolutely horrifying.Despite Andres Muschiettis words that the flash is a Tribute to Zack Snyder and Ezra Miller saying that ""No power or force in any known megaverse would or could ever erase Zack Snyder's mighty wrkz. You can take that quote. Take that to the bank, to the press, to the schools, to the military, to the other pillar of capitalism I'm forgetting cause of that thing where if you try to think of a group of things you always forget one of them"" this still feels like a watered down version of what Snyder had in mind.That being said movie is decent enough ""the performances are excellent Ezra Miller is the perfect choice to play the flash, Batfleck is the ultimate Batman but Keaton's performance oozes nostalgia and is very good, young Sasha Calle is brilliant easily becoming the perfect Supergirl (I must admit though that I'd rather have seen Henry Cavill as Kal El in this movie) and even Nicholas Cage in his 15 seconds on screen gave us goosebumps imagining what Superman Lives would have been like had Warner Bros not been so short sighted.The plot is the typical Flashpoint storyline with a few alterations. Once again one can't help but feel Snyder would have insisted on a more fleshed out story, this felt kinda paper thin at times. The CGI is definitely sub standard and no movie in the Zack Snyder era of the DCEU now the DCU was ever passed with such poor CGI. There are some very good emotional moments, lots of Nostalgia and performances Par-Excellence.It's a good movie but isn't everything it should've been. Perhaps I'm being overly judgemental here but I feel the constant changes in management and direction messed this movie up badly.Still it's worth a watch.Unfortunately I don't agree with Andres Muschietti Zack Snyder should definitely not watch this movie. Being the man he is im certain hel be polite enough and encouraging but deep down inside I'm absolutely certain he'd be disappointed in the end result.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Barry Allen is a fun, happy, sometimes awkward character... like a puppy! However, Ezra Miller and this script just make him uncomfortably awkward. The biggest issue with this movie is the graphics. His awkward running style is the least problematic of the CGI issues. The largest by far is that all the other characters in scenes where Flash is running or going back in time look like they were replaced with department store mannequins. This is laughable in all aspects. It makes sense that the DCEU is doing yet another reboot (scrapping all the actors) with all the bad PR surrounding DCEU actors and the monster flop that is Flash.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

There were funny moments in the film that I liked. There were also some sad moments but the action sequences were the ones that I enjoyed. The CGI and special effects were all right to see.It's great to see Michael Keaton return as Batman. He nearly stole the entire movie. It was just like watching a third and new installment to Tim Burton's film series but only with the Flash. The best of all was hearing Danny Elfman's theme song. There were references in the movie that the fans and I know about. Of course there were easter eggs and cameos that I saw so I won't spoil those in this review. The ending took me by surprise as well.I know that this film didn't make it to the top 10 box office success but there were a lot of positive reviews who liked this movie. I don't know why there are negative reviews hating this film. It was two hours long but that's what superhero films are for. I don't know what to expect for the next upcoming DCEU films in the future.

I loved the storyline of Flash/Barry Allen and his dynamic with his past self (and Bruce!). Truly what captivated me the most was Supergirl's introduction. Sasha Calle immediately hypnotizes you on-screen that every scene she has pulls you on the edge of your seat. She is entertaining and perhaps one of the most promising young actresses in the industry. I'm immediately hooked and cannot wait to see her in future projects.I loved the characters' dynamics and how Barry would sacrifice everything just to feel his mother's love again.

The film is loosely based on the comic book storyline Flashpoint, in which Barry travels back in time to prevent his mother's death, but alters the timeline and creates a world without super heroes. He then has to team up with an older Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), a female version of Superman (Sasha Calle), and his alternate self (also Miller) to stop General Zod (Michael Shannon) from destroying the planet.The film has some positive aspects, such as the humor, the action sequences, and the performances of Miller, Keaton, and Calle. Miller brings a lot of charm and energy to his role, and his interactions with Keaton's grumpy Batman are fun to watch. Calle is also impressive as Supergirl, who has a tragic backstory and a fierce personality. The film also has some impressive visual effects, especially in the scenes where Barry uses his speed force powers.However, the film also has many flaws that prevent it from being a great superhero movie. The plot is convoluted and confusing, with too many characters and subplots that are not well-developed or explained. The film tries to cram in too much fan service and references to other DC properties, but they feel forced and unnecessary. The third act is especially disappointing, as it devolves into a generic CGI-fest with a bland villain and a predictable outcome. The film also suffers from some poor editing, pacing, and dialogue issues.Overall, The Flash (2023) is a mixed bag that will appeal to some fans of the character and the DCEU, but will also frustrate and disappoint others who expect more from a superhero movie. It is not a terrible film, but it is not a great one either. It is a mediocre film that could have been much better with a tighter script, a clearer vision, and more focus on its main character.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As forgettable as most entries have been in the DCEU so far, The Flash raises the bar on how visually hideous a blockbuster with $200 million production budget can look.Directed by Andy Muschietti (Mama & It), there are times when the story hits the right emotional beats but everything around it is so chaotic from the start that those moments never manage to strike the chord. Many of the callbacks & references to past films & characters are unnecessary to its own plot and all the superheroes reprising their roles appear much worse in this story than they ever did in their own films.The action has no build-up, excitement or escalation whatsoever, humour is often awfully timed, and the visual effects are all over the place, ranging from serviceable to inexcusably cartoonish whether it is rendering the backgrounds or focusing on the action unfolding in the forefront. The performances are mediocre at best and editing puts more emphasis on fan service than getting the basic storytelling fundamentals right.Overall, The Flash is visually abhorrent, emotionally vapid & creatively bankrupt from beginning to end and doesn't feature one memorable set piece worth investing into. The film had potential in its premise but it required a tightly-knitted narrative that's devoid of deviations & distractions instead of prioritising cameos & appearances that neither add to the film nor enrich the viewing experience by much. Quite possibly the eyesore of the year.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The multiverse humour is good, although nowhere near as special as the Marvel offerings and Miller is good in his dual roles, as are his supporting cast.

It has everything you may want to see, from comedy, to drama, to high stakes. It has 2 Batmen and 2 Flash! And at least 2 Supermen! And it's an origin story for Flash, so that people who don't know how he got his powers, won't be left wondering! The origin is shown in an interesting and engaging way too. It has everything except dinosaurs!I think it's a genius detail how the story revolves around a can of tomatoes, and around spaghetti. Barry needs to eat to keep his speed, and this is shown. And that there are key points in time that can't be changed. And that Batman is more emotionally mature that Ironman since Batman realizes how bad time-traveling can get, and he wants to avoid it. And that Super Girl is weak compared to Superman and she can't defeat a soldier like Zod. (This was actually a complain in Man of Steel - how can a normal superman defeat a soldier superman? Well, this is addressed here)Something else I respect, is that nothing happens the first time they try it. Flash tests the time-travel before he embraces it. SuperGirl loses to Zod before she gets a second chance. Barry tries and retries on many occasions to get things right, like when he tries to regain his powers. This happened many times and I love it! (This is the movie's message. That sometimes, no matter how many times you can save and load your progress, the damage is done. Food for thought for those who blame themselves, thinking ""what if I could have done this and that?"")Even the cameos are well thought and respectable. We get to see that somewhere in the DC multiverse there's a Nick Cage Superman, that finally fights giant spiders! (For those who don't know, that movie project was abandoned and the producer wanted giant spiders so bad, that he added them in his next movie, Wild Wild West!). For those wanted to see more cameos.. come on, think of the pacing of the movie! Right now every cameo matters. Everything else would be shoehorned and badly received by the majority of the viewers.People complain about bad CGI. To me, it was fine. There are CGI for 90% of the movie and they don't use night-shots as an excuse to cover any flaws. Everything is shows during the day in a colorful and mostly cheerful manner. Also when Barry talks to his younger self, played by the same actor, while the camera moves in a dynamic way... that's seamless. The story is so gripping, it will make you forget about the CGI. (Most ""bad"" CGI is when Barry uses the speed-force, so in my head-canon, it's the speed-force that makes everything look a bit weird.)Even though I have seen many multiverse stories (Xmen, Avengers, Dr. Strange, CW Flash, even the animated Flashpoint), the story here feels fresh. I could say that this is the best multiverse movie I have ever seen, as I couldn't find any plot-holes. (Even the beloved Into The Spiderverse had a massive hole: the Kingpin wanted to change universes, but that doesn't make sense, since it is explained that you will degrade if you go to another universe!)Essentially, this DC multiverse has a smart fail-safe. They can't reuse timetravel often, because every time they do it, the universe is reset for good. The explanation is even better than Rick and Morty! And they even showed it in action since Flash tried over and over to fix something and fails. Very clever!For those who think that DC copied Marvel regarding the multiverse story. DC did it first in the comics, Marvel did it first in the movies. These 2 companies copy each other for over 50 years, but DC did most things first, as it had a 20 year head start. The Flash #123 from 1961and Justice League of America #21 from 1963, ""Crisis on Earth One!"" were the pioneers of this concept. Marvel Comics began in 1961 and their first multiverse story was ""What If? #1"" in 1977.I originally went to see the Flash with my biased glasses on. I don't like most DC movies but I love the DC animated universe (The only DC movies I really enjoyed were Batman '89, Shazam 1 and 2, and Aquaman). I didn't like the Snyderverse and I didn't like Ezra Miller as the Flash. All that said, Ezra Miller did well in this movie and as THEY play 2 roles... it helps getting behind the pronouns thingie!Some people may hate the movie because they hate Ezra Miller. The actions of one, should not be a punishment for everyone else who worked hard on a project. It is unfair to sacrifice the jobs and the future potential of hundreds of people involved in a production, just because of the hatred for single person. Besides, this was DC's only way to reboot their franchise.Flash is crazy awesome, go see it, go have fun!","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

As usual. Supergirl is good too. Even Iris is good and not annoying like the TV actress in the series. The writers were trying so hard to make a comic relief movie with some clever lines and humorous scenes and situations. Like Marvel has succeeded at with Iron Man and Guardians. They failed. I was embarrassed and uncomfortable for them. Truly bad. And that is just the surface. Ezra Miller was literally the worst thing in the movie. Trying so hard to be cute and funny. Not working. Pushing hard l, too hard, to be quirky and likeable. Was it him or the director? Maybe both. Just not happening. What was happening was a really annoying character getting more and more annoying as the film went on. DC has done some terrible casting in some of its movies. Like Affleck for Batman amidst literal petitions not to do it from fans.they should have seen from a screen test or first scene he needed to be replaced. The writing from DC has also been really bad and this movie is no exception. The opening sequence just starts the ball rolling with an unbelievably annoying scenario. BTW this review is irrespective of Ezra Miller's personal problems. He was just bad on his own merits as an actor in this film. As a main character it's enough to destroy a potentially salvageable story. I got through it merely due to laughing, not at the places laughs were intended, but in places where they weren't. If you want to laugh at a B movie level effort with TERRIBLE cgi (compared to what should be available at this budget) check it out but don't expect anything good from the lead.","14 out of 20 found this helpful.

It's good, but it's not the ""greatest comic book movie ever"" like it was promoted for a few months and you gonna see it by yourself soon.Everyone is good in their roles, Ezra Miller, Sasha Calle, Michael Keaton....especially Keaton. I mean he got the scene stealers moments, alongside with Sasha Calle. Ben Affleck probably got the best few minutes as Batman and I mean better than everything he did in the past few of the movies, which is kinda shameful, because he deserved solo movie.The story as you can expect is much inspired by the Flashpoint comics, but there are some big changes of course. Most of the story progression feels fine. Everything with Barry and his mother and the scenes where Affleck's Batman is talking with Barry is great, the humor for me it's hit and miss, the same goes for the VFX.Props to Ezra Miller for portraying two irritating characters, making the younger Barry more irritating and the one we know kinda wiser. There are scenes when you can clearly see that one of the Flash characters it's not Ezra. It's the stunt double with blurred face or just VFX, but it's much noticeable. As a whole the desert scene it's kinda messy in my opinion talking about the effects.Good to see Michael Shannon back. Great actor in great character. Michael Keaton as I said bring the smile to your face every time if you're from the kids grown with his Batman. Sasha Calle is really good addition to the movie. In some scenes her eyes and facial expression just talk by themselves. Speaking about characters, there are some cameos, some of which I guess you already know, some not, I'm not gonna spoil anything, but will say that some feels earned, others just throw there. In the end it's fun, don't get me wrong.It is up there with ""Man of Steel"" and ""The Suicide Squad"" for the best DCEU movie. Like I said it's far from masterpiece, given that we watched ""Across the Spider-Verse"" so soon, it's like watching ""Dungeons & Dragons"" after ""Inception"", both enjoyable, but on a whole different level.Kudos to Andy Muschietti, the man who delivered this movie, after the project got a few other directors, was in works for decades, been in production, halted, rewritten and finally see the light of sun, or maybe I should say was hit by the bold of lightning.And yeah...there is a post credit scene, make of it what you want knowing the recent DC changes.","11 out of 34 found this helpful.

Despite being plagued with controversy after a number of run ins with the law, Ezra Miller makes a welcome return although I'm more used to Grant Gustin as The Flash on TV. Still Ezra Miller was good. If anything, I was more excited to see Michael Keaton return as an older Bruce Wayne/Batman having last appeared in Batman Returns (1992) before Val Kilmer took over the role for Batman Forever (1995).Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller) takes off where he left after Justice League (2017) working with Batman/Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) and Alfred (Jeremy Irons) to save the day by rescuing people and stopping the bad guys. Barry Allen is haunted by the murder of his mother (Maribel Verdu) and the false imprisonment of his father (Ron Livingston) from many years ago. Wanting to correct the past, Barry Allen as The Flash wants to reverse the timeline to save his mother from being killed. Though successful, events are altered with devastating consequences. Barry Allen somehow finds himself thrust into an alternate 2013 in which his parents are alive and through fate Barry runs into his younger self. Both Barry's end up having to team up after General Zod (Michael Shannon) declares war on earth. Trying to recreate the Justice League to stop the invasion, Barry seeks the help of a now reclusive Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) who has retired as Batman. Though in his 70's, Bruce Wayne returns to don the Batsuit to help Barry Allen/The Flash prevent General Zod's invasion. Along the way, they enlist the help of Supergirl (Sasha Calle).I never expected Ezra Miller to make a successful return as Barry Allen/The Flash. I do think this may be has last outing though, given that Warner Bros will be taking DC in another direction.I was very excited to see Michael Keaton return as Batman/Bruce Wayne and he certainly lived up to the hype. I grew up watching Michael Keaton as Batman in Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992). It was a shame Michael Keaton couldn't make another appearance given that he was meant to appear in the now cancelled Batgirl movie.Sasha Calle did well as Supergirl. I'm unsure that she was going to have her own standalone movie or make any other appearances but it doesn't appear likely.It was fantastic to see Michael Shannon reprise his role as General Zod from Man of Steel (2013). He just picked up where he left off and didn't miss a beat.Director Andy Muschetti did a fine job with The Flash and having the multiverse being brought to the big screen.I thought The Flash was a bit slow to start off but once it got going I enjoyed it. Though it doesn't rank as one of my favourites, The Flash was well worth watching and worth the wait.7/10.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

In this movie, Barry uses his power to travel back in time and save his mother from being murdered, but this creates a world where General Zod has returned and there is no other hero to help him. He must team up with a retired Batman (Michael Keaton) and Supergirl (Sasha Calle), his alternate self from another dimension, to restore the timeline and stop Zod.The movie's strongest point is its cast, especially Miller and Keaton, who have great chemistry. Miller brings a lot of charm and humor to Barry, making him a likable and relatable character. Keaton steals every scene he is in as the grizzled and cynical Batman, who still has a spark of heroism in him. He also provides a link to the 1989 Batman film, which is one of the many references and Easter eggs that the movie offers to DC fans. Calle also gives an impressive performance as Supergirl, who has a tragic backstory and a fierce personality. She adds some diversity and female empowerment to the movie, which is otherwise dominated by male characters.The Flash is a mixed bag as a movie, with some strengths and some weaknesses. On the positive side, the movie is funny, fast-paced, and entertaining, with some impressive action sequences and visual effects. The movie also explores some interesting themes, such as the consequences of changing the past, the importance of family, and the concept of multiverse.The movie's weakest point is its plot, which is overly complicated and convoluted. It results in a lack of focus and coherence. The movie also suffers from some inconsistencies and plot holes that are hard to ignore.The movie also has some issues with its tone and style, which varies from scene to scene. The movie also has some uneven visual effects, which range from stunning and realistic to cartoonish and fake.The Flash is a decent but flawed superhero movie that offers some fun and excitement but also some confusion and disappointment. It is not the best or the worst DC movie in recent years, but somewhere in between. It may appeal to fans of the character or the genre, but it may also frustrate or bore others.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Action sequences and visuals are good in general. Funny, both in action and dialogue which made the whole movie fun. Ben Affleck Batman was amazing, loved that he was rugged and not smooth in action. Old Bruce Wayne was good, Batman better than expected because I didn't like him from the trailers. Micheal seemed like a good blend of the two(Batman and bruce wayne), just old. The actors who played the role in my lifetime usually play one side notably better than the other. I didn't expect to like him, I thought he'd just be for those who grew up watching him but he was actually great.Loved super girl, I think she was a scene stealer and she's just as cool as I thought she was gonna be, it was great casting. I liked ezra miller too but she's the highlight for me. Idk how but I'd love to see more of her in the future.I think the first half of the movie was the better just because it's when the movie felt most put together and thought out. After that it's a bit touch and go, yet it still erred on the right side of the line but just about, just enough to be more than tolerable. On a side note I just want to say they were a lot of back camera shots of Flash were his butt stuck out for some reason. It feels unheeding to not mention it because it was notable.I loved each of the cameos, individually, done right but they were one too many especially in the third act. Love interest felt like an extra and didn't really do add much, I didn't think it was explored enough so this was one of the rare occasions I wished they just scrapped her off, at least as a love story.I think the story was decent enough, if you'd never seen a time travel movie before I'd say it's amazing but unfortunately it's a formulaic hence predictable story. I still enjoyed it though and loved that the movie seems to make it a point to let the inspirations to be known. The story also reminds me of Frankenstein monster, but is not horror in any way, it's fun and charming and it's unfortunate it comes out in somewhat no man's land, during the period after Snyder and before Gunn. I feel like it'll garner some hate because of it and split fans. It's hard not to make comparisons with mcu's Dr strange as they have very similar story arcs, Batman warning flash and dr strange warning Spider-Man; exploring the multiverse and changing realities.The pacing changes; it made sense to slow the plot down were instead of moving from one scene to the next, we get to see a little more of who the characters are and come to grips with the story which despite some complexity, I think was well told for the most part; but I wish the thrill went on and on. However I did love the dialogues, didn't feel lazily or hastily written.In the end I wouldn't dare to call The Flash a great superhero movie; it's very messy but it all somehow gels together and works (to me). It's a surprisingly fun because despite evidently being held together by a thread I still enjoyed the movie as a whole. It's always funny because I expect this to get a lot of hate, but everybody in the cinema, albeit in china, seemed to have a blast watching this. I think it's better if you go in wanting to enjoy it and not critic it.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

When his attempt to save his family go awry and inadvertently changes the future, Barry becomes trapped in a timeline where Man of Steel's General Zod is on the precipice of conquering Earth. Utilizing the help of the Barry Allen from this dimension, as well that universe's Batman and Kryptonian, Barry is determined to set straight the tears in the fabric of reality that he himself has created.As far as superhero adaptations go, The Flash is a decent addition. After years of delays with the filming of the movie, saddled with the further baggage of the ill advised actions of its main actor, its end result is a great story hidden within a messy product. After the back-to-back box office failures of Black Adam and Shazam: Fury of the Gods, Warner Brothers looked to The Flash to be the big win that help end the Zack Snyder era while beginning to pave the way for a new regime in storytelling for DC Comics. Sadly, due to a bloated runtime and cripplingly bad visual effects, what could've been a resounding victory for the company ends up being a mid tier movie that fails to cash in on its potential. An interesting premise, a meditation on the fact that even with the greatest power people can't control everything in their lives, is often undercut by late 90s/early 2000s era GCI and oddly placed jokes. With cavalcade of cameos ranging from instantly recognizable to morsels for the fans, The Flash is a serviceable feather in the cap of franchise in the midst of a reorganization but nowhere near the successful product they'd hoped for.The Flash co-stars Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle as Batman and Supergirl, respectively. While seeing Keaton on screen suited up as The Bat again initially thrills, Keaton himself seems to be rarely present in the scene, delivering his lines without any real conviction or sense of purpose. The thrills mostly come from the recreation of the world Tim Burton and his crew directed (along with composer Benjamin Wallfisch's nods to Danny Elfman's score), with Wayne Manor's exterior shots draped in fog and its interior immediately reminiscent of the mansion's expansive room inside viewers came to love from the set design of the first two live action movies. Keaton's presence, while welcoming, is lethargic and lackluster, getting through his lines in order to collect his paycheck.Sasha Calle is the breakout star of the film. As Kara Zor-El, cousin of Superman's Kal-El, her entrance into the film gives the audience a much different look at her arrival on Earth. Harkening back to a well received comic book story of the early 2000s, once Superwoman is able to break out and let loose she dominates the screen with her quiet brooding nature that changes as the story unfolds. A delight to watch, Calle would be a worthy addition to James Gunn and Peter Safrin's upcoming DC reboot.Directed by Andy Muschietti, The Flash was a tall order from the beginning. After a veritably endless carousel of directors walking in and out of the chair, the It and It Chapter 2 helmsman was tasked with picking up the pieces of a number of different ideas and forging them into one unified vision. The end result is a flawed, yet entertaining movie that does a good job at balancing the action with the the character work. While the character work takes a bit of a back seat in the second act, the first and especially the third shows the viewer exactly who Barry Allen is, and the impact of his family on him. Pacing wise, the film wastes little time establishing his whereabouts since last seen in Zack Snyder's Justice League and the titular character attempting to justify to Bruce Wayne his intent to time travel. The story's second act, easily the weakest in the narrative, as well as being interminably long, loses the momentum gathered in the first before having to ramp back up to a fairly strong narrative conclusion. With General Zod being more of a side story than an actual plot device used to propel Barry's story forward, the confrontation between Flash, Zod, and Zod's troops serves as nothing more than a desperate clinging to what came before with Man of Steel.Overall, The Flash is a decent enough superhero film. While there's justifiable frustration at the fact that inside the over convoluted kitchen sink of a story lies a possibly great film waiting to be unearthed, the result the audience is left with is a passable one. It's main star, while being overshadowed by Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle, takes the best of what worked with the character in previous movies and finds ways to continue fleshing him out. A fun enough adventure that pales greatly in comparison to the other multiverse film released a mere two weeks ago, The Flash will likely be remembered more for its controversial lead actor than for the movie itself.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Main Flash costume is great, looks amazing in action. Plenty of action scenes keeping you engaged and the humour lands for the most part. If you're a fan of The Flash character, the use of his speed and VFX are jaw dropping and the costume looks beautiful. Plenty of cool cameos to surprise the audience.CGI is wonky in some places and the pacing of the final act is a bit rushed, drops you straight into it unexpectedly unless you're a comic reader. Stakes don't feel high until right at the very end of the third act.Batfleck was not in this enough and the cameos are fully CGI which looks kinda weird.Shame Ezra is shrouded in controversy as they do such a good job here and it's an excellent movie it makes you want them to come back for more.It's an ode to Flash fans and comic readers, definitely going to watch this a second time in theatres!","17 out of 39 found this helpful.

The Flash is F'n amazing. Like it's one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen. Andy Muschietti (Director) did an amazing job.""Now I'm terrified for the future of the DCU. What was he watching. How low are his standards? Was he ordered by lawyers or his bosses to say that?If Gunn truly thinks this is one of the best superhero movies ever, then I have no faith that he can deliver on an entire franchise, much less one movie.The opening sequence was one of the most ridiculous, convoluted, poorly acted, terrible CGI, jumbled messes I've seen since, well, since the most recent Marvel movies.I thought Keaton's run again as Batman was fantastic. His acting, the Batplane and his story arc were all well done. But I took points away for Affleck's Batgirl, a soap opera Supergirl and Barry's stupid laugh. Keaton was the only redeeming thing about this movie.So bland acting, poor writing and storytelling, lathered in terrible CGI gives this a one star. Keaton, by himself, adds a second. And the future of the DCU in Gunn's hands makes me incredibly nervous.","15 out of 22 found this helpful.

It was a fun experience! While not an incredible masterpiece, the two-and-a-half hours flew by, thanks to a simple yet effective storyline. Surprisingly, amidst the Marvel competition, they managed to carve their own path in the Multiverse narrative.Reluctantly, I admit that Ezra Miller delivered a discreetly brilliant performance, and the chemistry between the two Barrys worked wonders. Kara's presence added an extra spark, but undoubtedly, Keaton's Batman stole the spotlight from everyone.The best outcome of this film would be the return of Keaton as Bruce in a Batman Beyond adaptation. However, let's address the mammoth in the room, the CGI. It's an ENORMOUS problem! It's genuinely terrifying! The initial sequence showcasing Flash's first mission gave me nightmares, and Barry's suit with its flashy lights resembled Reynolds' Green Lantern costume, albeit with a bit more conviction.Honestly, I have no idea where the Gunn universe will go from here. There's a single post-credit scene that was concealed from the press and early screenings, and unfortunately, it's horrendous! It might be the worst aspect of the entire film, and it would have been better if it hadn't been included!All in all, it exceeded my expectations, but it falls short of being the savior of the DC universe.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Loved Michael Keaton's return as Batman. He actually was in a light mood with a bit of a sense of humor. Izra Miller was good in his role as The Flash, legal troubles aside, he played both dual roles of himself very well. I don't know about the girl who played Supergirl though, it just wasn't as strong. Maybe because it was little more than a cameo, and she didn't get to do much except tussle with some guards and Zod. The special effects weren't that great, but the story was well done, even though many people may have multi verse fatique. It was a lot of info to take in with cameos galore, but still fun. A solid 7. Above average in my book.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It feels like they're trying to turn a tanker round but with this film they have got the ship at least going in the right direction. It's not perfect at all and it's too long by at least 30 minutes (they all seem to be too long) but this is a good, if not a great film. Bringing back Michael Keaton's Batman is a real master stroke, his addition adds gravitas and heart to the film. It doesn't feel rushed and rewritten a billion times like the others. Supergirl is a real revelation. I was left wanting to see way more of her. Tbh I'm not sold on Ezra Miller as Flash. He is fun and puts his all into it but as a main character he's too light and throw away so having the extra characters really helps. A big success with this film I felt was that they've finally got the flying right. It's more graceful than powerful and doesn't feel like you're watching a computer game. I was so excited to see this as I'm a huge Burton Batman fan and on the whole I found it entertaining and it also goes all out to please the fans (maybe a little too far) If you're a fan of DC and fed up with the mess of the 'Snyderverse' this should have something for you. Now it's time to get Superman right!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

'The flash' is packed full of colour, heart and of course speed. This guy is fast, like really fast and it's a joy to watch Barry Allen zip around in a storm of fiery lightning.As mentioned, this is not a perfect film - it's true that the CGI is poor in parts, and this can take you out of the experience, however in the vast majority of this film the visual effects are slick and clean. The big boss battle against general Zod's army was particularly striking and wonderfully backed by a rendition of 'salute your solutions' by The Raconteurs.I'd also like to praise the films tackling of 'time travel' and it's consequences. I won't go into detail but I thought it was note worthy to mention that this take on 'time travel' felt a lot more grounded than other films like Avengers Endgame (whose time travel appears to only have minor consequences and so lowers the stakes of the movie).Overall 'The Flash' is a great film to go and see with your friends, it has a little bit of everything (including Michael Keaton's Batman!!) and I was pleasantly surprised with how it all panned out.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

However, it is important to note that a significant amount of the character's journey has occurred off-screen, making this perhaps not the ideal starting point for his saga. The narrative could benefit from further development to fully flesh out this character, making it a potential entry for movie 3 or 4 in his overall arc.Pros: While I won't delve too much into the story itself, I must say that the portrayal of Flash as a character remains true to his essence. The alterations attempted within the comic realm offer a fresh and intriguing retelling of the flashpoint storyline.Cons: The CGI falls short of completion, leaving certain visual elements feeling unfinished. Additionally, despite the heightened anticipation surrounding the cameos, I found them to be underwhelming and not worth the hype.I strongly recommend that viewers watch the Flashpoint animated movie alongside this film. It provides essential context and enhances the overall viewing experience.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I heard this movie had a ridiculous budget, 250 million or something. For that money you would think the cgi would be jaw dropping. It looked like a PS3 cut scene. The time travel effects are cartoonishly terrible. I was in shock. Super girl was ok. Zod was wasted. Keaton was ok but horribly written. Keaton's fight scenes were cool.

There's something that I would save? Probably Micheal Keaton. He's a very good actor and he emanates charisma every time he's on the screen. But the character itself is a bit meh, mainly because he's a side character and so do not expect this big and deep character arc. But his Batman was good.To wrap up I report my initial thoughts right after coming out from the theater: ""if someone asks me if I would prefer to re-watch The Flash or watch any other random movie, I'd probably roll the dices of the random choice"". The Flash was very bad and surely all the production chaos was a big reason why it came out like this. However for those that are able to turn off the brain and enjoy some superhero action with very low expectations, it may be an enjoyable time. But if you don't fall in this category, please do yourself a favor, spare 2 hours of your life to do something more interesting.

-Very diverse, filled with a variety of styles for many to enjoy
-Much of It comes from Miller's selves and the interactions he has often with himself
-Keaton's delivery is spot on and adds elements that are very dry, but fun, feeling like the 90s
-An end credit scene that serves as one of my particular favorite funny moments, alongside some laughs in the fightingThe Sound Editing
-Made for theater quality, it feels like a live action comic book story.-Great blends of actions sounds make the world come to life, the scenes pop, and made me dance with delight at just how immersive it is.-Loved the fact music and sounds mixed well and were edited to stand out.-I could hear everyone talking, no low tone mumbling to require captions or blowing out my ear drums.The Emotional Aspect of The Story
-There are moments where the movie hits hard and helps really give character development.-Barry's story has a lot of emotional connections and I loved the hero's reflection through his eyes.-Those connections, that moral exploration, all was relevant to me and I appreciated the emotional moments that came especially at the end.-Several members in my theater were crying in my showing.The Visuals To Some Degree
-They created a world that is hard to make come to life outside of drawings, but they did some things very well.-I liked the new style of Flash running, part speed, spart slow motion, and part reference to cartoons as they went along.-I liked several of the action moments feeling legitimate and looking real, giving you that D. C. comic feel.-The lightning effects and vehicle moments excellently designed and still showing the details they can make when they put everything together.-Costumes and looks of the villains were impressive to me and do enjoy the details they paid attention to.-Animation mostly flow smoothly, impressive work for this bunch.The Action To Some Degree
-Primarily the opening and midpoint of the movie is my favorite section of action. Here, it's coordinated, creative, and good use of talents that make for exciting moments.-My favorite moments had a bit of edge with stakes, a fantastic fight that has theatrical flair, but mostly choreographed moments.-Loved the blending of comic book with the dark edge of DC in those moments, and in some cases adding an emotional finish that worked for me.The Acting Is Pretty Decent
-Calle did a great job as the edgy Supergirl. She has looks, the feel, and play an emotionally torn edge quite well to go with the dark edge of the movie. Sure, not your typical portrayal, but for the theme of this movie works.-Affleck is fine for when he shows up, but in the brief time, he's the same role he has played with a little more comedic presentation like Whedon had him do.-Miller is much of the film, but impressed with his acting skills still flourishing well. He plays the double role well, and he acts extraordinarily well with the others. Those emotional moments really bringing out his best, while his comedy shows his delivery talents for one-liners that made him famous.The Cinematography
-Brings about the various tones they want and gives you the real life comic edge
-Liked the dynamic movements and shots to give you a maximized outlook that D. C. does well to bring to life.-Enjoyed the unique shots to establish the world, but not lose focus of the moment.-Adds a bit of nostalgia factor in some of the ways when it came to the movie's references, action, and the mind bending concept of the multiverse in this series.Michael Keaton
-My favorite aspect, Keaton returns to the role of Batman with the grace and vibe we love to see in a movie.-I absolutely loved him reprising the role, felt like I returned to the 90s, but with a modern look, as he jumped back into the sarcasm he wielded well.-He takes the character and goes with it, acts so well with just about everyone, and gives me one of my favorite Batmen in the longest time. Absolutely the most balanced and best use of the character for me.DISLIKES:The Story Transitions
--Kind of weak, rushed, and trying to stuff a lot into one story, The Flash struggles to handle the non-emotional moments.-The concept of interacting with oneself becomes more comedic than impactful for me, and really only thrives at the end.-While the Supergirl component is mediocre and feels last minute, sort of thrown a bit extra to include the villain they chose.-Even the big bad thing at the beginning is a tad mediocre and almost forgotten, leading to weaker story elements for me.-Why not more references to some of the other story components given several of the other hints they dropped.-Felt very much like taking shortcuts at various points, perhaps a tad too much editing to fit the time limit, and it was still a bloated film.The Cameos To A Degree
-Most of the cameos are meh in my opinion. I can't say much for some of them, but they almost did nothing for me outside of a few laughs here and there.-Some of the cameos seemed forced and again some sort of calling card or overdone gimmick that I find little need for the story. Thus, I wasn't impressed and would have liked a few others to come into play.-Some of the nostalgia moments managed to help some of the factors, but I just wished I could have had better cameo inclusion.The Action To Another Extent
-Near the end, the fighting got more theatrical and less of the balance I like, leading to very stiff, overdramatic fighting.-It got lost in slow motion fighting sometimes, losing the elements I liked and the coordination, again, very shortcut feeling and boring.-And especially the big finish... it was okay, very bloated, mundane, and cheesy in my opinion, but helped by the emotional aspect of the story.Double Ezra Sometimes Annoying
-The double dynamic became a big focus of the movie, and it only worked for me at times.-The comedy got a bit too much for me, getting annoying, stale, and constantly bantering to bloat the film.-It's not that these growth weren't necessary, but just went too long and I would have liked a little more curbing to help use the time better in my opinion.-Ezra's quirks are fun at times, but again, others needed more moments to shine in order to maximize their inclusion.The Visuals Go Fake At Times/Ridiculous
-The movie's biggest meh for me, is some of the visuals and just what they can't still accomplish that other studios do better.-An opening scene shows one of these, going a tad too far for me to be impressed with the visuals, lost in the ridiculous nature of the scene.-In the time moments, these are fake and rough, needing a little more finesse to polish things up.-This happens several times and thus, WB still has some work to do to blow my mind with the consistent visuals that I've seen.The VERDICT:
The Flash is one of the better movies of this universe that I have enjoyed in a long time. It's fun, funny, collected, and does a lot of things in the 150 minute run-time. I think the emotional moments are touching, I think the character journey makes sense and is deeper than a lot of movies, and I think the movie has some better balance than I expected. Action wise it works on levels, with the hero for me being Keaton's who steals almost every scene with the direction they took and him making it come to life. But, the movie is very inconsistent, dropping quality and balance at times to fit something off for me. Near the end, the things I liked mostly burned away, and the speed of the movie rushed through things and dropped the action to more theatrical finishes. Not the worst thing, but, also not the best, alongside animation and character inclusion that still needed more finish and touch-ups. I guess a director's cut will come soon enough to rectify this, but... for now, my scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5

I mean really cry. And it was very satisfying on so many levels. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I really love it. I love the acting, the plot. The dialogue, the character development. Everything about this movie was perfect. I heard negative reviews about why this movie is bad and I just don't understand how. The thing that I don't like about DC comic movies is this gritty, dark atmosphere. Which this movie had too. I like the bright and glossy feel of the marvel movies. That's the only thing I wish that was different. The character development and extras were also amazing.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Ezra Miller is great playing the two different Flash characters, the plot has a lot of heart and Warner Bros threw everything at this one in terms of their DC properties. Seeing Michael Keaton as Batman again gave me goosebumps and the nostalgia factor is dialled up to 11, but done right. I often find that action sequences can become quite repetitive and boring, but in The Flash they manage to pull them off without the film getting too bogged down with smashy crashy nonsense. An excellent entry in to the DCEU, more like this please.","18 out of 42 found this helpful.

On one hand I absolutely loved the barrage of surprise cameos, on the other I'm unsure if such expanded universe would survive. In all honesty I'm thoroughly entertained by the catastrophic battles, but was that the best glass-shattering effect a 3-billion-dollar production could depict? For one I absolutely loved the ground-breaking presence of Supergirl, yet should we pass on the red cape this soon after Henry's dismissal?Out of all superheroes whose dedications sprout from childhood trauma, Flash is the only one competent of trimming it, which poses him a much harder choice. Miller's portrayal of the ""Barry""s is phenomenal, let along the controversy, at times a careless urchin while the next scene the poorest child forced to bereave himself. The story is good - after all it's based on one of the most evocative DC comic - and the ending is actually quite enticing. As an entertainment, The Flash is beyond decent, yet in terms of ""changing the course of DCU"", it just isn't enough.DC, you have renounced Snyder's Superman, you may do so with Batman, but can you please not take away his Wonder Woman? I seriously can't think of an actress capable of replacing Gal Gadot.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The only good acting was Michael Keaton the forever true live physical Batman. Just look at his 89 & 91 portrayals. I will also say that the work for George Reeves and Christopher Reeve as well as as Helen Slater were incredibly realistic. If DC was trying to duplicate Dr Stranger's Multiverse. They failed spectacularly simply by not including any number the Arrowverse or Smallville shows. Then there's this pathetic excuse for a Barry Allen. No acting skills and well as a crappy looking suit. He was more suited for Impulse. To call him Barry wasn't just wrong but insane. Barry Allen the most powerful honorable super-speedster. Now I never claim to be a fan of DC Comics other than for the GLantern-Family Hawk-Family Bat-Family and of course the Flash-Family. To see this film made me die alittle inside.

I liked the chemistry between him and his younger self. It was an interesting concept to explore, what would it be like if you met a younger version of yourself? You would probably find yourself annoying. The humor for the most part was done well. The action scenes were enjoyable too.Michael Keaton was good as Batman. Seeing him kick ass was fun but I felt like there was no real reason to bring him back besides nostalgia bait. His character already had a story arc and it wasn't like the Andrew Garfield spiderman where he redeemed himself. At this point I am kind of bored of seeing Batman. It's a flash movie but they need batman to attract viewers.Supergirl was alright, she didn't really do much but she had some cool fight scenes. I would've liked to see her character have more development.The biggest problem with the movie is the CGI. I was expecting a multiple million dollar blockbuster would have better CGI. Some of the effects looked like PS5 graphics. Some scenes looked cartoonish. I'm not a big fan of how much CG they put on the Flash's suit. The whole multiverse/different timeline thing was a bit confusing and seemed like the writers didn't really defined clear rules of how it works but rather just used it as plot convenience so they don't have to explain much.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Lately, being excited to see a movie has usually left me disappointed and have to say the opening sequence left me worried. I like the 'fun' side of The Flash but it was borderline silly and the CGI was not good. I stuck with it and have to say it did bring me back in.Miller, setting aside all their off-screen issues, does a great job. In fact the whole cast, without exception give superb performances. Keaton's performance and his story were the highlight for me.Some multi super hero movies have felt like they're cramming in too much complex plot and end up being messy and confusing with a feeling of being overly long. But I felt The Flash did a great job of keeping it simple, considering it tackles time travel and multiverse.I like the dark stuff in DC, so I had to accept this was going to be more tongue in cheek and fun, just accept it don't think too much about technicalities or plot holes. It's supposed to be fun and it's multi-verse time travel - let's not get overly bogged down in 'well that wouldn't happen'Some of the CGI seemed unnecessary, so when it was bad I wonder why they bothered. Just keep it practical. My biggest criticism is the CGI - it risks taking you out of the film when it doesn't look good. But stay for the plot and the performances.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

Anticipation was high, and expectations even higher, considering the potential of the character and the rich source material available. However, upon finally watching the movie, I was met with a sinking feeling of disappointment that echoed long after the credits rolled.One of the most glaring issues that plagued the film was its lackluster pacing. The narrative seemed to rush through crucial plot points without allowing the audience to fully grasp their significance. Scenes that required emotional depth were glossed over in favor of flashy action sequences, leaving character development hanging by a thread. The movie's breakneck speed was ironically fitting for a film centered around a speedster, but it ultimately detracted from the story's impact.Speaking of characters, the ensemble cast that had so much potential was squandered. Ezra Miller's portrayal of Barry Allen was endearing, but the script failed to explore the depths of his character. The emotional turmoil and personal struggles that make the Flash such a relatable and intriguing hero were brushed aside in favor of witty one-liners. Even the supporting characters like Iris West and Cyborg were given disappointingly little screen time, robbing them of the chance to truly shine.The villains, a crucial aspect of any superhero film, were equally lackluster. The film's decision to incorporate multiple antagonists seemed like a recipe for disaster from the start. Instead of allowing one villain to take center stage and truly challenge the Flash, the audience was bombarded with a confusing mishmash of motives and backstories. The potential complexity of these villains was sacrificed for convenience, resulting in a forgettable rogues' gallery that failed to leave a lasting impression.Visual effects and action sequences, while visually appealing, couldn't save the film from its narrative shortcomings. The relentless barrage of CGI-laden scenes often overshadowed the story's emotional beats, leaving me feeling detached from the characters' struggles. The movie seemed more concerned with showcasing its impressive visuals than with delivering a coherent and engaging plot.Another point of disappointment was the missed opportunity to explore the multiverse concept in depth. The film's title promised a journey through time and alternate realities, yet the execution felt superficial at best. The multiverse should have been a narrative playground, but instead, it became a convoluted mess that left me scratching my head rather than marveling at the possibilities.Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of the ""Flash"" movie was the squandering of potential. The character of Barry Allen is a fascinating one, with decades of comic book history to draw upon. The film could have delved into his personal struggles, his relationships, and his evolution as a hero. Instead, it settled for a shallow portrayal that failed to capture the essence of the Scarlet Speedster.In conclusion, the ""Flash"" movie left much to be desired. With its rushed pacing, underdeveloped characters, forgettable villains, and missed opportunities for narrative depth, it fell far short of what it could have been. As a fan of the source material and the superhero genre as a whole, it pains me to say that this film was a disappointment. Here's hoping that future adaptations will learn from these mistakes and give the Scarlet Speedster the treatment he truly deserves.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

C. comics. Also all the other D. C. comics. After I grew out of that juvenile age I lost it interest in comics. I've seen a few of the movies and TV revisions over the years. Some have been good, some not so much purely as self contained stories.I still am bemused that so many older people take comics (and their film representations) so seriously. The genre is escapism, fantasy, imaginative story telling. Not heavy, deep mythos with existential meaning or depth psychology archetypal symbology. Taken as such is a facile shortcut to a deeper philosophical understanding of the patient subject matter.Of course, comic and script writers have posed as mythologist, but the results are often shallow and superficial. And treating these comic and film writers as more than financially motivated story tellers is simplistic. No doubt they do their best and have pride in their work. But the intent is to sell.The comic derived films are best as pure entertainment. As much as the Indiana Jones type franchises. Reading reviews here, so many are obsessed with connecting the dots between all the other comic and film iterations of these characters and their previous stories. A pure linear, analytical approach. And nit picking at the technical minutiae of the presentation rather than focus on the evolving action as it embodies the story arc. If a visual glitch or blurred image detracts too much then you have lost focus on the story.A captivating story should be enjoyable as it is shown not in how it does or doesn't relate to other stories and characters of the same franchise 'multiverse.'I think that the movie taken as such in isolation was good. Not great. It got bogged down too much with quasi scientific babble intended to connect the dots with other iterations of the franchise. Meant purely to satisfy the hard core comic fans of the franchise.There were some interesting twists and unexpected plot turns. The comedy element was ok but maybe overdone. Having two Flash characters at the same time interacting and with opposite personalities was a clever premise, and the transition from slacker Barry to responsible Flash was a solid plot point.The Batman story and the rationale for the team up was set up solidly. But the Lebowski-esque Bruce Wayne suddenly reverting back into the grim crime fighter was overdoing the credibility of the idea.Maybe I'm way out of the loop. But what happened to Kryptonite? How was the imprisoned Kryptonian girl kept enslaved? That vulnerability had always been a critical element in the Superman/Kryptonian stories. .The family dynamics storyline grounded the movie, but seemed a little too soap opera-ish.I was entertained enough watching the movie on it's own without having to check off how it did or didn't conform to franchise criteria. Obviously the multiple Batman actors and clips of previous Superman and other franchise actors was intended to close the multiverse loop. I think it did so adequately enough, though possibly it could have been done a bit longer.I still have hundreds of vintage D. C. Silver Age comics. I would love to see an authentic recreation of that part of the multi verse. Not as retroactively re-envisioned, with a ton of revisionist political correctness. Just the pure imaginative stories and characters living authentically in their own era. Without the compelling urgency to make them 'relevant' to whatever demographic is chosen to be the target audience.To me, these comic adaptations are taken way too seriously. Too much emotional investment and commitment to the comic genre, looking for purity and conformity and evaluating the movie based on those criteria.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The characters are likable on their own and even more together. I do have to add some of the visual work could be better for a film of that rank and specially competing with some other recent films in the same genre, but where the visuals may lack in some areas, they are jaw dropping in others. Overall a good experience and a definite recommend for any fan of old, recent and new DC films and series.","22 out of 54 found this helpful.

Only the return of Michael Keaton as the Batman of my lost teen years (and a few minutes of Gal Gadot as WW) made it worthwhile, and even he couldn't do much with the needed another draft script.

Barry uses his powers to travel back in time to try to save his family but ends up in a timeline that has no super heroes. General Zod (Michael Shannon) returns to face Flash, Batman (Michael Keaton), and Supergirl (Sasha Calle). In the current timeline the Flash is told by Ben Affleck's Batman not to mess with the timeline but he immaturely does not listen. Henry Cavill, Jeremy Irons and Gal Gadot have brief cameos one last time since James Gunn is taking over the DC Universe. I believe he is one of the reasons why the movie failed at the box office, besides that it took too long since it was released from production costing the studio way more than anticipated to the point that they had to put the attention on Keaton because of Miller's bad public relations. Ron Livingston and Maribel Verdu played Barry's parents in both timelines. I personally liked the movie, I could care less about Miller, but seeing Keaton as Batman was well worth it. The movie didn't have the best CGI but having to see George Reeves, Helen Slater, Adam West, and Christopher Reeve along with Nicholas Cage at the Flashpoint was well worth the price of admission. I would say this was one of the better DC movies released lately. Loved the twist at the end but don't bother sitting through the credits, the end scene was pointless.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

Michael Keaton's return as Batman is a highlight of the film, bringing a mature and experienced take on the iconic hero. Ezra Miller is another standout as the grown-up Flash, effectively conveying the character's geeky charm and quick-wittedness. The music is also commendable, adding to the film's overall tone.The pacing of The Flash is well done, ensuring that the story moves along at an engaging speed without feeling too rushed or bogged down. That said, there are some negatives worth noting. The Other Barry Allen character can be frustratingly annoying, detracting from the overall experience. Not all of the humor works either, though it's not a major focus of the film.The action scenes revolving around Batman are mostly created using CGI, which can sometimes feel less impactful than practical effects. However, given Michael Keaton's age, it's understandable why this choice was made.Overall, The Flash earns a 6.5/10 score. Despite its flaws, it remains an enjoyable film that fans of the superhero genre may appreciate. If nothing else, it's worth seeing Michael Keaton's return as Batman.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A big chuck of the audience will probably like it and there will be others who will probably just see another average forgettable film. I'm with the later on this, although it isn't totally void from the memory box due to the nostalgia of Michael Keaton returning as the dark knight. I'd say it's more colourful and kid friendly type of superhero film in comparison to the recent film 'The Batman'. Weirdly this film excels best bang in the middle where Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) must locate The Batman of a different time line, a Batman of age from Tim Burtons 89 Batman film. It opens with outstanding cinematography where the Flash is contacted by Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) asking for Barry's assistance on a mission. Using slow motion to clarify the speed of The flash as if time stood still, some effective shots are displayed although they are of course very far fetched for humorous purposes . Juxtaposed we have Ben Affleck's Batman on a bat pod similar to what we saw in Nolan's movies chasing down some goons with again immaculate shots of the highest level.Ezra Miller despite having much controversy surrounding his personal life evokes the role showing his potential conveying two different personas. It's the Ezra Miller show alongside (Michael Keaton) that keeps the viewer fully engaged. Later on we get (Sasha Calle) and (Michael Shannon) returning as General Zod (Man of Steel) however neither seem to get the amount of screen time they need to make any real impact on the picture. The opportunity to explore alternate DC universe films is an interesting concept with the highly recognised Christopher Reeves having acknowledgement, as well as Superman projects that never got past development stages such as Tim Burtons version of what would've been a Nicolas Cage Superman. Ultimately this is a film about Barry Allen though and focuses on his journey to go back in time and save his mother. The main villain is never really the obstacle Barry has to overcome, instead his biggest enemy is himself.The script has moments of heartfelt emotion although many of the jokes feel awkward at times to me and rather forced; yes comedy is the most difficult genre when trying to please a wide range of audience members. Like most comic book movies as of late the end feels rather dragged out bringing an epic battle that outstayed its welcome. With endless video game like lives The Flash is able to go back again and again leaving a rather messy script carrying very little weight, meaning or even point to it! All in all the point of it all is in the tagline to an extent, ""some things aren't meant to be fixed!"" Yet this feature is far from flawless leaving me thinking if only Andy Muschietti had a little more time to work on the ending and finally fix what he started.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I've heard he has some baggage and outside issues, but he is very likable in this role and a fine young actor. It is a treat seeing the cameos, and I was really happy seeing Michael Keaton returning as Batman.The only negative I have is that this whole Metaverse thing was done already in Spiderman no way home. There is no escaping the fact that this seems very much like the Marvel version of that. I greatly enjoyed No way home so for me thats not a bad thing, but in terms of originality this isn't a first.

I'm really looking forward to what DC has up their sleeve with future projects especially if they are this entertaining. Without a doubt the best part of the movie was Michael Keaton. I haven't been a huge fan of Miller's Barry but this was the most likeable I've seen him yet. The pacing was great. May have to go see it again.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I went into it expecting the worst. What I got was one of the funniest, fun superhero films I've ever seen.Now I won't lie. The film does have issues. The special effects are kind of weird. The story was a little messy. Some parts are unintentionally hilarious. Though what surprised me is I was laughing with the movie far more than I was laughing at it. A lot of the comedy was intentionally hilarious. They should have advertised the comedy more. It's by far the best element. I'm so used to the comedy in superhero films being lame and distracting.The movie is a lot of fun too. All the actors look like they're having a ball (except Michael Shannon who looks almost disappointed to be there). It's clear this was meant to be a fun fan service movie first and foremost. If you think about it too much, you're going to have a bad time. Now I'm not saying you need to turn your brain off. Just know that you can nitpick any part of this movie if you really want to lessen your enjoyment of it. But the movie does a fairly good job of making some of the more fantastical elements sound plausible if you're willing to suspend your disbelief a little. I honestly expected far more stuff to be handwaved by the film, like why Michael Keaton is suddenly Batman.I'd recommend it if you want a fun superhero movie that focuses heavily on the comedy. If you want something more serious, this isn't it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Like just watch the movie and see Ezra as Barry and not Ezra. A lot of fun action scenes in the movie. In those action scenes I will say that Batman is very fun to watch and is fluid to watch and is iffy in cgi. If you are looking for a pretty good comic movie I would recommend the flash.

It can only be described as truly dreadful. The plot is incredibly awkward, leaving viewers feeling perplexed and unsatisfied. What truly stings is that it tarnishes the cherished memories of those who held the original Flashpoint story in high regard. The CGI effects are horrible, the acting is subpar, and the twist in the narrative is outright ludicrous. It pains me to say that watching this film was an incredibly disheartening experience. I am left pondering a single, simple question: What compelled the filmmakers to deviate so badly from the brilliance of the original animated Flashpoint story? It is truly disconcerting to witness such a misguided adaptation.","25 out of 42 found this helpful.

The relationship between Barry and his powers, the maturity of his final decision to undo the time manipulation he undertakes, and the alternate versions of classic characters all make that story an epic tale and one that would translate so well to the big screen.The Flash has none of that in any good capacity. The writing in this film is infantile, trying to be funny constantly and delivering on none of it. The incessant CGI looks horrible. The movie seems to be a pasting together of meme content from around the internet in a hope to arouse interest.Let's start with the writing. To give a good look at how they wrote this film, let's concern ourselves with the pivotal line: ""Not every problem has a solution. Sometimes you just need to let go."" This is spoken by Barry's mother to him as he tries to complete MATH HOMEWORK. How dumb can it get? That's horrible advice for a child doing math homework, it's unnatural to talk like that, and it's so obvious what the writers are actually getting at with the line, including their intention of bringing the line back later. To add to it, Barry has the audacity to accuse another character's entry line as being rehearsed. The other problem with the writing is that it is obsessed with shoehorning jokes and leaving spaces for audience laughter. My theater was silent throughout. The gags are borderline slapstick, and Barry Allen, a supposedly smart, witty scientist superhero, seems to be living with Roger Rabbit and taking speech cues from him.Next, the CGI. Avatar: The Way of Water just wowed us with how fantastic a movie can look. The Flash seems to believe that immersive visuals are an option. Every other shot had at least one actor fully replaced with CGI, and seeing as there are two characters played by the same actor in most of this movie, that's a SERIOUS PROBLEM. The first scene with the two of them looked really good; I don't know why the quality took a nosedive from then on. Every bit of CG face looked like it was constructed from clay, and I couldn't help but think about how Red Dead Redemption 2 looked more lifelike than this motion picture.The writers and producers of this film seemed to think that what the world needed, as a response to such multiversal entries into popular culture as the Spiderverse movies and Godzilla, was Nicholas Cage as Superman. Of course, Nicholas Cage doesn't really make an appearance in the movie, but a CGI version of his likeness based on the decades-old rumors of him donning the red cape disgraces the screen in a cringe-inducing cap to the climax of the film. Memes everywhere, as if that's how you should write a movie.I was really hoping for a bit of greatness here. I have been disappointed for years with Snyder's terrible butchering of solid characters, and I was even willing to look past the few minutes we have with the fake Batman we've had from the DCEU. Unfortunately, Affleck was one of the better parts of The Flash. He managed to not go murdering everybody like he's done in the past (not Batman), and his acting and action were pretty solid. Another hero that kept me in my seat was Cara-El, written and acted rather competently, especially compared to our protagonists.5 out of 10. Go see it if you LOVE Michael Keaton in the suit, but don't expect to see him doing any karate chopping. They leave all that difficult stuff to the computers.","64 out of 120 found this helpful.

In fact The Flash's CGI is even worse that WW84, it's downright shockingly bad.I don't understand WB. I trash talk Black Adam and Shazam 2, but both of those films are better than this cheese ball of a movie.

The marketing on the film made it look like it was going to be the end all be all of superhero films. It is far from it. I am not a fan of The Flash but I do think that Ezra Miller was a good fit as Barry Allen/ Flash as part of a ensemble cast as in Justice League. Ezra Miller is not bad in this film but his character is so jokey and and annoying that it gets tiring. The premise of this film is that The Flash goes back in time to fix an event in the past but causes an alternative reality without metahumans. That's it. If course the selling point if this film is the appearance of both Ben Affleck and Michal Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne. This really isn't a spoiler because all of the trailers showed them. I was not a fan of Ben Aleck's Batman, but here he is pretty good but it's really just a cameo. Michal Keaton dies get more screen time and his performance is probably the best element in the film. The truth is that it is pure nostalgia and Keaton does a good job with what he's given. The problem is that it works only as nostalgia, nothing more. The film is called The Flash, you would think that the secondary character wouldn't overshadow the main character but Batman dies overshadow The Flash. The character is too annoying to care very much for him. Another problem is that with the whole multiverse tripe the story isn't as compelling as it should be. Michael Shannon returns as General Zod and is a completely weak villain this time. Not menacing at all.There are so many callbacks and nostalgia moments that the story takes a backseat. I have no problem with nostalgia and fan service, but when it's the best part of a film,The problem with this film and so many films in comic book hero films these days is that they are big, loud but completely forgettable. Its incredible that a film with such a large budget could be so averageNot horrible, but painfully average.Grade: C.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

My Silver Age memories of the character as a stalwart but brainy, clean-cut All-American were dashed by the current re-imagining as a clumsy, insecure geek. That being said, Miller's acting in this movie was impressive, playing two versions of Barry Allen in scenes ranging from slapstick humor to sensitively emotional. He turned in a very good performance.Michael Keaton's portrayal as an alternate universe Batman was a brilliant piece of casting and solidified his oft-referenced claim ""I'm Batman "". He truly embodies the role.Much has been made of the CGI being poor quality. Honestly, it looked okay to me but I generally rate movies on plot and acting and don't pay close attention to visual gimmicks. The action scenes looked good and I could at least tell what was going on. I've seen other comic book movies where that wasn't the case.Near the end of the movie there are nostalgic references to other iterations of DC characters over the decades. It attempts to explain how these various versions of the same characters exist in different parts of the multiverse. It's a fun and logical device that sets the groundwork for the coming DC Cinematic Universe.In conclusion, this movie may not be high art or faithful to the Flashpoint storyline, but it has action, a coherent story, humor and pathos. A good movie-going experience.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

Apart from making an aspect of the multiverse clearly defined with spaghetti, which worked fantastically, there's not much that can be considered new ideas that haven't been already explored in recent years. Even so, the fulcrum aspect of the multiverse they tried to show ends up just a setup for world-building and not properly utilized at all, considering how the movie ends up and how it dealt with paradoxes. Ezra Miller is the heart of the movie and now I do see why some critics criticized that aspect because of his real-life persona. There's an automatic apprehension to root for the character because his face reminds you of real life. But still, when the movie really engages you, that doesn't become too much of a problem.The action set pieces are conceived wonderfully, as the use of the environment with the action looks quite novel but the CG work is very inconsistent. It did give some amazing action setpieces with a couple of characters and actors that were amazing to watch even though it kind of gave a feeling that there's something unrefined about it as a whole. A lot of the action in the movie looks kind of like video-game cutscenes but they have designed the visual keeping that in mind and tried to integrate that into a visual style which is not too bad and made it enjoyable but there were still some scenes that were a little bit too shoddy.The cameos could have been done in a better way or at least the choice of usage of some of it in the way it was presented could've been better. It also made it feel like some other cameos should've been there which could've been easier and more appropriate.There are also a couple of absolutely mad cameos that like most cameos didn't have much to do with the film but leave the audience dumbfounded with the audacity with which they brought them and I'm all for it.Supergirl didn't really have much to do here but Michael Keaton's Batman shined even within his limited scope in the movie. Even with all the cast of characters the film firmly belongs to Ezra Miller and he has done a great job of it. At the end of it, The Flash is a very entertaining movie but could have been way better if they would've taken a little bit more risks and had better CG work.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Finally is DC nailing the ironic and humorous take on their heroes. Perfect balance of action, drama and be ready - tons of humor spread throughout the story. I caught my self laughing with tears in my eyes till the end. Don't listen to the naysayers on this one, trust me you'll have a blast with both new and ""old"" DC characters. And hats off to the Flash. Bravo DC for hiring the right director and writers. Keep it up!The story is actually moving on a deeper level regarding appreciating your parents, and that's a story that never gets old. Supergirl is stoic and well cast - and bringing Batman-89 back on the screen gave me the really good chills. Wanted the movie to last for one more hour, and that's a rarity with superhero-movies these days. I'd say Marvel watch out, if this fresh take on the DC Universe continues... Finally you got it right DC.Even though the CGI is lacking in places, the fun, moving and creative story makes it a 10/10. Go watch it on the big screen tonight!","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

But when I finally saw the movie, it only got interesting when Keaton came into the picture.Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) discovers he can run back in time, and decides to stop his mom from being murdered. But unwittingly creates a paradox in his world.Ezra Miller does well in the dramatic parts, but when it came to the funny moments, it simply goes in really annoying silly moments, that make ask what is this, I mean some of the funny moments with him worked in Justice League (2017), but really goes over the top here. The effects are just too over the top, some parts good, others just too cartoony. Now Michael Keaton coming back as Batman for me, is the saving grace here, and Supergirl ( Sasha Calle) also bring some enjoyment to this.The ending to this, gives me little hope for any future DC movies to come. But let's see what the future holds.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It has its flaws, plenty of them in fact, but for the most part it is a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging experience.The story at its core is very good, following Barry Allen as he seeks to 'fix' the past, which proves to have significant effects on reality as he knows it. It zips along at a decent pace and is full of great humour (easily the funniest superhero film in a while across DC and Marvel). I do think there are some superfluous characters added in and a few too many meaningless cameos, which detract from the fact that the story stands on its own quite well!In an attempt to separate the person from the performance, I must say Ezra Miller is fantastic in this. They play two versions of Barry that bounce off of each other so well, and they really do make the film.I also think the whole thing has quite a nice energy to it. It is tongue in cheek and fun and just has an entertaining vibe to it.My major gripe though is that this film is just too effects heavy, and they aren't particularly good effects either. The opening sequence is laughably bad and looks more like a video game cut scene, as does everything in the speed force. I don't mind a film being effects heavy, especially a superhero film as that is par for the course, but when they are this bad it really does break the immersion in the experience.Another gripe would be that all of the action is very messy. It is shot in a way that is very disorientating and it never feels particularly fresh or engaging. Aside from a couple of cool Batman sequences, there really isn't anything to write home about where the action is concerned, which is a real disappointment.I do also think the film never really manages to find its emotional core. The script is too eager to find its next gag instead of building emotion and real stakes, which just seems like a real missed opportunity. There are glimpses into the more emotional story that this could have been, but they aren't enough.After a slightly shaky start I found myself really enjoying this film. It's messy, sure, and is riddled with bad CGI, but these problems never really get in the way of what is otherwise a pretty entertaining experience.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

And then the movie, originaled directed by Zack Snyder, was a disaster. Even with the many attempts to restore that cinematic universe, nothing concrete was reached (the Gunn anouncments are still far from see the light). But in the middle of all this chaos, The Flash continued in development, even with the massive tornado of chaos and crazyness called Ezra Miller remaining on the leading role. Came the hype, and I don't bought that hype (Tom Cruise watched the movie and loved? Marketing to me). After all this years of MCU, we are more than tired of knowing that the expectation is the mother of disappointing. And then the bad critics came out... Ahh, but I'm a person who likes to see to believe, to see to criticize with my own voice, and damn... Tom Cruise was right! The Flash is one of the best super-heroes movie ever, with a beginning that reminded me of a good episode of Justice League Unlimited focused on the Flash, and it developed spectacularly, and I hope to see Ezra Miller back on the role, they is amazing on the character. Ah! One more thing. A little spoiler... I REALLY WANT GEORGE AMAZING CLOONEY BACK ON THE NEW DC UNIVERSE! No more.

His only hope to stop him rests in the hands of a retired Batman, an imprisoned Kryptonian, and an alternate version of himself.Finally, the Scarlet Speedster got his big screen solo outing and it's everything that I wanted it to be: fun, heartfelt, thrilling, and even refreshing. Andy Muschietti never directed a superhero or an action movie before, but he surely knows how to direct a scene, he has the potential and I honestly can't wait for more. My excitement paid off since this is my most anticipated superhero movie of the year. Barry's story arc is truly the heart of this movie, running into his younger self makes him realize at the end and just accept the grief of the incident that took his mother also his growth becoming more mature. Despite all the ongoing controversies that still surround him, Ezra Miller is undoubtedly talented and showed their acting range, playing two versions of the character that have distinct personality from each other. Miller's performance proves once again that the actor is still worthy to play this iteration of the Fastest Man Alive.It hurts me that we may never get a chance to see Batfleck kicking arse in his solo flick, even if this is his last appearance as the Caped Crusader, he definitely reminded me how badass he was and still is in that intense opening sequence. Michael Keaton is back, and the same goes for him if this is indeed his swan song, he absolutely will leave a mark on both old and new fans' hearts. I don't have much to say about Sasha Calle performance (she's gorgeous tho), she nailed it regardless. Too bad it's probably one and done for her as Supergirl. For a movie that relies heavily on CGI and a budget is around 200 million dollars, it's hilarious how it looks unpolished, sure some are great but also some are just laughably bad. The third act is a bit overwhelming yet surprisingly awesome.The Flash is an ambitious time-travel extravaganza that serves its fans with unexpected cameos, it's big in terms of scope and scale. Agree to disagree, The Flash is one of the better DCEU movies in recent years.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Everyone thinks SFX is the worst part of the movie but it's actually the writing. Direction is bad and choppy with the movie and the end result is a chaotic mess. Why they had to drop Superman from the movie and rather bring on an entirely new character? When Marvel did multiverse they didn't just drop their established characters but DC just took the multiverse idea and went haywire. Now it's a pattern with DC that they will bring new characters in big projects and they don't have the skill to introduce them in a way that can impact the storyline positively.

The Flash now serves as one of the Snyder-verse's final movies in 2023, a eulogy for Zack Snyder's era of DC but also, strangely, for all of the comic book to cinema adaptations. The outcome is disorganized and odd. It's a cheerful, carefree movie that is overtaken by corporate hagiography and serves as a commendation for a number of films that fizzled out.Given everything, the worst thing The Flash could accomplish is feel tedious. The movie's two-and-a-half-hour runtime does, however, go along at a commendable pace. Given that it features one of the most complicated stories in a recent run of superhero movies that are dreadfully lacking in multi-versal explanation, this is even more astounding. Christina Hodson's script keeps the story firmly focused on its protagonist's emotional journey and treats the finer points of its metaphysical world-building as flavor, an excuse to do some extremely comic book things, even though it lacks the clarity or resonance of, say, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.Barry Allen is briefly reintroduced in the opening as a full-time forensics lab analyst and occasional Justice League on a personal quest to exonerate his father, Henry, who has been wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of Barry's mother, Nora. When Barry finds out that the last significant potential breakthrough in his dad's case would not clear him, the narrative really gets going. In a moment of despair, Barry learns that if he runs quickly enough, he can outrun the speed of light and go through time, where he may view history in a ring of space-time he refers to as ""the chronobowl."" Barry resolves to time travel in order to stop his mother's death and his father's imprisonment, disobeying Batman's caution about the dangers of changing history.The Flash is a buddy comedy in which Barry teams up with a younger, more annoying version of himself from the past. Despite this angst-filled premise, director Andy Muschietti cleverly infuses the movie with a Looney Tunes sensibility, reintroducing Barry in one of the funniest opening sequences in a superhero film to date.The majority of the movie takes place in a new timeline that Barry invents, where the choice to save his mother has repercussions that threaten to destroy the DC film universe's very foundations: General Zod makes an appearance, just like he did in 2013's Man of Steel, but this time there is no one to stop him. Batman, the character portrayed by Michael Keaton in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman and its sequel, is the only known superhero in this reality, and Barry is compelled to reenact his superhero origins with his younger self.At this point, The Flash ceases to be a movie and transforms into a number of other things, some of which are downright cynical. Making Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman the main supporting character in the movie is obviously an act of nostalgia, but Keaton does a good job in the part. The Flash, however, doesn't stop there. Like Barry, the filmmakers go too far, too fast, and too crazy, almost losing control of their movie in a jumbled mess of meta-commentary and eulogy as they reflect on the history of DC movie adaptations as well as the Snyder-verse, which started it all and is soon to come to an end.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

An overblown third act, CG overload, awful cameos and a villain ripped straight from a video game are all here and accounted for but it's also funny and fast paced film with a really solid emotional core.This is easily Ezra Miller's best performance as Barry Allen/The Flash. Thanks to the multiple performances the film can have it both ways, still indulging in the constant quips that can be grating in the younger Barry but wisely balancing it against the older Barry who has to mature and mentor his younger self.Michael Keaton is the best part of the film. He returns to the role like he never left and even though its nowhere near as rewarding as his previous two outings he still gets enough to do, is funnier than before and has a standout fight that makes up for him spending the third act almost exclusively in the cockpit.Sasha Calle doesn't get a lot of screen time, coming into the film quite late but thankfully she's more than capable of leaving a lasting impression, bringing both the stoicism and hopefulness to the character. Its a shame the film makes it pretty clear she won't return because she deserves to.Andy Muschietti's direction is bold at best and bland at worst. The title reveal is delightfully playful and the film isn't afraid to embrace the abilities of its characters leading to some inventive shots but also means a lot of it can comes across feeling floaty and weightless.The CG is actually awful (not the vfx artists fault), it rarely looks good and so much of it looks surprisingly unfinished. The music by Benjamin Wallfisch is fine, a lot of it is good in the moment without creating any memorable themes and there's plenty of callbacks to Danny Elfman's iconic score (probably too many to be honest).","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, while it had potential, the movie ultimately left me with mixed feelings.One of the highlights of ""The Flash"" was its good premise. The concept of a superhuman with the ability to travel through time had the potential to deliver an exciting and mind-bending experience. The initial setup and the references to the character's origin story were intriguing, leaving viewers eager to see how the story would unfold.Unfortunately, the plot twists failed to deliver impactful and meaningful punch to the story. The acting performances were just okay; Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton did a decent job, but perhaps they weren't provided with enough material or direction to create meaningful emotional connections with the other characters, the audience, or the story as with some of the best Superhero movies that I have seen. Lastly, the movie suffered from bad and recycled CGI, taking away from a genuine and immersive experience that breathes new life to the thrills. Even the time travel bubble which was meant to be cool looking, reminded me of some of the CGI that had already been used in the Green Lantern and Thor. Just not original enough for me.Since I'm a die-hard Flash fan, I felt entertained and I loved the addition of some of my favorite characters, and the actors who played them. So, it definitely wasn't the worst movie. It was better than these childish superhero comedies that I've seen (Deadpool, Shazam, Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor Ragnarok, Suicide Squad). Better than some of the flops like Green Lantern, Black Adam and Batman vs Superman. It just didn't have the depth and originality that I had hoped it could deliver.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Few comic book characters understand that better than Barry Allen, aka super-fast superhero The Flash. When he was just a kid, his mother was murdered in their home and his father was wrongly convicted and subsequently sent to prison for the crime. In the character's self-titled debut solo film. Flash uses his powers to travel back in time and prevent that tragedy from ever occurring, inadvertently becoming trapped in this alternate timeline he created. When Kryptonian General Zod arrives and threatens Earth, our hero must gather whatever protectors he can find to defend the world in which his family is happy. As the synopsis suggests, 'The Flash' is a very heartfelt, emotional film due to it being about loss & trauma and having the power to change it. The scenes between Barry and his mom in particular are equally wholesome and heartbreaking since we ultimately know her fate. Ezra Miller delivers a phenomenal performance as two different versions of Barry Allen; the main one more mature & serious and the other an 18-year-old carefree goofball. Their dynamic is delightful, with the latter version responsible for much of the film's humor. Surprisingly (and welcomed), 'The Flash' is one of the funniest comic-book movies I've ever seen. The jokes are perfectly placed and I can't even count how many times I laughed out loud from beginning to end. Another highlight of the film is Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman, who proves you're never too old to kick ass! After 30 years, he slips back into the role like a comfy pair of Bat-slippers and cements his place in the Batman Hall of Fame. Keaton clearly loves playing the character, and that passion radiates from him whenever he's on-screen. 'The Flash' also features Ben Affleck's swan song as his iteration of the Caped Crusader in a fantastic, albeit bittersweet, send-off. Rounding out the film's ensemble of incredible characters is Kara Zor-El/Supergirl (Sasha Calle), who utilizes her limited screentime to enhance every scene she's in. Her role is like the parmesan cheese on the plate of pasta that is the movie: not too much as to overpower the entire dish, but enough to still appreciate it. After seeing Sasha's debut performance as the Girl of Steel, I truly hope she continues to play the character going forward. Now, while the movie is outstanding, it's not perfect... although the good FAR outweighs the bad. My only two criticisms are that, while Flash's powers are portrayed in really cool, visually interesting ways, the CGI resembles PlayStation 3 graphics at times (specifically in an otherwise cheer-worthy sequence towards the end) and the villains feel a bit wooden and generic. Overall, while it took nearly a decade to make it to theaters (ironic, huh?), 'The Flash' is well worth the wait. Full of heart, humor, and great performances, the film stands out among the hit-and-miss DCEU as one of its best offerings to date.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

"7","/10","DCEU Film #13: The Flash","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9136777/?ref_=tt_urv","PCC0921","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur109135693/?ref_=tt_urv","21 June 2023","In the Flash (2023), we witness the end of the DCEU as we know it. Those films now enter, into film history, as part of the era, that depicted the rise of the comic-book film, in the early part of the 21st century. Now, the next phase of DC's theatrical division moves onto it's next incarnation, in the guise of James Gunn's new DCU, which should launch in 2025. The Flash (2023), ends a 13 film run by the DCEU, that began with the Man of Steel (2013). So, being a Flash film, you already know, that this will be a perfect moment to use the character, most pivotal, in all the stories DC has used during its history, to reboot its brand, either on film or in print. This is a perfect way to segue from the current universe to the next one coming. As seen in the trailers, you also know, that this is a time-traveling film. Barry Allen decides to go back in time and save his mother. It's the quintessential Flash story. We also know this will be another example of a multi-verse film.So, as this swan song opens up, we also are reminded of the off-screen problems of it's star, Ezra Miller, as Barry Allen, the Flash. Trying to remove that from your mind won't work, because, unfortunately, knowing this, helps enhance his performance. It's an eerie parallel, that is felt in the film, especially since he runs into a younger version of himself, who wouldn't really be considered totally stable, especially by the end of the film. So, removing real-world problems from the equation, the star's performance is not a problem in this film. With that in mind, we move onto the supporting cast. Many characters in the film have to stay top-secret here, but two characters we do know from the trailer is Ben Affleck and returning champion Michael Keaton, as our main Batmen. Barry Allen turns to his Bruce Wayne (Affleck), to get support for his idea, to go change the past. Once Barry gets to the past, it turns out he has entered the wrong universe and while searching for Batman, he finds the Bruce Wayne from the Tim Burton universe, Michael Keaton. Both Batmen do a great job with their performances, but I felt Keaton was held back a little too much. He felt too subtle.The plot also harkens back to that beginning film, the Man of Steel (2013) and utilizes elements from that film, in order to give us an idea of when this takes place. The day the Kryptonians attacked Earth. This brings back Superman rival, General Zod (Michael Shannon), but gives us a new hero, Supergirl (Sasha Calle). Basically, this boils down to a multi-verse disaster in the making. Forget everything you know, heard or believe, when it comes to the concept of time-travel. This is most evidenced by the shot the writers of the Flash (2023), take, on Marvel's concept of time-travel, as seen in Avengers: Endgame (2019). It is a subtle joke, that speaks volumes. The humor in the film is quite good. It is that infuriating aspect of Ezra Miller's Flash, that is appealing. He was the comedy-relief in the Justice League (2017), much like Paul Rudd was in the MCU's Captain America: Civil War (2016). So, it's not a surprise, that the Flash (2023), has lots of comedy moments.The Flash (2023), isn't a bad film, but it isn't a great one either. The multi-verse plotline, along with the main plot of Barry attempting to save his mother, coupled with having to world-build another universe in two hours and a plethora of characters roll through, makes for a messy situation, unless you are knowledgeable enough to understand what is going on. Fortunately for me, I have been following DC since the 1970s, so none of that bothered me. It could be confusing for those, who don't know the comics or all the movies from the past that well. The strong point of this film stems from the swan song aspect of it all. Knowing that things will be changing for DC makes this a strong homage to the past ten years of the DCEU. Love them or hate them, whatever the sum total of all 13 parts were for you and for film history, the Flash (2023), is strong enough to entertain and put a decent closing to this era of DC comics theatrical films.7.2 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's been nothing but bad choices ever since Man of Steel.After the decision to kill the ""Snyderverse"" it made no sense that they even completed production on this thing; what's the point? Ohh Warner Brothers...AND I'm a huge fan of the much better DC animated universe, and The Flashpoint Paradox in particular, and this is a fair adaptation of it! This did a better job of fan service than the last season of Picard! I don't like Ezra Miller, and I feel they even addressed that in a satisfying way. The effects were very good. The CGI cameos were a lovely treat.I think the only reason it was such a flop was because of the circus both DCEU and Ezra Miller separately became, and people knew this wasn't going anywhere. That and all the spoilers that were baked in before anyone could see it. Can you imagine if you didn't know Michael Keaton was in it?? Which is all a shame, because although it has a lighter tone, it's the best movie in the DCEU since Man of Steel, and I guess that makes it fitting that it's the last: book ends with a whole lot of trash in between (with the exception of the first WW which was also pretty good). Aaaaand I'll always be bitter that Batfleck never got a solo film.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Warner was wise to focus on Keaton in the marketing bc having Keaton back in the cape and cowl is essential to making this whole endeavor work.That being said, if this is indeed Keaton's last turn as the caped crusader, it will be somewhat of a missed opportunity for not placing him in a full on return to the Burtonverse bc the world/Gotham that Keaton's Batman inhabited was such a defining feature of his iteration of Bats that it feels like a shame not seeing where that exact continuity went.But, that's another universe/timeline.The humor and fun that Keats, Calle and Miller inject into this flick are it's super power and the film coasts on their merits, and a few cameos, to its detriment.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Beyond that most of the problems with this film are textbook studio interference. I think after Summer 2023's very expensive flop fest, studios will begin to right the ship, or one can hope. Will this finally get Warner's attention to let artists be artists, and realize it doesn't have to cost unspeakable amounts of money to make? I hope so. I waited a long time to watch this one, knowing the issues it had and the baggage it brought. Having finally watched it (with my brain properly shut off) I must admit it's a pretty fun film. Keaton fully brought it. The movie could've been so, so much better, and that's the gut wrencher. Comic fans will hate it and I get it. There's a lot wrong canon-wise. I'm not a comic fan myself but know and appreciate the characters. I imagine the studio decided the demographic of this movie are non comic fans, and they're the ones who will really like it.

The action, story, performances, nods, Easter eggs and more were all done so well.I'd highly recommend it, something about it is very special and had me smiling, laughing and feeling things throughout.It deserves ALOT of praise. The actors were all fantastic and I would pay to see more Supergirl in a stand-alone movie. I went in excited having grown up in the 80's and looking forward to Michael Keaton returning as well as supergirl in a big budget modern take which did not disappoint.Saying anymore would spoil too much but it deserves to be rated well so I had to contribute to the rating. If you're a fan of the stories, actors or the original Batman or superman movies I would say relive the good old days and enjoy this one.A massive well done. Great movie and a fun ride!","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The writing was also great, this is a fun movie to watch, it has you laughing throughout, whilst also having a deep emotional core. The humor was similar to that of dungeons and dragons honor among thieves. While there where a lot of complaints about it being just a fan service, it didn't seem like that to me. Yes, it did have things that fans enjoyed, but you can still enjoy it without knowing too much about DC. There were a lot of complaints about the end being chaotic, which was what I was expecting when I went to watch it, but it wasn't really chaotic. And despite the comments about the cgi, while it wasn't avatar way of water, it wasn't that bad. Also, Michael Keaton was a great Batman, and I think Sasha Calle is my favorite supergirl. Over all, a good film.I almost didn't go see it, but I'm glad I did. Definitely worth watching:)","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Michael Keatons reprisal of the role as Batman was truly captivating and delightful to watch. Although I wasn't born when he portrayed Batman, I watched those movies dozens of times when I was younger. The moment he showed up on screen I couldn't contain my excitement and it brought me back to my childhood. The fact I knew he was going to be in the movie didn't change anything. The reusage of the Danny Elfman theme made it all complete and gave me goosebumps. It perfectly complemented the movie and enhanced the overall experience.This movie is the DCEU version of No Way Home, delivering a grand spectacle packed with action and nostalgia. It was fan service at its finest. All the cameos worked for me and runtime didn't bother me. However the dodgy VFX did bother me a bit, but it didn't ruin the overall experience.I can fully recommend The Flash. It is a must-see for superhero movie fans, offering something for both the older fans with a lot of nostalgia and for the newer fans of the franchise with thrilling action and strong performances.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This was overhyped which to me is a big shame. I love the character Flash and to see this not living up to the hype is kind of sad. But with that said, it was still pretty entertaining though, although it had dodgy CGi. (Really Hollywood? You got so much money and can't even do proper CGI? Embarrassing).""The Flash"" is based on ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" very loosely. When I say very loosely, basically everything after Barry going back to save his mom changes from the original source which is nice and original and all, but I feel like they would've had a much better time if they followed the original source to the tee. Watching Ezra Miller on the big screen after all the criminal things he had done was kind of uncomfortable but he was as usual pretty funny in his role. (I do not endorse the actor, but I like the character. Just clarifying). Michael Keaton back as Batman was incredible and for me the highlight of this movie and by the looks of it most of the people who watched this agrees. The different easter eggs were amazing and the score was fantastic. But honestly, this could've been SO much more and so much better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

One of the major standouts in the movie. Really liked her.34 years after he first played Batman on the big screen, Michael Keaton returns to the role (and the big screen) and he doesn't miss actually he is MVP for me.Batfleck is back he showed for a short amount of minutes but i enjoyed seeing him for one last time.In the end, The Flash triumphs through its ability to connect emotionally and deliver moments of genuine humour.

The film has a strong sentimental tone, which creates empathy with the protagonist and his actions.The action scenes were excellent, with all the actors and choreography well-directed. The characters truly shine when they need to.I won't give it 5 stars because the special effects were lacking. While the ""speed force"" sequences looked intentionally strange, the real action scenes shouldn't have had that issue. However, it stands out, especially in facial expressions, reaching the uncanny valley for some characters.In conclusion, the movie is good for an afternoon watch and enjoyment. If you've been a DC fan for a while, you'll love everything they show and explore. Additionally, the message of ""not all problems have a solution"" is highly motivating and truly evokes emotion in the viewer.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

I mean, who wouldn't get excited to see Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman? It was like a blast from the past and definitely brought back some nostalgic vibes. But, gotta be honest, the CGI left something to be desired. It just didn't quite live up to the high expectations I had. I was hoping for some mind-blowing visuals, but it fell a bit short.Now, let's talk about those unexpected cameos. Oh man, they really caught me off guard! One of them was downright crazy. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say it was a delightful surprise. And there were a couple of other cameos sprinkled throughout the movie that added to the excitement. It's always fun to spot familiar faces in these superhero flicks.Now, when it comes to Barry Allen, I couldn't help but notice how much more awkward he seemed compared to his Justice League appearance. I guess they wanted to emphasize his quirky personality, but at times it felt a bit forced. Don't get me wrong, though, there were still some scenes that had me cracking up and they definitely left an impression.All in all, I'd say it's a classic popcorn flick. You know, the kind of movie you grab a big tub of popcorn, kick back, and enjoy for a couple of hours. It's not something you'd watch over and over again, but it definitely delivers a good time. So, yeah, worth a watch if you're in the mood for some superhero action and a few laughs, and then you can move on to the next adventure.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Michael Keaton has still got that charisma he had when he first played the role of Batman. CGI could have definitely been better. The pace of the movie is good. The villain had literally no impact on me personally. Because, when watching a movie I usually want to get a clear picture and motive of the villain so that I can get myself engaged in the movie personally to a much deeper level. This has not happened in the case of this movie. This one is my biggest complaint about this film. The emotions are portrayed very well though. The direction and screenplay are good too.Finally, this one may not be a masterpiece but at the same time, not as worst as it was projected.

Ezra Miller has apologized for his behaviour, and I hope that people can give him another chance, provided of course he continues to make efforts on bettering himself. His performance was excellent, and I'd love to see him return as The Flash.As for the movie, it's just so much fun, and me and the audience laughed all the way through.

There's just so much going on, I think what they achieved here was amazing, and executed very well.

I definitely had a few issues with it and I don't agree with the premature claim of it being one of the best superhero movies ever, but it's fun enough.Starting off with the good, Ezra does a great job as our main Barry. He brings plenty of heart and emotion through his performance and you really feel his internal struggle. Michael Keaton's return as Batman is an obvious highlight and whilst I wasn't alive when his films released I still got that nostalgia kick seeing him back. Sasha Calle made a strong impression as Supergirl, tho underused, I enjoyed her. It was nice to see Batfleck back one last time, I loved his speech about scars making us who we are. The action was pretty good, particularly the opening action sequence in Gotham which was a lot of fun.Now as for the issues I had with it. Firstly, the CGI is not great and at multiple moments looked like PS3 graphics. This then leads me onto the cameos, some of which were dead actors brought to life via CGI which did not look good at all and on top of that I just had a taste issue with bringing back dead actors.Then there's the humour which was a 50/50 split with what worked and what didn't. An example being the lasso gag which wasn't funny and they've done before. Lastly, there's young Barry who I liked sometimes, but other times he got really annoying and put me off his character.The Flash isn't a top tier DC flick for me but it is a mostly enjoyable ride nonetheless.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I grew up with DC comics (and Marvel, lets face it, we all have a preference but we would read whatever we got our hands on), and I wasn't lining up to see this movie, after what I got to see of Ezra's flash in the other movies, not even being his first titular movie. Well, didn't help all his problems with the police, kidnapping allegations, etc., but that wasn't my problem with his Flash, his Flash in Justice League rubbed me the wrong way and boy oh boy it just dialed up to one thousand in this titular film. His Flash is cringe, a complete moron almost, a mockery of Barry Allen. How can someone fail so miserable interpreting such a famous character, specially when he had the luxury of having an interpretation of the Flash that he could look to for inspiration (Grant Justin... sure, I have some things to criticize about his Flash but compared with Ezra Grant's Flash is a masterpiece of perfection).Not even Keaton performance saved it for me... this is so bad that not even all the nods and easter eggs made it worth for me. It was painful, so painful I walked out before it ended.Ezra was a complete miscast, his Flash is egregious, so bad it makes the Green Lantern look like a masterpiece.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

""The Flash"" is a perfectly entertaining movie, but little more, which is a shame considering it had immense potential.The various cameos and Easter eggs are a real treat, but they all overshadow the real story of the film: Barry trying to save his mother. ""The Flash"" is at its best when it explores the Allen family and it's too bad the story wasn't as focused on this as it was fan service and nostalgia.Don't get me wrong, the nostalgia factor was awesome. Michael Keaton's Batman steals the show for sure, and Supergirl was pretty interesting despite her lack of background. But all the nostalgia made for very hollow storytelling, especially since the actual story, Barry trying to save his mother, that got us there in the first place was far stronger.All in all I highly recommend you see this film, especially if you were a fan of Keaton's Batman.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The action scenes with Batman were very entertaining because we got to see michael keaton prove that he can still be one of the best batman ever.

It's one thing to be hangry and late, it's another to make that the problem of your sandwich shop guy.Frequently, it seemed as if Ezra Miller forgot how to act or speak like a human being.

I have been a DC fan since the 1980's when as a kid I first saw Christopher Reeves as Superman. Later came Tim Burton's Batman, complete with Michael Keaton in the starring role and I've been hooked ever since. Fast forward to the cheesy '90's and the TV version of ""The Flash"" which I also loved.Then came this latest ""The Flash"" movie. Wow. Ezra Miller. Gosh I found him an annoying character to watch. It really was a chore for me. When the lead character irritates one so much, then there is a problem. The first hour or so I slogged through. Some of the slow mo scenes honestly reminded me of the original 1978 Superman when Clark is running next to the train...it was that bad, as back then they did not have modern technology to make things look good (DC needs to go and watch Marvels ""X-Men Days of Future Past"", a certain Quicksilver speed scene and see how it can be done properly!). For a movie about a speedster, there really were next to no actualy speed scenes, just terrible slow mo scenes!Finally, the big reveal that most of us were waiting for when a certain caped character returns - complete with original music score by the great Danny Elfman. I had chills, goosebumps, whatever you want to call it, nostalgia was there and I was loving it. No, this is not the next Batman movie, but it really could have been. Loved the easter eggs and cameos so look out for those too!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plotline felt disjointed and struggled to maintain a coherent flow, leaving critical character arcs unresolved and neglected. Key moments lacked emotional depth, failing to forge a connection between the audience and the characters. For a superhero movie, it lacked the gravitas and resonance that fans have come to expect from the genre.Regrettably, the misuse of CGI further compounded the movie's woes. Action sequences, which should have been the film's highlights, were marred by glaringly obvious visual effects, reminiscent of a low-budget production.

Even though his private life and negative news keep coming, it can be seen that he has put a lot of effort into this role. The performance is absolutely solid, and the continuation of the entire DC Justice League and the characteristics of the role of The Flash are being potrayed.Michael Keaton's Batman is fantastic. Not only just continuing the classic style, but the batsuit is also upgraded to match modern feeling. However,Keaton did look much older compare to his glorious day back in BATMAN(1989) and Batman Return(1992), and it is unknown whether he will appear in other movies as Batman in the future.Fans who like DC movies will definitely be able to satisfy their wishes , but the visual special effects standard are unstable, some scenes are well done, and some scenes are overdone, but it is still acceptable as a means of expression and to progress with the story, but I think there is room for improvement.As a sci-fi superhero movie, this movie is worth to watch. It is very entertaining and suitable for the whole family to watch. But it may not be suitable for people who don't like sci-fi movies. But in order to make the film not so dull, the movie also has a lot of humour to ease the heavy atmosphere.What is the future direction of the DC superhero movie? I believe DC will depend on the box office results and popularity of this movie before making a conclusion, but I think this movie has established a new direction for DC superhero movies, and has the opportunity to create their DC version of 'Avengers Endgame"" style movies, but it all depends on the reaction of the audience and whether the producer is willing to go into this direction.This movie tries to attract audiences of different age groups, but fans of different age groups have different expectations, resulting in some inconsistent effects of the whole movie, but overall it is entertaining and interesting.In addition, the movie also rationalizes the concept of multiple universes, so it cannot be ruled out that in the future DC comic hero movies ,there can be characters from different eras , different time and space to re-appear in the same movie.As the first 'The Flash' solo movie, it is good overall. Some scenes are shocking enough to watch in theaters, but I believe it may not satisfy all fan's'requirements, because different fans have different expectations, and some hope that a certain character will appear more, some hope that the development of a certain story will advance, and some hope that a certain scene will be filmed in different way. I heard that the derivation of certain plots of this film this time is all due to the voices and expectations of fans. This made the film company want to make this film, so I believe that the future direction of the DC comic hero movie will depend on the reaction of this film,In addition, Supergirl (Superman's cousin) is very eye-catching, but the appearance time is relatively short, but she continue to have the momentum of Superman characteristics. In addition, there are easter eggs at the end of the film, so audience can pay attention.I watch the film in IMAX and it feel so good to watch on IMAX for several scenes.7 marks (10 marks full )","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's the kind of movie you play as a trump card when you are in big league. Maybe DCEU wouldn't had to work on a check book that wouldn't balance if The Flash had come any sooner. I'm starting to feel about the places that the brand could go. Andres delivers what we expected. As a fan, very excited with where the company is advancing while Andres already being in talk for the James Gunn's DCU.Speaking about the movie, it was super fun, emotional and complete. Although I would prefer darker and gritty tone for a movie. These are the lot which attracts the crowd. This was the problem which the company couldn't address in the initial days. The Flash will inspire afar for rest of the coming years.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A promising film that loses focus.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9268456/?ref_=tt_urv","ethanbtlrbutler","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61972664/?ref_=tt_urv","18 August 2023","The Flash begins as an intriguing, highly-creative and promising film. Unfortunately, the writers seem to lose focus in its second-half, following a plot line that isn't substantial enough to finish out the story being told. Which is truly a shame, as this story is a good one, and has the foundations of a touching tale. The actors all do a good job here, especially in emotional moments. Muschietti brings some truly unique ideas to the often repetitive superhero genre, at least for the first half. As soon as the movie decides to focus on a battle with Zod, it loses all intrigue.I found the movie to be a lot more enjoyable than expected. The CGI is an eyesore, and almost headache-inducing. I believe if that was easier to look at the film could have been bumped up a star. Alas, the movie suffers the most not from bad effects, but a bad third act, like many superhero movies. The issue with this third act is not merely a dull final battle scene, which it certainly has, but rather the deviation of focus from the otherwise touching core plot line.For me, The Flash is a 6.4/10; enjoyable, despite some major flaws.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As always they have shown too much of the good scenes in like what, four pre-release trailers?I think this phenomenon started with Batman Vs Sups. If any DC executive is reading this, kindly stick to a single trailer and never reveal your punch moments and characters. Let the fans enjoy it firsthand in theaters and then spread the word.Secondly, most of us know the story about what happens in Flashpoint Paradox. So nothing surprising there. They have stuck to it well. Some MCU fans may even accuse that they did some things first. Well they're wrong. Because DC did it first in Comics.Finally I don't understand the obsession with colors. Almost all DC movies end with a color splash one way or the other. Too much red, green and blue. It's matching the JL costumes, I get it but they're overdoing it in my opinion.So coming back to the review,We know the base story, we saw some good scenes and moments beforehand in the trailers, there are some questionable VFX scenes where I did not understand if it was supposed to be realistic or they wanted it to resemble a digital artwork.YET...What we have is a decent entertainer. The cameos were good and surprising at times. They pay homage to many old franchises.There are multiple moments where you will applaud naturally if you are a DC fan. Not just the new teenage fans but even ones from the 80s and beyond.The action sequences were good. The acting was generally good from all actors. I felt Iris was perhaps the only one that didn't gel well with the rest. The one from the Flash TV series felt more genuine than this one.The best part about the movie was that, it was a fun flick. There are some comic one liners which will crack you up. It wasn't too dark at any point, which is exactly what I expected out of a Flash movie.I wouldn't say it if it was a Batman movie. We know DCU is much ""serious"" than MCU. So much that the main villain's catchphrase was ""Why so...?"" 😁Even as a fun-flick the Flash movie is a treat for... no not just Flash fans, but the Bat fans and the JL fans in general.So you can happily grab a pop corn and go watch it ...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was disappointed by the downward spiral of the last five or six MCU movies and thought that the age of superheroes was coming to an end, but it seems that DC has finally picked up the torch.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's not as bad as I was expecting. It's just all a bit underwhelming and is tonally all over the place.I felt there was a decent story bubbling away, but it all got gobbled up by DC's need to avoid a PR disaster by focusing too much on Ezra Miller, who is surprisingly good in his dual roles and, if it wasn't for the off-screen baggage, is good enough here to carry a Flashpoint/BTTF type film about time travel, dealing with grief and going up against evil Flash.But I got the sense all that was lost in the reshoots and handing the DC reigns to James Gunn. The opening act feels like it was tacked on - possibly they went to James Gunn and said ""We need a wacky, outlandish opening"" - because it doesn't sit tonally with the rest of the film.The last act feels like the last act of a different story, maybe the one they set out to make. And isn't helped because the special effects clearly aren't finished and it all feels rushed.Overall, not a disaster - it made me laugh, I liked the Batman nostalgia and some action scenes are really well done - but it all feels like a superhero movie made by a committee. Despite the big explosions and big action, there's not much to get excited about. Just a bunch of scenes from 3 different films in search of a story.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The CGI though, the amount of money and budget they had they could of done better. Very obviously computer generated compared to other superhero movies you can see the work that was out in. It feels like they had no time left and just made it work which is a shame, as this movie could of been a 10 with better CGI and some tweeks.Overall enjoyed it.

First of all I've always been a Marvel comics fan and never cared much for DC comics, and this has carried on with the movies. This is one of my favorite DC movies to date, but it could have been so much better. At this point, they have so much lore and history to play with in a movie like The Flash. Sure enough, they are using plenty of it and even a non-fan like me got all giddy a several Easter eggs and references, but there is so much more they could have pushed for. And the horrendous CGI doesn't help; why is it so bad compared to other current movies, especially MCU ones? Still, I very much recommend it if you're into entertaining super hero flicks.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Can't ask this enough...As far as 'The Flash' as a cinematic experience, prior to watching I had an expectation of what we saw with Marvel's Quicksilver in films like 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and 'X-Men: Apocalypse', films that came out in 2014 and 2016 respectively. I'll just say my expectations were not met.The only meaningful substance that came out of this film, from my perspective, is obviously Michael Keaton reprising his role of Batman.

These 2 morons are responsible for one of the worst movies ever released and easily the worst piece of DC media ever created. Ezra was involved in the flash ( obviously), Gunn was given control and decided to have the flash edited to suit his vision for DC. That vision meant editing the flash to include cameos and throwbacks to storylines, characters and plots that Gunn is responsible for cancelling, yet in his complete lack of brain activiity and out of touch with reality bubble he thought that putting throwbacks in the flash would blind the audience with nostalgia and they would overlook the steaming pile that the flash is. If you want to be reminded of storylines, plot points and characters that Gunn has already killed off, while a the same time watching an ego tripping child groomer deliver utter mediocrity while poorly delivering a story that DC has already told countless times over and which was handled infinitely better in the animated movie ""flashpoint"" then maybe you'll like this movie.If you have working brain cells, if you want a movie to tell a story, if you want to have some escapism aided by compotent acting, if you want to be entertained then this is not the movie for you.Main***
First things first lets address the elephant in the room, this movie deserves to fail, before it even hit cinema some people had a negative, albeit justified perception of it. Gunn, a one note hack who in 30+ years in the business has only had 1 success which was guardians of the galaxy, which was impossible to be anything other than a success since marvel fans are so rabid its effectively a cult, marvel could sell bags of feaces, if the bags had a marvel logo printed on them they would be guaranteed to sell. Point is Gunn is not a good director and objectively is one of the least qualified people on the planet to be given the reigns to all of DC's property, yet inexplicably that is what happened. Gunns first acts as CEO of DC were to round up all the popular, successfull, fan favourite actors like Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot and fire them on the spot, but for reasons defying any semblance of brain activity he cleared house of all the good and profitable actors he decided make Ezra the sole focus of his attention so all of the press, all of the media and the future he envisioned for DC all revolve around and/or heavily include a child grooming, woman beating, assault prone, thief. This movie, Gunn and Ezra deserve to fail, that is not a matter of opinion, that is not even up for debate, that is an immutable fact. So all that said, it was set in stone that this movie was never going to have an impressive showing once released.Now onto the reviewing the actual movie footage. It's bad, plain and simple bad, a boring, predictable movie that tries to use a nostalgia factor to mask it's many shortcomings but since those moments of nostalgia are all looking back on different stages of live action DC, none of which exist anymore and thanks to Gunn will not be continued or revisited instead of making us smile or having fond throwbacks to the past they come across as exactly what they are, cheap poorly thought out manipulation tactics. You will not watch this movie and have a little smirk when certain cameos come up or when certain things are mentioned, instead you will just be reminded ""oh yeah, we were going to have X storyline or Y was going to get more screentime"". I know this movie was not headed by Gunn but changing aspects of it to suit his terrible marvel-lite, zero storyline, zero effort, sloppy phase system BS vision for what DC should be were among the first actions he took once put in the position of power and those changes are further proof of the reality of what I said above, Gunn is not fit to head DC.Instead of this being a movie that serves as a bridge of sorts, one that serves as a fair well to the established DC we have seen while also setting a clean slate to revisit those characters what it actually is is an insult, it insults DC's existing movies with how it handled it's cheap cameos and throwback moments using them as atom thin veils to mask it's own arrogance and it also both insults possible fans of future movies and establishes those movies are going in the wrong direction because Gunn is actively doing everything in his power to do the exact opposite of what people want. Rebooting DC is easy1: fire the child grooming, multiple felon who would be and should be in jail, the only reason he isnt is because it would be bad PR so the 1% in control of WB are pulling strings to avoid him facing the
consequences of his actions.2: Keep the actors who have proven financially successful as well as being well recieved by fans and critics alike. I am not saying that Henry Cavill should be superman for the rest of his life, Gunn could still turn out his guaranteed atrocious unneeded, unwanted, superman origin story number 9000, doesn't mean there is no room in any DC content for Cavill to play a slightly older, established superman.3:Release batwoman movie. This movie was 100% guaranteed to be profitable, a movie focusing on a member of the bat family who has not had a lot of attention in live action media and that stars Brenand Fraser, one of the most beloved actors of the past 4 decades playing a villian, there is 0% chance this movie would not have generated a profit.4: Do *NOT* turn DC into marvel lite. The phase system is the worst thing ever to happen to cinema. Storylines are gone, scripts are gone, plot are gone, quality is gone. Phase systems are not about telling stories, they are about re-treading the same footsteps over and over again while leaving enough ""ambiguity"" ( it isnt ambigious, it is so one dimensional you cant miss it coming, but ambiguity is the most fitting word for what marvel *think* they are doing) so that they can then tell those same stories again on smaller screens with predictable spin offs and adaptions. Instead of looking at a franchise and thinking "" in 30 years time we can create a good story about superman if first we spend 29 years releasing and re-relasing his origin story in cinema and home media every single year until we are officialy in phase 15"" Instead of that zero synapse perspective focus on making current movies good, give them compelling stories that work, don't think "" how can I avoid developing this story for the next 3 decades to milk every penny out of this characters name""","14 out of 22 found this helpful.

It's definitely a bit of a double edged sword to go into a film with those kind of expectations because of if it doesn't 100% live up to them it's gonna feel disappointing even if the film's still solid overall. And that's very much how I feel walking out this movie; a bit conflicted maybe even underwhelmed having still had a good time for the most part.Obviously Ezra Miller has brought a whole load of controversies to this film that couldn't have been foreseen and it's made the build up to it more difficult but I'm not gonna deny I think they're great in the movie. I think the best compliment I can give the performance is that I did start to see both versions of Barry as 2 separate characters pretty quickly, they're funny and bring the emotional weight that's needed for the films more poignant moments. Sasha Calle isn't in the film as much as I was expecting but I really gravitated towards her version of Supergirl and I would really like to see James Gunn keep her on in the new DCU. I loved Michael Keaton in this movie, I thought his Batman was used with a good amount of restraint and I thought he fit right in to the story. He's still totally believable physically and I just thought he excelled in the mentor role the script sets him up to be. It may be controversial to say but I think this could be his best Batman performance.I think Andy Muschetti elevated a lot of sequences with his really slick and visually creative directing. Just like with both the IT movies he always seem to find the most visually appealing way to shoot the types of the scenes the script calls for. I liked his interpretation of the speed force and it's as bright and colourful visually as I'd what a film about this character to be. I will say the tone was a bit hit and miss for me, I understand the Flash by nature is a quirky character but not all of the jokes landed for me and my biggest issues come when Muschetti tries to apply that same quirky tone to the character's that aren't Barry.While is directing it very creative what bogs down his visuals is the CGI. There's no way around it; the visual effects here are pretty horrendous to a baffling degree. And it's not just that they're not great, they are so poor that it actually took me out of certain moments where you're clearly supposed to feel awe inspired by what's on screen but instead it makes what's happening feel a bit empty. But the CGI isn't what I'd classify as my biggest problem with this movie.I just didn't think the story was that strong. There are a lot (and I do mean a lot) of great moments but the overall narrative feels really messy. I think this is partially a victim of the fact that the DCEU has never really felt like a fully fleshed out universe so the first act has to do a lot of heavy lifting to set up the character dynamics just so that the time travel the whole plot is based around can take place. Despite that I still found myself enjoying the first 2 acts but the actual climax in the 3rd act fell a bit flat for me. The awful visual effects are on full display and it essentially re creates Man of Steel's climax to a much lesser degree. There's a moment that's meant to feel awe inspiring but instead it just came across as hollow because there was nothing that felt real or tangible going on. The actual end to the story I actually thought was pretty perfect the pace getting to the conclusion though is clunky.So I'm pretty conflicted on The Flash overall, there are so many great individual moments but they're built on a story that didn't feel fully realised to me. I definitely think it's a victim of its expectations because Warner Bros did themselves no favours by building this up as one of the best comic book films of all time because it's absolutely not but I certainly wouldn't believe any of the hyperbolic negative reactions I've also been seeing online. It's a very enjoyable but imperfect superhero movie with a script that definitely needed a bit of an overhaul. I would be curious to see how my opinion evolves after a second viewing but as of now that about sums how I felt about The Flash in a nutshell.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It also serves as a way to softly reboot the DCEU and help to rework the upcoming Aquaman 2 and Blue Beetle into James Gunn's new DCU.Overall I had fun with this film and found it to be enjoyable throughout. Ezra Miller was impressive in his role as Barry Allen/The Flash and was largely responsible for the film working as it did. The story has mature themes and an emotional foundation. The time mechanics felt realistic even if a little complicated. Seeing a returning Michael Keaton as Batman will be a huge draw for many as will the introduction of Supergirl to the DCEU. The script was generally fun and littered with cameos and Easter Eggs.My main issue was the noticeably bad CGI. The filmmakers have responded to audiences saying that it was done on purpose but it was genuinely off putting at times. I wasn't sure how I felt about Supergirl at times but I think that was due to a mixture of her being an Alien and the CGI. Therefore the awkwardness of her character works. This is miles better than this year's Shazam 2.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I went on the journey with Barry Allen through the eyes of Carmine Infantino. I witnessed his death in Crisis. I saw the rise of Wally West in his own series. The Flash was a comic I loved the most.Why the Flash? Because he was a normal guy got chosen with that lightning strike to make the world a better place. He wasn't a millionaire, amazon, alien or god. He was just a guy racing to catch up. He wasn't perfect either. Wally West the character was deeply flawed.Flash forward past the 1990s TV series and the Grant Gustin series to the Snyderverse and the insanity that was Zack Snyder being unleashed onto the DCU.This version of the FLASH kind of reminds me of what Ben Affleck's Daredevil tried to do with that character. It jumped right into the hero's biggest story without warning. Since the Gustin series had been going strong for 9 years, the film relied on that public knowledge to go big or go home.Put aside Ezra Miller's controversial public life, he does a great job here playing his version of Barry stuck in two different times in their life. The effects on The Flash, the suit and humor were all great. The now controversial ""ChronoBowl"" was an interesting choice but also seemed doom for failure. (To be honest, The Arrowverse did a better job of explaining the multiverse and including legacies) In this cut of the film, Sasha Calle and Michael Keaton are completely wasted. Ezra Miller's performance is the best part of the film.

The bad reviews are very wrong, and this movie was so great. I don't think this movie deserved to bomb.I loved the superheroes and the battle scenes but the 2 Flashes, Batman and Supergirl is a real good Justice League team. Black Adam and Shazam Fury of The Gods were kind of bad and I thought that The Flash might be bad because DCEU have so much bad films and some good ones, but I was wrong. I love that this movie also teaches us to love our parents and it's just sad that Barry lost his mom, and he still fights to change the past so he can live with her.I didn't like that CGI was actually pretty bad and that's mostly it.Honestly this is my number 1 favorite DCEU film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

An emotional storyline awaits, with quite a few unexpected twists and turns.Ezra Miller, Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle deliver a great performance as the super-hero team comprising of Flash, Batman and Supergirl respectively. Sasha brought Supergirl to life with her stellar performance. As a Keaton-fan of the Batman movies in 1989 and 1992, it was memorable seeing him in action and hearing his famous one-liner.The action sequences and sound effects is a must-see for the big screen. Lots of humor and touchpoints with the exiting DC universe.I feel the trailer reveals quite a lot about the movie but still leaves enough surprises for the avid DC Comics fans.There is a post-credits scene.

And it was all the way through the movie.The story was fun, and It was cool to see the other Batmans. The cast was great especially Michael Keaton and Sahsa Calle, but the movie was flawed with having Ezra Miller as the lead. I think they could have a found a much better lead actor, he really ruined it for me. I think some of the script was poorly written, like Barry always reminding people of what happened or should have happened in his reality. At this point did it really matter? It felt like a lot of filler lines, to just fill the moment. There wasn't a lot of heart to the movie, it just felt empty, like something was missing. Lot's of great action but with poor CGI. Was not impressed.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Flashpoint would be the inspiration behind the film and that got me excited as I love the graphic novel, this isn't a direct adaption, its inspired and has Barry Allen traveling back in time to save his mother as the plot point but after that, everything is different and honestly it works quite well in how you'll be in for a ride that you'll be unprepared for like The Flash in the film. Ezra Miller has been a topic of controversy for two years and I understand why someone would choose not to watch it for him but his performance is great in this and he's better than ever as The Flash. Then came the marketing, making Michael Keaton the main Batman with him reappearing as his character from Tim Burton's two Batman films, Sasha Calle as Supergirl and the first trailer brought back Michael Shannon as General Zod and Antje Traue as Faora-Ul which was the villains for ""Man of Steel"" which was the start of the DCEU, it feels fitting that they're back for the ending (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will be the true conclusion). It also stars Ron Livingston, Maribel Verdú and Kiersey Clemons. With Ben Affleck along with other actors from the DCEU making cameos.The Flash is directed by Andy Muschietti from a screenplay by Christina Hodson, she wrote Birds of Prey prior to this so she has knowledge of the universe. Henry Braham served as a cinematographer for the film and shot The Suicide Squad prior to this aswell for the last two volumes of Guardians of the Galaxy. Benjamin Wallfisch did the musical score for the film and it's a good soundtrack, music fitting each scene both light hearted and darker, also the more suspenseful scenes. I think it was nicely edited. Andy Muschietti's direction was great, I really liked his vision for the project and how he wanted to make the project his own and fitting to the DCEU. I don't have any criticism towards him, great visual storytelling and it felt like he gave great direction to the actors.The Flash met my expectations, it was a great superhero film which brought plenty of satisfying and joyful moments. I love the characters and DCEU, I think they did a good job at putting an ending to it. With the speed force and time traveling, we got the multiverse in film format (after seeing it in Arrowverse and Titans before), and I don't want to spoil anything but you'll surely find it worth sitting through. The Flash offers a lot of things to like, the visual effects could and should have been better though, the final battle sequence against General Zod deserved ten times better effects and a more detailed location. I also understand why Michael Shannon didn't quite like it in this film just because of how one-dimensional Zod is and how there are almost no deep themes, I wouldn't say there are no themes though as there's one strong theme that's executed perfectly on screen and in writing, the theme of loss. There was emotional depth in the film through the loss of Nora, Barry's mother, it was executed perfectly and performed perfectly by Ezra Miller. The writing offered some great comedy, plenty of laughs from me and the others in the audience on the premiere, Ezra Miller had that comedic timing. Overall, I think the writing was great, much better than her work on Birds of Prey. The dialogue was great and so was the characterization. I really enjoyed the first and second act, they were golden. The third was fine but could have been better. The action sequences were great, all of them! Again, here the visual effects could have been better, but the action sequences were well thought out. It was also nice to see Michael Keaton back as Batman, he was great! I also liked Sasha Calle as Supergirl, good performance. This is a film I'll rewatch, without a doubt. Great superhero film!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

But I think this could have been much better if they had put more thought into the pacing of events. Like, some characters, quickly turn in favour of Flash with no real depth. I hate that given this movie has a substantial run time touching 2 and half hours. Then, the most controversial aspect of CGI. I can't argue with that, really. I watched this on 4k at home so all the imagery were very clean and the CGI was noticable in times where it should've have been. I'm not talking about the ""chronobowl""/Speed force CGI but other ones like Barry's face when he's in Flash-time. The budget is 220 million so I wish they had done much more given the time for production were much longer than most superhero movies nowadays. The cinematography was fantastic and I shed some tears because this one actually had an emotional impact. Then, Michael Keaton's Batman was fantastic and so was Sasha Calle. Zod's scenes felt very rushed though I can see he was not the point of interest in this movie which is driven by plot and character, literally!!! Get it? Anyways, I think this movie is not really underrated as of now and if it were to fall from its rating, it deserves justice because the vision was well-received for Flash fans such as myself who've seen the CW Flash and saw this familiar storyline of Flashpoint. I hope Andy Muschietti do well with his Attack on Titan project which at this point is not even sure of being made. I wish they make a good live-action adaptation of it if they do make one.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

When he discovers that he can run faster than the speed of light, he decides, against the advice of Bruce Wayne, to go back in time to put things right. As we all know though, such plans are always fraught with danger, time line wise and this is no different.Whilst Barry and his past self played by Ezra Miller are largely good fun in this, there are significant sections where they are both deeply irritating which is somewhat distracting. In addition the film includes a contribution by Supergirl played by Sasha Calle giving, at odds with the rest of the film's tone, one of the most miserable performances seen since The Grapes of Wrath hit the screen.That said this is one of the more enjoyable DC superhero movies of the last few years featuring an entertaining story, fun set pieces and strong FX throughout. The big draw here though is the introduction of shots and cameos of past beloved superheroes (and some who nearly were) and a starring role for Michael Keaton returning as Batman. The man provides much kudos here as does the accompanying suit, quite beautifully realised bat cave, bat mobile and plane, even Danny Elfman's glorious music. These factors add to a fun tale that should appeal to most people, but which may not include ardent young fans into DC lore.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Flash is visually appealing and has a nice soundtrack. Story builds up slowly but never gets boring. Sasha Calle, oh my, she was awesome as Supergirl. She added so much nuance to the character that I wish there was more of her like a solo movie or something. Mind you, I never liked Supergirl until this movie. I thought seeing Michael Keaton as Batman would be cringe but it wasn't. The fight choreographies for his Batman were pretty good, and the audience finds Bruce Wayne in an interesting place in his life. Very much like the Supergirl, I wanted to see more of this Batman/Wayne. If the movie is still on theatres where you live, I think it deserves to be watched on silver screen. The theme, some problems don't have a solution, your past makes you who you are and you can't change it is a relevant and timeless one. Although it maybe hard to relate. Trying to change to past leads to destruction is a quite nuanced theme that not everyone may not be able to connect to. Regardless, the movie was an enjoyable experience.Now, to address the elephant in the room because everyone is doing it; I don't care much about Ezra Miller. They did this they did that, well who knows what celebrities got away with before the age of social media. I actually never liked their Flash until this movie but they did a good job in this one as well. I'd recommend this movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Hearing The Flash was going to get his own solo movie, my mind leapt to the things they could do with the action scenes. While there's some obviously shared notes between Barry and Quicksilver (his comparable X-Men Universe counterpart) in how they use his abilities, hats off to the creative team for giving us some fun action scenes and some funny moments when Barry's dealing with his powers. One of the pleasant surprises I had watching The Flash is that I laughed a fair amount and it didn't feel forced or too manipulative. The writers and the creative team were able to find some unique ways to present how dealing with these powers would affect Barry and how the average person would perceive them. I wouldn't describe the action as fantastic but all the characters have their moments and I didn't leave disappointed with those scenes being too cliche or just average.Ezra Miller's been in the headlines a lot for his behaviour off-camera so let's set that aside. He's play dual roles here as both present Barry and younger teenage Barry. I liked Ezra better as current/older Barry, he's able to wring some funny moments out of Barry's awkward behaviour and maybe it's because he's the sobering presence next to his goof of a partner but I found him more believable in that role. Conversely, he's not as good as the more aloof member of the duo. The young adult Barry is designed to be more selfish, less aware and dumber overall but even if you make that concession, I found him mostly grating other than a few one off lines. It's a decent overall performance when put together but I'm not sure if it will save this iteration of the character. Michael Keaton is fun returning as the alternate Bruce Wayne from the Tim Burton timeline, he's still got the style and the presence the character requires and he's the steadying veteran the movie needs. The Burton movies were before my time but we all love Keaton and he seems comfortable being a supporting character next to Miller. My favourite performance was Sasha Calle as Supergirl, she's got the steely demeanour and the other-worldly vibe down pat, she fit the part like a glove from moment one and with all the questions about re-integrating the returning characters, go figure it's a new cast member that outshines them all. Maribel Verdu and Ron Livingston are both fine as Nora and Henry Allen respectively, they're having to work hard due to the cloying nature of their arcs but they get the job done. Largely the same for Kiersey Clemons, she's decent with what she's given but her inclusion seems more to setup the character for future movies than to give her something to do in this one. We get most of the Snyder/Wheedon Justice League appearing in cameos and they're all fine, I don't have many notes one way or another on them individually other than I wish we got more Jeremy Irons as Alfred before DC hit the reset button.Getting into what I didn't like about the movie, I'm surprised that I agree with the critics. The Flash is a perfectly acceptable entry in the DC Universe but it's oddly placed in the larger order. It's filled with little in-jokes and references which you may or may not know depending on how attached the the Snyderverse you are. The Flash also expects you to already have some warm and fuzzy feelings for the characters (both the main players and the supporting) that I just didn't have. They really want you to invest in Barry saving his parents but it's played like you're already attached to Barry as a character. He's been in a couple other movies as a supporting member of the Justice League, I haven't spent enough time with him to overlook that his plan is selfish and likely to fail. So when it comes time for the emotional payoff and we're supposed to be crying for Barry's selfless sacrifice, I just shrugged my shoulders. I also think The Flash suffers from tough competition in the multiverse superhero movies. Marvel's already taken a run at this a couple of times and because we've spent more time with those characters and there's been more buildup, we feel when they make those tough choices. It's earned vs unearned pathos. The Flash stands on it's own but it's not the first one to arrive to the party and it may not have all the fresh appeal it thinks it has for that reason.Whether this movie was even going to get released at all became a controversial subject with all the drama surrounding Ezra Miller. But the potential of it was too much to ignore and after having viewed the finished product, The Flash accomplishes what's required. With the crowded superhero landscape, the film had a tough fight to separate itself from the crowd and it unfortunately doesn't quite get there. I'm interested in seeing where DC goes from here as this movie seems to be a point of diversion (as described in the movie). I think this movie will give the die-hard fans what they want but I don't know if it will be the game-changer some were expecting. I think it's worth seeing if you're interested but it's not a must-watch experience and you could wait for this on streaming on need be.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Everything DC has done since the Christopher Nolan trilogy has been a mess. With, for me, the exception of Man Of Steel. That was an interesting take on Superman and I enjoyed it greatly.This Flash movie was HORRIBLY CHEESY. I still cannot understand why DC executives continue to RUIN these great characters. Bad script, bad dialogue, bad acting.Keaton was the ONLY thing good about this movie.Ezra Miller's performance, along with the rest of the cast did NOT come through at all. He has no range, no layers and was simply not believable as the Flash.I hate having write reviews like this, but I what is worse is that DC makes movies this bad at this point.","35 out of 65 found this helpful.

Almost like they go one step forward and two steps backwards. We are hoping to see some creative approach to storytelling with James Gunn leading the charge in days to come. The Flash however was the last of the previous management product and has been years in the making. This movie is definitely one of a kind and surprises you out of nowhere (in a good way).The Flash has a lot going on, the film explores the 'flashpoint' concept which gets briefly introduced at the end of justice league. There isn't much of a surprise around it as they have revealed quite a bit about the timeline and characters which The Flash is traveling to. The movie is a journey between timelines where The Flash battles internal and external conflicts. What sets the movie apart is the creative visual representation of time travel, the humour and the final flurry of surprises with easter eggs in the end. There are indeed some outrageous action sequences, especially the introduction scene of flash saving the babies from the hospital. However these add a different charm to the movie almost equivalent to the cheekiness of deadpool. The time travel concept isn't new and so the multiverse concept considering how this is being explored in recent movies. The movie does remind you of Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness in some scenes and also Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. For some creative choices which have been made. However this doesn't negatively impact the movie. The movie kind of tends to go haywire at times but somehow manages to bring itself back on track. The climax definitely has one of the best emotional moments in a superhero film and portrayed in the most beautiful way possible.Keeping public and personal controversies aside Ezra Miller has played one of the best dual roles which I have seen in a film. The two different versions of Barry Allen present such variety not only in terms of looks but also in terms of demeanour. One can almost feel as if there are two different actors playing in the movie. Ben Afflect, Michael Keaton play the apt supporting Batman characters. I cannot speak much about the performance and impact of other actors because that could lead to potential spoilers. They all have been written and portrayed in a deceivingly brilliant way.The Flash is fun, engaging, visually compelling, at times outrageous and deeply emotional. If only DC had standalone introduction movies for these superhero movies before Justice League and then continued the universe, maybe this movie would have had a much bigger impact. The movie does end with some exciting potential ahead but nobody knows whether DC is going to pursue the same.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

His portrayal just never worked or grabbed me compared to the others. And his portrayal here didn't change my mind. This just wasn't what the studio and lots of others hyped it up to be at the end of the day. Definitely NOT one of the best superhero films to date but just an ok entry.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Nope, not even close to snagging a spot among DC's heavy hitters. But hey, don't write it off just yet-I had a downright riot!Now, your mileage may vary on Ezra Miller's Barry Allen. Some folks found him a tad grating, but hey, maybe that's part of the whole Flash package, am I right? Personally, I didn't mind him at all.Let's talk about the true scene-stealer: Michael Keaton! When that Batman theme kicks in and Keaton's back in the cape, it's like a shot of pure nostalgia straight to the veins. But hey, just a heads-up-it's The Flash's show, not Batman 3. Gotta love those sneaky cameos!And Supergirl? She's a hoot! If she gets her own flick, count me in for round two! Oh, and the surprises? I'm still reeling from 'em! Can't believe they managed to keep those under wraps!Sure, it drags a bit in places, and some of the CGI's about as dodgy as a back-alley deal. Seriously, what were they thinking? But hey, they sure pushed the PG-13 envelope, didn't they? Nudity and f-bombs? This ain't your grandma's superhero flick, that's for sure!So, will I be hitting the play button again?

The Flash succeeds not only in making a good story, but they subvert expectations constantly. I did not notice any contradictions of previously established story points. The story itself was gigantic, yet easy to follow. All the actors did an amazing job playing their characters, especially Ezra and Sasha. My only gripe with the movie was the fact that the CGI was not the greatest, especially when they had faces on their character models. They were quite obviously CGI, but this didn't detract from the story at all. Tons of cameos and easter eggs for fans of DC too. Overall a very good movie, and the only (kinda) bad part about it was the CGI.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

CGI is most of the time pretty PS3-like and only 3-4 jokes land well for me, among hundreds of jokes that remind you again of that abominable Whedon's cut. What Muschietti basically did in this movie is erasing almost entirely whatever remains of the Snyderverse to pave the way for the new overlord Gunn-verse though the latter still remains to be seen until perhaps the end of Aquaman 2 which gave birth to the despicable power creep. Some of the logic and decision making process by the main character need to met with heavy criticism or even scrutiny. The moral of the story being conveyed here isn't bad all, in fact, it's almost tear-inducing, at least that's a plus from me for this movie. Had it not for my cousin(s), I would never have left the idea of not seeing this or any other comicbook film since No Way Home, especially on the theaters.7.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Flash was no different. Many points early on feel forced and overly campy and definitely smells very much like a rip off of the Spider-man Multiverse movie. That is not to say the movie doesn't have some really good moments, it most definitely does but they come on late and I nearly lost interest at several points. Ultimately if you like the Flash stories then it is a must see but if don't expect a unique experience. They are trying very hard to garner Marvel successes and DC always seems to be playing second fiddle even though in my opinion they have some of the most interesting super heroes.As the CGI goes some of it felt very faked. The AI is getting there but it's not quite polished yet. I won't state which characters to which I am referring as I don't want give any spoilers but you will recognize them when you see them.Michael Keaton stole the show but that came as no surprise. Michael is one of the finest actors out there is definitely under utilized. His moments are screen are well done and he pulls the role as Batman off so well it's a wonder they just don't recast him in the role even though he is getting on the older side for an action hero role.Juxtaposed Ezra Miller's character feels like he is stumbling through much of the movie but does have his moments coming across as a solid action figure. But you would think he should have the character well figured out by now. All of the actors that portrayed spider-man pretty much nailed their vision of the character down pretty solidly pretty quickly. Still, there is something I like about the character and it is probably more a problem with the writing than the actor. I think they should let the actor ad-lib a bit and see where he takes the character. Right now he feels a bit too restrained.Overall the movie isn't horrible I just would like to see DC comics pull it together and put down some solid 8 or above movies that really show off some of their outstanding comic book super heroes. If you like DC stories you should see this one. It's better than most. If so far the DC stuff just hasn't done it for you, you might want to skip this one. It's probably not going to change your opinion much.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie is really exciting and very well paced. Ezra does a wonderful job working off his younger self, and interacting with the rest of the ensemble. I was worried he would be shadowed in his own movie by everyone else brought in for fan service, but I'm pleased to say everything fit together like a well oiled machine. Don't like the man, but credit where it's dueSpeaking of the rest of the cast, everyone works well where they're placed even if they may be a little under utilized at times. It was wonderful to see Affleck return as Batman, Michael Shannon brought his perfect villainy back to Zod, and Sasha Calle was a great supergirl I hope to see lots more of. But of course, we all knew who the big gun was gonna be...Michael Keaton never lost his touch with Batman. Stole every scene he was in, and seeing him mop the floor with baddies never gets old. I'm very excited to watch his scenes over and over again when they're available on streamingWorth noting as well, the movie's humor definitely landed for me. Everyone's comedic timing is right on, the callbacks and references are utilized well with the jokes, and it was good to see it never compromised any of the dramatic moments as we've seen so many times before. There's some stragglers here and there, but I knew it was gonna be good with one of the first visual gags in the movieOk, so what was bad about the movie? Well as it's been said many times before, the CGI really falls short at times. To be fair, it worked well for the majority of the film in my opinion, but when it was bad it was BAD. It was distracting, and definitely pulls you out of the immersion. I can forgive bits and pieces since I know one day all CGI will look dated, but the filmmakers have come out defending it as a creative decision to show how the flash views the world in the speed force. Fair enough, but it probably should've either been polished up or just straight up scrappedThis movie also is clearly reliant on fan service and nostalgia, which isn't inherently a bad thing if you know how to walk the line. I would argue they do it well for about 80-95% of the movie, but when they overplay their hand, it definitely shows. For those that saw SpiderMan: No way home, imagine if that's where the line should be drawn on fan service reliance, now take two big steps over that line and you've got this movieBut here's my biggest problem in the movie, which does get into minor spoilers so be warned. I'm of the mindset that revival of old characters through people who have since passed is not a bad thing, if you're willing to put in the work to be respectful to their portrayal. This movie does feature some of that, and it's that with that atrocious CGI I talked about. It's in bad taste to try and pay homage to someone but make them look like a melting Barbie doll. This movie could've had an extra star from me without that, but this is what they chose at the end of the daySo overall, the movie was a fun DC movie I would easily say is some of the best we've had in a while I'd be happy to watch again, flawed though it is. If this is where worlds collide, I'm happy to say this is where some of the greats came together.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a smart strategy from a Movie Executive point-of-view as they can bring in other, generally liked/loved characters from previous films/entities.Sometimes it works Excellently (SPIDER-MAN ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE), sometimes it works ""Well Enough"" (DR. STRANGE IN THE MULTI-VERSE OF MADNESS) and sometimes it is just plain boring (the latest ANT-MAN movie), so expectation is that the DCEU will find a way to screw this up and make dull and boring a premise (and characters) that should be exciting and fun.And...with THE FLASH, the DCEU got it right (for once) and it is the most fun DCEU film since the first WONDER WOMAN film.Based on the FLASHPOINT comics series and Directed by Andy Muschietti (IT and IT, Part II), THE FLASH Isn't (really) a ""multi-verse"" story, it's a time travel tale (that causes multi-verses). An important distinction for the Fanboy - but rather unimportant to the regular movie-going person. This tale brings a bunch of fun (and humor!) to the DCEU as well as touching on the fondness nerve for by-gone characters (and the actors who portrayed them).Central to this film is, of course, THE FLASH, played by Ezra Miller. Your enjoyment of this film will swing on whether you find Miller's performance ""fun"" or ""annoying"" for it strides that line between the two. For the BankofMarquis, Miller's performance was a ton of fun - which added to the enjoyment rather than taking away from it.He is joined by a bevy of cameo appearances - to name any would be to spoil them - but (since it is in the trailer), Miller does spend much of this film interacting with his younger self and he succeeds (more than he fails) during this part of the film. The 2 Millers are also joined by Michael Keaton, reprising his role as Batman from the 1980's (again...not a spoiler - he's in the trailer). Keaton brings starpower - and star energy - to this film and he lifts the middle portion of this movie.Muschietti conducts this orchestra of multiple-cameos, multiple versions of the same character and multiple special effects professionally and cleanly, never letting the audience get lost and (most certainly) never letting the camera (or the film) linger too long on any plot device (which hides the holes that, inevitably, show up).A fun, enough, installment in the DCEU - with some heart and a large portion of nostalgia - THE FLASH is a positive way to say goodbye to the DCEU.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

It's interesting that they still try to make him the ""funny one"" of the Justice League team, when DC have kind of done that with the two 'Shazam' films already, and at it's core, this film asks the serious question - if you could go back in time, would you save a loved one who died?Due to the time-travel & parallel universe aspect of the film, we get to see many multiples - Barry/Flash (Miller), Batman (Keaton & Affleck) and Superman (no spoilers!). I'd say Keaton actually gets more screentime than Affleck and does really well, especially considering he's 71 and hasn't played Batman for over 30 years! The main plot is basically 'Back to the Future', which gets plenty of nods, with Batman and Kara (Calle) helping Barry to get back and overcome the changes of where he's ended up.Some of the ""speed-force"" CGI is pretty bad and the main problem the film has is trying to tie together a decade of DC films that haven't had the same interconnectedness/planning as the Marvel films. This film uses Zod (Shannon) as the villain again, taking it back to 2013's 'Man of Steel'. While there's not a crazy amount that's new, there's some funny/nice/good moments, but probably not enough to elevate this to something special, and it's not quite as good as 'Wonder Woman' or 'Man of Steel'.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

From its convoluted plot to its abysmal performances and lackluster production quality, this movie is an absolute disaster. It is rare to come across a film that fails on so many levels, but ""The Abyss of Shadows"" manages to achieve this dubious distinction.The film opens with a promising premise-a group of explorers embarks on a perilous journey into an uncharted underworld. However, the plot quickly devolves into a convoluted mess. The narrative lacks coherence, leaving the audience confused and disconnected from the story. The dialogue is filled with clichés and lacks any meaningful depth or emotional resonance. Character development is virtually nonexistent, with the audience being introduced to one-dimensional, unrelatable figures who are impossible to invest in.The performances in ""The Abyss of Shadows"" are uniformly atrocious. The cast appears to be devoid of any acting talent, delivering wooden, emotionless performances that make the film feel like a high school drama production. The lack of chemistry among the actors further exacerbates the film's already unbearable shortcomings. It is clear that the director failed to extract any meaningful performances from the cast, leaving the audience wondering how such talentless performances made it onto the big screen.In addition to its poor storytelling and performances, ""The Abyss of Shadows"" suffers from a noticeable lack of production quality. The cinematography is amateurish, with shaky camera work and poorly framed shots. The visual effects, if they can even be called that, are laughable, reminiscent of low-budget B-movies from decades ago. The audio design is equally subpar, with poor sound mixing that often renders important dialogue unintelligible.The film's pacing is another significant flaw. The narrative drags on without purpose or direction, leading to a torturous viewing experience. The few action sequences present in the movie are poorly choreographed and lack any tension or excitement. Even the attempts at suspense fall flat due to the predictable and poorly executed plot twists. It becomes increasingly challenging to stay engaged as the film stumbles from one incoherent scene to another.Moreover, the production design and set decoration in ""The Abyss of Shadows"" are uninspired and uninspiring. The locations lack any sense of authenticity or visual appeal, further contributing to the film's overall lackluster atmosphere. The costume design and makeup are equally disappointing, failing to create a believable world for the characters to inhabit.""The Abyss of Shadows"" attempts to tackle complex themes but does so in a clumsy and heavy-handed manner. The film's feeble attempts at social commentary and philosophical musings come across as trite and pretentious, adding insult to injury. It is evident that the filmmakers bit off more than they could chew, resulting in a film that feels disjointed and out of touch with its own intentions.In conclusion, ""The Abyss of Shadows"" is an excruciating cinematic experience that fails to deliver on any level. From its baffling narrative choices to its abysmal performances and lackluster production quality, this film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. It is not often that a film deserves a rating of 1 out of 10, but ""The Abyss of Shadows"" earns that distinction with its incompetence and lack of redeeming qualities. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this cinematic disaster.","12 out of 19 found this helpful.

The forced humour? The overthetop and horrendously bad CGI. This is a 250 million dollar movie, that feels like a Saturday morning cartoon in Live Action.In what world or universe would anyone think that this would fly, let alone be a good idea, let alone an actual production, let alone entertainment that they could charge money for?I don't care for Ezra Miller, though the guy can act. He is however, terribly miscast as the femboy, inflection-voiced tween awkward adolescent trying to outdo Tom Holland's effortless nerd kid charm with an overthetop irritation that is unparalled - only until you meet his more overthetop, jarringly grating alter ego.Why are the female superhero characters always average-faced, androgynysed with male haircuts, scowls, and absolutely dripping with zero visual feminine appeal and loads of masculine energy. Why are they always latino? Would it kill them to make an actual gorgeous, femininely perfected version akin to Chris Reeve? Super characters are meant to be the epitome of human perfection. Not average kids you see at the supermarket. Who can't act but just yell and scream and read words in a monotone voice.This is literally Spiderman multiverse - done horrendously badly, no frills version, with zero of the charm. And it feels it. We've seen all this before. It was cool the first time. Not the twentieth.Poor Keaton is just pure fan service, and feels even more embarrassing. The literal eye roll cringe hearing him repeat original lines that appear perfectly framed in front of a green screen with an almost WINK NUDGE WINK NUDGE DID YOU SEE / HEAR THAT AUDIENCE? Is enough to make one vomit, and even he feels odd saying them. And it is in no way worth the tightening of the 1 out of 100,000 nerd boy's trousers for having including it.The Bold and the Beautiful level script and forced drama are far too often laughable. It FEELS like satire. It FEELS like a Jay and Silent Bob skit that quite literally mocks the entire superhero genre, and minimizes its even greatest of characters. Which is exactly what Keaton's presence does. When little toys on strings and other 80s effects add more gravitas from his original films over the tech marvels (but absolutely hollow / zero depth) we have in today's films, you know you've got massive problems.I absolutely don't know who this movie is for. No children, not adults, not DC fans, not superhero fans, not movie fans. No-one with a brain and an attention span could swallow. Garbage and call it satisfying.FWIW, I LOVED the director's IT work, but this is the kind of fall from grace that one oft doesn't recover from. Having said that, so does Zack's trash. And yet, here we are. When even he isn't around, history still repeats.","12 out of 19 found this helpful.

I wouldn't call it good, but, you know what? I enjoy the mess a bit, and there's enough of an emotional throughline that bookends the film in its first and last act to provide some low level of pathos to the whole insane affair. It doesn't work as a whole, and it's emblematic of the hugely wasteful and overstuffed nature of comic book movies in the early 2020s. However, there are charms to be had.Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) is the janitor of the Justice League, as he explains to Alfred (Jeremy Irons) during an effort to prevent the collapse of a hospital, a result of some kind of assault on it that Batman (Ben Affleck) is trying to resolve on the other side of Gotham. It's here, in the opening action sequence of the film, where it is extremely obvious that the limits of the film's special effects budget was put to the test. Babies falling out of buildings with the Flash saving them in his accelerated state simply look plasticky and fake, but the action is amusing as he has to eat his munchies to up his calorie count and have enough energy to go faster. That this whole sequence ends up pointless, including a cameo from Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is unfortunate. The rest of the movie has nothing to do with it.So, moving on.The actual plot involves Barry deciding to go back in time to prevent his mother's (Maribel Verdu) death by getting her a can of tomatoes during a fateful trip to the grocery store, the small event that led to her murder and his father (Ron Livingston) being blamed for it, putting him in jail. When he tries to go back, he ends up in an alternate timeline where she didn't die, but it's also several years prior. Pretty much everything with Barry's mother is actually quite good, Verdu having a small part that she does well in. However, it's where Miller is his least annoying and most able to reach some form of pathos.Unfortunately, the film turns into a proto-origin story as Barry takes his younger self on a little bit of discovery of his powers, and the younger Barry is just...annoying. He's obviously intentionally so, acting as a less mature counterpoint to older Barry, but it's never that fun to watch. Throw in the fact that the actual plot mechanics of the thing are just repeating stuff that, while never explicitly explained, were easy to figure out, and it feels like a waste of space. When Zod (Michael Shannon), though, shows up and there's no Superman to stop him, the two Barries go in search of Batman, finding Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) having given up the bat mantle in favor of incredibly well-practiced retirement. Together, they figure out that in this timeline (I guess it's more of a Timeline thing of alternate dimensions, though, for some reason, Barry references Back to the Future heavily) there is no Superman, instead there was a Supergirl (Sasha Calle) who landed in Russia whom they have to save.Gosh, this is a busy film, and we haven't even gotten to the extended finale in the desert.However, it is when the finale starts that I get into the film's weird groove. The action is bright, colorful, and clear. There are real stakes. It does enter a loop of death, but that's obviously on purpose. And the movement into the Speed Force to work through the consequences of trying to change time bring the film back to its thematic core. Sure, the special effects are waxy and far from realistic, but I don't consider that some sort of great sin. Miller has to play against himself in a couple of different ways, and it's surprisingly effective.It's not enough to save the film as a whole, but it's enough to keep it from being a complete and total disaster of overstuffed narrative in search for reason to be more than two hours long. It's enough to give me a kick out of the experience.Andy Muschietti threw the kitchen sink into this, and I'm just happy that some of it entertained me along the way. It's a mess, but sometimes I really do get a kick out of messes.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The performances are good, highlighting the protagonist Ezra Miller who achieves two Flash characters with different nuances, the intellectual and the clueless comic, Michael Keaton also gives an incredible performance when he returns to interpret Batman. The soundtrack is good, managing to stay with the public. The cinematography is a great achievement in most of the scenes, also achieving quite good camera movements. The digital special effects are a mixture between well achieved and very bad, on several occasions After Effects is revealed and the graphics look more like those of a video game. For his part, Andy Muschietti's direction is nice, since he is a rather irregular director, he can direct good films and at other times films without charm, as for ""The Flash"" he achieved a quality film. A fun movie with some scenes that get tiresome.","10 out of 24 found this helpful.

It's funny at times, and watching Barry become annoyed with himself is pretty entertaining. Michael Keaton is easily the best part, and his involvement is greater than just a cheap cameo. His Bruce is interesting, tough and fun. I think this movie is worth the watch if you are a fan of the superhero genre and Keaton's batman.

And I am not talking about the movie's merits yet. It just seems so obvious: even for a rubbish Marvel movie the ranks and box office are upwards no matter what. Wandavision S01E01 already had around 8.5rank despite the fact that there was nothing inside there from what the Tv show wanted to present. I believe that there aretoo many of die hard Marvel fans, that if you make a 3h movie showing a wall with paints dry and someone said these paints come from the boots of Thor, Ironman and Spiderman, people would remain watch it and write high ranks comments.To the movie in question now. Despite A. Muscetti's lack of experience, he managed a great requel prequel kind of thing that spaghettifies in a smart way the whole DCU to make an Easter egg equivalent to all Easter eggs of the 7th art history.Michael Keaton was never the ideal Dark Knight for me (Batfleck was), but seeing him like that was such a return to my child years, the 1st loves, the 1st disappointments that it moved me a lot. Before jumping again to re-watch the 1989 classic for the 20th time, I stay here to say that the director did an excellent job depicting him eventually better than before. He caught the essence of T. Burton and J. Snyder and gave us a hell of a ride that felt much less than 2h making me wonder how the clock was so advanced at the end of the movie.I never liked Ezra Miller, so seeing him twice should have been too much. However lets admit that he is not the only one with issues and despite, lets credit him that he did a really fine job here.Indeed there are some CGI issues, but maybe Gunn has some good cards in his sleeves. I will definitely watch anything DC brings us. Can't even wait for more.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I find it refreshing and also I'm surprised and intrigued why this hasn't been done before. Movies usually take things from here and there and they end up building something that not always works..
Anyway, the story is good, it has some humour (not always great though, I'm still struggling with Miller's performance), lots of action and a huge amount of fan service and cameos that the big nerds like me (no shame) will appreciate and enjoy!It's overall a decent movie, but there's something really bad about it: the CGI.What the hell happened to this production ending up looking SO BAD in that department. There's also so much unnecessary CGI of normal people that looks so fake and unrealistic! Example when Flash is travelling in time, the faces on the treadmill are done by CGI, strangely, and everything looks like you're watching a videogame cutscene (and not a great one) instead of a live action movie in the cinema. Flash body looks awful most of the time, regardless the very cool design of the suit. And every scene when the characters meet themselves and one of the faces are made by CGI, it's so horrible that distracted me from what they're actually doing.One more, why Flash moves in slow motion while running? It's like he's gliding instead of giving steps! Really weird!The bad CGI almost ruins the movie for me, it certainly made me lower the rating. I wish it would look better, but as it is, it's an entertaining, decent superhero movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was wrong.I borrowed the Blu-ray from a friend and decided to watch it with a couple of friends. After 10 minutes, everybody in my room was just: ""stop this, this is unwatchable"".Then I said: ""Ok, wait, maybe it gets better when batman shows up, lets skip to that part"".

Its repercussion is serious without trying to make that mambo-jumbo styled tonal shift for the added comedic quirk that fanboys love. It took the case seriously AND made it with known that it has consequences. By the time, the Kryptonians arrived - there are repercussions. Repeated throughout. The tone changed with it. It sticked its landing.Though I would say, the reason it failed is pretty much written in the wind. Miller is hated, the way WB is using old actor is purely cash grab for nostalgia (and rightfully did not work), the CGI was meant to look bad but did not do favors to already negative reaction towards Miller and the Zaslav's cutting off the original Franchise.Overall, not the biggest masterpiece but a better use of 'Multiverse' plot and possibly the best DCEU film since Man of Steel.PS: If the Flash was able to return and found a new Bruce, wouldn't there be another Flash in that universe?","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The soundtrack manages to create a cohesive and immersive experience, enhancing the overall enjoyment of the film.In terms of themes and messaging, ""Flash"" tackles important concepts such as heroism, self-discovery, and the power of perseverance. While the visual effects may falter, the film's exploration of these themes remains impactful, offering audiences moments of reflection and inspiration.In conclusion, ""Flash"" falls short in its visual effects, hindering the overall experience. However, the film manages to compensate with its stellar cast, engaging screenplay, competent direction, impressive practical effects, memorable score, and thought-provoking themes. Despite its flaws, ""Flash"" still provides an enjoyable superhero adventure that fans of the genre can appreciate. While it may not be perfect, it's worth watching for the performances and the story's engaging narrative.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

With a convoluted plot that seemed more interested in confusing the audience than telling a coherent story, this film failed to deliver an engaging narrative. The performances by the cast were lackluster, with no actor managing to bring charisma to their roles. It felt like they were just going through the motions, without any real emotional depth or connection with the characters.The CGI in this film was a major disappointment. Instead of enhancing the viewing experience, it often detracted from it. The special effects looked cheap and unconvincing, which is particularly problematic for a superhero movie where visuals play a crucial role. The action sequences, which should have been a highlight, were marred by the subpar CGI and lacked the excitement and spectacle one would expect from a movie of this genre.The overall tone of ""The Flash"" was chaotic and noisy. The film seemed more interested in bombarding the audience with constant noise and action than in developing a compelling story or meaningful character arcs. It felt like a series of disjointed set pieces strung together with no real purpose or emotional resonance. This made it difficult to become invested in the characters or their struggles, as the film prioritized style over substance.One of the biggest issues with ""The Flash"" was its lack of a clear identity. It attempted to combine elements of various genres and tones, but the result was a confusing mishmash that never quite found its footing. Is it a superhero movie, a time-travel adventure, a comedy, or a drama? The film couldn't seem to decide, and this lack of focus undermined its overall impact.The pacing of the film was also problematic. It felt rushed in some parts and dragged in others, leading to an uneven and unsatisfying viewing experience. The plot twists and turns were often predictable, and the attempts at humor often fell flat. It seemed as though the filmmakers were trying too hard to please everyone, resulting in a movie that ultimately pleased no one.In conclusion, ""The Flash"" from 2023 failed to deliver on multiple fronts. From its convoluted plot to its uninspired performances, subpar CGI, and lack of a clear identity, the film left much to be desired. It was a noisy and disjointed mess that struggled to find its footing, making it a disappointment for both fans of the character and casual moviegoers alike.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

I choose the movies I watch and like based on if I liked the movie or not. I liked it. It wasn't as epic as it was advertised, but that's marketing. It was a good movie and should have made around 350 to 500 million. People are too sensitive and trust that what others cry for and rant about means anything or is real. If I have a gripe about something I will tell that person or business. I don;t have to cry to the world about my bruised ego or be reduced to vampiric journalism. What business is it to the rest of the world unless it causes bodily harm, psychological or PTSD level emotional damage. Stop looking for approval, sympathy or celebrity status at the belittlement of people that live in circles me or you could never understand. Who cares if your rich neighbor has a nice car. Worry about your lemon in the driveway. Anyways, I thought the CGI was cartoonish needed to be just as dark and grittyas the other themed movies and tv shows. Humor is fine just gotta stay in your lane. Other Supermen were bad CGI. Nice surprises and I liked the script and the combination of Flashpoint and intro of Reverse Flash or whomever his alternate timeline self became (Godspeed?). Give these artists more time and respect. They are a very large part of your movie or investment. More time and cooperation = better finished product. Alita: Battle Angel for the win! Marvel used to be better when they released one movie a year. DC was better when focusing on TV or Movies not both. DC has better stories than the justice League though. Avengers, Fantastic Four, Superman, Batman, Justice League I have seen too much of YOU. That is why James Gunn is succeeding. Please choose another epic story to be different and stand out! Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy was a brilliant move. Wake up studios! Wake up Directors. Don't let the masses dictate what media you make (DIsney). F@#$ck em all and let history sort it out. Just be happy that you can watch stuff about a favorite character from your childhood. ...back in my day... Your memory is probably just another casualty to the Mandela Effect. 🤣 Peace.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Batman Keaton was amazing and so was the new Superman. Ezra played a great role and the CGI wasn't bothersome in the least. I kind of know what people mean, but I think they are expecting way too much and honestly probably are hating on Ezra Miller. The movie is back to back laughs with a lot of heart. The Ezra duo was very impressive. There were no moments that broke the suspension of disbelief. If you are looking for Batman and Superman nostalgia this is the movie for you.

Of course, Michel Keaton's Batman is a kind of dream come true, unfortunately there was not enough money for the fuel for the Batmobile, and the Batwing has undergone some dubious modifications over the years. Either way, it kept the movie going, along with other interesting faces throughout the movie, and some good humor. The most disappointing thing is the CGI. I have the impression that Man of Steel was on a much higher level, it was refined, and there is simply a lot and cheap.There's nothing to write down.

There are plenty of scenes where it feels like a kid made it in microsoft paint, but overall it's not really noticeable. I really liked the suit, it feels better than the CW suit. I liked the scene where barry goes into a door and how the molecules go through the door, it feels very well-detailed. The plot is good but not great. It's just a Flashpoint adaptation which could've been way better. In the beginning where we see Barry's calorie watch, it feels cool and could've been used again, i was hoping that but then... Never mentioned again, like come on, Seriously? Supergirl was way under used and didn't even have a proper arc. I really liked Micheal Keaton's Batman and i think it was one of the only great things about the movie. The final battle was AWFUL. It feels uncompleted and way too bad.

I feel like the movie is being attacked by either people how hate Ezra Miller or people how hate that the Snyder universe is getting erased, as well as by people who did not like the marketing for this movie which claim this movie to be the best superhero movie ever.The reality is that this movie is solid. It's not the best movie ever. But it's better than most of the Marvel phase 4 movies. It's better than Eternals, Thor 4, Ant Man Quantumania, Black widow, and better than Shazam, Black Adam, Wonder Woman 1984.There is questionable CGI at times, that's true. But they are brief moments that don't really take away from the experience. The humor mostly lands, because of the funny things that happen to Barry, but the second Barry was kinda annoying.I liked most cameos, I like that the women in this movie are sexy and feminine. Super girl looks great and i hope she stays as super girl in the new James Gunn universe. She has a strong screen presence and for now she isn't the stereotype of Mary Sue or Girl boss that needs no man or anyone because she is better and stronger than anyone else"".She is down to earth, respects men around her, she is compassionate, isn't an insufferable feminist who hates men, while still having her own agency and her own strength. It would be a shame if they replaced her.The message of the movie is: ""Accept what has happened, learn from it, and use that knowledge to guide you in living your best life now"".","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yet, it turned out to be a complete shipwreck!Several reasons factored in its gigantic failure, the major one being the allegations made against Ezra Miller, and this whole fiasco did have a considerable impact on the film's theatrical run.Now, let us keep these things aside and judge this solely from a cinematic standpoint. Is it a terrible movie? No, is it great, then? Not, then what is it? A decent, passable entertainer and that's all!There are some cool visuals, the humour is effective, and on top of all, the story itself digs through (or at least tries to) some interesting themes, mainly the concept of parallel timelines, aka Multiverse!Don't get your hopes too high, though. While the writing does emphasise paradoxes and branched-out timelines caused by this time manipulation, the greater implications do not come off as ostensibly as they would have wanted to. It gets so convoluted in the final moments, I feel; a more efficient direction from behind the camera could have done the job they intended to.P. S.

"6","/10","Even with all the references, ""The Flash"" rarely excites. The battle scenes have few textures and the action is generic and poorly finished accordingly","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9539253/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","3 January 2024","The plot begins with a powerful action scene, in which Barry Allen-Flash (Ezra Miller) is called to help the victims of a terrorist attack in a hospital. While the opening sequence already manages to give us the tone of the film, it also serves as an impetus for us to understand Barry's true intentions and the traumas he has carried for a long time - given that his mother was murdered when he was just a child and that the father took the blame and now awaits a trial that doesn't seem to have a happy ending. It is from there that, moved by the brief spark of hope in restoring a family that was torn apart by a poorly explained tragedy, Barry moves through anguish and melancholy to go back in time and prevent his mother from dying. However, what he did not expect is that his benevolent actions would trigger a series of events foreshadowing the implosion of the multiverse.What would you do if you could go back in time is the maxim that governs the feature film directed by Andy Muschietti - and a question that has certainly crossed our minds. After all, we all make mistakes and feel responsible for having acted differently and fixed what was broken. Barry, in this way, discovers that he has an ability to return to the past, breaking fragile rules of space-time to ""change events"" and ensure the survival of the one he never forgot. Now, it is remarkable how the protagonist is enveloped by a vigilante blindness that makes him forget the butterfly effect - and that takes him on a tortuous journey of reparation and nostalgia. However, no matter how noble his intentions may have been, the plan backfires and he opens a timeline parallel to the one he belongs to, creating a perpendicular rift in the multiverse that predicts catastrophe.For those who watched the trailers and promotional teasers for The Flash, you will probably have few surprises throughout the 140 minutes of the feature film directed by Argentinean Andy Muschietti. From the main special appearances to the apotheotic moments, almost everything had been revealed by Warner-DC's marketing department in the advertising pieces. Which, let's face it, takes a lot of the fun and emotional impact out of scenes like Batman (Michael Keaton) saying his iconic line ""I am Batman"". Surprising moments are really rare, usually references to other incarnations of the publisher's main superheroes in cinema and television. The plot itself shows Barry surprising himself with his ability to navigate between temporal plots and landing in the past to try to change his lonely present of orphanhood (dead mother and imprisoned father). When going back in time, he comes across his 18-year-old version, still without the powers brought by an unlikely combination of chemical elements and lightning fallen from the sky. However, the protagonist did not imagine that this world would be different from his own in certain ways, with several variants and few familiar constants. Batman is a different person, Superman Kal-el has a different destiny, but Zod (Michael Shannon) continues to come to Earth to conquer it and revive his home, Krypton.The Barry of the past is the hero who is reluctant when faced with the call to adventure, but who proves his worth along the journey of maturity. The Barry of the present is the mentor who guides his younger version to learn, thereby demonstrating the ability to be more than Batman's boy wonder - the same dramatic curve as Peter Parker, who proved to be more than Batman's boy wonder of Iron Man. Absolutely everything revolves around these parallel and complementary journeys of the Barrys, but that doesn't make The Flash a serious film about feelings, traumas and adult sensations. In addition to personal controversies, Ezra Miller had proven in other works to be an actor with repertoire, something that in this new super production is only partially valued. An irritating and loud teenager, the Barry of the past gains space and constantly supplants the seriousness of the Barry of the present, who carries the character's tragic tones. Andy Muschietti chooses to give more time and importance to the comic content, thereby sabotaging items such as: the hero's sadness aspects, the obsolescence of Michael Keaton's Batman and the strong personality of Supergirl (Sasha Calle). No wonder, Batman and Supergirl are demoted to mere occasional colleagues. Batman is still valued for its nostalgic aspect, but Krypton's daughter is compromised by the suffocation of drama.In addition to this issue, the film is tonally very strange, with an initial sequence of frantic action in Gotham City that serves to make it very clear that the Flash in this film is the Flash from Justice League, complete with Jeremy Irons' Alfred and the Ben Affleck's Batman (albeit wearing an absolutely hideous version of his costume). At the beginning, the tone is openly comical, with Ezra Miller reveling in his dramatic limitations as a court jester, with the beating itself taking on a veneer that was supposed to be hilarious, but which ends up only generating yellow smiles due to the exaggeration of the whole thing, including a newborn rescue sequence in a hospital featuring horrific visual effects of these babies. Then, in the other universe, the footprint is opposite, darker and heavier, but also more rushed and without Muschietti, at any point, really having the courage to bet his chips on it, which leaves room for inconveniences of displaced humor that they detract from the whole and deflate the drama, especially because the development of the two Barry Allens, especially the youngest, is relegated to the background and then, almost instantly, is accelerated from 0 to 100 without giving time.Another problem that weighs heavily on ""The Flash"", especially in the final third of the projection, is the visual effects. And it's not just a standard complaint about hero films: the thing is bad even by the low standards that Marvel has been presenting lately. The opening sequence, with Flash saving falling babies, is terrible on a PlayStation 2 level and there are several racing scenes that all feel artificial and weightless. And it's something that really hinders the experience, as it takes away the impact of key moments. There are special appearances that are made entirely (and without purpose in certain cases) in CGI that look like rubber and wax dolls with which it is impossible to create any connection. What should be nerd apotheosis becomes just something shameful. Luckily for fans and spectators, Muschietti manages to balance the poverty of the effects with a firm pulse on the progress of the story. In the end, it is thanks to his direction that ""The Flash"" manages to deliver something that DC has never managed before: uncompromised and unpretentious fun.The rest of the film, especially its final minutes once again in the chronosphere, is a search for references and fan service that irritatingly has become the standard for blockbusters of the genre. Out the window goes the story, which is then summarily replaced by the absolute and inescapable emptiness that are the moments that exist only for the viewer to point at the screen and identify this or that character and object more quickly than their friend next door. The cinematic experience, therefore, becomes an uninspired child's game that requires nothing from anyone other than a frankly useless encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture.Even with all the references, ""The Flash"" rarely excites. The battle scenes have few textures and the action is generic and poorly finished accordingly. Post-production is responsible for showing super-powered beings in battles so sumptuous that they lose sight of the human dimension of these extraordinary men and women. And, by the way, the quality of the CGI is not always consistent with the economic power of the production. An initiative full of special appearances, Flash's first solo adventure serves to introduce the concept of the multiverse to DC and make beautiful tributes to his long and sometimes sleepy journey. This journey of weak emotions includes never-before-realized cinematic versions of characters such as Nicolas Cage's Superman (one of the good ideas) and tributes to the precursors of the wave that has reigned for more than 20 years in cinema with a more industrial feel. Furthermore, there are good jokes about changes in timelines - the best of which is about the protagonism of the ""Back to the Future"" Saga. In fact, recharging the ""flux capacitor"" with lightning is another affective borrowing from Robert Zemeckis' creation. However, the solutions are lazy and difficult problems are solved with simplistic strategies - like the lightning bolt that, if replicated, could create armies of Flashes? In the end, even the resolution of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is recycled by DC Comics. Reality almost collapses for the protagonist to learn to accept losses and understand the value of his scars. This film, at least, should be the last of DC's current phase, serving as a reboot of the universe - so it's strange to see a Batman from the past hated by fans appearing in the final scenes in a questionable and confusing participation - it's strange to think that ""Blue Beetle"" and ""Aquaman 2"" would still be released after this production.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was hyped for this movie because I thought this was the one for them finally. It's hard to watch. Ezra Miller is really hard to like in real life with their personal drama but they're somehow even more unlikable on screen. Their jokes or attempts to be humorous are not funny and with a 2 1/2 hour movie they just get annoying and their cursing just served no purpose so when it keeps happening it's just frustrating. The CGI is shockingly bad. Some scenes are like watching a PS2 cut scene. Affleck kills it in his very brief appearance and it just makes you further upset with how Warner Bros just wasted his talent all these years. The cameos are kinda fun, the ones that aren't CGI at least, but the story just drags on in my opinion and parts don't really make sense. They could have stuck to The Flashpoint Paradox but choose a different path to almost create their own version of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" and it feels forced. The action sequences could have been great but they just get ruined by how bad the CGI is. I know the director said they're suppose to be bad but that just can't be true or if it is true it's because they were given no resources to make it better. Overall I didn't enjoy it and my son who loves anything DC fell asleep so not a ringing endorsement of anything attention grabbing.","31 out of 58 found this helpful.

But the movie was a good one to watch at the big screen. Same Flashpoint story ( a pretty decent plot ), acting was acceptable and the cameos were a nice touch for the fans. It had some good laughs and had some very silly ""Ezra"" moments.In short, the film was very enjoyable, over 2 hours and didn't feel that long. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and nailed it! Supergirl vs Zod fight was ok for the poor CGI at moments but I personally don't mind that if I am enjoying a movie.It's an honest 7 / 10 and it's weird to have a really good movie with all the hype and bots writing 10 / 10 reviews lol

I was open to Ezra trying the role but in this movie, he falls flat and fails to impress...at all.... Granted he was in the role previously and did a passable, if not quirky job at it but when given the title role, there just isnt the substance in the writing nor the acting chops to make it fly..I actually fast forwarded thru alot of Ezra;s goofy moments of which there were Many..The silly posing of the characters,in the middle of action scenes, not only the flash but also supergirl, was just over the top and frankly looked ridiculous...That said, some of the better moments were when supergirl was on screen..i liked what Sasha did with the character even though the fight scenes were a stretch to believe..Here you had 2 Kryptonians, supergirl facing Zod, both possessed of hieghtened super powers, yet the 90-lb supergirl was throwing around Zod like he was paper mache'... they were Both from krypton and he was twice and more her size, she shouldnt have stood a chance here but did..Sasha played the character well though with her own unique way of doing it..I liked it! Micheal keaton? Whats not to like? The dude was a highlight of the film along with supergirl and Zod..the Flash himself was for me the low point...this role has been done Infinitely better by others, namely the excellent portrayl by Grant Gustin... seeing Ezra's attempt at a solo role was a letdown and I would hope the role gets passed to more capable hands along with better writing because this was a mess...this movie tries the ""lets add everything And the kitchen sink"" approach along with some not so good CGI with super heroes looking like they were lifted by wire harnesses, which in truth,they were! But the audience should Never get that impression...This hodgepodge is Not a keeper for me..there are so many super hero movies that would put it to shame with actors who do justice to their characters..Henry Cavil was someone who did a superb job in his role yet was dropped yet here you have someone who if dropped, would not be missed ,from this role and yet remains... Who decides these things?","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie gets into thick of it pretty fast and keeps the tempo up till the end. Most of the time it feels unpredictable while some of it is not, half fresh maybe the best way to describe it. I laughed several times almost to tears and a couple times the jokes where so bad it pulled me out. There was a lot of action but kind of forgot it happened, no super cool fast slowmo scenes like for example in x-men. It is hard to say what exactly it lacks. A lot did happen and it was mostly a joyful ride but nothing iconic.

Even though I had very low expectations from the movie, after a couple of recommendations I decided to give it a watch & Thank God I did cause it has so much to offer then people expected. The Complains of VFX being goofy & weird is true for some parts of the movie but for most part it's still comes off nicely done. The plot deters from the comics a little which was a fun surprise. The first act was kind of goofy but nothing you might hate. Ben Affleck, Micheal Keaton & Sasha Calle outshone Ezra in the movie in all the right ways. The second & third act of the movie were so unexpected that I actually had to rewind some of the parts and analyse frame by frame. The conclusion was very satisfying with a cool cameo to end the film and with it the DCEU. Although the film recieved criticism & hate mainly due to Ezra's real life issues, I still think it is one of the better movies we have seen from DC & may very well be on the levels of No Way Home & Multiverse of Madness if it wasn't for some sloppy parts & Ezra Miller'S weird if not goofy acting. A great watch as a Superhero Genere fan & would recommend watching it yourself before listening to all the comments.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Just like me, who had once lost hope and had no expectations, the moment I saw it was released, it ignited my hope again. To be honest, the current word-of-mouth ratings of The Flash among other Superhero movies are not as bad as I thought, which can be considered a surprising or comforting thing. I think Ezra has shown everyone his outstanding acting skills, as well as his dedication and love for the character, Barry Allen. Unfortunately, the work itself was obviously born out of time. But after going through so many obstacles, I wouldn't be surprised about what would happen next. After 8 years of tough breed, the script is almost overturned and rebuilt every year... Now I have to be satisfied with this final presentation, and even feel fortunate to be able to see it in the cinema. Although it sounds like an excuse, box office is not the only criterion for testing a work. I will be more thankful if The Flash can once leave something, or anything in DC or Superhero movie history. Deep helplessness from a fan, man.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Thankfully, I went with low expectations and wanting only to watch 5 minutes of Keaton's Batman, and that's what I got.The dreadful lead performance (both of them) and poor CGI are so glaringly/prominently bad that they transform an otherwise play, albeit very poorly written, story structure into an almost unwatchable film.There's no other way to describe it, but ezra sucks. His acting and mannerisms do not provide enough for anyone to care about the character (instead, the opposite, real life included). Then, the script is structurally uninteresting. In fact, it feels like the movie is missing pieces.. and some of the parts they did decide to include just makes the experience even worse. There's no consistency in its time-traveling rules, or even with previous entries in the ""franchise"".As a bit of a surprise, Sasha Calle is given a decent role and she performs it very well! She also looks great in it, much more so than I expected. But it is another comic storyline that is used for nothing...
Now, the biggest surprise was Maribel Verdú, whom I liked VERY much. The only part with ""weight"" comes from her part and acting. So, the movie isn't devoid of everything.. it's simply that the parts to get there are underwritten and lacking in imagination (even if her emotional role is tired and overdone).Stay home.You aren't missing anything that is not on the trailers, and the action and developments are too simplistic! Warner Brothers allowing ezra to lead a movie by himself was a weird choice, but to not even address his real-life antics, while letting him finish the project? The scores and box-office results were deserved.","58 out of 118 found this helpful.

I was really wanting this film to be great & well in - in some aspects it was. The opening action sequence was disappointing as the C. G. was Not to the standard we expect nowadays especially given that it's a DC film. I can only assume they did not want to invest any more funds on a dead franchise. The writers should have re-written the sequence but regardless, I found it fun & entertaining. Ezra is Ezra & his alternate version is annoying but it's addressed & acceptable.Michael Keaton is what lured me & he didn't disappoint. The nostalgia of the O. G. is very cool & I was thrilled that the musical theme from Batman the Animated Series was used ! There are some scenes which run long but again, it's not detrimental to the movie. The overall story is solid, simple & stays the course. Supergirl is used sparingly & I was pleased that she wasn't another Captain Marvel but there were slight indicators that she could've gone down that path. To finish without ranting on.. the ending is very sentimental & MUCH nostalgia & respect is given to the foundation of DC superheroes which I absolutely loved. In summary - the cons are the CG effects & some slight bad acting from Supergirl & Ezra on Red Bull. The Pros- the movie was very enjoyable & the tributes given were very well done & will bring a smile & tears to your face. This film brought a memorable end to the DC franchise that sadly did not live up to expectations like Marvel did.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

James Gunn cannot save it because there are too many voices from the corporate side that bring the quality down or don't let the artist do their thing. No surprise there. Andy Muschietti is a good director, a great director for horror movies, but he couldn't save it.Neither the 4 versions of Batman that we see here. Not even the Nicholas Cage thing that all the fans know about. Definitely not the questionable CGI. The story however is the strong point because it's a very ""Flash"" kind of story. He is OP here and the story only work for and with him. I was entertained, it had funny moments, it has member-berries moments as well, it was fan service. Superwoman was cool, dumb-dumb Barry was obnoxious, just like a 18 year old should be.For me, it worked.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This forever delayed and constantly rewritten and reshot cinematic Frankenstein trashes them all. The film´s take on Batfleck is especially bad and sets the tone for the out-of-character disaster to follow. The CG and choreography mostly suck, the musical choices and the humor are embarrassing and both villains are among the worst comics films can offer. Supergirl is barely in it btw. Has there ever been a comic character more cursed by live-action adaptations than her? The one thing I actually like is the present-day version of Barry and I can see the Snyder Cut version growing into him even if the film refuses to connect to either version of JL and The Flash´s ""canonical"" prequel comics. Ezra´s other performances suck and I hope to never see the actor again for obvious reasons. Flash, I prefer Wally, is a great character and deserves a film series void of member berries, nostalgia and CG cameos (of dead actors!). Who´s idea was it to make a Flash film without a single proper Flash villain!?! The first 2 seasons of the CW show proved the potential the core Flash lore has. Let´s hope we get luckier next decade as the IP is about to be put on ice due to the film´s projected box-office disaster.Josstice League (3/10) is one of the worst blockbusters of all time so the DCEU´s worst film is set in stone but this and Black Adam are the runner-ups. WB remains a mess and is cash poor so I have limited hope for Gunn´s chance to succeed with his 2025 reboot but the worst has to be behind us and only 2 more Walter Hamada films are set to release. Both in 2023. Poor Aquaman... Let´s hope that Batman and Batman spin-offs won´t be all DC fans will have to look forward to on the big screen.PS: I fully believe that the Hamada Cut of this hacked-together film could have been a forgettable 5/10 instead of the irritating 4/10 Gunn&Safran Cut we have now but someone else will have to ride that hashtag.","47 out of 94 found this helpful.

There are plenty of times throughout where I could definitely see the green screen and the artificiality of the CGI. I also feel that the more I sit down and marinate on parts of the story/screenplay, the more messy they can get.........and most of it IS spoilers regarding this film AND the overall DCEU timeline (which I won't reveal).With all that being said, though, I do think The Flash is one of the better superhero/comic-book films in recent memory. It's fairly consistent with the story it wants to tell and does add some profound emotional gravitas that I was quite... proud of. The action sequences (despite some iffy special effects) were really fun and lively. The humor mostly lands and I laughed my ass off in specific scenes. Andy Muschietti proves himself to be a great genre-fluid director with some notably gorgeous framing compositions & unanimously great performances.Benjamin Wallfisch's score is phenomenal, by the way. I thought was hearing Danny Elfman at first. That's how good it is.Controversies regarding Ezra Miller aside, that is someone who can truly carry a film on their own. In the case of this film, it's a difficult performance to translate to the big screen. There are two incarnations of Barry Allen in this film (which is revealed in the trailers), and dual roles are usually challenging. But, Ezra Miller does it so effortlessly, and I have to give credit where credit is due.I appreciate that The Flash has a timely message: you can't always rekindle or rewrite mistakes and tragedies in your past. It's in the past for a reason, and no matter how much you wanna alter it, those things can't always be altered. That is a real aspect of life, despite it being displayed through the lens of the superhero genre. It captures the true beauty of this character through said message.Lastly, I'm proud to say that the superhero films we've gotten in recent memory have not used the multiverse trope just for gimmicks.After what almost feels like countless decades of this film being in development hell, and even despite its flaws, The Flash (to me) is largely a worthy accomplishment.See this one in theaters, too.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

For that, and with decent performance from the cast, except Calle, and the NOT-ALL-BLACK-AND-DARK feeling, it's a reasonably good movie. 8/10 maybe.But OMG, have you seen the CGI of this one? H. O.

Following heavy praise of this film after its early showings there was a lot to look forward to going into this, but once again the DCEU never fails to disappoint. You would think that a film heavily dependant on CGI would be capable of pulling off scenes in 2023 that could leave an audience in awe, but the opening sequence would show you otherwise and show you what to expect. I still stand strongly on the fact that I never approved the casting of Ezra Miller as Barry Allen in the DCEU(add on top the news and controversy) hopefully this may be the last time we see him as the speedster.Now onto the positives, Sasha Calle had a good introduction into the DCEU with her role as Supergirl. Very good emotion shown from her even with he very limited screen time. Michael Keaton brought a lot of nostalgia to this film reprising his Batman as I'm sure most people expected. From a story standpoint I did enjoy as it showed why heroes are who they are and the importance it brings to their purpose. As well as some of the dialogue was a lot funnier then I thought the film would've been.Lastly without any spoilers, there were a lot of cameos with a mix of some being cool and some being there just to be there tried to help the film connect to the viewers but overall was useless. Ending with one of the worst end credit scenes I've ever had to watch ""The Flash"" has more cons to outweigh the pros and leads to a 3/5 star film, on the fence with a 2.5. Definitely a film that was overhyped in my opinion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Led by the commendable performance of Ezra Miller, a marked improvement from his previous appearance in Justice League, the movie brings forth a captivating plot and unique representation that caters to a broad audience.The film impresses particularly with its representation of diversity, a much-needed departure from the traditional superhero mould. The introduction of a Latin Supergirl breaks ground and serves as an inspiring symbol for Latin communities worldwide. It is indeed an extraordinary sight that widens the scope of superhero representation, leading younger generations to believe, quite rightfully, that anyone can don the cape and step into the shoes of a superhero.Unfortunately, the film stumbles when it comes to its CGI effects. Despite living in an era where high-quality graphics and special effects are the norms, this movie must deliver on this front. The visual elements, quite conspicuously, are the movie's Achilles heel. However, if viewers can overlook this drawback and engage with the story and characters, the film promises an enjoyable cinematic experience.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Offering extraordinary performances, a thought-provoking script, pioneering CGI, and a notable addition of a past legend, this film provides a sensory and intellectual banquet that exceeds expectations in the most unpredictable and satisfying ways.At the heart of the movie is the exceptional performance by the protagonist, who delivers a remarkably human and multidimensional portrayal of The Flash. His performance, balancing the character's inherent wit and humor with an emotional depth that resonates deeply, is nothing short of brilliant.The film's script serves as a testament to the power of smart storytelling. It threads together a narrative that is complex and layered, filled with surprising twists that demand an active, engaged audience. This film isn't simply about high-octane action or saving the world; it challenges you to think, to question, and to piece together a puzzle that, once solved, offers a rewarding ""Eureka!"" moment.One cannot discuss ""The Flash"" without addressing the eagerly anticipated return of Michael Keaton as Batman. His presence isn't merely a nostalgic nod to the past but serves to elevate the entire movie, adding an extra layer of richness to the narrative dynamics.Interestingly, the movie gives the concept of the multiverse a fresh, captivating spin, taking a trope that has been explored extensively in other films and series and breathing new life into it. The multiverse here serves to add a fascinating dimension to the storyline and the characters within this universe.Beyond the riveting action and heady concepts, ""The Flash"" is also brimming with humor. The film is peppered with moments that will make you laugh out loud, moments that add a lightness to the narrative and endear the characters to you even more.And yes, expect to feel a lump in your throat. ""The Flash"" isn't merely an action-packed superhero adventure; it's a beautifully told story that resonates with authentic human emotion. There are moments in the film that take you by surprise, touching your heart when you least expect it.The film wraps up with a solid, satisfying ending that neatly ties up the narrative threads, a testament to the overall strength and consistency of the film. It's a film that's not only thoroughly engaging from start to finish but also exceptionally well-executed.""The Flash"" is more than a superhero movie; it's a film that will make you fall in love with the character anew. If you've ever been ambivalent about The Flash, this movie is likely to secure a special place for him in your heart. ""The Flash"" doesn't just entertain; it moves you, makes you think, makes you laugh, and leaves a lasting impression. It's an exceptional cinematic journey that stays with you long after the credits have rolled.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first 10 minutes of the film seem promising but leads to the most boring hour of my life. Ezra miller was the worst part of this movie, thank god for Ben Affleck and Keaton who was the star of the movie. Once the movie gets to the climax it seems rushed and unclimatic, using footage from previous movies to wrap other an otherwise boring movie. This movie can only be described as a complete missed opportunity of something that could have been an amazing movie and an incredible restart to the Dv universe.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Fury Of The Gods and The Flash. If Walter Hamada is the man that's responsible for the DC Studios films that got released in the last few years, he deserves praise, in my opinion, because I enjoyed seeing almost every DCEU film that got released from 2019 to 2023. The Flash, in particular, is my favorite film of this year so far. Sure, it's not as good as, let us say, Across The Spider-Verse, but it affected me the most. The Flash is admittedly silly at times, but almost everything else in this film works well. It's clear that plenty of effort and money went into making The Flash. After The Suicide Squad (2021), The Flash is my favorite film in the DCEU. First of all, the cast, especially Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton, delivered good performances. The Flash does seem like a star vehicle for Miller. There are a few scenes in the film that are actually moving. This is something that can be said about only several superhero movies that got made in the last decade because most of them attempted to deliver only laughs and entertainment. But The Flash still features some effective comedy. One of the reasons why The Flash is often effective is because it features a good music score by Benjamin Wallfisch. What's also worth mentioning is that The Flash is kind of like a comeback for the American flag. The American flag is in the film for a bit and it looks glorious when it appears. The American flag hasn't looked this good in a film for about a decade or more. Sure, the American flag isn't a very good actor. The performances of the American flag are mostly stiff and of one note. But the American flag doesn't get cast in films because of its acting chops. It gets cast because of its good looks. There were rumors that the American flag had turned to drugs, and perhaps this is the reason why it looked bad in the films in which it appeared in the last decade. But I'm here to tell everyone that the American flag is back! Not since the 1990s has the American flag looked this good on screen. Perhaps the American flag has been spending time at the gym and consuming dietary supplements.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I thoroughly enjoyed myself pretty much from start to finish.Why did I ever consider skipping this movie? The Flash has been handled pretty poorly in previous DCEU movies. He was supposed to act as the comic relief, but just came of as the annoying one. It must have been the writing, because I was not annoyed by Ezra Miller in this movie, they even made me sympathise and feel for him by the conclusion of the third act.The story broadly follows the Flashpoint storyline. He goes back to save his mom from dying and breaks the timeline continuity. But in this movie instead of meeting Thomas Wayne-Batman, he meets Keaton Batman and Supergirl.The main reason why I went was ""My Batman"" i.e. Keaton. He was awesome in the movie once again. On top of that there is a bunch more fan service which I never thought I'd live to see onscreen. I will not spoil it for you, not to rob you of the surprise but some of the easter eggs in there were very satisfying to see.Supergirl is likeable in the movie. I feared she'd be handled similarly to Captain Marvell, but she is pretty sympathetic and I hope she'll return in later movies.The Humor worked. It did not outstay its welcome. Dramatic moments are left to be dramatic, funny moments are funny. The balance is done right unlike in the last 5 or so MCU movies.The CGI, well, people complain about it but honestly I thought it looked fine. The story distracted me enough not to care about the green screen scenes.To conclude, I'd just have to agree with what Chris Stuckman said in his review: I am a fan, let me be serviced :D.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

They bring a unique charm to the character, capturing both the youthful exuberance and emotional depth of Barry Allen. Miller's portrayal adds a layer of relatability to the character, making it easy for audiences to invest in their journey.Michael Keaton's return as Batman after three decades is nothing short of triumphant. His presence brings a nostalgic thrill to the film, and he effortlessly slips back into the role, reminding us why he is considered one of the iconic portrayals of the Dark Knight. Similarly, Sasha Calle delivers a fine performance as Supergirl, bringing a refreshing energy and providing a strong counterpart to the Flash.Ben Affleck's extended cameo as Batman offers a compelling mix of action and meaningful drama. Despite an atrocious Batsuit design, Affleck seizes the opportunity to showcase his talent, leaving a lasting impact on the story. If this is his swan song, he leaves on a high note.The action set pieces in The Flash are a true highlight, offering exhilarating sequences that make great use of the Flash's super-speed and the visual representation of the Speed Force. The film presents inventive ways of depicting the Speed Force, providing a fresh and exciting visual experience.While most of the visual effects are impressive, there are moments where some CGI falls short of expectations. These occasional lapses detract slightly from the overall immersion but do not significantly hinder the enjoyment of the film.With numerous cameos and a steady supply of fan service, The Flash is a treat for fans invested in the history of DC Comics. To fully appreciate these appearances and avoid spoilers, it is highly recommended to see the film as soon as possible.It is worth noting that there is one brief end credits scene that takes a humorous approach, poking fun at some elements of the Snyderverse. While it adds a lighthearted touch, it may leave some fans with a slightly sour note as the film concludes.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10/10.Native 4K theatrical presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 7/10.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was excited but once I saw the rating and some of the reviews and footage, I lost most interest. But still, I thought I'd check it out once it streamed mainly because Michael Keaton is in it.Let's start with the CGI. A lot of it looks insanely bad. Harry Potter's first quidditch lesson bad. PS2 bad. This is a big budget 2023 movie, it shouldn't look like this. I dunno if they just ran out of money or didn't care. Having said that, some of it also looks pretty cool, especially some of the action scenes near the end.Ezra Miller is a very talented actor. I feel torn because he seems to have a lot of issues to the point I'm surprised they even still hired him. Is he just troubled or actually dangerous? I also have to say that his insistence on ""they"" as a pronoun is very patronising and confusing - I can't believe Wikipedia seems to have gone along with this. He's clearly a guy, and he can have whatever sexuality he wants.But anyway, Miller is actually quite good in the lead role. In fact, he plays two characters, or at least, two versions of the same character. And that part of the VFX worked pretty well. It's easy to forget that it's the same guy and that he can never actually interact with himself.Miller is good in both the comedic and dramatic parts of the movie. To the point that I was laughing and moved many times, far more than I'd ever expected. The performance feels very sincere and the subject matter is pretty universal. As bizarre and silly as much of the movie is, some of the scenes worked quite well.Michael Keaton was great as usual, although it felt like he didn't have a huge amount to do. I liked many of the subtle nods to his movies, but not so much the obvious nods. If the movie has to grind to a halt so he can say ""THE LINE"", it's not worth it. But if we get little details on the screen or choices of wording which many people won't notice, and which don't slow down the momentum of this movie, then it's worth it.I tend to hate unnecessary gender/race swaps in movies, but Sasha Calle was really good as Supergirl. It was a relatively dark, sad and intense take on the character, but I really liked it. It felt sincere and that's what matters. You feel her anger and some of the action worked pretty well. Still, some of the earlier action scenes with her looked ridiculous, with absurd physics and very dodgy CGI. But her performance and brief arc were really good - I'm surprised she hasn't been in more movies.I was far less impressed by Kiersey Clemons who I could barely stand. I don't like to be mean, but personally, I didn't find her remotely attractive, believable or good at acting. She felt out of place and really uninteresting to watch. I have to wonder how she got the role. It felt awkward seeing Miller trying to act like he was head-over-heels in love with her, it just didn't make sense.Part of the reason Supergirl worked was that there's no emphasis on her being a girl, no ""girl boss"" moments, no unnecessary bringing down of men to prop her up, etc. No reference to her being stronger or wiser than Superman. In contrast, Wonder Woman's brief (and yet still slow-paced) appearance results in 3 men being embarrassed. That scene wasn't really funny.For example, Wayne mutters about maybe he should end poverty to fight crime rather than fight criminals. Pretty stupid, trite stuff. When welfare was expanded in the US, crime went up. There are no excuses for violent crime so Batman is doing just fine beating up criminals.An early scene involving saving babies was very absurd and was a bad note for the movie to begin on. The tone just didn't work. Endangering babies is very hard to sell as funny. And it had some of the worst CGI I've ever seen.The cameos near the end were kind of nice, but didn't really mean anything. They were just arbitrary. I'm left wishing they could have found some meaningful way to connect them to the rest of the story. I don't mind a bit of nostalgia here and there if it's done respectfully and if you've built up to it enough. It's something that could work, but the overall movie and plot just couldn't properly justify it - they did nothing with the concept.The music is okay - better than many superhero movies these days. But it's nothing compared to the work of Elfman or Williams who scored Batman (1989) and Superman (1978) respectively. The Batman theme is quoted, but the last chord is changed which ruins it. Why do that? Modern composers seem to be far less talented and disciplined than their predecessors. There are no memorable new themes here, although the music does its job well enough for some scenes to be decent.The Flash is a mess, there's no way to deny that. The DCU (or whatever you call it) has completely fallen apart. This movie barely holds together even without the time-twisting aspects. But good actors and some good ideas here and there elevate the material. Ezra Miller has huge potential as an actor - way above average in both comedy and drama, not to mention interacting with himself. Keaton and Calle are really good as well.There are parts that are actually moving, some brief moments are rousing and exciting. The ideas have potential. But a lot of the comedy is just bad. The tone is inconsistent. The plot is ultimately dumb. But I have to judge by the best strengths of the movie, I have to try my best to enjoy it, and somehow, I actually found many parts of it quite enjoyable.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't like the visual effects of Flash running - the lightning, he waits as an Olympic runner before he starts running, the effects of slow things around him. Scenes from X-Men Quicksilver are much better at this point.But the message the movie passes is very good; what motivates Barry in his journey, his story is good and legitimate, some dialogues make you think in your own life, and, oh, the nostalgic part is fantastic, especially if you are 40+. There is a role/character that did not even go on air then (this one was funny).Do those good parts make it worth it? That's subjective.

For myself, I imagined that this was an artistic choice and was done to add a cartoonish atmosphere to the film, and it positively affected my enjoyment of the film.The movie is divided into two. In the first half of the movie, Barry Allen is a very difficult character to watch with the personality traits written for Ezra Miller. The movie is based on the very popular Flashpoint comic book story. As you progress through this story, and once the focus shifts from Barry Allen and his third-rate attempt to make the audience laugh, the movie's viewing pleasure increases a lot. The movie also borrows a lot of material from the movie 'Man of Steel'. I accept this as an admission that they failed heavily in the series except for that movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

While I recognize all the flaws of both his trilogy of films and the thought-process that was responsible for rushing them to theatres, ""Man of Steel,"" ""Batman V Superman,"" and ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"" are all movies that I hold near and dear to my heart, faults and all. Even in the films not directed by Snyder, I enjoy the universe set up in the DC movies. So, I was really looking forward to ""The Flash,"" excited to see the swan song to the DCEU before James Gunn's cinematic reboot. And how does ""The Flash"" stack up? Ehhhhhhh.You've probably seen the insane amount of press this movie had; with everything from Super Bowl ads to celebrity endorsements to near-constant TV spots and YouTube advertisements, ""The Flash"" was advertising itself to be the best comic book film of all time, rivaling Nolan's ""The Dark Knight."" Not an easy task, to be sure, but with Stephen King and Tom Cruise singing their praises to the heavens, I, for one, was fooled into thinking this really would be one of the great super hero movies. And it's not! But what it is, is a perfectly serviceable, even entertaining, movie, but one that suffers from tonal clashes and inconsistencies.""The Flash"" begins with an appropriately bombastic opening, one that serves to show off the powers of our titular hero. Akin to the Quicksilver scenes in past ""X-Men"" films, you'll witness Ezra Miller's Barry Allen as he races to save the lives of innocent bystanders caught in a life-threatening predicament. It's an admittedly fun sequence, one that's played for laughs, filled to the brim with visual gags and Barry's trademarked ADHD behavior. And after watching said sequence, you might find yourself thinking that you're in for a similarly wacky ride throughout the entire duration of the movie. That's where you'd be mistaken. Moving from zany comedy to stark drama to over-the-top action (rinse and repeat), ""The Flash"" has an identity crisis, so much so that you can almost hear the studio meddling as you watch the film. It's unclear whose vision this is - is it Andy Muschietti's, the studio's, or James Gunn's, or some sort of Frankenstein-esque combination of all three? My money's on Frankenstein.So, you'll see Ezra Miller mourn the loss of his mother in one scene, engage in silly slapstick in the next scene, and traverse the multi-verse (portrayed with shockingly noticeable CGI) in the next. The movie does not know what it wants to be; and instead of sticking to one, consistent tone, it tries to marry a myriad of different tones together in an effort to please as many people as it can. And you know what the worst part is? When ""The Flash"" allows itself to become the drama it seems to want to be, it's really, really good.The last 45 minutes of this movie does contain some of the best super hero drama I've seen since I can't remember when; it's emotionally resonant and engaging, it tugs at your heart strings at times, and it's appropriately intense and adrenaline pumping. It's everything I wanted this movie to be! But it's like the producers were afraid to let this movie just be a drama, because before you get to this you have to sit through two hours of out of control comedy. And in a way, I get it. The backlash against ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman V Superman"" being ""too dark"" made the studio course correct every future DC film. But ""The Flash"" isn't a dark movie - it's a dramatic one, and it should've been allowed to be dramatic.I hope my review made sense, because I seem to be having some difficulty articulating what I want to say (must be due to the fact that I'm sober right now). In conclusion, I'll say that this isn't a bad movie. You can see this and probably have some fun with it, and I will certainly be buying this when it comes out on Blu-Ray to rewatch with my family. However, I can't help but feel disappointed as I watched this film, because I can see the greatness underneath that was not allowed to come to fruition.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film is an absolute train wreck that leaves audiences wishing they could run as fast as the titular superhero just to escape this mess. The CGI in this movie is so horrendously bad that it's laughable - and not in a good way. It's as if they hired an intern who just learned how to use a 3D modeling software and decided to handle all the visual effects on a shoestring budget. From the poorly animated lightning bolts to the hilariously awkward slow-motion sequences, the CGI alone is enough to make your eyes bleed.But wait, it gets worse. The script for ""The Flash 2023"" is an insult to storytelling and character development. It's filled with clichés and cringeworthy dialogue that would make even the most ardent fan of the superhero genre cringe in embarrassment. The plot is a jumbled mess of time-travel mumbo-jumbo, poorly explained motivations, and plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. It's as if the writers were just throwing random ideas at the wall and hoping something would stick.As for the performances, the actors seem to be struggling to keep the audience entertained, and who can blame them? With such a lackluster script and nonexistent character arcs, it's a wonder they managed to get through filming without breaking down in tears of frustration. Even the usually charming and charismatic lead actor can't save this sinking ship.""The Flash 2023"" feels like a rushed attempt to cash in on the popularity of superhero movies without any regard for quality or coherence. The action scenes are forgettable at best and cringe-inducing at worst, with CGI so bad that you'll wish you were watching a cheap 90s cartoon instead.To top it all off, the movie suffers from severe pacing issues, dragging on for what feels like an eternity. It's like being trapped in the speed force with no way out. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, hoping that the torture would end soon.In conclusion, ""The Flash 2023"" is an abysmal failure on every level. The CGI is laughably bad, the script is a disaster, and the performances are lackluster. It's a shame to see such a beloved character and franchise treated with such disrespect. Save your money and your precious time, and run away from this movie as fast as The Flash himself.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

The film had presented itself as the conclusion of the story arc concerning the DCEU that started with Man of Steel and instead it turned out to be a film simply about the Flash that does not close any circle, on the contrary it opens new ones while knowing that there will be no other fil concerning the DCEU since James Gunn is already working on a new DC-branded universe. Leaving aside this detail the film is divided into 2 parts, the first one is terrible with scenes that are aberrant to say the least with CGI from Playstation 2 (I still wonder how we can see such bad CGI after years of work) that introduces the story and tells the Flash's origins but without going into too much detail also adding a second terrible and unbearable Flash. In the first part of the movie we also see how they wanted to ruin Ben Affleck's Batman by introducing him with an AMAZING chase which I personally liked but unfortunately as soon as it ends they make him make funny faces and make him say sentences without any logical sense like a fool. In the second part instead let's say there is more meat, we have the return of Keaton's Batman (chilling), the return on the big screen of the very great Zod, for the first time we see Supergirl and lots but lots of action scenes (always with terrible CGI). I don't want to give spoilers about this movie but let's just say:
1) It is disappointing if one falls for it at the trailers;
2) The CGI is terrible;
3) Affleck underrated;
4) Keaton overrated;
5) Zod is Zod.That said, I recommend viewing to all because some people may like it anyway.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

There where moments which made me laugh and caught me surprised, that's amazing as new Shazam Godly mess for example was nothing like this.It is a synthesis of several stories from animated Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox which is a bit darker one, to other depictions of same story I saw over the years. I like it has its own twists like Kara (which I would say is much nicer and more Supergirl at least for me than serial one blonde useless mess) and many small alterations which I would suspect were driven by money and samo make story really interesting. Showing of several different Batmen and new explanation of timelines is a nice touch.Will not spoil it, but I would say it is good time spent over a decent movie. Good action, nice pace and dialogues are not so forced, came natural in many places which should be not as idiotic explanation in some of movies.Solid 7/10 - BTW: end was funny and some guest appearances amazing, especially in their age...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Some of the CGI looked like it was from a game and some transitions were very abrupt but it didn't really affect the film. I found the ending to be a well done finish to the story.

They even had a perfect exit strategy to recast Ezra Miller, given that the plot revolves around alternate realities and different versions of DC characters. I am baffled as to why they proceeded, especially considering how entirely uncharming Miller is throughout the movie.The movie begins with Miller very hamfistedly portraying someone that is clearly meant to be on the spectrum, with all the sensitivity of Sia's musical movie catastrophe. Typical of contemporary representation modalities, autism is depicted as being primarily characterized by obnoxious, self-centered demanding behavior. I am not sure exactly what they hoped to accomplish by establishing the ""hero"" like this.Even more puzzling is the fact that the viewer is soon introduced to a more annoying version of Miller that seems to be channelling a mangled version of Keanu from the original Bill & Ted movie. This incarnation is so irritating that the writers broke the fourth wall and had the original version of the character having a vocal moment of realization of how annoying he, himself, is. At that point, I didn't know what to do but throw up my hands in resignation.On the more production related side, it's basically as bad as others have been saying with some consistency. The CGI is PS2 cutscene quality at a lot of points. The editing and plot pace is fumbling. The fanservice is almost completely constrained to the surface with little integration into the plot in any meaningful way. It comes across as a flimsy gimmick to add gravity to a pretty thin main plot - and achieved with some of the most half-baked conceptual visualization I can recall from recent cinematic history.On top of everything, the protagonist is hardly any sort of hero, considering the majority of the conflict was his own doing and the larger effects of temporal meddling are clearly left unresolved. I doubt it endears the character more to the audience having constant fisheye close-ups of Miller's gormless reactions. Maybe that's just me!I dunno, just thought this thing stunk essentially from top to bottom - a stench only intensified by the baggage brought by the main actor's disturbing reputation and the industry plowing ahead despite all the reasons own the loss or pivot in their approach. Instead they astroturfed early critic screenings and fed them to news outlets to try to cover up the obviously ill-advised festering greed and delusion that made this movie possible.","27 out of 52 found this helpful.

The story of the flash is a reworking of the classic story from the comics and more recently the tv show with Grant Gustin. Here's my take, I don't really like Ezra Millers character here, I found his performance annoying but it's different from the Grant Gustin flash and played as a continuation of the breathless awkward speed freak seen in previous Zack Snyder movies. When the alternate Barry is encountered, he's played as a different personality and the 'what if' seen in back to the future 2 is played out, with Barry's personality with his mothers influence is seen. After an act of let's get the band together, which is well thought and played and an alternate time travel trope is explored. I have to say Keaton steals the show, but the work of Ezra Miller was laying the two Barry's is very good, and the special effects work to bring these together on screen never looks odd (for example check out Van dammes double impact - it's horrible with overacting aplenty), we get to the final act and the 'big fight', and these is the bit where cgi takes over, and I've seen better. In fact there are sections where I thought it was on a par with the rock in the mummy returns. As far as the movie goes, it's enjoyable, just watch with an open mind.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now, onto the movie itself.Let's be honest, this film had some decent moments, but it's like trying to run a marathon in brand new shoes - you stumble a few times. The storyline with Barry messing with the timeline, multiverses, and older versions of himself got me scratching my head more than trying to figure out time travel. It felt a bit convoluted, like trying to untangle a messy ball of yarn. And speaking of messy, the CGI during the battle with Zod's forces left me longing for some cleaner action scenes.But hey, it's not all bad news in Central City. The chemistry between Barry and Supergirl was electrifying, and their teamwork brought some much-needed spark to the film. Plus, the emotional arc with Barry coming to terms with his mother's death was a touching aspect. So, while The Flash had its flaws, it still delivered some super-powered entertainment.

Ezra Miller proves himself once again a capable actor in the role, this time portraying two Flashes and with good comedic effect. However it also proves the limits both of The Flash character and perhaps Ezra Miller range. The films plot is the long way around the short story, initiated by The Flash's attempt to rewrite history to save his mother's life, and also save his father from incarceration after he is wrongfully convicted of her murder.The Flash has decent pacing, but at time the woeful CGI is so jarring its almost a show stopper. Its too much CGI and also not good CGI, which is where all DC films seem to suffer. When The Flash enters another time line, or strand of the multiverse, it is done well Michael Keating makes an excellent return as a clapped out batman drawn out of retirement. But the Super Girl character and baddie Kryptonians are utterly 2 dimensional.The Flash has a happy ending, but its a tinny ending to a film that already suffers badly from the CGI and a stretched story. Satisfying for non-fans, but probably forgettable for all who see it. For reasons other than Ezra Miller's real life shenanigans I don't except there will be a another Flash movies. This movie probably only proved there was not need even for one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

At all.The story also makes no sense.I get they wanted to do Flashpoint again, but we've seen that story, which was crap and stupid when it was a comic, a half dozen times including relatively recently in the Flash TV show, as it was an entire season of that show.It's a shame that the writing is much worse than a badly and generically written CW TV show.It's also a shame that they put zero thought into the script at all. They wanted time shenanigans and quips and CGI, and that's it.So the idea was bland, because nobody gave a crap about it being any good to start with, and then forgot that when you go back in time that it doesn't effect anything before the point you go back to.Imagine if in Back To The Future, Marty McFly goes back to 1955, and him doing so made Doc be born female decades earlier for some reason. That would be stupid and would mean the writers were stupid, wouldn't it?It's not fun, Miller cannot act, and the CGI looks like crap.Nobody went to see it because it looked terrible, and comes as a part of a string of terrible movies, and the word of mouth is that it's sub-par at best.The reviews are generally favourable, but that's because the only people who went to see it are the sort of people who like this kind of absolutely terrible dreck.I only saw it on the high seas to see if it was bad as I thought it looked, and it took multiple bites at the apple as I kept turning it off and doing something else out of boredom, because there is nothing at all worth watching here.","21 out of 39 found this helpful.

But, undeniably, I think this movie also had a lot more heart than previous ones. There are good plot beats. Especially the super girl ones. And just plain fun ones, like with Batman.The result is a really weird movie that is kind of hard to rate, since I really liked some things and hated others. I think it overall succeeds at more than it fails, and it feels more comic-y than most super hero films, which I enjoyed - when it stuck those elements.

It's so epic to see Michael Keaton back as Batman. He really did steal the show. Imo nobody else can capture the true emotion of Bruce Wayne like Keaton can. Even in the scenes where he's not saying anything,but still showing emotion,gives alot more depth to the character in a way only Keaton can convey that. It's crazy he's even in the same movie as Ben Affleck. Ezra Miller as Flash/Barry Allen gives a crazy performance. It's not perfect by any means but damn I loved how all the different universes connected. It has a perfect balance of action and comedy.40 years after Superman III and the comedic element surely has evolved to blend in with the action better imo. The CGI didn't bother me that much. If only Val Kilmer and Christian Bale also made an appearance than this movie would be really perfect. Definitely gonna watch again,and has put me in a real DC superhero movie kick now.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sasha Calle was rage in a tight bodysuit. Michael Keaton was only there as a call back to a previous era. Even as a Flashpoint homage it didn't work. Studios have got to stop blaming superhero fatigue on their own failures of imagination and providing audiences with garbage. Just like Shazam 2 failed because it was a bad movie, Flash's failures were all about bad writing.

It was kinda fun and if the point was to entertain....yeah sure it did the job. The Flash wasn't boring,fairly easy to follow and had its moments with our heroes.Was it a mess....maybe, there was something frantic in the pacing and the complaints levied at the quality and use of CGI are earned. I actually asked myself if the look of it was deliberate , a stylistic choice made due to budget restraints.The portrayel of loss and hopelessness did hit home though not as hard as it could have.Unfortunately the same can be said for the humour, the action sequences, the acting...the use of an end credit scene and cameos that felt out of placeThis wasnt a single movie but the highlights of 2 or 3 loosely held together by what? I dont know much about movies but tell you.What I can tell you though....leave your expectations behind, accept the CGI as is, remember how rare superheroes on screen once were and let yourself forget all the craziness behind the scenes.*Kara and Iris can have my number, address, social media everything and last piece of my favourite fried chicken.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I almost got up and left the cinema.(If you move into the future or past, the earth moves away from you going around the sun, and the earth is spinning as well, and the solar system is moving around the spinning galaxy, etc etc, so travelling into the past or future while remaining in the ""same place"" on the earth is mind-bogglingly complex motion.To see this, a youTube search for the video ""How Fast Are WE Moving Right Now?"" (2 mins 27 seconds) explains it brilliantly.So about half way through all this DC silliness and idiotic plot construction, there is a change in the movie (no spoilers), but suddenly it's a different plot and movie entirely.It becomes an elegy on loss, the past and who we were back then, and how we can ""never go home"" (philosophy-wise), and trying to go home only messes up your life and the lives of others you love.I cried 3 times holy crap! I never cry in 99.9% of movies.I blame Michael Keaton, one of the two BOAT Batmans. As in the first Batman with him, he brings a bit of human insanity, and gravitas and poignancy to the movie. He makes you actually feel the loss and hope and fear and confusion, and his dialogue brings this home to us. Wow.Michael Keaton, and the actress that plays the Krypton super-girl (Sasha Calle ... Kara Zor-El / Supergirl), and dorky Ezra Miller as The Flash/Barry/Teen Barry become different characters in a different movie. They present a superb, deep dive into things lost forever in the past.

I liked The Flash (2023), it was fun, funny, and Ezra Miller was good in the movie, the only thing I would say is that the CGI can be noticeable from time to time. Knowing that the DC universe is being rebooted makes me wish we had more DC movies like this.Despite everything that has happened to Ezra Miller he was incredibly good in the movie; I like how hard Barry Allen is trying to deal with a younger version of himself along with fighting with an alternative Batman, dealing with his mom's death, and getting his speed back which was cool to see for him growing as a character. The younger version of himself was annoying, but that was the point because it was him before he got his powers, also older and younger Barry Allen did work well together.It was cool to see Ben Affleck as Batman working with The Flash in the beginning of the movie, he was cool in the action. The main draw to this movie is the return of Michael Keaton as an alternate version of Batman, who was awesome to see; he was awesome in action scenes, it was cool knowing what it was like in his world, and it was cool seeing his Batman outfit, Batwing, Batcave, and Batmobile. Michael Keaton Batman worked great with older Barry Allen/The Flash and younger Barry Allen/The Flash in helping older Barry Allen fix the timeline, and in action scenes against the main threat.I liked Sasha Calle as Supergirl, and thought she did an excellent job; she was cool in the outfit, and she was cool in the action sequences against General Zod. I also liked the return of Michael Shannon as General Zod, he has more cool fight scenes in this than in the movie Man of Steel (2013). They did a twist on the Superman part in the Flashpoint comic, but I liked it and thought it was done.Having read the Flashpoint comic, I can say they do scenes from the comic either with a twist to it or it will go as it went in the comic. The action sequences were fun to watch, but the CGI was noticeable most of the time, even when you see young Barry Allen you can see the CGI on him sometimes when on screen. The movie does have cool CG visuals when The Flash is reversing time, but there are also appearances of certain cameos that are obviously CGI for a reason but cool to see.I thought The Flash (2023) was a fun DC movie that did an excellent job telling a story like the Flashpoint story in the comics, and Ezra Miller did a fantastic job despite the production issues with the movie. The CGI does stand out, but the effects on The Flash were very cool to watch, especially in those slow-motion scenes. It was also great to see not only Ben Affleck back as Batman for the last time, but Michael Keaton as Batman returning since 1992, but I do recommend watching this movie for The Flash because he was great to watch him evolve as a character and as a hero.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I would go as far as to say that if you are basing the movie on time travel with younger/older/other versions of characters, there needs to be a better crew behind the computers. There were many moments that felt very joss whedon Justice League rendering /reshots and other times that made me think of Hulk(2003). There was a great story and plenty of space to really explore and work in the characters but the second half just shoots itself in the foot with the yammering on and weak performances to a not at all climactic ending and a no hype post credit scene.

Here are some of the positives and negatives in The Flash.The positives:1. Acting performances. It was refreshing to see Micheal Keaton come back again as Batman. They handled Keaton's Batman decently well, giving a lot of throwbacks and nostalgia. Sasha Calle as Supergirl was also refreshing to see as she too did act decently well on her part. Ezra Miller, despite his controversies, does a decent job at the very least, providing some humour and heart throughout the film.2. The Score. Benjamin did a brilliant job with the score as it really does bring out the effectiveness of the scene.3. Batfleck. Ben Affleck officially says goodbye to the DCEU with The Flash, and although he was a small part of the film, it was truly wonderful to see him one last time as Batman, before we welcome the new one in The Brave And The Bold.4. Direction. Andy Muschetti does a rather compelling and excellent job at this direction, with beautiful cinematography and action.Negatives:1. Third Act. The Third Act felt a bit too rushed compared to the final 2 acts. Supergirl and Micheal Keaton did not have much scope in the last and final act. Micheal Shannon, while his performance in the Flash is great, had nothing much to do with General Zod. Nothing special was given to Zod during this timeline of the multiverse and third act failed to give much scope to Supergirl and Zod.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's directed with love and is refreshingly funny for most of its running time.The final act does become a bit convoluted, but it's wrapped together nicely with a fitting end.

Not exactly, the ending although fun in some ways for me waa unsatisfactory... the jokes barely land for more than a whimper (they aren't Thor love and thunder bad though). Also a lot of unnecessary swearing.But the CGI... in the travel scenes and the opening scenes the CGI humans are atrocious.

Directed by an incredibly talented filmmaker, the movie successfully captures the essence of the Scarlet Speedster while delivering an entertaining and visually stunning experience.One of the standout aspects of ""The Flash"" is the performance of the lead actor, who embodies the charming and charismatic Barry Allen. The actor brings a depth of emotion and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and endearing. His portrayal captures both the lighthearted humor and the underlying determination that defines the iconic superhero.The film's visual effects are nothing short of impressive.

The chemistry between the characters is palpable, and each actor brings their unique touch to their respective roles.

The storytelling was exceptional, with a well-crafted plot and witty dialogue that kept me engaged throughout. Ezra's portrayal of the Flash character was remarkable, effortlessly conveying his charm. His emotional depth and relatability made the character truly captivating, and his interactions with other characters were superbly executed. Additionally, it was a delight to see Michael Keaton return as Batman, presenting an older, weary version of the iconic hero. This made me nostalgic for Tim Burton's previous Batman films and left me yearning to witness his unique take on the character once again.However, the one aspect that I believe everyone can agree on is that the CGI elements in the movie fell short. They felt somewhat outdated and failed to live up to the film's overall quality. Furthermore, I didn't connect much with Supergirl's portrayal, finding it rather dull. The introduction of her character could have been handled in a more compelling manner, as her storyline felt rushed.Despite these minor shortcomings, the Flash was a solid addition to the DCU film lineup. While it may not be the best film in the franchise, it was undeniably enjoyable and served as a successful reintroduction to this new universe of characters.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So the story is really poor.The CGI and special effects is really, the only reason you would see this movie. At times it feels like you're watching a comic book come to life, with the same kind of ""unrealistic appearance"" you would expect if a comic were to actually come to life. It was all really well done in my opinion and I really just wish the movie had better writing.There was also the issue of Ezra, like I said earlier, the story didn't know where it was going and thus there were many times where Ezra's emotions would jump between serious and comical and then there was the problem of capturing two different ""Flashes"", Ezra simply couldn't pull it off convincingly that both ""Flashes"" are in fact different versions of themselves, it felt like they were both the same ""Flash"" despite being entirely different. The whole immature thing is not at all convincing to show a difference between both ""Flashes"", sure it is humorous to see the ""Flash"" learn about his powers but that's about it, Ezra's humor stops there and as a result many other actors could have filled the role better and brought more to the table to further the roles of the ""Flash"".The story is also littered with plot-holes, I mean I don't expect a superhero movie to have perfect writing where everything makes sense, but to completely ignore fundamental points just so that you can force something to happen is really, really poor writing.So in a nutshell, fun movie but terrible for fans of The Flash.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'll move on quickly from that however I do want to make the point that I find it interesting that although Warner Bros. And DC have been quiet on the accusations they were quick to change the marketing of this film to focus it on the the return of Michael Keatons Batman, I imagine to take peoples mind away from Ezra Miller playing the Flash.That will being said if are able to separate the actor from the character then I highly recommend seeing this film as I thought it was brilliant. That films opens with a well crafted but perhaps slightly underwhelming action sequence but what follows after is one of the best DC films of recent times. The team behind this film have managed to find a way to get around the fact that this flash is already an established character in the DCEU and gives us a memorable Flash origin story. To explain how they do this would venture into spoiler territory however I will say that the decision to put Barry Allen with a past version of himself works excellently. Ironically the two Barry Allen's are how I imagine Ezra Miller is as a person, one side is professional and respectful and the other is obnoxious and narcissistic. To be honest that may be why for me this is his best performance I've seen him give, he really shines in this film which is important as after all he's playing The Flash in a movie called The Flash. It's hard to talk about the plot points of this film without spoiling it however this film trades over the top action for an emotional family driven story and for me it worked really well for The Flash character. After all, he isn't really a strong fighter like Batman or Superman, he's known for his speed and agility. This also helped to keep the film unpredictable and fresh even towards the end but this was at the expensive of a wasted Michael Shannon as Zod however he isn't the real enemy here, time is. There's also a load of fan service here especially for DC fans, if you thought Michael Keaton coming back to play the Batman was going to be the only throwback in this you're very much mistaken and for me it was all throughly enjoyable. Other than Zod being underused my only other criticism would be that that super-girl doesn't really do that much and I don't really know if the film needed her to be in it but Helen Slater did a good job none the less.Overall this may just be my favourite DC film since Wonder Woman and it's one that I think I may find myself coming back to regularly.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The series have long running story lines that develop a character, while the films (least the ones that stick in the mind) go back to their origins. We all know Batman lost his parents. Here, the Flash figures out one of his greatest powers; time travel and how he can use it to try and correct one of the biggest issues in his life.The annoying part is, that while the TV series has Barry as a grown up CSI, Ezra Miller seems more like lost kid. Give him the long hair and he looks like Alan Rickman, but looks are the only thing. Having Derry Girls Saoirse-Monica Jackson as one of his work colleagues doesn't really make him any more grown up.That does change the tone of the film. It's funny. From the roadside fans at the start, the hospital rescue, through to other scenes along the way, it's enjoyable on a MCU level. OK, the story is hokey, but the real kicker (literally) for me was watching it on a 4DX screen. The speed scenes where awesome, the fight scenes brutal and there is something to be said for flying scenes with wind and swooping.Would I see I see it again at home; unlikely.

Storyline has enough heart, action, humor and uniqueness to keep you engaged.In conclusion, people rating this low for CGI are missing the point, and people hating on Ezra due to the headlines you are just feeding into the whole cancel culture ruining the industry. If anything Warner Brothers trying to hide Ezra Miller from publicity to stop the bleeding or canceling Batgirl are going to be their demise for not realizing that everyone has their issues.Good movie and you won't be disappointed if you give it a chance and are a Flash fan in any capacity. However, as a warning I do like the Flash series, which my wife likes to point out is complete crap, so maybe I just have bad taste.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I saw this as I was scrolling through HBO Max and to be honest: it's a fun movie. Admittedly, I was also eager to watch it due to the infamously horrendous VFX effects, which did not disappoint. Despite the lead actor's incidents in real life and the production issues, I think it turned out to be a fun flick with Miller putting in a funny and engaged performance. Also, maybe I'm a sucker for time travel films - specifically segments where characters have to deal with the fresh odd situations that they find themselves in - but I think this was done decently with the characters that they had at their disposal. Obviously it feels like it is restrained by its locked casting potential as it would've been a much greater film if the whole Justice League were fully committed. Overall though: flawed but fun.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Lets start with the highlights of this movie. Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle. Both pull their sections of the film out from the snore fest that is the rest of this film. Keaton is clearly running on autopilot through out. He doesnt have to dig deep to pull this off.Sasha Calle does great with the material she's given and adding a sincerity to the emotions of her character at each moment, that the other cast members either arent required to do or dont know how to with that character.Ezra miller's fanboy Flash has always been irritating an a stupid interpretation of this character. He takes this to the max with the alternate universe Barry Allen. As such every scene he's in grates on your ears.The cameo's at the end of the story are supposed to bring a sense of nostalgia to the older viewer. When all they do is annoy them further.DC needs to remember their soource content is not PG-13 or 15 rating, its been R rated for the most part with the odd touch of PG-13. Try and make something to fit the PG-13 market and you end up with a travesty. MCU source material is PG-13 with the dose of R sprinkled here and there. As such they can hide those parts more easily, hence make a more widely appealing product.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Did they really think we would believe he was a 'younger' version of himself? He honestly came off very annoying.The second reason I watched it was to see Kara Zor-el aka Supergirl.

There was some good humour, though the double Barry did get too much at times.Growing up with Michael Keatons Batman, I was super excited to see him a part of the movie. I thought they did a good job explaining the multiverse and how MK Batman made it into things. They missed a good opportunity for Supergirl - she was great but so very underutilized, it was more a token kryptonian appearance than anything else. It's even more frustrating when considering that HC apparently isn't in the rebooted universe. And on that note, while the end was cheek I know, it was way too much and considering that they are rebooting, they lost an opportunity for a recast to instead go with a piss take. Same goes for glimpses into the multiverse - it missed and tried too hard.Overall, enjoyable but a little frustrating because it nearly was a great movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Firstly, the movie was undeniably fun, delivering an exciting superhero experience. However, there were certain aspects that didn't quite align with my preferences.One notable aspect was the portrayal of the young Barry Allen character, which at times came off as somewhat annoying. While character growth can be compelling, it felt a bit forced.The movie delved into the multiverse concept, creating a complex narrative. While this had potential, it occasionally felt chaotic and challenging to follow, which impacted my engagement.Barry's emotional journey was a central theme, but it didn't resonate with me as deeply as I had hoped. His emotions seemed somewhat forced and didn't evoke the intended connection.The plot's central premise involved changes to the iconic Batman and Superman characters, explained through time travel. This added an intriguing layer to the story, although it could have been explored more deeply.One significant drawback, from my perspective, was the subpar quality of the movie's visual effects. Exceptional VFX are essential for a superhero film, and the lackluster quality here was a notable distraction.In summary, The Flash movie provided entertainment but had its share of drawbacks. The portrayal of Barry Allen, the complex multiverse concept, and the emotional depth of the characters fell short of expectations. Additionally, the disappointing VFX quality was a substantial issue. Nonetheless, for fans of the DC Universe seeking a unique take on familiar heroes, it's still worth a watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's fast-paced, engaging, funny, and emotionally resonant.Not every element of the complicated time-bendy story makes 100% sense, and the visual effects are sometimes undeniably impressive and sometimes an unfinished mess. But this film forsakes quite a bit of the tired superhero formula, and I love it for that.The primary conflict of the story is one of priorities, morality, and purpose. I became invested in Barry's journey of self-reflection-literally. He learns a lot about himself by interacting with his past self.Rather than a traditionally bombastic, city-destroying climax, The Flash has a small, low-key, introspective climax that hit me like a shot to the heart.To top it all off, Michael Keaton is better than he ever was as Batman. He's jaded and brutal and he actually has an arc in the script.It's definitely not a masterpiece that's gonna save DC. But I really loved it in spite of its faults, because it felt like a large breath of fresh air, overcoming the trappings of its tired genre.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The main man himself goes back in time to save his Mother from death, but as time travel usually does, it goes horribly wrong and he finds himself in a worse position than when he started.There's plenty of humour, but it's not over-used (unlike Thor; Love and Thunder) and it's mixed in with a decent storyline that's not too contrived for superhero newbies either. There is a massive hole in the story when it comes down to who killed his Mother and why, so don't expect any awards for writing, but where this movie shines is in it's visual effects, which are literally stunning and must be seen on the big screen for full effect.Sure this isn't Oscar territory or anything groundbreaking plot wise, but it's a whole heap of fun and that's what superhero movies are meant to be, so if you want to see 1 superhero movie this year, make it the new Spiderman, but if you want to see 2, this is a must-see.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Andy Muschietti, who directed the ""It"" movies, did what he could to creatively move things along while also tethering the story to its emotional core, but ultimately ""The Flash"" is a very studio-driven movie. It's good, and I'll probably see it again, but right from the outset the tone is set for silly humor and pop culture references galore.However, this weakness in the film, like not taking itself seriously, could also be a strength. It does feel more grounded to see Barry Allen struggle so much, despite having maybe the most impressive array of powers on the Justice League (outside of any Kryptonian, of course). He is a sympathetic hero, for sure, and Ezra Miller does the heavy lifting needed to have us believe it.Although I know the trailers have revealed much of the plot and some of the characters, I don't want to mess it up for the reader going in unaware. So be prepared for a lot of ""no way!"" moments, and kind of a deluge of nostalgia, especially if you've been around for a few decades. A lot of stuff is paid off along the way, but particularly at the end.Yes, Michael Keaton is in it, and yes, he is everything you'd hope he would be. Ben Affleck is probably at his peak Batman/Bruce Wayne in this film, Sophie Calle shines as Kara, and Miller plays a second role in the movie that allows for a hell of a lot of introspection within Barry Allen regarding what he should do versus what he can do.The best scenes were the ones with Allen and his parents, and Ron Livingston and Maribel Verdú played them perfectly. This is where I feel the movie excelled: the death of his mother matters because we see her and him having that completely relatable mother-son relationship. In fact, it is such a healthy and natural love that would be so traumatic to lose, maybe if you were in Barry's position, you also would not think about the destruction you could bring about to the world if you had the power to time travel and bring your momma back.So yes, The Flash does things I've always wanted to see in a major motion picture with the Scarlet Speedster as the headliner, and for sure it was fast-paced and funny and trippy and incredibly touching in certain parts, but it could have been better. Considering how long it took to make it and all that was going on outside the set, though, I am grateful we got something positive out of it.Now if I could only get my hands on that Flash ring. And the Flash suit. And the Speed Force.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie deals with Barry Allen travels back in time to prevent his mother's murder and inadvertently creates an alternate timeline. Batman character was so good. It has several differences from flashpoint. Ezra miller acting was convincing compared to previous DC movies. Flash running and CGI was not so good compared to The Flash TV series. The Climax CGI was the main villain in this movie. The CGI doesn't seem good. Maybe they try to complete the movie in a limited budget. But outcome was disappointment.

The only reason you might wanna watch is because of the actors listed and characters aproached in this storyline. I had low expectations, but man...this got them 6ft deeper.The reason/spark/motive of how this all starts is well known from comics, the tv show and even the trailer/ads for this movie. No matter how low your expectations are they managed to make even this feel cheap and unnatural.The plot is lacking with not substance to the story and feels like a suitcase that holds clothes for two people and was closed using an elephant. To be more precise it's rushed with too much time spent on useless scenes and too less on the actual content/acting. Also full of small plotholes here and there on many scenes(it shows that it wasn't thought through from start to end, just pieced together).I don't know who got the idea of that ""acting/persona"" for the younger version, but I've seen people with real life medical problems that look more normal than that ""character"" played by ezra. If he tried to play a disabled person(brain mostly) he got it right. Those screams are so annoying and without a reason/purpose. Overall the acting was sub-par at best and I feel bad for the good/decent actors that got dragged in this movie.Soundtrack was so-so. In some scenes makes you feel like you watch some 2001 comedy(but it's a serious scene) and sometimes is just there. Nothing spectacular, but also not necessary bad. The 2001 comedy refference is mostly because they try to make it a funny movie with jokes at every corner, but most of them are delivered bad/wrong or shouldn't be there.In conclusion, for anyone that wants to watch ""the flash"" should go watch the tv show(as much as they want from it). It won't have those great names(like in the movie) and it isn't the best tv show or anything, but it's infinitely better with more action, plot, history, twists, crossover, comedy and acting than this movie.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The end comes back to the beginning and both are personal for the main character, which plot wise is nice.If they had replaced Ezra Miller, had a Henry Cavill cameo as Superman, and not included George Clooney and Nick Cage (They don't make sense), this would've been pretty awesome. Plus cut some of the CGI to be more tasteful. Thirty minutes could have been cut, easy.Also I didn't think I would like Batman and Supergirl as much as I did in this. The versions they used worked.

Overall, a decent superhero movie as the more micro elements of the movie coupled with the playful tone made the film a fun watch and engaging overall (especially the dual role of Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton returning as Batman), but the overuse of CGI and the pretty predictable plot makes this movie a bit too late in the race to the Multiverse.Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Took a page out of the Deadpool/Spider-man playbook to tell a pretty meta story about a young superhero trying to find his purpose and get past his past traumas; does a decent job in the macro elements, but a better job in the more micro ones; gets a decent amount out of his actors), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Ezra Miller (Holds their own very nicely and plays the double role very well; really embodies Barry's role well and does a pretty good job in the more emotional parts of the movie), Decent from Sasha Calle (Her character was kinda written very bland and one-dimensional, so her performance can only go so far), Decent to Pretty Good from Michael Shannon (Not really given that much screen-time to work with, more just plays from experience when he needs to), Decent to Pretty Good from Ron Livingston, Decent to Pretty Good from Maribel Verdú (Played the mother role well and worked off of Ezra well), Decent from Kiersey Clemons, Good from Michael Keaton (Really shows his experience in playing Batman as he has a real genuine joy in portraying the character again and really puts in the experience he has gain from his whole character to play an older version of the character), Decent from the rest of the cast), Decent Story (Structure was pretty solid and laid out well, the main issue is that its very similar to other time-travel/multi-verse movies and is very similar in plot to Spider-Man: No Way Home), Decent Screenplay (Dialogue was decent throughout (some lines were better written then others), humor was pretty good throughout the movie (even though it got a bit meta a times (not a terrible thing though cause its the character)), symbolism is pretty minor throughout; foreshadowing was a pretty good as it helped tie things together in the end (though it could be argued that it follows the template of other time-travel/multi-verse movies)), Decent to Pretty Good Score (Worked in well throughout the movie), Pretty Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Pretty Bad Editing (Fine for the most part but is just bad and noticeable when coupled with the CGI), Bad Visual Effects (The more minor use of CGI was fine, but just felt over-saturated in the more grand elements; the Deep-fake/CGI of people was really in the uncanny valley as it was so obvious that the people were not real), Pretty Good Production Design (Big fan of the Bat-cave and the Batman sets), Pretty Good Costumes (Really big fan of how they paid homage to the old Batman), Plot Structure was pretty standard as it followed a template that other time-travel/multiverse movies uses (with it being clear which part of the story arc the audience is in); the exposition was a bit long, Pacing was a decent throughout the movie (the exposition was a bit longer/slower than I would have liked, but the movie hits its right pace towards the middle of the movie); the runtime for the movie was fine (maybe the exposition could have been 10 minutes shorter), Climax was decent and shows the true revelation of what the movie is trying to show (which is nice as it uses the final fight as build to this rather than it being the climax itself), Tone was very meta and playful (which I did like even though I am not so much of a fan of this style); felt like a mix of Deadpool and Spider-Man, I saw an early screening of this movie (so it was not the final cut)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I went through Kilmer, Clooney, was quite surprised by Bale and later Affleck but was thrilled when the announcement of Keaton's return to the role came out. I have always felt that Burton/ Keaton's Batman needed one more outing and with the Flash that was finally possible.The final product was a mixed bag. The movie loosely adopted Flashpoint, which is a phenomenal story arc in the comics. The Flash is actually needed to be seen a few times to let everything sink in. It is definately a nostalgia trip and there it succeeds. To see Keaton's dusty cave and the iconic batmobile is priceless. The score is also great especially in the segments it emulates Danny Elfman's original themes. I do not understand the general hate of the movie, regardless Miller's private escapades he plays a pretty decent Barry Allen and the dynamic between a more mature Barry and his younger obnoxious self is quite entertaining.The problem is that it starts as a Flash movie, but then it gets completely stolen by Batman, so perhaps it would have been better to name the movie Flashpoint instead of Flash.It is emotional, fast paced, funny, nostalgic - all the characteristics of a good movie. For me a potentially great movie with nice score and great acting was ruined by at times horrible CGI. At places the CGI is great but then there are scenes where The Matrix has had better CGI and it came out in 1999.Out of the DCEU this is by far the best movie if not the only one worth watching. Keaton as Batman and Barry's relationship with his mother is so relatable and emotional. Even though I dislike Batman's ending and the original ones would have been better, it kind of fits the entire story.Excluding Clooney and horrible CGI this could have been a fantastic movie, but to me it is a guilty pleasure.8/10 nontheless.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not to say I didn't like some of them, Keaton for one is excellent, but it feels like this was a corporately-designed film to maximize nostalgia and callbacks. There's certainly enough to enjoy here, but I'm left feeling like this could've been a classic.At the heart of this film is a moving, even profound character arc that Ezra Miller does a great job showcasing. The moments of the movie focusing on this are by far the best. The Batman '89 nostalgia is great (that Elfman score really does something to me), however it's mostly window dressing. The same goes for Zod's return and Supergirl's debut. They don't add much to the film and aren't really even given much focus.The humor really does land for the most part, though there are some tonal inconsistencies. Some bizarre editing also adds to a disjointed, chopped up feel at times. Affleck is terrific in his brief role and makes me even sadder we never got a solo Batfleck film. The action scenes are shot with a unique perspective and I enjoyed essentially all of them. Keaton's fight scenes in particular are awesome to watch.Onto the CGI and the cameos.... I really don't think we needed any of this and especially not in the visual effects state we received it. The CGI as a whole is often pretty horrid with the baby scene an odd standout.The Flash isn't the absolute disaster it could have been given all the behind the scenes drama this film endured, but it doesn't quite live up to its brilliant Flashpoint inspiration.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As an ardent fan of the source material, I walked into the theatre with an eager anticipation for the scarlet speedster's standalone outing. Despite the undeniable efforts of Ezra Miller and the electric presence of Michael Keaton, the film stumbles over its own shoelaces, failing to live up to its immense potential.Miller, reprising his role as Barry Allen, proves his mettle as a leading man, carrying his scenes with a good balance of humor and gravitas. Keaton, donning the cape as Batman yet again, is a welcome sight, delivering a performance that echoes his storied legacy in the franchise. The film does have its fanfare moments - a few cool cameos which will bring smiles to the faces of true DC fans.However, the film suffers an identity crisis. The Flash, unfortunately, ends up feeling like a sidekick in his own movie. The narrative, overly focused on Superman's Zod storyline and the world of Keaton's Batman, robs our titular hero of the spotlight he so deserves. The plot feels rushed, lacking a compelling villain, a substantial romance, or intricate backstories to lend depth to the characters.Regrettably, ""The Flash"" (2023) seems to be the latest casualty of the DC Extended Universe's ongoing struggle to find its footing. It's disheartening to see such beloved source material fall prey to the whims of filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran. For our group, this might be the last DC movie we invest in, as the 6 out of 10 rating can only commend the effort and the promise of what could have been.In the end, while the Flash may be the fastest man alive, it seems this film couldn't speed away from its inherent narrative shortcomings.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Its certainly worth a watch if the Miller controversy doesn't bother you.The CGI is really cheap though, you can tell WB pulled back on the budget somewhat, expecting it to fail. Its hardly better better than the Flash TV show. The Batman bike chase looked awful.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Great pacing all the way through, character development was perfection. Yes there is a little too much reliance on CGI but it's a roller-coaster ride. Ezra Miller is just perfect in this role, as always. I've been a fan of the Flash tv series from the beginning and I think that helped me understand some of the concepts in this movie but I don't think it's a requirement to have seen it.Some of the cameos brought a tear to my eye and I found them to be very respectful of the franchise. Some are so subtle that I'm sure I missed them so keep your eyes peeled.Overall a fantastic movie, highly recommended.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The writing is horrible. They literally had the script on a silver platter for them if they just followed the actual ""Flashpoint Paradox"" storyline. I mean there is literally no villain in this movie. There is no point to this movie. Yes the ""letting go"" them was good but at least add some good spectacle and story too it. Such a trash movie and such a disappointment whoever is giving this good reviews doesn't know a thing. Only positives to this movie are Michael Keaton as Batman and Sasha Calle as Supergirl. But they are also useless. Glad I never have to see Ezra Miller as the Flash ever again.","25 out of 51 found this helpful.

We had CGI that was laughably bad, some acting performances that were a bit weak, some very questionable plot elements and a lot of unneeded filler. Did I enjoy it though? Yes.While it had its issues, I can't sit around saying it's a horrible movie. We have a pretty interesting plot with The Flash going back in time to save his mother, but unfortunately causing a large string of events. While the plot is a simple time travel plot, it had its charm to it and kept it entertaining.I'm not going to act like The Flash is groundbreaking, but if you are looking for a movie with some good action, a decent plot and a bit of humour, I'd recommend it. I think the most important element to any movie is to keep the viewer entertained, and to me, it did that. Just don't expect to see something monumental.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Micheal Keaton to appear in the DC Extended Universe that consists of Batffleck.I thought Batffleck was terrific, just not in this movie. Everything about his Batman was lame in this flick.Is it possible that was done to show love for Micheal Keaton? He did not need it. Yes, I'm biased cause I was in the theater in 89 when this dude first said, ""I'm Batman!"" and as if Keaton needed to prove that was true, he does it here. That 89 movie is 34 years old, and there were things they could not do then, and the strange thing about This Flash movie was we got to see Keaton do things we never thought we would get to see him do as Batman. Like fighting, actually fighting, and those Batwing scenes...It's like a genie gave Micheal Jordon a wish to be 34 again for the 2023-2025 NBA season. Keaton has nothing to prove, but seeing him back in the game was dope.In all honesty, since the trailers dropped, Batman89 was the only thing I wanted to see, but The Flash was a good movie overall. I loved how they visually showed us how Flash uses his powers, even if the special effects could have been better. A lot of Fan service that made me feel like I was reading a comic book. I kept feeling it could have been better, but they were dealing with many stories that did come together nicely.And to be honest with you, I did not care for Ezra Miller. Nothing to do with his latest controversy; I just realized that in Justice League, his version of the Flash was taken in a small dose, but this is his movie, so I get the biggest serving of the Flash, and technically they doubled that serving, and that was a little too much. It took time for him to grow on me, too much time. Once again, I'm biased because he is not my Flash (that Flash is on TV).It's a lot to go through, but it's one of the best comic book-driven movies I've seen.","11 out of 32 found this helpful.

As good as he is here, he is just about the most toxic actor in Hollywood at the current moment due to various personal problems which I hope he is able to overcome. He's a very talented young man. The film is typical of all comic book movies, which all seem rather similar as time marches on, and this one in particular is a mess the longer it goes on. It's fun for a while, again primarily due to Miller or in this case two of him, along with some fun help from Michael Keaton returning to the role of Batman after many years away. The plot is primarily about turning back time so that the title character can change the fate of his mother. Beyond that, and there is a lot beyond that, I am not at all sure what the rest of it is about with appearances of various superheroes of the past. Someone told me that I needed to read the book, LOL, in order to understand the plot.

This film does have certain good things about it.The story is relatively intriguing revolving around time travel and trying to change the past which inevitably alters the future. Even though that concept has been done in movies before, the execution and intrigue level is there. There are certain sad and silly moments sprinkled in.As a whole, Ezra Miller does an okay job as the Flash but we are reminded that another actor could have done a better job and a better portrayal at making the character feel sympathy. The younger Flash scenes with him interacting with himself were well done and were some of the highlights.We see a multiverse of past Batman's returning in this film, blatantly mimicking the outline of Spider-Man: No Way Home, yet some people don't seem to have a problem with it.Michael Keaton returning wasn't great, did not find him convincing or found the chemistry with him and Flash to be any good. Super girl was a solid addition as the actress gave a different yet very needed layer to the character.The film have its entertainment, a solid intriguing storyline but it falls off around the point Keaton appears (around the 1:30:00 mark). The following action sequences felt repetitive. Also a very anti climatic and nonsense type ending. They really could have went with a swerve type ending but ultimately went with the most predictable one.The ""surprise"" cameo at the very end was sort of funny but will ultimately be a waste as since this film flopped, we most likely won't get a sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are some specific scenes or I should say scenarios where it seems that the makers CHOSE to keep it a bit less realistic CGI (don't worry, it's not the Justice league moustache fiasco) but it's forgivable if you understand what they tried to do with it. You'll understand more once you see the movie.All in all a perfect combination of seriousness, humour and emotions likes of which we don't usually see in DC movies.I hope they have started on the right path now and don't end up deviating from it in case we are to witness another Justice League in the James Gunn DCEU.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

Several emotional scenes. The CGI was not world class but imagine this didn't have the preposterous Marvel budget. DC needs a comeback badly and this didn't hurt that effort. Honestly I'm burnt out on superhero movies. What drew me here was everything that makes a regular movie great. I am a DC fan and will always root for them. I'm not an Ezra fan but he did a hell of a job. I would highly suggest ignoring the haters. This is a triumph for DC and needs ticket sales to drive further wins for the studio. Marvel has had their time in the sun. They've proven that multi millions can be pumped into a production as a formulaic success. DC has heart and for me that is a vital component in film.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Overall, I think it's a good movie that was let down a fair bit by the CGI used throughout. It's just a shame that when the subject matter of the movie is the Flash it's going to be very CGI dependant.

Firstly ever since this was announced this has been my most eager film to see in many decades. I loved Michael Keaton as Batman and I loved the prospect he was coming back. In the end I am giving it a 5, for one main reason; Ezra Miller.'They' cannot act. 'They' have no charisma and is simply annoying. The first 20mins of the film I was wincing and grimacing in my seat hating it just hoping for Michael Keaton to arrive.Now what made matters so much worse was Ezra Miller goes back in time and meets his teenage self, who is somehow infinitively more annoying. Quite literally think of Jar Jar Binks and you have the sort of level this was played as. This Jar Jar Binks is in the whole movie. Now to add matters worse was knowing the real life criminality by Ezra Miller and all he has been involved in. It honestly made me feel like I was watching a Mindhunter episode seeing him. It was not appealing. The film should have been reshot with someone else playing the Flash. It wasn't like ''they' is a good actor.An hour in I honestly almost got up and left the cinema. Then Michael Keaton arrived and at first I thought, Warmers have blown it. This is not going to live up to my memory in anyway. However soon that was changed and Michael stole the film completely.What I will also say, on introduction to Supergirl. I was groaning at that too, as she was first seen as a tiny, skin and bones mess. I was thinking to myself, this is supposed to be Supergirl. Why do Warner's cast people like this to play Superhero's. However I need to apologise immensely for thinking that, because as soon as she put on the suit, her body language, charisma and demeanour changed and I was thinking ""wow she is actually a very good Supergirl"". This is what happens when someone can actually act. They can give people that shock of what they project.In the end I have serious mixed feelings - I loved, immensely, Michael Keaton and I loved Supergirl. But I hated the Flash. Now when the entire film is called the Flash I am stuck. Hence I am giving this a 5. It should have been called Supergirl though and just had Batman and Supergirl in it. If the film had of been Supergirl with Batman helping her I would have given this an 8. Watched it Only For Michael Keaton.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

As a fan of the beloved DC superhero, I couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement as the movie unfolded.Ezra Miller once again dons the red suit as Barry Allen, bringing a unique charm and quirkiness to the character. Miller's portrayal of the fastest man alive is endearing, showcasing Barry's determination, humor, and vulnerability. His chemistry with the supporting cast is evident, especially with Kiersey Clemons, who plays the fiercely intelligent and dynamic Iris West. Their on-screen connection adds depth to the story and injects a much-needed touch of romance.The plot weaves an intricate web of time-travel and alternate realities, paying homage to the iconic Flashpoint storyline. While the concept might be complex for casual viewers, the film manages to strike a balance, ensuring that even newcomers can follow along. The narrative unfolds at a brisk pace, keeping the audience engaged throughout, and the script skillfully navigates the complexities of time travel without becoming convoluted.The film's visual effects are simply stunning. The Flash's super-speed sequences are a spectacle to behold, with lightning bolts crackling around him as he moves through time and space. The action sequences are adrenaline-fueled and expertly choreographed, showcasing the Flash's unique abilities. The cinematography and CGI work together seamlessly, creating breathtaking visuals that immerse the audience in the fast-paced world of the Scarlet Speedster.The supporting cast delivers strong performances, enhancing the overall quality of the film. Michael Keaton's return as Batman is a nostalgic treat for fans, and his presence adds gravitas and emotional weight to the story. Sasha Calle shines as Supergirl, bringing warmth and determination to her role. The ensemble cast, including Billy Crudup as Henry Allen and Ben Affleck as Batman, deliver solid performances that elevate the film's emotional depth.One minor drawback of The Flash is that the movie occasionally feels crowded with characters and subplots. While these elements add richness to the narrative, some of them could have been further explored to avoid a sense of rushed storytelling. However, this is a minor quibble in an otherwise exhilarating film.In summary, The Flash is a thrilling and visually stunning superhero adventure that successfully captures the essence of the Scarlet Speedster. With Ezra Miller's engaging performance, a captivating plot, and awe-inspiring visual effects, this film offers a fantastic journey for both fans and newcomers alike. While it may stumble slightly with its crowded narrative, The Flash delivers on the promise of a high-energy, action-packed experience that will leave you craving more adventures with the Fastest Man Alive.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is a sense of Deja Vu in The Flash - I kept thinking, didn't I see this in another movie?To be fair, it's still entertaining, as Barry enters a trippy time-travel arena that takes him to the past to change history and meet his alt-history self, who is a bit of a dope. The interplay of the two Barry's is genuinely entertaining and funny, and there's a lot of fun with the speedy-guy stuff.Soon the Barrys are searching for their fellow superheroes. My least favorite Batman, Michael Keaton, takes another shot at the role and is fairly decent in the role. Then there's some big fights, some more time travel stuff, some revelations, a , a lot of ridiculousness, and it's over.As a comedy, The Flash is pretty good. As an action movie, the CGI-heavy fight scenes look like CGI-heavy fight scenes. Normally I don't complain much about special effects in action films, but this literally looks like stiff animations of the characters stiffly fighting. It's clear that no humans swung a fist during the making of The Flash, and it makes me miss the days of stunt people fighting.As a time travel film, The Flash gets increasingly muddled. As a drama, the plot is increasingly unsatisfying. It's also got one of the weakest post-credits tags I've ever seen - what on earth were they going for, anyway?The cast is good. Ezra Miller is excellent as Barry and I really like Sasha Kalle's unusually hostile verson of Supergirl. And Ben Affleck, while only in the film for five minutes, offers surprising resonance and depth.Overall, the end result is ... decent. It's not a must-see movie, but it's an enjoyable time killer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In its best moments, The Flash offers a glimpse of the DCEU with a fully established Justice League team, despite arriving too late to build meaningful momentum. For DC fans, it is a bittersweet farewell.Like his work on the two IT films, Andy Muschietti skillfully strikes a balance between character-driven drama and big blockbuster spectacle and crafts a light-toned adventure that's unafraid of its profound darker moments. He places Barry Allen's emotional journey front and center and tells an origin story without having to start from the very beginning.Screenwriter Christina Hodson populates the film with fan service moments that are unabashedly geeky and dare to be weird and obscure. The humor is well-timed and organic to the situations, not delivered rapidly to cover up sadness.The story's emotional core, centered on Barry Allen's desire to save his mother, is effectively touching and it emotionally justifies its multiverse storyline over other recent multiverse stories.Ezra Miller's performance is nuanced and multifaceted, showcasing a tremendous range between the comedic and dramatic moments. Michael Keaton owns the Batman role but is locked into repeating his signature lines like a house DJ. Sasha Calle brings a cool dark edge to her Supergirl but would have benefitted from more character development given a late entrance.Plagued by behind-the-scenes problems, The Flash's troubled production sure could have used its hero's time-traveling abilities. With multiple leadership changes and Ezra Miller's controversies, there is a perpetual corporate presence that hovers over the film, most evident in its final act. There's a pressure to set up where the story goes next but paradoxically, everyone knows this is the end. It concludes as an odd little shrug, as if to say, ""We don't know. We'll see.""Andy Muschietti's aesthetic design of the time-traveling special effects, intended to be plastic-looking, has gone over the audiences' heads, who are visually registering it as Playstation 2-level effects. The final climactic battle is set in a blank-looking desert that distracts from the main storyline of Barry saving his mother.Overall, The Flash is an entertaining film with heart but ultimately falls short of being a great comic book film.A firm plan makes all the difference.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

One thing I don't understand is the fact that DC has been working on this film for over 10 years, because they want to know that they've been drinking coffee instead of working. The plot of the film is good, but the realization could be performed better, come on. The characters are ridiculed, first of all Keaton's Batman, one of the most iconic Batman reduced as a clown. There were two characters I liked: the Barry Allen of the present and the weird Barry Allen of the past: the only two that animated the film. Supergirl is embarrassing, especially her costume. The antagonist exploited for the film, General Zod, is also embarrassing, I never understood his intentions and what he wanted to achieve with his mission. Ezra Miller does a good test while Sasha Cally is really low level. The thing I liked most about the movie is the story of Barry and his family, that's the only intention I understood about the plot. The introduction of the multiverse is not well explained and seems in some respects a very bad copy of Marvel. The direction is good and even the emotions are present in some traits. The duration of the film is excessive and the ending is horrendous and inexplicable. One thing I think is wrong is that many people say that The Flash is at least not a decent movie, which is what it is for me. This is a movie that I want to watch in many ways, while for others I would really avoid. The Flash is a film wasted on what it could represent, a great superhero film..

I actually can't stand the fact that the Flash has ADHD or that the whole movie is set in a weird world were the other DC Comic super heros get more screen time. In fact it seems The Flash is pretty useless as a Super hero, his skills fall pretty short of doing anything. And shouldn't super girl have Blond hair? So to end, it's like a long episode of the Big Bang Theory inside Sheldon and Leonards dream...I would say avoid.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The credits for THE FLASH claim that only four dudes don the black cape--geezers named Adam, Ben, Mike and George. Visually, this is equivalent to seeing a quartet of Ringo's sharing one umbrella. That's at least three Ringo's too many for most people. Astute viewers will glimpse even more anonymous Bat Men during THE FLASH. The idea that a caped crusader can be everyone everywhere all at once is not new. The highlight of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, for instance, occurs when all the Civil Rights lawyers in Alabama gather at the scaffold, each yelling ""I am A-t-t-i-l-u-s!"" as Mr. Peck dangles in the breeze. But if all the Bat Men of THE FLASH began yelling at the same time, I suspect it would ruin their powers of echolocation.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It incorporated elements of the Snyderverse but also of Tim Burton's Batman.It was great to see Michael Keaton as Batman. Some really fond memories of those films and this didn't ruin them.Loved the opening scenes with Affleck's Batman. So underrated as Batman but awesome nonetheless.The story is touching and the effects are very cool with some great and fun cameo's.I'm not a reader of comic books but I do devour almost anything DC related. I've enjoyed all the films from recent years, flaws and all. Not having read the comics also means I don't come into it expecting it to fit into existing lore and can take the films as they are, going all the way back to Keaton, Christopher Reeve and even the Superman series of the fifties (George Reeves). It also means that seeing a brunette playing a completely different Supergirl is a curveball that opens so many possibilities. I'm looking forward to her standalone films.I really recommend this film. Sequel please and (long hope) more from Snyder and Affleck. Aquaman 2 next. 👍","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

The movie takes risks I don't always see superhero movies take and I appreciated how they executed it overall even if it may not feel satisfying. A lot of the movie could have been cut but it had pretty good pacing, especially since it moved away from the typical Synderverse film. Even though the graphics looked bad at times I felt it was forgivable in some scenes, I honestly don't see how they could have avoided making it look fake. Ezra Miller was both annoying and perfect depending the scene. Some callbacks felt forced and weird but I overall liked the different approach they took on the flashpoint timeline that felt more fitting for Hollywood and more towards something I felt the Snyderverse lacked. Don't get me wrong, it's still filled with plot holes like most in the series, along with cringe, confusing choices, and tonnes of other problems, but the more comedic tone and risks the other movies avoided by just trying to be dark made it more acceptable.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not perfect; it's a little messy, but nonetheless, it's very, very entertaining. Ezra Miller is excellent as the two Barrys, and the relationship with the mom brings a lot of emotional heft to the movie. It carries more weight because you know that things are not going to work out in that regard. A lot has been said about the effects, but I just rolled with it, and it really didn't bother me as much as I expected it to. It was awesome seeing Michael Keaton back as 'Batman,' and I got chills when he donned the suit, while Sasha Calle as Supergirl was thoroughly badass. The cameos were fun but thoroughly ridiculous at the same time. Yes, the third act is a little all over the place, but that's just a minor criticism. All in all, Andy Muschietti's ""The Flash"" is vibrant, full of color and energy, and yes, it's a little manic and messy, just like its titular character, but it's never not entertaining. It's more than a decent goodbye to the era that started with Snyder's ""Man of Steel.""

Nicholas cage making cameo was a nice touch alongside Christopher reeves that suffered a catastrophic cervical spinal cord Injury.2 more points were removed for the fact of unnecessary casting thereby raising the budget,for example,it wasn't necessary to cast in a YouTuber and give him screentime that could have been done by anyone, literally anyone,probably casted in a cast member of the series like Cisco or even elastico and that would have resonated with both the series watchers and the movie watchers making it an enjoyable experience rather than cast in individuals with no talent except making sketches that are inherently childish.The actress playing Iris west wasnt good but since her screentime was less,it makes it forgettable about the whole ordeal.Overall this movie was really good and it shows that DC Is slowly catching up To Marvel that is now sleeping with rubbish phase 4 films&series save some that it's been churning out.It has some swear words so parents should be a tad bit careful.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

While it has problems, its still an enjoyable and fun movie.Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) decided to go back in time to try and save his mother. In doing so, he gets trapped in the past with his younger self (who hasn't received his powers yet). The two of them seek out Bruce Wayne for assistance, but the Bruce Wayne in this timeline is a retired Michael Keaton, not Ben Affleck. The two Barrys convince Bruce to assist them in finding the Superman. When they discover the imprisoned Kryptonian in Siberia, its not Kal-el they find, but Kara-el (Sasha Calle), his cousin. Old Barry also finds out he has unleashed General Zod (Michael Shannon) on Earth again. Together, with a newly empowered young Barry, this new Justice League attempts to thwart Zod while also resetting the timeline.The CGI is awful for a movie that costs $200m (before marketing). I simply do not understand how a movie in this day and age looks so cheesy. Actors are on strike to avoid digital representations of them in the future, but if The Flash is any indication, they don't need to worry. My second issue is with the character of Supergirl (can we still call her that). I enjoyed Ms. Calle's performance as Kara, but she is way underutilized. In the comic on which this movie is based, its Kal-el they find not Kara, but I didn't mind the gender swap. I did mind, the swap if you are just going to waste the character. She contributes almost nothing to the plot and there was some great storyline that could have been explored, but it seemed like the director just wanted to get in more CGI battles. The other issue i had was the idea that two Barry's could defeat an army of Zod's supermen. One Superman kicked the snot out of Barry in Justice League. Yet hundreds of them are easily defeated by...I'm not making this up...kicking them.Having said all of that, the individual parts are better than the whole. I know Miller has a ton of off camera issues, but he has always been my favorite part of the Justice League. His wide-eyed, innocent attitude was a perfect counterbalance to all the gods around him. This Barry is more mature and even he gets annoyed by his younger self. I imagine I would also get upset with my arrogant 20 year old self if I met him...me....today. The byplay and filming of these scenes are excellent and you can't tell its one guy playing two roles in the same scene. The inclusion of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman was a nice nostalgia kick. He still looks menacing and psychotic which was the best part of him being Batman. He looks insane enough to be running around at night dressed like a bat. Sasha Calle looked amazing in the costume and there was some serious potential for a story arc that got wasted. She went from being an isolated prisoner to being human's best hope rather quickly. There was a moment where it seemed like she might turn on the humans (for imprisoning her) but then she sides with them almost at the drop of a hat. Missed opportunity in my opinion.I'm not a huge fan of these multiverse storylines. Seems like it just an excuse to bring back actors or characters and shuffle plots lines when you run out of new ideas. I did enjoy it in Spider-man: No Way Home, and to some extent it was fun in The Flash, but its being overdone. Still, I enjoyed The Flash as a low-tier superhero movie and was not disappointed at all.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They can enjoy the movie and have a great time by watching the movie.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The idea without slick plot, good acting, and huge plot twist will never win the fight in theater world.So much movies show us how Famous actor not guaranteed good result for whole movie. On the contrary, good director will find how to make a good movie with general story without famous actor.I think the names of several actors from the superhero movie before take the movie to this point. It's will be better if the director took new idea and fill out the movie by new name for multiverse superheros, because multiverse has no connection to other movies in the reality. It's more than this, isn't it?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The main complaint I have is that it really feels like a sequel and this is the first Flash movie. I haven't watched the show with Grant Gustin or Zack Snyder's Justice League yet, so I don't know anything about how they developed Flash and how he handled getting his powers there. It does delve into the multiverse. I prefer the Marvel multiverse movies that came out, of which I'm talking about Quantumania and Across the Spider-Verse. They feel like sequels and are actually sequels, with this one just feeling like one but isn't actually one. That's mainly because it's trying to do the Flashpoint storyline, of which is better to pull off if there's a previous Flash film developing the character.Another complaint is that it kinda revealed a couple things that are meant to be reveals/surprises in the advertising, makes it kinda predictable.For what I find on the better side, it does feel like it does raise the stakes a bit. Barry really shows a conflict of thought and grows as a character. The action is alright, not bad but could be better.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The biggest problem wasn't that the studio (laughably) started a rumor campaign about it being the best superhero movie ever; the biggest problem was that I never cared about the people or the world they were trying to build on. The movie literally riffs off an origin story the audience never saw. From scene one, this was nothing more than a computer animated mess that lacked stakes. There are video game cut scenes that worked better than whatever this was. Whether it aimed for action or humor or something in between, it missed (except for the middle act when the Burton Batman went full Back To The Future...that was funny). The script is bad, the effects are worse, and even nostalgia can't cover over this many problems. I grew up on the Super Friends and Justice League. I spent hours drawing DC Comics. I'm literally the target audience...and this film still completely failed to deliver.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The flash is one of my favorites superhero's. I loved the flash comics and the first 3 seasons of the flash show. This movie was nothing like those two. The writing, the cgi, the characters were all horribly done.Firstly the writing was all over the place. A lot of the scenes were rushed. There was no build up, things were just happening. The movie needed to slow down and build upon these characters. I felt out of touch with Ezra Millers character. They did a poor job of making you feel his emotions. We do not know this Barry DC, introduce us better. Have a more in-depth backstory, stop focusing on Batman and Superman/Supergirl. The flash didn't even seem like the main character, the director seemed to like Batman and Supergirl/Superman more. There is a reason we have source material. Use the comics DC. For christ sake take the first season the flash show and get better actors and have a movie budget. Boom! You have a fantastic movie.The CGI was terrible. There were some scenes where it didn't look bad, but 98% the scenes were god awful. It was a CGI overload. So many colors and things happening. You are often confused what you were really looking at. The time travel art was so confusing, you genuinely could not tell what was going on. DC was shoving colors and motion blur down our throats. Whenever the flash had his suit on, you could tell easily it was cgi.None of the characters were appealing to me.Barry 1 and Barry 2 were not funny and it was hard to take him seriously. He should taking acting lessons from Grant Gustin.Batman was so bland and had 0 character
Supergirl was alright
Iris seemed like a random NPCOverall this movie needed so much work and needed people that actually cares about ""The flash"". DC you have failed yet again. Genuinely fix yourself.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

I've never seen ""Aquaman,"" ""Wonder Woman,"" or ""The Justice League."" I'm not averse to the DCU, I'm just not a huge fan. I chose to watch ""The Flash"" for no other reason than I wanted to go to the theater. I hadn't been in some time and ""The Flash"" looked decent enough.""The Flash"" is not an origin story though it's the first solo film featuring the character. His real name is Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) and he's a spastic young dude who reminds me of a slightly toned down Shia LeBouf.The Flash made a discovery while doing some depression running. He was lamenting the loss of his mother to murder and the loss of his father to prison while running at full speed. In the process he found he could go back in time; which meant he could go back and save his mother.But we all learned from Doc about the space-time continuum, the butterfly effect, and all that jazz. Barry upset the space-time continuum time and again as he tried to get things right.One of the biggest problems with this movie was the CGI. It was CGI heavy in the beginning and it looked terrible. The only other major problem was Ezra Miller as I mentioned before.The time travel aspect of the movie didn't bother me as much as it could. I've seen so many time travel movies with every conceivable method of time travel, that Flash running back in time was no biggie. Have you seen Superman (1978)?The casting also didn't bother me. In fact, it was a positive. There was Michael Keaton, Michael Shannon, Ron Livingston, Jeremy Irons, Ben Affleck, and a cameo by George Clooney. Just fix the CGI and the lead character, then you have a banger of a movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought it was absolutely superb, probably the best DC movie since TDK trilogy, and at least the equal of the first Shazam or WW movies as a functioning, well made film.Some context - I am 45M, grew up with Christopher Reeve Superman and Michael Keaton Batman. Got into the comics after 1989, read religiously through about 2000. Comic collecting fell off after I moved out on my own, but I still read collections on Kindle and have watched nearly all of the movies. I found the Schumacher Batman films absurd and dumb, loved the Nolan films, have no idea why Green Lantern failed (charming performances and a mostly comics accurate story), found MOS and BVS dour and ultraviolent, liked Shazam and WW, think ZSJL is the best of Snyder's efforts because it integrated better character stories and at least a bit of levity. I have watched The Flash of the Arrowverse shows and think it's a great adaptation of the material.So with respect to The Flash movie:-I was engaged by the emotional story, and moved to tears when the emotional finale occurred. The plot itself was clever and well exposited, I never though ""Oh, come ON"" or ""why are they doing this again?""-I was impressed by the attention to detail in recreating the Keaton Batman's manor, props, costumes, and thought Keaton turned in a very good performance.-I thought Sasha Calle was really good as Supergirl, and while I did not really enjoy MOS, thought it was extremely clever and fitting to wrap up the Snyder-verse the way it began.-Ezra Miller, whatever his faults, was very charismatic and emotionally convincing in the role.-I enjoyed the peek at the multiverse, and think it's a wonderful and respectful way to transition from the Snyder-verse - this (or Aquaman 2) will be the last story we see from it, but the world will keep on existing in the larger multiverse.So why is The Flash failing? Is it made just for me, and I don't represent a big enough market? Was the movie just 5 years late to market? Has the DC brand been that damaged by Warner's spasmodic inconsistency? Do moviegoers really care enough about the impending reboot to shun ""not main story line"" movies? Were Ezra Miller's peccadilloes really enough to sink the film?I'm really just sort of baffled. This was exactly the movie this franchise needed. Fun, full of heart, action packed, true to the comics, loaded with reverence for what's gone before on screen, a fresh start for the future.Honestly I'm kind of astonished WB allowed a movie this good to be made.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Here, it's the purpose that matters above all else, and that is crucial for it to hit the right emotional notes.It has problems in its introductory act, still taking everything too lightly and with humour that doesn't always work - in a style very similar to MCU humour - and it fails to explore anything about its villain (who had already been introduced to us before).Regarding the VFX, I don't share the opinion that they are among the worst ever seen. There's much worse in several Marvel films, including some recent ones. They are bad when the CGI is in motion on the ground and the battles look like a video game. I didn't like it, but it's nothing that isn't commonly seen in most films of this subgenre. I didn't have any issues with the CGI in any other scenes. I don't even understand the criticisms of the CGI in other universes because it was clearly an aesthetic choice (if Cage has that fake face, why doesn't Miller? Because that was clearly the choice when presenting other universes through Flash's eyes).I'm a little sad that this won't continue from here on because it's one of the most promising things to come out of the DC universe and the best thing narratively speaking (not visually), in a live-action multiverse. I would like to see more of Miller in this role and I would like to see more of his relationship with Iris growing. At least we should have more of Sasha Calle's Supergirl, who deserves her opportunity.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first 45 min tends to drag but once the film picks up it becomes very enjoyable. I really liked how the film incorporated Supergirl and Batman, both characters were developed well and added much to the overall story line. The CGI is a major issue, to the point that at times I thought I might be watching a video game cut scene. It was so bad that it really takes u out of the film, a real shame considering how interesting the film becomes.

People do not deserve entertainment! I know how much it costs to make a movie and how many people it takes to make one of these fantastic productions come to life. It is not cheap, and people remember that not many people are going to the movie theater, so being free on Amazon Prime is a good thing. I loved this movie when I screened it; I love Ezra Miller as an actor because he brought a unique character to the movie screen, and I genuinely love the idea they got all the old characters back in this movie. It was nostalgic for me. I have to say, towards the end, when he saw his mom, it made me cry; it hurt me inside because losing a family member was very real to me. Berry Allen had the power of the Multiverse to change everything and realized it is more complicated than that! I bet Cronus taught him a lesson in messing with his time. If you do not know who Cronus is, you must brush up on Greek mythology. Cronus would be considered a celestial in the Marvel Universe, but this is DC; still, Greek mythology is Greek mythology.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

But it kept appearing on TV while I was switching channels, so I started watching from the middle. Then I recorded it and watched from the beginning. I have conflicting feelings about saying this, but this is one of the best superhero movies in a long time. It has character development (rare for most superhero movies), action, humor, special effects, touching moments, drama, suspense, and even nostalgia. The screenplay is not simply the all-too-common theme of the bad guy wants to take over the world and the hero has to stop him. The ending, which I won't give away, was more complex than the cliché one where the hero figures out the bad guy's weakness and sends him far away in space and/or time with a hint that he'll return for the sequel.Ezra Miller did a fantastic acting job as two different characters, but from all reports, he needs psychiatric help, and Warner Brothers lost significant revenue because of it. If it weren't for Miller's behavior off screen, I believe this would have been one of the highest grossing superhero movies of all time.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This was seen in No Way Home and it worked in a spectacular way because it was so well done. In The Flash we also have a lot of fanservice, but I don't think it's done as well. The biggest defect of the film is not even this, since the story is boring and the script is often very flawed. We have an interesting direction that creates really cool scenes. However, it's impossible not to be bothered by the CGI, which, even though it really is a creative decision at times, still bothers a lot. The visuals of most of the characters are very bad and this is another negative detail in the visual. The fanservice is cool when Michael Keaton's Batman works, as much as I don't think he was well worked, however, when other characters appear I don't think it works. The Flash is not easy on the eyes for a variety of reasons, but fans of the DC universe will definitely appreciate the references.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it just doesn't work in totality, and the film feels undercooked, to say the least. Everything from the plot to the HORRID visuals and poorly thought out nostalgia bait seem to confirm this. Please let the DCEU die already.The Good:1. Some nice moments. Within The Flash's two and a half hour runtime, I will admit there were some nice moments. The final scene with Barry and his Mom was genuinely sweet and made me want to go hug my own Mom. There are some cool Batman moments and if anything, hearing the classic Danny Elfman score again was nice.2. The weirdness. This is highly personal, but I kind of liked some of the weird, kooky dialog and out-there ideas in this movie. There's a scene in younger Barry's dorm room that I found funny. I'm a sucker for The Flash's powers, they've always been super cool to me and there are some legitimately interesting things done with them.2. The ending (mostly). While the final act of this movie is very bad overall from a visual and creativity standpoint, and while I think this ending was entirely predictable, it's still kind of cool to see one of these movies have a less ""we-have-to-punch-the-evil-away"" endings.The Bad (hoo, boy):In general, this movie is really ugly. Muted colours, obnoxious blue and orange lightning bolts, and everything looks as if it was shot on a green screen and feels lifeless. Miller looks terrible a lot of the time in his costume and the camera does this weird fish-eye lens thing where it just looks...offputting, that's all I can say.

This movie has the best jokes in a comic movie ever They are real jokes not like dumb jokes in Shazam and Deadpool. 😀When Justice League hit theatres in 2017, I'll admit that Ezra Miller's rendition of The Flash wasn't my favourite, but his version grew on me over the years. The DC films in the last ten years have been hit or miss though. You could never tell if a film was going to be good or not. Well, hearing everything that could happen in DC's latest release, The Flash, I had to see it for myself. I'm happy to report that after seeing it and sitting on my thoughts for a couple of days, I can confidently say that this is one of DC's better films in the last 5-10 years and the emotional core packs a great punch.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The effects are horrid is what I am saying, in case anyone was confused.The plot though, the plot, that was boring and rehashed tired garbage too. The acting, subpar from miller and most everyone else. If you want to see Batfleck watch the trailer, it has 100% of Ben's performance in it.

Though I picture the younger Barry probably a lot more realistic to his real self.

I don't even have to bring up how disrespectful these cgi ""cameos"" are because it's self-explanatory. I feel really bad for most involved in this production, and I meant ""most"" because some of these people needed to be fired for their low-effort work. Which brings me to the effects, as everyone has already stated how bad they are and without hyperbole these are the worst effects I have ever seen in a movie of this budget. For some reason they seemed to have used mostly Photogrammetry for the effects instead of green screen, which would have been much cheaper. I know that they can't use a green screen all of the time, but it still looked better when they could have used it. The Photogrammetry is so bad, it somehow looks worse than the Photogrammetry in Fight Club and The Matrix. As for the plot, it felt shallow and pointless and made me wonder why the whole movie happened to begin with. All in all, if you want to feel miserable for two-and-a-half hours, this movie might just be for you.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

Muschietti is known for directing the wildly successful It duology. The film is one of the 2 final chapters which began a decade ago with Zack Snyder's Man of Steel. It is the epilogue chapter in the DCEU.Who stars in this?Ezra Miller reprises his role as the titular character with a host of supporting characters which cannot be revealed.What is it about?It is about Barry Allen trying to save his parents.And how was this?What began as a universe which was not well-received by the audience and made lesser(yet successful) numbers compared to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, comes together in a fashion which today's Kevin Feige can only dream of doing.Andy Muschietti's love for the characters, comic books, the DC live-action movies in general, oozes out from the screen and into your mind to blow it out of your wildest imagination. Every second of this movie is pure comic-book awesomeness and for those who have grown up with the superhero movies beginning with the 1978 motion picture, Muschietti provides an entire platter to devour from. The filmmaking is a wondrous combination of heart-stopping action set pieces, breath-taking visual imagery, and intense writing - put together to cater to the fans of all things DC. Not to be mistaken that other crew members do not have enough to do here. Henry Braham's cinematography is scintillating and wonderfully framed. Every moment is a joy to watch while the action is captured in all its glory with sweeping shots and effective lighting. Benjamin Wallfisch provides the score of a lifetime - bringing back all the greatest hits in the superhero roster. John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein and Joby Harold write a story which leaves you gasping for more every time a dialogue is said. For the movie nerds out there - this is the greatest cinematic achievement one can receive in catering to the fans. These guys along with Christina Hodson - who wrote the screenplay, deserve a staggering round of applause to did what they did. Eunice Huthart's stunt coordination is superb! The action set pieces are stupendous and enjoyable in a manner no other DC movie might have done so far.Ezra Miller has put his heart, soul and mind into the character and it shows in every frame. His performance achieves a rare benchmark for the genre and covers the spectrum of every scenario Muschietti places him in. It is a beautiful transformation for a character which was meant to be the comedy relief in the previous films.The Flash is a $200-million superhero movie which is the culmination of so many things across the concept of filmmaking - from studio issues, to actors not getting their due, to being the perfect example that in the hands of the right director and the right set environment, an actor can do wonders. It was impossible to think what could top something like Avengers: Endgame but it happened sooner than later.It is officially the GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE.Their Tagline - Worlds Collide.My Tagline - 'Let's get nuts.'THE GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

He has severe mental health issues and desperately needs professional help, not acting gigs.

Blue Beetle and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom are slated to hit theatres later this year. I can't see it going much further, though, since these lose so much money time and again.And it must be terrible to be the DCEU. It's wildly and enormously better to be part of this team, but people still just flock to the MCU like cattle. There are far greater movies in the DCEU and so many duds in the MCU.I digress. I figured I'd like The Flash prior to seeing it. I had NO IDEA how incredible this movie was. To be fair, it's not perfect - it does go on a tad longer than it should've, some of the CGI was painful and one of the most annoying characters in the entire universe is here. (Hint: it's the stupidly obnoxious 18-year-old who acts like a 9-year-old. NOOO 18-year-old acts this childlike.)I digress again. The Flash wastes NO time getting to the goods - so, no origin story here, thank goodness. I mean, it does take the lead from Tim Burton's original Batman by introducing the character's beginnings later in the story saving room for a nice comic-book action cold open. I don't mind origin stories, however. If it's the character's first movie, so be it. But I like it more when there is just the assumption you know the title character. Especially with the someone named The Flash and that he would be, well, fast.Barry ""The Flash"" Allen figures out he can be so fast, he can travel through time and wants to save his parents from a tragedy that took his mother's life many years ago. Barry is, of course, told this is a bad idea and can mess up the multi-universe, etc, and...we wouldn't have a movie if he doesn't Flash-on with his plan. Now Barry's must fix this so he can go back to his future.Sucks we have yet ANOTHER multi-universe comic book movie. What is this, the 7th of the last 10 films released in both the MCU and DCEU? Even Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is basically in another realm parallel with our timeline. Mercifully it doesn't dominate the plot and is used seldom enough to be its own movie.This movie was a complete joyride from start to finish. I thought the 1,516 trailers I saw for this spoiled all the cameos. Nope. Brace yourself. Finally, the trailer didn't ruin everything and there are probably 3-4x more AWESOME cameos, some you saw coming. Most are complete and WONDERFUL surprises. And even a few huge laughs out of me for whom they got. And why.I do hope people will give this movie a shot. It's hilarious, action-packed and surprisingly has a TON of heart. I did tear up multiple of times, namely because of the hurt Barry is going through with both what he's done and the loss of his mother. Having lost my own mother, this was really tough to see. Like Ezra Miller or not, he did a phenomenal job with his connection to his mother.For the other role he plays...well, not so much.You really, REALLY, need to be familiar with the ENTIRE DC brand, and not just DCEU. Having known/grown up with DC, since before the original 1978 Superman: The Movie and having watched/familiar with all of the Superman actors over the ages, this is one I picked up almost every Easter Egg. In fact, one guy started talking about the cameos to his group post-film and what they were referencing. I had to go way further with the history and expanded on his lecture about threefold. I know, NEEEEERD. When it comes to Superman...you can call me whatever you like. He will always be my number one.SEE THIS MOVIE. Where people thought Zach Snyder's movies were too dark and Wonder Woman set too far in the past (both of her outings,) this is modern and as light as they come.And this is the Justice League movie we SHOULD'VE gotten.***Final Thoughts: As stated above, I love way more DCEU movies than MCU. Currently, I am a HUGE fan to really liked roughly 60% of the below ranked best to worst DCEU movies. I can only say the same for 33% of all MCU movies. And there are a lot more of those, so they had many more chances to prove themselves...and still comes in second to DCEU.1. Man of Steel (2013)

And Keaton himself felt that he had more than delivered (true) and wanted more money. BAM -- that was the end of the Keaton DC franchise. This post-Snyder post-Whedon entry brings to mind the DC ""imaginary tales"" of the 1960s.

A lot of superhero movies have let me down in the last 2 years and except for Snyder's cut of JL in black and white, I'm rarely eager to see a movie a second time. This one does the trick. Yes, the CGI is sometimes questionable but I'm in my 50's and from a time where FX were the word ""Kapow"" written on the screen. I prefer a solid story to a CGI fest. And The Flash has a good story, just enough humor and a solid cast to make it great entertainment. I had a 21 and a 15 years old with me and we all came out of the theater pleased and smiling. So forget about Miller's latest scandal and just enjoy the ride. Oh, and they get the multiverse right. That's a big plus. Their nod to the past in the final act is moving and creative.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The Batkeaton's badass appearance adds a perfect entertaining (if not nostalgia) element to pleased batman fans, and it seems like he doesn't need anyone else to take his role as the Caped Crusader.

People complaining about the bad CGI visual fx, It's not that bad, IMHO. The only thing that doesn't make any sense to me is when young Barry Allen has the same physical appearance with the ""real"" Barry, while Bruce Wayne is a different person.

The movie is a thrilling and visually stunning journey through the speedster's world. Directed by the talented Andy Muschietti, known for his work on the horror hit ""It,"" this superhero adventure takes viewers on an exhilarating journey through the multiverse, packed with mind-bending action sequences, heartfelt storytelling, and stunning visual effects. From start to finish, the movie delivers an electrifying experience that will satisfy fans and leave them eager for more.Despite all the controversies, Ezra Miller shines once again as Barry Allen, capturing the essence of the Scarlet Speedster with his quirky charm and genuine vulnerability. Miller's portrayal adds depth to the character, allowing audiences to connect with Barry on an emotional level. The exploration of Barry's personal struggles, including his desire to save his mother and the consequences of his time-traveling adventures, add depth and emotional weight to the story.The supporting cast shines in their respective roles, with standout performances from Kiersey Clemons as Iris West and Sasha Calle as Supergirl. Their chemistry with Barry adds an extra layer of warmth and camaraderie to the film. It was great to see Ben Affleck as Batman and Bruce Wayne again (probably for the last time).Calle's performance as Supergirl is a standout, displaying both vulnerability and strength in equal measure. She effortlessly embodies the essence of the character, showcasing Supergirl's unwavering optimism and her fierce dedication to protecting the innocent. Calle's portrayal strikes a balance between relatability and otherworldly power, allowing audiences to connect with her journey on a deep emotional level. Though her screen time may not be as extensive as some fans might hope, she leaves a lasting impact and sets the stage for further exploration of her character in future films.Michael Keaton's return as Batman is a nostalgic treat, and his presence brings a sense of gravitas to the story. The dynamic between Keaton's Batman and Miller's Flash creates a fascinating mentor-student dynamic that fans will surely appreciate. One of the most intriguing aspects of Keaton's reprisal is the way his Batman is seamlessly integrated into the narrative. Despite the time-traveling plot, Keaton's Bruce Wayne feels like a natural progression of the character, a seasoned crime fighter grappling with the consequences of his choices. The older, weathered Batman resonates with a depth that adds a layer of maturity and wisdom to his interactions with the film's titular hero.Visually, the movie is a feast for the eyes. The special effects are spectacular, especially during the high-speed sequences where Barry taps into the Speed Force. The scenes of him racing through different dimensions and altering the fabric of time are breathtaking and showcase the character's incredible powers. The action sequences are adrenaline-pumping and expertly choreographed. The film successfully captures the essence of the character's powers and delivers exhilarating moments that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The cinematography and visual style effectively convey a sense of speed and urgency, creating a thrilling experience for the audience.Overall, ""The Flash"" is a triumph in the superhero genre, successfully blending high-octane action, mind-bending storytelling, and heartfelt character moments. It embraces the spirit of the source material while bringing its own unique flair to the table. Whether you're a die-hard fan of The Flash or simply looking for an adrenaline-pumping cinematic experience, the overall journey of Barry Allen and the grand scale of the multiverse make it a must-watch for fans of The Flash and the broader DC universe.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The highlight of the movie were the side characters and cameos.There was also a very amusing scene that was a nod to Avi Avard, you'll know what I mean when you see it.Some of the side characters felt very 2D, with the exception of Keaton who stole the show.

The film captured the essence of who the flash was from his personality to what his focus was and what shaped his character. It did a very good job drawing you into the storyline and keeping you interested waiting for what happens next.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

Storyline is good, actor's acting is very good, movie does not bore anywhere. Critic spoiled the whole mood with negative rating but movie saved it. This movie is a must watch not for one time atleast for two times.I am unhappy with the show time In India because only single show time has been given and that too only for one week.I liked the movie very much...

I really hoped I'd like it. Everything has been done before and in much better ways by MCU. The story is mediocre, the scriptwriting is mediocre, even the special effects is mediocre.Ezra Miller did try his best, but his Flash character is one-dimensional. I'm not sure if it's the script or the direction or simply his acting that failed to make me sympathize with Flash's emotional struggles. It should have affected me, but it didn't.If it wasn't for Keaton's Batman, I wouldn't even consider to see it. And I wasn't wrong, Michael Keaton is the only thing worth watching in this messy movie. He's still got it. He's, indeed, Batman.So, I gave 5 stars only for his performance.","46 out of 117 found this helpful.

It's real that Michael Keaton's Batman stole the show. Both of Batman fight scenes are amazing. Sasha Callie's Supergirl is a little weak but it's ok she is just out of the space ship. She is looking good in Supergirl suit. Hooping see her again in upcoming flim. I was expecting Zack Snyder's Justice League members, but only a few in The Flash. Anyway, even if you're not a DC fan, it's a fun movie to watch. For me, I rate The Flash 8/10.

No need to explain the plot, we all know it is about Flashpoint, and they do it in a brilliant way. The Flash comes in at nearly two and a half hours and it feels like thirty minutes. The pacing is phenomenal and among the best pacing I have witnessed for any superhero movie as of recent. The script is air tight and not one shot of the film feels out of place. Rather than taking the strictly goofy route (like most superhero movies have been doing lately) this film finds the perfect balance of humor and gritty action scenes that should be in every superhero movie. Michael Keaton's Batman steals the show and is somehow even more convincing as Batman at 70 years old than he was in 1989. Every scene Keaton is in is electric and grips the audience in a very unique way. By the time The Flash wraps up, viewers are left with a since of satisfaction due to the ending not being a heart-broken one nor a happy one. With plenty of fun cameos, bright and breezy filmmaking from Andy Muschietti, awesome action scenes, and a perfectly woven story, The Flash is sure to satisfy the craving for everybody's need of another superhero classic.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

How they displayed the multiverse made no sense and if you blinked you would miss the ""cameos"" of those who played superheroes in the past. Anyone else in the role could not have done worse. As usual Hollywood wood decided to try and indoctrinate people with ""diversity"" instead of sticking with the original material. So all in all, the wrong actor to play Barry Allen, poor effects (when a TV show has better effects that says something).","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I went into this movie with an open mind and right from the start Ezra Miller is awful, annoying and reminds me of Elliot Page. His character from the Justice League (another horrible movie, shot twice) is amplified in this one. The CGI was overkill. In all honesty, the CW Flash was and has done much better.As I continued to watch, it did not get any better. I got bored with it. There was no depth, no connection, just blah. Different timelines, this character, that character it was just overkill. Like circling The Flash on a chalkboard and throwing anything and everything at it to see if it would stick.I've lost hope for DC. Any movie that comes out is viewed with caution because of how terrible WB has been with it. Sell it off to Marvel and be done with it.Bottom line, highly disappointed.

So disappointed especially after his last movie from the MCU was so good.The Flash movie had potential but it seemed like it was a committee that was involved.A committee that was made up of representatives from other subcommittees that all had different ideas.Some of the different ideas were cohesive with others but most were not.The new costume for Flash was great.I even managed to get over my hatred of Ezra Miller to try and enjoy this over hyped piece of trash.I still don't like Ezra Miller for his off screen issues but he is not the problem with The Flash.The CGI is good at times but at certain points in the movie it's as though there were last minute rushed changes qnd the CGI looks almost cartoonish which in 2023 is not ok.The story is so bad in places I don't think it would entertain a child.The main thing I found in the movie that lacked imagination was when Flash time travelled and the time space continuum he was able to view the time stream from was laid out like a colluseum but a poorly done CGI time line colluseum. It lacked imagination. It lacked vision. It lacked even a morsel of creativity.It did not get me to emote with any feeling other than disbelief at how once again DC has failed.The time may have come for the DCU to end but maybe it had come too late. Too late to leave with a shred of dignity and integrity.The Flash could have been ans should have been a swan song for the ages but just like a lot of DCU offerings there was something akin to reading one of those 1980s ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books. It's like the writers had a multiple choice option at the end of every chapter and had to hand it to a different team to choose the next chapter without that team knowing what the previous chapter was about.Disappointed.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

There are genuinely funny scenes, moments of awe, and sadness. Despite Ezra's real-life troubles, here he comes across as a likeable, grounded and root-able character as The Flash. Whilst there are many side characters and each get their moment to shine - this is a movie about The Flash and to its credit the film never forgets that. Side note: Keaton's Batman has still got it - and The Flash respects the legacy of that batverse without trampling on it. Though I felt there was a missed opportunity to showcase some Batman Beyond/aged Batman struggles of the character. But I understand why they chose the path they did.The bad: The plot conveniences annoyed me. I.e., Circumstances or events occurring because the plot demands it, not because it's earned or logical. This is at its worst when it sacrifices character in the name of plot. Without spoilers, an example is contrasting what powers each Flash/Barry reaches in their relative timeframes (seconds vs years). Another mark against the film is the overuse of CG, especially bad CG. For reasons unbeknownst to me, EVERY scene the 2 Barry's are in, they use a CG model for the 2nd Barry, whether the CG version is the focus or not. It's bizarre - Hollywood has been using basic composition techniques to put the same actor in 1 frame for decades. It wasn't necessary and hurts each moment the 2 Barry's are interacting closely.Should you watch it: This is in the top tier of the DCEU. A shame we probably won't get to see these characters / actors anymore but glad the universe is going out on a high note. This is an entertaining comic-book popcorn movie that honours its comic predecessors and does a better job of establishing a Justice League than the Justice League movie. Recommended.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Then imagine my delight when I heard the plot of this movie... The Flash travels back in time to save his Mum where he teams up with Batman, Supergirl and a younger version of himself - yay two Ezra Millers.I couldn't have been more wrong and even as I'm writing this, I'm still surprised with the amount of joy this film brought me, even before Batman appeared. I grew up with Michael Keaton as Batman and when he swooped back on to the big screen it was like he'd never left, as this feels like an extension of his previous movies, falling back into the character so effortlessly.The new girl on the block was Supergirl and despite having very little to say, was a welcome addition, bringing a stoic strength that female leads aren't often allowed. The film is peppered with cameos and they all seem to be done with purpose, rather than being thrown in because an actor had a spare 5 minutes to kill or was fulfilling a contractual obligation.There's plenty of heart here and it manages to evoke just the right amount of emotion without dwelling too long and I'll even admit to tearing up a bit towards the end.One thing that comic book movies (in fact most movies) often fail at is humour, yet somehow I had more laughs then I've had in a while.

I can say that The Flash was one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. Flash totally entertained me and I really enjoyed it. Everything was good except cgi which could be much better. We saw a great and perfect Batman in this movie, but Ben Affleck's Batman costume didn't catch my attention and didn't meet my expectations. Cameos that preserved the past and legacy of Superman and Supergirl, Batman and the Flash and presented it in a way that was appropriate for viewers. I recommend that you watch the movie as soon as possible and enjoy watching it. A good ending for the dceu universe and a good beginning for the dcu with James Gun.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Much like Transformers it has no heart and is just effects. At least I didn't go to the theater to see it. Why are DC Comic movies so bad? Aquaman is bad too but somehow entertaining. I guess Jason Mamoa is fun to watch? DC should stop making movies for a few decades and maybe a new generation can make better movies for them? Ok so I need more characters to submit this review, well, the film was bad. All special effects and no real story. Ok I still need 118 more characters so it was bad as in not good. It was an insult to human intelligence. This film made life difficult. I hope they do not make a sequel.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was also away how much of a train wreck Ezra Millers life has been personally.Now putting that aside when I watch a movie I watch it for the experience and acting. What has happened ""outside"" the movie doesn't resonate with me.Put simply an absolute bravura performance from Ezra Miller. The amount of screen time he occupies in an almost 2.5 hour film where it is predominantly just himself as the actor on screen for almost the entire time - and to pull it off in compelling and endearing fashion is a gift.The movie absolutely surprised me to the upside. 9/10.

I feel bad for every one in this movie because of who was cast as the lead. Save your money for the next chapter of DC, it may not get much better but has to be better than this garbage. It stopped being a competition with Marvel and more of just trying to survive as a franchise.

It is an overall great action movie, with a fast tempo and a good score.

I am aware of the stories around him (unfortunately!!! Because what does that have to do with his profession?!) and I am shocked that it might be the cause for the bad reception of the movie.He manages to be very intense and very funny at the same time. Quite unique. I couldn't take my eyes off him, trying to figure him out. One could say he really knows how to blur the lines (pun intended)... When you'll see the movie, you'll know what I mean. I knew he is an excellent actor but I was really blown away by his talent.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

No but it is one of the worst, but it's still entertaining. Do the flashes powers make sense and translate visually in this movie? Nope but it is visually interesting. Michael Keaton is great for the scenes with decent to above average scenes like the kitchen but he's also cringe when he says the famous line from Batman 89. The jokes do not all land but some of them are fun, and Ezra is a really good actor but the dialogue is not great but the plot is actually pretty clever and classic.

My feelings about Ezra Miller as a person aside, the film is a spectacle from start to finish! The opening sequence of the movie is worth the price of admission alone, as are several fun, funny, and absolutely insanely great moments throughout the movie! I found myself laughing for once during a DC movie, and director Andy Muschietti masterfully blends humor with the high stakes presented in the film.The plot of the film is a faithful adaptation of a major DC Comics storyline involving The Flash called Flashpoint. There was only one very minor detail involving the plot that irked me, as I felt the movie had a major missed opportunity to not include a classic villain central to the Flashpoint story, but that's just me. There are plenty of Easter eggs for fans to spot but even if you aren't familiar with the comics you will still enjoy it. There is even a slight nod to another DC Comics storyline called Red Son within the film.Michael Keaton shines once again in his return at The Caped Crusader, reprising the role from the 1989 and 1992 Batman films, ignoring the events of Batman Forever and Batman & Robin in which he didn't star. He returns in classic and badass style, with a little nostalgia thrown in, most notably nods to the original Batman themes in the film's score. Ezra Miller does an admirable job as the titular character, despite my feelings about Miller personally.The standout performance for me was Sasha Calle as Supergirl, cousin to Superman. In every scene that she is in, she demands your attention and is just as good as Henry Cavill's version of Supes!The movie was not without it's flaws though. There were many times I found a few scenes annoying and dragging slightly, and there is quite a busy third act, and it does get slightly bogged down by all that it's trying to do.However there are a couple of cameos in the film I DID NOT SEE COMING right towards the end!All in all, The Flash is amazing, and proves that in the right hands and with the right screenplay and direction, DC heroes can have their chance in the spotlight! If this is the last hurrah of the Snyderverse, then this goes out in style on a high note! (This movie does reboot the DC films to fit the new DCU now helmed by James Gunn.) This cannot be missed if you are a Flash fan, or a Keaton Batman fan! There is a lot to love about this film, and it FINALLY serves the fans up with a lot to like! #TheFlashMovie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was great seeing Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck return to reprise their characters and the story really had some great humor, several emotional moments too. It really paints the picture of actions having consequences even the smallest actions can lead to a domino effect. I loved seeing this more mature version of the flash vs the one that we saw in the original Justice League movie too and seeing the comparison between past and present Barry was both hilarious and just nice to watch.

The movie does not have any positive or negative consequences per se, but that is kind of the point. Definitely watch it at home on Max if you can't make it to the theater. The parts with Keaton's Batman are the best scenes and he is upgraded to hang in there with today's villains, however, he is still the Burton Batman.

The CGI is subpar overall, but in several scenes, it becomes embarrassing. However, by far, the worst aspect of the movie is Ezra Miller's performance, which comes across as a wannabe Sheldon Cooper - I'm not sure if it's his fault or the direction's, but it's a pathetic performance. Perhaps the only interesting things were the tributes, unfortunately also marred by the poor CGI. They missed the chance to reboot the DC universe with one of the best comic book sagas; instead, they ended up with another failure. The DCU has once again shown it doesn't know how to make films well.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Worse than I expected...and I didn't expect much.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9288555/?ref_=tt_urv","blmulholland-14261","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur98727287/?ref_=tt_urv","27 August 2023","There's so much wrong with this movie that it's almost hard to remember it all. Let's start with the acting. With the exception of Michael Keaton, the acting in this movie varies from bad to mediocre. Miller in particular shows himself pretty incapable of doing anything but the quips. And it's not like he's amazing at quips.Aside from Keaton and Miller, no one else really gets enough screen time to do much. Sasha Calle (Kara Zor-El) gets a little time, but not enough...but also doesn't really do anything with the time she's given. Nothing about her portrayal of this character will be remembered by anyone in any way.One of the things I found particularly annoying is how hard this movie WANTS to be funny. Flash was relegated to the comic relief in Just-Us League, so it makes sense that they try to make him funny in this...but the jokes just don't land. There's one good one. I don't want to spoil it, but I'm not sure they intended it as a joke, so I don't think I'm spoiling anything. It's the inclusion of the Nick Cage vs a giant spider scene. I LOLed at that. And that's all. Literally the only funny thing that happens.Which is a problem because the movie tries SO HARD to make the humor. At times, it almost feels like a parody of a Flash movie. Comedy beats that don't really make sense are shoehorned in like the comedic instruments falling out of the van in a awkward way that seemed to be trying to choreograph in a humorous way...but isn't.This brings me to my next complaint - erratic rules. Look, it's superheroes, so I can't hit them too hard on the over the top physics, but if you're going to introduce rules on your magic, you need to be consistent. And Flash isn't.Let's talk about plot. The entire plot in this thing hinges on the movie's rather unusual take on timelines and multiverses. It's explained by a spaghetti metaphor by Keaton and ... it's nonsensical. If you're going to do time travel, the way to make it cool is to put the effort in. Time travel is hard. It inherently unravels the stakes of your movie and has to be handled carefully.The Flash makes ZERO effort to make it's time travel rules make sense, essentially writing itself a blank check to do...whatever, whenever. It conflates the concept of multiverses with that of multiple timelines in a way that doesn't really make alot of sense. It also never actually uses it's gimmick in a way that feels clever or original.The movie often falls into reference checking the Keaton Batman movie in a way that, far from feeling cool or nostalgic, feels egotistical.The movie begins with an extended bit of action where Batman, Flash, and Wonder Woman are involved in random hero stuff that...has absolutely ZERO plot value. And it's not short. This is a LONG extended chunk of the movie that feels like it must have significance given how long it takes...but no. Nothing. Just wasting your time. And what's weird...neither Batman nor Flash come off as overly heroic in it.Let's talk effects. The effects are...REALLY inconsistent. And mostly bad. Now, to some extent, I feel like I want to grade on a curve here because they really loaded up with ALOT of effects. There's SO MANY effects. I'll bet effects shots FAR outnumber noneffects shots in this thing.But there are many scenes where Barry is running in Flashtime and the effects are so shiny and nondistinct that it actually looks like this movie had approximately the same budget as the Flash CW TV show. And...maybe less. Because at least in the early season of the Flash TV show the effects often looked BETTER than in this movie. It was only as the show drug on and ratings fell and budgets fell that the really shiny and bad effects started cropping up. But how does that make it into a MAJOR studio movie. I've heard they tried to claim it was deliberate...and that's laughable because alot of the bad shots aren't the multiversal stuff. The falling babies at the beginning looked so low-res, I almost would have expected that to be a video game screengrab.While I'm talking about the CW show, can I take a moment to say that I hate THIS Iris West just as much as I hate the Iris West in the CW show? What is it about this character that writers insist on making her come off as a total Witch with a B?Scenes also frequently don't make a ton of sense. Why would Bruce Wayne meet Barry in Central City...twice? Barry can come to Gotham in seconds. Bruce needs to fly on an airplane. It made no sense. And why would they be talking in a random alley?Honestly, even the action isn't all that good. Like, this is a superspeedster. You kind of HAVE to live up to the Quicksilver scene in the X-Men movies. And...this doesn't. I'm not even sure it lives up to the CW show.And if you're doing multiverses...how do you not include the Arrowverse NOR the 90s Flash? They spend all this time showing off Superman alternates and Batman alternates. You realize those aren't the main characters of THIS movie, right?","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Warner has done they're best to spoil the plot with all they're promo shots, so there's no news in a new Supergirl and a second Flash. It all happens because DC cant do a single move without copying the boring Marvel formula. This time the disorienting multiverse (which Marvel stole from Back To The Future, which also is referenced here). The fun part is the very meta moment with seeing Nicolas Cage as Superman, since he actually screentested for it. The not so fun is that the movie never can decide if it wants to be funny or serious; the tone shifts every 5th minute. And Ezra Miller's stunts outside, makes some of his lines cringeworthy. The guy is just not very likable. The big thing is of course one Michael Keaton back as The Bat, which is a true joy. If you don't like Keaton back, there's something wrong with you. Watch out for one very great cameo right at the end. Very inspired anf very ironic.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

And you'd run into an immediate problem: In order to achieve maximum testable enjoyment, you might have to see Batman '89, Man of Steel 2013, Superman II 1980, Wonder Woman 2017, and either Supergirl movies, comics, or the recent TV show--and that's just to know who the characters are and why their significant.If you don't, then you might not understand why certain events play out the way they do or why certain characters take certain actions even though they're not the logical ones at that moment.At the same time, the movie is kind of hoping that you won't have watched the recent Flash Arrowverse show, as the overarching plot, the parts taken from 60ish years of Barry Allen Flash mythology, was also fully covered in the TV show, and done just as well or better.The TV show also fully spoils the eventual outcome of the film (wow, that Iris West sure if a cute acquaintance! Do you think we have to wait until Flash II or Flash III to find out if these two crazy kids can hit it off?).I won't spoil the ending, but I did find it very confusing, and I'm a DC comics fan and understand what happened.And that brings us the biggest problem with all of the DC properties, the one thing I'd say to the Warner Brothers execs if I could, the movies and TV shows have become constant retellings of origin stories, and constant reboots. Marvel has made some wrong moves too, but you get the feeling that they've actually thought about their properties, e.g. Spiderman: Homecoming didn't attempt to retell Spiderman's film origin for the 3rd time in less than 20 years.Ultimately, I was hoping that DC would get its act together, but I just don't know if it's possible at this point. Their movies, even the good ones, are messy, inconsistent, and aren't very fun. But they should be.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now after watching it, it's absolutely EVERYTHING. Amazing storyline - we've heard it before on the silver screen, but the way they managed to tell it on the big screen was impeccable. Ezra did an incredible job, and I can understand why this version of Flash was meant for him. He embodied the role perfectly. There were elements of nostalgia, exciting action, humorous moments done well (sparingly and not forced), and heartfelt moments where you truly felt for the character. The character development kept you engaged. Some people egged on the CGI, but I thought it was brilliant. The directors choices in some effects was intentional and it's aligned with comic books, where in Barry's perception, the world looks much different. This is THE BEST DC MOVIE made to date. I don't care about the politics or drama outside the film - the film is perfect and everyone needs to watch it. DO NOT listen to the naysayers. They're simply hating because of the politics.

I concur with the esteemed Stephen King; this movie is something special. Sure, it features the legendary Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman, brims with nostalgia, exudes hilarity, and exhibits awe-inspiring visuals. However, at its essence, it remains a profoundly poignant narrative centered around an individual grappling with the loss of their mother. Within its frames lie genuinely impactful scenes that, if one has experienced such circumstances, are bound to strike a chord.

Younger Barry Allen was really annoying, but I think that's the point. I had no issues with them in the role.The stand out for me, was Michael Keaton. When Batman is doing his things and Danny Elfman's iconic score is booming, it's a joy. But make no mistake this is not Batman 3, it's a Flash movie that features Keaton's Batman.Supergirl was good, I enjoyed her, and if she gets a stand alone, I'd watch it. There were some surprises, that I'm amazed have not leaked.It feels it's run time at times and some of the CGI is very dodgy, especially during a certain moment. Considering what they were going for, I can't believe they released it like that. The CGI at that moment is my biggest complaint.They get away with a lot with its rating including nudity and a fair amount of bad language, including the F bomb.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The CGI didn't affect my enjoyment of this film all that much and it had emotional moments that really really surprised me with how perfect DC managed to pull them off. The fanservice was perfect but unlike a certain MCU project wasn't the entire selling point of the film and excels in fanservice nostalgia enjoyment and enjoyment as it's own thing with new characters like the impressive supergirl performance from Sasha Calle and surprisingly great performance from Ezra Miller despite what he's been up to personally over the last year. I'm not the biggest fan of time travel affecting events taking place before the event change at all but all in all this film's emotional and nostalgic/fanservice moments completely made up for all the problems I had with it.

Barry goes back in time using his super speed & prevents a tragic event involving his family, from ever happening in the first place. However, this results in the world going topsy-turvy. There are no more superheroes in the world & Barry must do everything he can to bring everything back to normal & safeguard the future.The Flash is a phenomenal film. Director Andy Muschietti has given us a movie that is a tribute to all things DC, through its vast history in media. The comedic scenes will make you laugh uproariously. The action set pieces are mind-blowing. The visual effects are awesome. Ezra Miller is superb as Barry Allen/The Flash. Miller flexes their acting range by playing two different versions of the same character. However, I still prefer Grant Gustin's portrayal of Barry Allen/The Flash in The CW series. Michael Keaton is the star of the show as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Seeing Keaton reprise one of his iconic roles as the Caped Crusader is an absolute delight to watch. Michael Keaton's spectacular performance is the highlight of the film. Sasha Calle is outstanding as Supergirl. Michael Shannon is brilliant as General Zod. Ron Livingston is amazing as Henry Allen. Maribel Verdu is fantastic as Nora Allen. The supporting cast is excellent. Prepare yourself for many exciting surprises. The Flash is a must watch for fans of the DC Universe.

The cgi is quality, I don't understand the hate it is getting, ironically the hate is coming from same people who praise Marvel for it's cgi. The movie was surprisingly funny with effective comedy moments for a DC movie. In overall a masterpiece and must watch. In my opinion the movie stands out as the best in DCEU and also the funniest one. Ezra Miller delivered a strong, memorable performance playing the role of two different versions of Barry Allen and needs to be praised for that. The movie was hilarious, gripping, memorable and highly enjoyable. A must watch for all DC fans.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Not the best Dc or Marvel film, but certainly the best DCEU film of all time. It was a nice love letter to the DC Universe alone and had a lot of heart and soul injected into it. Most of the comedy is great, some are cringy, and some of the CGI is very trash. In light of the cons, I still looked past them because of how good the story is. I thought the swerve they did on who was the real villain was cleverly done even though it felt a bit rushed. Give this movie a shot, I promise you will have a great time and a lot of excitement with the story.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I have found most of the DC movies mediocre at best. The all seem TOO cartoonish, and yes I know they are comic book based, but I would still expect them to have some sense of reality.The acting ranges between wooden to over the top. The effects are mediocre, and the story is idiotic. I know it's supposed to be part of the character, but I find Ezra Miller's Flash a little over the top in his representation of what is clearly meant to be autism. The time travel angle and its impact on the future is something that has been done many times, but this is one of the least plausible and least interesting treatments of this trope. Overall, I had a hard time forcing myself to watch past the 1st hour of this. I found almost nothing enjoyable about this.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Zod and Supergirl don't have much to do, the movie is basically just focussed on the two Flashes. It could have been sooooo much better, but it settles for being really good. Music was a slight disappointment, there is no memorable theme like Wonder Woman or Pattinson's Batman. The DCEU goes out on a positive note, and I hope the future movies under Gunn are just as good or even better.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

DC's The Flash has arrived, not as a meek puff of smoke, but as an electrifying lightning bolt, setting a scorching trail that burns brighter than ever in the superhero movieverse! From an exquisitely designed storyline that flutters close to the original Flashpoint Paradox animated movie, to the invigorating visual feast, this film has redefined the DC cinematic universe!Ezra Miller reprises his role as The Flash/Barry Allen, bringing a delightful blend of unbridled joy and poignant intensity that is both spellbinding and relatable. Miller's Flash isn't just super-speedy; he is funny, emotional, and deeply human, a living embodiment of the saying, ""Not all superheroes wear capes.""Speaking of capes, let's take a moment to gush about the stupendous return of Michael Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne. With his seasoned acting prowess, Keaton reminds us why he was, is, and will always be, the quintessential Batman. His Batman embodies wisdom and resilience, doused in a dark charm that harks back to his iconic 1989 portrayal. The interactions between Keaton's Batman and Miller's Flash are gloriously memorable, packed with humorous moments and heartwarming camaraderie.Now, let's not forget the new kid on the block: Supergirl. Played to perfection by Sasha Calle, our newest heroine soars above and beyond all expectations. Her performance is radiant, powerful, and offers a breath of fresh air to the DC lineup. Her portrait of the character as a troubled and angry powerhouse us just brillant.The Flash offers more than just a character study; it's a thrilling exploration of the Speed Force and its boundless possibilities. The CGI sequences are pure artistry in motion, with breathtaking visuals that capture the essence of Flash's abilities like never before. The speed, the time manipulation, the energy - every element comes alive in a dazzling display of cinematic magic!The storyline, while following the spine of Flashpoint Paradox, introduces unexpected twists and refreshing additions that give the narrative a unique flavor. The blend of light-hearted humor and intense drama strikes a perfect balance, ensuring that our pulses never miss a beat.What makes The Flash the best DC superhero movie to date is its beating heart, its unabashed sense of fun, and its fearless commitment to storytelling. It's a splendid spectacle that simultaneously thrills and moves, often leaving viewers laughing one moment and misty-eyed the next.A toast to DC and all the creators! You've raced ahead and set the bar incredibly high with The Flash. Thank you for this gem, a true testament to the phrase 'lights, camera, ACTION!'.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

It is either great or just plain trash. I would like to say that the truth is more like somewhere in between. The movie is not the great masterpiece that some people have said it is but it is also not the trash that some people say either. It is in fact quite average albeit with a good story and some touching scenes.While the CGI can be quite wonky I do not see how it is worse than the CGI of many Marvel movies that are often so color graded and washed out to the point where everything feels so dead and sterile. Here at least the time distortion by Flash's perspective makes everything look plastic-like, which I do not mind. (But oh boy, did the babies look bad.)Speaking of Flash, I do not mind Ezra's performance here because he was not as annoying as he was in Justice League 2017. He in fact made me cry a few times. I honestly also do not care what he is doing outside of acting because we would probably end up cancelling more than half of Hollywood and our favorite actors if we do not separate the artist from the private person.Anyway, I was very happy to see Keaton as Batman again. I felt the kind of magic with movies I have not felt since I first watched Batman '89 and that to me is enough to give this movie 2 extra stars. I had my doubts whether or not an aging Keaton would be able to pull it off but not only did he deliver, he also made me laugh, cry and left me in awe.P. S. The only real gripe I have with the movie is the ending. It has to be like one of the worst joke endings I have ever seen so much so that I almost requested a refund.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Despite a strong start with Man of Steel (even with the issues of its last act), the effort by Warners and DC to AstroTurf a franchise in the style of Marvel never paid off. For a brief time leading to the summer of 2023, it appeared that it might have a chance to right itself with a film that would allow something of a reboot with a plot inspired by one of the company's strongest recent comic stories: the universe altering Flashpoint. With a host of returning actors and callbacks, the long gestating Flash solo film would have the fate of the franchise on its shoulders.Except that it stumbled, crashed, and burned on arrival.Watching all 144 minutes of The Flash, it isn't hard to see how much it deserves all of the roasting that it has received. Something that was clear from the opening ""baby shower"" sequence that helps to open the film with puns that perhaps even the 1966 Adam West Batman TV series would have hesitated using. From Ezra Miller being alternatively the blandest or most annoying lead of a superhero film this side of Miles Teller in 2015's failed Fantastic Four reboot to some of the most atrocious CGI and green screen work seen in a tentpole studio film with a budget over 200 million dollars, there's plenty to mock The Flash about.That's without getting into the script. Ultimately, the biggest problem with The Flash is that it's not so much a single film as four competing films taking up nearly two and a half hours. Among those are a Flash origin film and an adaptation of the Flashpoint comic plot line, either of which would have worked potentially in their own right but mashed together don't. Even less so when the film also tries to be an Avengers: Endgame style movie for the DECU with all of its callbacks and returning characters. Like so much of the DCEU, The Flash tries to AstroTurf a gamechanger film into the middle of the franchise, all while lacking any of the emotional investment or stakes that the MCU had built up to for Endgame.Only one of those four movies actually kind of works and it's the thing that The Flash, ironically, lives and dies by. That's Michael Keaton's return to the Dark Knight, a role he left behind 29 years earlier. Now, perhaps because of when my own childhood took place, I've never quite shared the nostalgia for Keaton's Batman that it seems many others about my age share. He was good, great even, but Burton's two films with him seemed far more keen about the villains than Keaton as the Dark Knight. That said, Keaton is the heart and soul of this film, the thing that makes it finally pick up at the halfway point and drives things right up to the moment he exits the film. That Keaton was meant to become the front and center of a revived DCEU is clear from the film and which makes it a shame that production issues, shifting release schedules, and finally Warner's own poor decision making robbed him of the chance to deliver upon how bloody good he was here. For a film that's wallowing in nostalgia and trying to use it to glue a film together, Keaton's Batman is the one thing that actually works, even if The Flash suffers from the same problem as Burton's two films: squandering a fantastic Batman to focus on other characters.If you're going to make yourself sit through the nearly two and a half hours that is 2023's The Flash, it's worth seeing for Keaton. Because there isn't much else worth recommending it for, frankly. Which is a shame, but also a fitting epitaph for the DCEU as a whole.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The script is quite good, and I quite like it. It rationalizes the absence or likely absence of other superhero actors in this DC universe. The logic of the movie is also well-maintained and not too confusing.As expected, Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton did well, especially how Batman showcased his strength and advantage in this film. Batman and Supergirl gave me a thrilling and satisfying experience. Particularly, Supergirl, Sasha Calle, before watching the film, I had seen some images of her on social media, including in the trailer, and I was somewhat worried about this new appearance. However, when watching, I was truly impressed and loved this portrayal. She is captivating and powerful. Trust me, she didn't feel forced like some other film franchises changing the appearance of established characters, but rather it was reasonable.The CGI and special effects might be a drawback in this film. I heard some explanations that intentionally made the 3D effects look like old 3D animation to reduce the graphic violence. However, I still feel that it didn't look great and somewhat disappointing.I would rate the movie at 7.5/10 on IMDB and look forward to other DC productions with the new director, James Gunn.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Andres Muschietti, who previously directed the It movies, now is directing The Flash. It stars Ezra Miller from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, and Justice League, Michael Keaton from Batman and it sequel Batman Returns, Ben Affleck from Batman V Superman and Justice League, Sasha Calle, Kiersey Clemons, Michael Shannon, and Maribel Verdu.Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) goes back in time because he wants to save his mother. In doing so, it creates an alternate timeline. He seeks the help of Batman (Michael Keaton), Super girl (Sasha Calle), and a younger Berry Allen to help undo the mess he created.I like the Flash, Super girl and Batman, so I thought I would like this movie. However, it was too goofy and there wasn't any character development to make me care about what happens.Younger Barry was really immature, once and awhile it made me laugh, but overall it got annoying and repetitive. Older Barry was more mature, yet, still irritating and not very smart. They made Flash out to be a joke similar to how they made Thor look in Love and Thunder.Flash never developed any friendships with anyone, its mentioned how him and Batman are friends but we never see that. He had an opportunity to bond with his younger self, instead all they do is bicker, which I feel, got old after a while.Miller didn't seem like he fit the role as the Flash, I personally like Grant Gustin in the Flash television show. He seems more charming. Keaton didn't ever convince me he used to be Batman, due to the fact he wasn't ever keen on helping them. Out of everyone in this movie Calle's super girl was the only one I kind of liked. She wasn't on screen for long but she seems tough.Since there isn't a meaningful plot, the action scenes feel pointless and drawn out. In my opinion The Flash didn't need to be two hours and 24 minutes. If you want to watch something with the Flash in it, I recommend watching The Flash television show instead.","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

The only moment Ezra portrays Barry right is when he realizes what he's done and should do.All credits to Michael Keaton. He did a great job. Even his references to the first Batman movie were spot om!I'm not saying you shouldn't watch this movie but as a comic book appreciator, I wanted to see a different Barry.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

The script feels like it's jumping between multiple different versions of itself throughout the film, leaving plot holes and unresolved threads littered across the multiverse like so much Hollywood flotsam.Michael Keaton is the only enjoyable member of the cast, but that may only be because I saw his Batman in the theater as a kid. It certainly had all the nostalgia feels and he nailed the role like it was the 3rd movie in his neverwas trilogy. Honorably mention to Sasha Calle. The script did nothing for her, but it feels like she had a lot more to offer than she was given the room for in this so-called ""script"". Michael Shannon was given nothing to work with at all. I wouldn't blame him for being disappointed with the final product. His Zod deserved better. Ezra Miller waffled wildly between unenjoyable to watch or downright grating. Not great for the movie's lead.The cameos were ... ouch. I don't even know the point of what they were trying to do there. They just didn't work in most cases and ultimately are more galling with who they omitted vs. Included. To top it all off, the CGI/deepfakery was unflattering. Speaking of which...The CGI, at best, is low effort/quality. It's more often just bad and some scenes are truly awful. I don't blame the digital artists. I think they just got ""Marveled"". Judging by the script/story, it's doubtful they had the time needed to actually complete polished, professional scenes and it shows.In the end, the movie goes nowhere, says nothing, and moves the characters exactly nowhere. Which is convenient, since it's the penultimate ""end"" of the Snyderverse and has nowhere to actually go. Much like Superman, James Gunn would be best served by just ignoring this entire thing. Kind of like how the producers ignored most of the source material, character development, and common sense. I know I certainly want to forget it ever happened.If you want to see the best non-comic version of the ""Flash goes back in time and hoses literally everything"" story, check out the animated Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox. It stays very close to the story and themes of the original (and excellent) comic run, and is well produced, acted, and animated.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

Quite a few scenes with funny moments, without it turning overly silly. Some drama scenes that felt very touching. Most of the action scenes felt good and well produced. The movie felt immersive, interesting and had very few slow parts. However, it took a long time to get to the final threat and that part was over quite quickly. Overall I was happy with the movie but even though Ezra Miller tried his best, he still doesn't feel right as Flash. I don't like when they portray Flash as clumsy, socially awkward and inexperienced. Grant Gustin (TV series Flash) would have been better for the role.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The special effects are not always the best, but they are still better than Marvel's. You will love almost every character you meet and the dorming DC Cinematic Universe fan inside of you will wake up from a never-ending nightmare and wonder : why did they wait so long to do something good ?

Ezra's acting was the highlight and the low of the movie, depending on which Barry they were portraying. Sasha Calle could have been fantastic but was just lackluster and stiff. Keaton was a high point, but still the whole movie could have just done a true live action flashpoint and been much more promising.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

His portrait of Barry Allen's persona is terrible. Why must he act like a bimbo is beyond me. Totally ruins the movie and plot, which in itself was dull.The ending is very confusing so it feels like the movie didn't end or it did but didn't have the storyline that you would think it would have.

I think it may be one of my favourite DC movies.Despite all the bad press I think Ezra Miller is quite brilliant and Michael Keaton was a god as to be expected.The plot for me was good, cohesive and wraps up well. There were some very funny moments and I found the emotional connection was there especially for anyone who has experienced loss at a young age and had that burning desire to go back and ""fix it"". Also hats off to Miller for successfully playing two parts, he did it exceptionally well.A lot of people have complained about the special effects but I didn't really notice. All in all I thought it was a good film, I would happily watch it again. I think DC does need to lighten up. The films where it has tried have been the better one. It's always been too serious in comparison to marvel and for that reason has been unsuccessful. Perhaps James Gunn will be able to turn it around but I genuinely think this film is a success.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is action packed, doesn't make a lot of sense, but kids don't care about sense. There's no sloppy love scenes, just corny lines, and a few seconds of butt scenes, not enough to worry about. I enjoyed the movie on the pure entertainment of the movie. This is another of those movies where script writers and storytellers shouldn't get anywhere near pencil, pen, paper or a laptop. I gave it a rating of ten for it's entertainment factor, the action scenes and being a fan of Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton. Michael Keaton in my estimation was and is the best Batman to ever wear the suit, cape and cowl.

For most of the movie my mouth was open. I can't believe they released this film in this state. The acting is shocking, Ezra Miller channels Tommy Wiseau . You can tell they are mentally unwell just by the performance alone. The CGI is equally bad and reminds me of the Green lantern movie- and the movie leans hard on these effects. Some of the cameos are cool, but because the effects are that bad it just makes them laughable.I went in the movie with no expectations and came out physically angry because it felt like a waste of time. I have nostalgia for Michael Keaton Batman and even that was hampered but the effects. Tim burton can make a cool practical scene in the 90s - 30 years later we have cgi that looks like a film student did it.Me and the friend I watched it with both fell to sleep multiple times - usually we'd wake each other up- but I thought ""let him sleep- he's not missing anything.""

If this movie brings in a lot of money that would only solidify that feeling and might allow DC to make Ezra Miller's Flash role a permanent and reuccuring character.DC can explore options to bring in Grant Gustin or literally any other actor as The Flash. They can just swap actors outright or from an alternate reality if they want to bake it into the storyline.Go and watch Spider-Man: Across the Spider-verse which is the outstanding Marvel/Sony movie The Flash is opening against and one of the best superhero movies created to date in my opinion. Please wait wait till this movie comes out on a steaming platform or find some other means of watching it where it doesn't help to solidify Miller's Flash role.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

Ezra does a great job playin' his parts, no matter what people say or think. It's an awesome superhero movie with all the eggs and cameos! Best DC has put up since Bats 89! I really did like the way they did the Flash's story. Too little of Iris, tho. She felt like an afterthought. Glad they improved Flash's run animation, and the jokes were much better, but in some places the CGArt was way wonky looking. Took away from the overall quality of the movie. Looking forward to seeing what they do next!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Lucky for Barry, he also resurrects Christopher Reeves, Adam West, and George Reeves, ushering in the advent of truly believable AI voices synced with dead-on realistic deepfake technology that audiences will surely come to love looking at for decades and decades and decades, and even decades, to cum. Ben Afflect shines as a Batman, finally getting to enjoy the fruitbats of his labors by getting to play the caped crusader in a production that doesn't shatter into a bajillion pieces during it's post-production period; it goes off without a hitch, as he is highlighted as the dominant Batman/Bruce Wayne, to which I'm sure has left Afflect very satisfied with how he's spent nearly the past decade of his life. Nic Cage reprises his role as Barry's Uncle, Dad, and Clooners is BACK as Superman IV. Zod brings da heat! Born again Flashheads will flock to theaters this Father's Day weekend to witness what only the CEO of Warner Bros has described as ""the greatest superhero movie ever."" The film is on track to surpass the $1billion mark after only 4 days, making it the greatest thing to ever happen to humans in the history of forever. But analytics by the studios' marketing team already shows that the inevitable sequels are on track to being even greater, making them greater than the greatest thing to ever happen to humans in the history of forever. So come on! Join Barry Allen, again, and finally become happy. Life is approximately 75 years, and then you're worm food.

I dozed off several times. Maybe I'm not into the DC universe, the story was difficult to follow - at times silly, at times down-right stupid and at times, plagiaristic. The main (?) plot of the story appeared to center on the death of the Flash's mother - it bookends the movie. But you never are given a clue as to the resolution of that. Then you have the very obvious error where someone dies in the middle of the film which should have ever lasting effects on the balance of the film, but oh well - not sure how that one ends up. On top of that, they parade thru every person whos ever donned a DC superhero outfit - even Nicholas Cage. Nicholas Cage????? Please!

It kind of didn't make too much sense but the first two acts complement the third one. Most of the comedy lands, the emotion is on 100 in this movie, but that's not to say this movie doesn't have any faults. The biggest fault I can say is the abysmal CGI. The CGI is plain hideous and disgusting.

With great actors such as Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Carlos Valdes, Daniela Panabaker,Tom Cavanagh, Jesse Martin, among others. The actors from this movie, with the respect they reserve were super poor. First time in my life I fall asleep, there was no trama, no story behind, just scenes happening, I paid for my cinema ticket and my train transportation to the cinema for no reason. One of the worst decisions of my life. You made Barry in this movie as if he was totally brainless as a human or too nerd, that someone would get annoyed or bored by watching it. No action showed in the movie. Seems like you needed to add Batman and superwoman to try to make it better because it was not enough for you. I would like to get my money back after this disappointment. I don't know what where the expectations from the production side when the movie was finished filming or edited. I ended up very upset for the disappointment of such a bad movie and even left 30 minutes before because didn't make sense keep watching something so boring.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

The main actor, Ezra Miller, has little talent as an actor, as his portrayal (yes, HIS) in Justice League proved.Re-hashing Affleck's version of the Dark Knight, is also evidence that the producers didn't care about the characters, given his portrayal of Daredevil in the film, let alone his appaling take of Batman in previous films!The inclusion of the late actors Christopher Reeve and Adam West as their versions of Superman and Batman, are terrible tributes to both actors.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

It was pretty great!First and foremost, Ezra was actually really phenomenal in this movie. The worry I have is when we are dealing with multiversal storylines, we typically would be getting more cameos and nostalgia rather than an actual story with character growth and story progression. We do have the nostalgia obviously with Michael Keaton returning as Batman, but I'm glad to say that the nostalgia doesn't cloud Ezra's performance. This movie made me go from appreciating his character, to loving his character.Like I said Keaton returns and while his character was fun to see again, I was surprised with how sparingly he was used in this movie. He does have some cool action sequences though.I do wish we got a little bit more of Sasha Coelle as Supergirl. She was still a stand out regardless.Overall the film does a good job balancing the multiversal side of the DCEU while delivering a great story with heart pounding action. While the DCEU may be coming to an end, I'm glad that we at least ended (at least in my opinion) on a high note. Easily within the top 5 best DCEU films I've seen, and a well executed multiversal film.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

However in this movie it feels like a shining light in an otherwise drab environment. There's no denying Miller's solid acting in the role, however even his performance can't save the movie from its faulty narrative. The lack of depth and exciting script hinders his ability to truly shine in the role. Everyone else is similarly fine in their role with no standout poor performances. However nothing stands out as great and this maybe more down to the story than anything else.The special effects team did a decent job of showcasing the Flash's super-speed abilities. Whether it's running up a building or battling a horde of villains, the Flash's super-speed is presented in a way that is both acceptable and at times visually impressive. However, the choreography and execution of the action scenes lack the wow factor that you may have come to expect from this genre. The sequences feel formulaic failing to leave a lasting impression or generate genuine excitement.The story has an overly complicated narrative that involves time travel, parallel universes and a host of other elements that make for a convoluted and confusing viewing experience. It's a classic case of a film trying to do too much and consequently achieving too little. The intriguing concepts are poorly executed, resulting in a convoluted and confusing plot that fails to engage le you fully. The story lacks a clear direction and fails to fully explore the potential of the consequences they could have on the world around him. It feels like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities of the character and his universe.Without giving away spoilers, the conclusion feels rushed and underwhelming. The build-up to the climax is poorly executed and the resolution of the main conflict feels unsatisfying and anticlimactic. It leaves you with a sense of dissatisfaction. The emotional connections and relationships between the characters feel shallow and unexplored, further diminishing the impact of the story. This lack of character development hampers the film's ability to create a meaningful and lasting impression after the credits roll.Overall, the movie has a decent enough performance from Ezra Miller but fails to deliver a compelling and interesting story. It's a film that will likely appeal to die-hard fans of the Flash franchise (or DC in general), but for casual viewers it may prove to be a confusing and ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience.4/10.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Miller gives knew meaning to the word dexterity as the dual (or actual triple) roles as Barry Allen and his titular alter ego whose burden of attempting to prove his father's (Livingston) innocence in the murder of his mother (Verdu) which culminates in his ability to time travel via his gifts of super speed whereby the parallel universe proves to indeed be a trixy paradox but gets able support from his 'other me' and Bruce Wayne (Keaton reprising his iconic role after 30 years and providing enough full body chills for the film's inception) to stop General Zod (Shannon) from wiping out the Earth's populace (again). While the visuals are often hit/miss (more on the hit but there's some dodginess particularly the 'baby shower' set piece)and eye-popping when viewed in IMAX the simple giddy pleasures of seeing Keaton's Dark Knight returning full impact with Danny Elfman's 'Batman March' is pure cinematic Heaven's Delight.

Yes, it is seriously and unexplainably flawed by ridiculously poor choices involving shockingly poor production values and CGI effects mostly. A whole segment that conceptually seemed to be a brilliant idea should have instead been left for the deleted scenes extras for the inevidable video release. It will piss you off a bit but the performances and committment to a fairly thoughtful and even progressive storyline are that good that you'll get over it. Is Miller's performance academy worthy? Yup. But the other highlight is the actress who plays Supergirl. Had she had more scenes she would have stolen the movie. All in all a perfect summer fun time movie event!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Jumbled Mess of a Movie Like Crushed Tomatoes Going Splat w Overlong Battle Scenes and Unresolved Issues","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9131556/?ref_=tt_urv","classicalsteve","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7383416/?ref_=tt_urv","18 June 2023","The idea of time streams is a complex one, and whether crushed tomatoes are placed on a certain shelf in a grocery store changes the entire history of the world. But here, 75% of the movie consists of long battle and action sequences of the CGI variety which go on way too long and didn't further the story much. At one point it appeared like a video game, most of which I had seen before. Actual story made up about 25% of the film. An aging Batman/Bruce Wayne, played by Michael Keaton reprising his role of 30 years ago, tries to explain the time stream stuff. And get this: he uses the analogy of crushed tomatoes on top of bad spaghetti! (Keaton's reappearance as Batman/Wayne was my favorite aspect of the movie,) But how the time stream stuff works is never fully explained which made me think the screenwriters hadn't really thought it all through.The story has two plots. The first which we learn pretty quickly so I'm not giving anything away is that the Flash's mom had been murdered and his father has been unjustly accused of the crime. He goes back in time to try to ""fix"" what happened. But his changing of history has dire consequences. But these consequences have not just Earth-changing significances but also change some of the history of the Universe!The second plot appears in about the middle of the movie, and as far as I can tell, comes into being because of the changing of history. However, this is never fully explained. This second plot was far too underdeveloped to be completely comprehensible and in some ways I found I didn't really care too much about it.. Without giving too much away, it involves the appearance of General Zod, who unlike the first two Superman movies with Christopher Reeve, is more like a cross between Vladimir Harkonnen of ""Dune"" and the Incredible Hulk. My problem with this portrayal of Zod is that it was flat and uninteresting. Terence Stamp in the first two Reeve Superman movies made his character highly interesting and appealing. Here he's just a slobbering hulk.The biggest flaws of this movie: the baddie and his subplot are under-developed, the characters were not developed enough for me to care about them, and the action sequences were far too long and did almost nothing to further the plot. At many points I was waiting in rapt anticipation for the end of the sequence. Even a great action sequence with CGI has to further the story in some way. If it's just action for the sake of action because studio execs think that's what the 14-to-24 crowd wants, it's a bad storytelling decision.While I liked Keaton's reappearance as Batman, the only aspect which I found entertaining, I felt the overall movie was so in your face in the action department and lacking in story development, I have no desire to see this film again. Yes there are a lot of complex ideas in this film, but a story has to explain them and spend a bit of time letting the audience understand, instead of having superheroes zooming around all over the place going after super-baddies.In the end, I found myself not really caring that much about the characters which is often the ultimate point of any story. In the first Reeve Superman movie, when Superman finally brings up the dead Lois Lane from her car stuck in the ground, we were on the verge of tears. Here I was like, yeah? There are references to other Superheros in the DC Universe and images of other actors playing the roles of Superman and Batman. At one point it was getting a bit much like this was a homage to the whole DC/Warner Brothers franchise. But Zod is not like the Terence Stamp version, my favorite portrayal, and was just not interesting enough to care one or the other. I have no desire to see this movie again and I doubt whether it will be released in a 25th-anniversary edition a quarter century from now.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

Ezra is endearing, sometimes obnoxious, always loving, and brings the funny and charming. He's just great. This film is excellent! I went to a matinee alone with absolutely no expectations, and I'm so glad I did. I loved it. The Flash is wildly entertaining in a perfectly balanced way. Action (despite a weird CGI baby or three), compelling family drama, comedic moments, and envelope pushing super hero science fiction that juuust keeps it both plausible - keeping in mind this is a guy who can ""run"" the speed of light - and exciting. And these fantastic physics bring into the story arc a cast of likable new familiars that aren't just gratuitous walk ons, but integral to the Flash. And to their own separate stories, which you WILL think about after seeing this movie. It finishes on a twist. Not a cliffhanger, but a twist that leaves future casting potentially fluid, which is something these actors are ok with eventually. You can't play Doctor Who forever now, can you?The Flash sets a new bar to the DC world standalone films, in my opinion. Much more fun than Superman, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and every Batman but the latest one. Now bring back the Justice League, and don't beat these solo films into the dirt.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It plays with the ever increasingly familiar multi-verse trope yet to me it wasn't a cliched story. There was a genuine heart and emotion underneath all these, frankly, stunning, distinctive yet somewhat overwhelmingly bombastic visuals. The story, I felt, was quite messy yet strangely I didn't feel it hindered my enjoyment of the film. I was invested in the characters and their goals and their wants and their histories.It's not the type of film you go into and just turn off your brain and watch and enjoy. You do need to pay attention to what is happening on screen, and it can help to have a bit of knowledge of the wider DCEU, but I feel most people could go into this and find something they enjoyed - be it the story, the humour, the characters, the visuals, the action set-pieces or the surprisingly large amount of fan-service moments throughout.Talking of fan-service, without giving away too much info, in the third act of the film I was just so enjoying what and who I was seeing that I was kind of forgiving the film's shortcomings.The Flash is flawed, yes, but it's really entertaining and a great way to just enjoy a movie. It's got the epic scale, it's got the characters, it's got the (mostly) decent story. It was just a joy to watch in my opinion.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I agree that some of the CGI was 20 y.o. Tech, most likely subject to budgetary compromises, yet the focus on the quality of the character's faces was extremely cool.I was confused by one of the character variants so my son got me to watch the video of Kevin Smith talking about his Superman script, hilarious entertainment in itself.If I could offer a recommendation: Grab some popcorn, open your mind to a brief escape and enjoy the show.

There were scenes that set up later important plot points, etc. Plus I have a weakness for the time paradox plot devices. :-)The biggest disappointment for me would be the opening scene. The made the flash whine & complain about the work he was doing. Why not make the character likeable? He's seen some serious stuff, wouldn't he be more mature by now? Or, alternatively why not make him out to be having fun with this powers & enjoy every last thing he gets to do? Also, it was like they were trying to copy Quicksilver's scene from Age of Ultron, but failed. I can't put my finger on it, but, it just wasn't cool like quicksilver's scene.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film captures moments of joy and emotion that resonate deeply. Sure, there are some valid concerns about the CGI, but don't let that deter you from giving it a shot. Trust me, it's worth it. Ezra Miller truly shines as an actor, showcasing his range and versatility in the role. And let's not forget the unique concept of the multiverse brought to life by director Andy, which adds a refreshing and enjoyable element to the film. Sasha shines as supergirl, it was a great time seeing Michael Keaton back as Batman. Additionally, I have a few concerns to share. Firstly, Sasha's role as Supergirl felt somewhat underutilized, leaving me wishing for more screen time and development for her character. The climax of the film didn't have the impact I was hoping for. While the story held promise, it lacked the intensity and sense of a life-or-death challenge that truly engages viewers. And let's not forget the CGI, which remains a significant concern. It often fell short of expectations and detracted from the overall immersion of the movie. While #TheFlashMovie has its merits, these issues are worth considering. Despite my reservations, it's still worth giving it a watch if you're a fan of the franchise. Hopefully, future installments will address these shortcomings. Overall, I highly recommend giving The Flash Movie a chance. It's a feel-good ride that will leave you wanting more. Kudos to the cast and crew for delivering an entertaining and memorable cinematic experience.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

There a lot of ways to describe this corporate product. Rest assured ""decent"" isn't one of them.At the very least you can hardly make an argument for it being squandered potential, since every single piece of this incredibly lame jigsaw puzzle is broken at it's core.The CGI is genuinely ghastly, and truly embarrassing at times. With the exception of maybe five shots, everything looks utterly artificial, and beyond fake. There are moments where you have to wonder whether, or not it's actually some kind of elaborate meta joke. ""Am I supposed to laugh at the disgustingly obvious CGI tears? The music certainly doesn't seem to imply so.""The funniest parts are definitely every time the filmmakers try to convince the audience, that there are real emotions being displayed, while most of the cast has a permanently frozen look of boredom, with a hefty dose of apathy on their faces.Unfortunately for anyone like myself, who really appreciates a good disasterpiece, after the 10 minute mark even any surface level ironic enjoyment comes to a screeching halt.At that point most of what we're shown is the powerfully cringe inducing performance by our lead actor, which one might be able to withstand, if it wasn't for the literal doubling down of having two Flashes interacting with one another for most of this poorly conceived SNL skit. It's really as painful as it sounds.This one is a perfect example of a vacuum cleaning movie. As long as most of your senses are preoccupied with noisy housework, you'll have a pleasant viewing experience.Just don't gaze into this thing too long, otherwise this thing might gaze into you.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Zak Snyder is possibly the worst director on the face of the planet.

Oh how misguided I was.I don't know who it is at DC that thinks you need to CGI 98.3% of their film, but YOU REALLY DON'T! Cgi people fighting cgi aliens while cgi vehicles shoot at each other on a cgi desert. Its genuinely dreadful.The worst part is that the story is pretty good. As is the dialogue. But it's like they went out of their way to emulate Snyder's terrible film making style.They've also tried to introduce the concept of a multiverse.

I've watched and largely enjoyed many but not quite all the seasons of the recent DCTV series starring Grant Guston as the Scarlet Speedster but must admit I was very trepidatious regarding Ezra Miller's taking on the role, particularly having seen how the character was portrayed in the recent Justice League movie.In the John Broome / Cary Bates-scripted comics of the 60's and 70's I loved, Barry West was a blonde, originally crew-cutted two-dimensional character with almost no hinterland. Happily married and in regular employment as a police scientist, all he had to do every issue really was tussle with a different member of his ever-changing Rogue's Gallery, but of course that just won't play today. So, rather like Marvel's Spider-Man, this Barry West is a geeky young man just out of his teens, with very few social skills or even social life come to that, struggling to cope with the double-whammy of his beloved mother's brutal murder in their own home and his innocent father convicted on flimsy circumstantial evidence of the crime.Because of the character's earlier introduction in the ""JL"" feature, we're spared the usual drawn-out origin story and taken to the heart of the action, namely the superhero's attempt to go back in time and by changing one tiny element in the past, hopefully save his mother without disturbing too much the space-time continuum leading back to the present day.Naturally things don't go according to plan and he ends up encountering and having to partner his younger self, which requires Miller to extensively double-up throughout the film. There's a lot of Bill and Ted / Wayne's World / Beavis and Butthead (take your pick) - type humour between the two Barry's, which while quite amusing in parts, probably goes on too long and slows down the film.We are of course by this stage, deep in the multiverse and to help them in their quest the duo enlist the help of this time-line's Batman, where it was genuinely pleasing to see Michael Keaton return to the role he first brought to life under the aegis of Tim Burton. Things get worse though and in truth a little overcomplicated, not to say overcooked when, in the now-trio's search for Superman they instead discover Supergirl which is handy considering that super-powered Phantom Zone villain General Zod is that very instant planning to take over the earth.It all ends up with the customary CG-Fest Battle Royal although this is underscored by our two Flashes having to deal with such concepts as time paradoxes, alternate variants and inevitable intersections before they put the universes (almost) to rights albeit at some personal cost but at least get the bonus of righting one major wrong in the present.Listen, there was a heck of a lot going on here plot-wise, especially the information overload at the climax but I just about managed to stay with it. Bits of the film I really liked, such as when Flash 1 and 2 light up the old Batcave and especially the tributes paid to the Batmen and Supermen of the past (it was particularly moving to see the late Christopher Reeve up on the screen once again) although sadly there was no place for Val Kilmer. Best of all though for me, parochial as it may seem, was seeing within the first 5 minutes, the centre of my home city Glasgow, transformed into a comic-book battleground.I'm well aware that this film has not performed to expectations at the box office making it unlikely that the Flash character will return to the big screen any time soon, especially played by Miller who seems to have serious personal issues in his / their life. For me that would be a shame because I actually did enjoy the movie. Miller carries off well the tricky task of playing the same character whose ages are only a few years apart and I think he did so with a good degree of personality.I'm definitely not going to abandon my old child-hood favourite now although I fear for the character's future status in the DC pantheon after the commercial failure of this feature. I guess what I'm saying is that I hope that this outing doesn't prove to be only a flash in the pan.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

As a die-hard superhero film enthusiast, I can confidently state that ""The Flash"" reigns supreme, standing tall as the finest superhero movie in recent memory.The film's storyline had me hooked from the very start. It expertly weaves together a gripping narrative that explores the origins of our scarlet speedster, Barry Allen, and takes us on an adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster ride through the complexities of his life. The character development was exceptional, allowing us to connect emotionally with Barry's struggles, triumphs, and profound sense of responsibility.The casting couldn't have been more perfect. The talented lead actor effortlessly embraced the role of Barry Allen, embodying the essence of both the ordinary man and the extraordinary hero. The supporting cast was equally impressive, each member bringing depth and authenticity to their respective characters. The chemistry between the characters was palpable, creating moments of heartfelt camaraderie and camaraderie that stayed with me long after the credits rolled.What truly sets ""The Flash"" apart is its stunning visual effects and mind-bending action sequences. The use of special effects to depict the speedster's abilities was nothing short of spectacular. From breathtaking high-speed chases to jaw-dropping confrontations, the film delivered on all fronts, leaving me on the edge of my seat and yearning for more.Director's visionary prowess shines through every frame, delivering a masterclass in pacing and storytelling. The balance between heartwarming character-driven moments and heart-stopping action was nothing short of perfection. Each scene was meticulously crafted, creating an engaging and immersive experience that captivated me from start to finish.""The Flash"" is not just a superhero film; it is a celebration of hope, courage, and the unyielding human spirit. It reminds us that even in the face of overwhelming odds, anyone can become a hero and make a difference. This film resonates on a profound level, leaving audiences with a renewed belief in the power of good.In conclusion, ""The Flash"" is a triumph in the superhero genre and sets a new standard for excellence. Whether you're a fan of the comics or a newcomer to the world of superheroes, this film has something special to offer. So, if you're looking for an unforgettable cinematic experience, brace yourself for a journey of a lifetime with ""The Flash.""

THE FLASH is admittedly not a ""movie"", however, but an IP monstrosity.Much has already been said about this basically being a soulless showcase for intellectual property, which is concurrently robbed of its original emotional and artistic value by being displayed in this way. And THE FLASH does indeed embody everything that is wrong with modern nostalgia-based content - so much so that one can only hope that these movies will finally self-destruct not only artistically, but more importantly at the box office.THE FLASH is also one of the ugliest films I have ever seen. I don't know what's going on with Warner Bros. And their visual effects studios, but it's like they were told to use the scorpion king CGI from THE MUMMY RETURNS as a benchmark, while at the same time having too little time to finish their work. It's absolutely baffling - and entertaining in a morbidly strange way: At least twenty percent of this thing looks like straight out of a PS2 cutscene, even the actors' faces look artificial. I wouldn't be surprised if Ben Affleck was only on set for 30 minutes and all of his full-body scenes were completely animated afterwards.I'm honestly glad that this movie flopped big time. Seems to be the only positive aspect about this ""hot mess"".","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Watch this film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are a lot of laughs and sombre moments to have in this meloncolle film. And what I would say is one of the saddest scenes in a superhero movie. The performances were amazing, and I know that Ezra Miller is controversial and has done some bad things. But I think Miller gives one of the best Superhero performances to date. The action was like reading a comic book or watching the justice league unlimited cartoon. The scores/music were really great, felt like old superheroe movies. The scores are as big as the larger than life heroes. The story was fantastic, and unlike what people say the ending does not contradict Barry's arc. The only actual true flaw are the visual effects. 30% of them are done and polished, another 30% are done just not polished, and the last 40% are just starting to get worked on. But what I'm looking at is really great it's like you have a beautiful outline of a painting that they took their time with. But they rushed when they were painting it. Overall love The Flash can't wait to add it to the 4k collection.9/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Esra with all his personal problems put aside puts in a emotional and comedic performance playing the 2 Barry's, if it's his last performance as The Flash he did the role proud.Sasha Calle as Supergirl although she's not in it that much I think she done well with what she was given.And now last but not least Michael Keaton as Batman he stole the movie hands down, I was there on opening night in a packed cinema and when he came out suited up everyone cheered (not used to that in DC films lol) like when cap picked up Thors hammer, literal chills. Not going to lie I probably wouldn't have liked the film as much as i did if it weren't for him retuning as the dark knight and he slips back into the role with ease like he never even left. Trust me if you're one of the ones only there for Keaton Batman you will not be disappointed!My only complaint with the film is the the cgi looks really bad in some places and it's normally when both Barry's are on screen and one of the faces just doesn't seem right like Henry Cavill mustache cgi in justice league bad but it never stopped me from enjoying the film and I'm booked to go again next week.Finally a win for DC.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It had a lot of potential and it was all pushed to the side for this joke of a movie. Supergirl is dull and seems to be a Mexican that has been in jail their whole life but is able to come back to full strength with 30 seconds of sunshine. Why is Ben Affleck Batman all CG?

It stands out because of its budget and hype going into it. You would think, that with so much riding on the movie to be good and with a budget of hundreds of millions, a main priority would be a solid script. The script for The Flash is so horrible, it's as if it was purposely written to be bad. Seeing as there's only a couple things that I liked, I'll break down all aspects of the film.The characters are like exaggerated versions of real people. Most people come off as dumb, childish, and quirky, all for the sake of trying to make the audience laugh. Batman becomes a joke the way he acts around Wonder Woman, and The Flash is the embodiment overacting. Things get worse in the alternate universe as characters become mentally restarted for some unknown reason.The story is paper thin. The inciting incident and ultimate goal that drives The Flash isn't strong enough to carry a superhero story. The secondary plot, that drives action, is mostly in the background since the movie is hoping people know it from Man of Steel. Characters come in and out of the story only when they are needed as a plot device. The movie hopes that the action and the jokes keep viewers interests away from the bland story. It also wants to rely on ""cameos"" to bolster its enjoyment, but most the the so-called cameos are just cgi recreations that lasts a few seconds.The action itself is a failure since it's only as strong as the cgi that creates it. Yes, the cgi, the number one complaint about the movie. It's far from the worst thing about the movie, but it does make the action beyond unbelievable since it separates any sort of physical reality from the fantasy of seeing superheroes doing superhero things.The biggest issue with the movie, is the script. For starters, the dialogue is laughably bad. Not one of the jokes worked for me (nor the audience I was with) and lines are written as if it's meant for kids to understand. I guess that explains why The Flash and so many other characters act like children. Characters do things for laughs, despite them being idiotic. The Flash hides his identity as well as someone blending into the jungle with a high vis vest. Luckily he's surrounded by stupid people who can't realize that it's this birdbrained guy. The rules set forth in the movie are only followed when the script wants them to be followed. The worst travesty is the ultimate resolution bombshell moment takes place in the goofy court scene. The evidence presented at a trial is the pinnacle of stupidity and is a major plot hole.I could write a book detailing the issues with the movie, so I'll finish off with two things that I did like. Any time Michael Keaton was on screen was nice and his explanation of the multiverse using noodles was well done. The Flash is a great movie to illustrate how there's certifiable attributes that equate to a movie being bad, personal feelings aside.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

So I went into it not expecting much at all coming from a big Flash fan who has watched all 9 seasons of the TV Show on The CW and was very surprised.Now The Flash is no where near perfect but the plot is great with the two Barry Allens, Michael Keaton's Batman, and Sasha Calle's Supergirl for the little time she was on screen. The CGI obviously wasn't perfect in some scenes but was not ""horrible"" or ""terrible"" I honestly expected way worse going off the reviews I had read. Overall The Flash is an enjoyable and fun experience to watch on the big screen.The only downside for me is ofcourse not having Grant Gustin's Flash in the movie not even for a small cameo, when they were able to add so many cameos in the multiverse scene towards the end. I feel they could of easily added a scene of Gustin's Flash even just like how Ezra appeared on the CW Flash for that one scene with Gustin's Flash telling Ezra's Flash about the name ""The Flash"" and later on calling himself The Flash. I just feel like this was a missed opportunity for us Flash fans.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

driven films with depth without sacrificing watchability and pace. The Flash isn't going to wow you with an uber-original story, but what might drop your jaw is the steadfast vision and a litany of incredible performances. Ezra Miller has had his troubles in his personal life, but his acting talent can't be denied. He displays a thorough understanding of the character Barry Allen and excels not only in the dramatic moments but has spot on comedic timing as well. His lead performance is further augmented by the terrific work of Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle, who both bring unique mentalities and motivations to their roles. The script is well written and surprisingly digestible, with multiple scenes that had me uncontrollably cackling. Muschietti handles the camera smoothly with natural instincts on close versus wide shots and an affinity for capturing imposing visuals. This is easily one of the most complete movies I've seen in recent years, and I will certainly be returning to the theatre for a second viewing.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is not terrible. It delivers the action, the fun direction, the cameos, and a great cast.The plot follows Barry (Ezra Miller) using his powers to travel back in time to save his mom and his father from being framed. After messing with the time line, he will need the help from Bruce (Michael Keaton) and super girl (Sasha Calle) to help stop a threat from Zod (Michael Shannon).Great plot which it tries to add a bit of emotional connection with one trying to change the past to save a loved one. While there are consequences that can affect the future.The film has plenty of action sequences that delivers. The opening sequence is awesome with Batman in his bat cycle trying to stop robbers. And Barry trying to save people. The action sequences are exciting. The visual effects may be questionable. But the director stated it is supposed to be like that to put the audiences in the flash perspective when he is travelling through time and space.Michael Keaton as Batman was awesome. It was nice to see him back. And taking full advantage of Batmans abilities. Sasha Calle was also the highlight as Supergirl. Even though i did feel like Batman and Supergirl were underutilized in the film. Ezra Miller is good as the character. Making it fun. They may have over done it with its humor.The film does have a lot of fun cameos. From a lot of actors. Also opening up the possibility that dc universe is endless.The film did struggle near the third act. By overdoing it with its timelines crashing. There was barely a fight between Flash and a villain. It was overwhelming. Also didnt have any development to supergirl and batman.Overall, it is a fun film with lots of action and fun cameos.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The ending could be better IMO.Highly recommend this to anyone who like superheroes movies.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

That being said, the way this movie was done was the only way they could have done a script of this kind. So... Michael Keaton's Batman was wonderful, definitely could've done more with Supergirl, but all in all it was a heart felt movie with action and a great storyline.

As soon as we all saw Michael Keaton was back as Batman our interest was piqued again.The Hospital baby scene is amusing but expected, Michael Keaton is both amusing as a homeless looking recluse but kick ass as Batman, Sasha Calle is great as Supergirl and Ezra manages to make two versions of themselves interesting and engaging. The vomit scene from being moved too fast is brilliant but overdone. The many Superman versions are a little overdone and Nicholas Cage has no place in the movie. Despite what others say, the ohmage to Christopher Reeve is pretty much a snippet of his movies and not CGI and the movie is surprising worth watching. Maybe not twice but it's worth a watch to add Barry Allen to the DC Universe properly. Sasha Calle however has definitely put her hand up for Kara to be added properly.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

His continuous, thoughtless behaviour, and his endless list of legal offences, if it hasn't already, threatens to cast a dark shadow over the DC Cinematic Universe's beloved speedster, much to the dismay of us fans.Multiverse theory and time-travelling have been done to death, and unfortunately, ""The Flash"" runs right into that brick wall. DC's Flashpoint Paradox event was a dazzling spectacle in comic form, full of layers and twists. But to recreate that on the big screen is already a tough task, and to do it while the superhero genre is already saturated, nah.Then there's the running motion, it's his literal superpower, the crux of the narrative, and yet, it's been botched so profoundly, you'd think it was intentional. Whether it was Ezra Miller or not, the running motion made DC's fastest hero look like a character snagged from a 2010 glitched video game than the humanoid lightning bolt he's supposed to be.On the brighter side, the time-travel-related character twists do inject a bit of intrigue. However, the attempts at complexity often feel like a novice juggler with one too many balls in the air.The graphics in this film were extremely disappointing, particularly when we consider current technology where AI can generate lifelike human figures almost instantly. One would expect a seasoned team of VFX professionals to deliver a noticeably superior level of quality.Time to reboot the reboots?","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Flash dodges familiarity at times it would've benefited from it, and is familiar in the ways it does not benefit from. Aside from the media narratives about The Flash, I wouldn't be surprised if anyone who came out of this movie said they loved it or hated it.There are a lot of problems with this movie and it's a lot of fun. Many people have critiqued Ezra Miller's lead performance but I wouldn't say that's even the biggest problem. The biggest problem with this movie is how bad it looks visually. Some of that HAD to be on purpose. Some of the action scenes really work and some really don't because of this issue. It's loud, it's ugly, it's some very bad editing & CGI.The Flash has a fun plot that drove home a solid point on living with regret or such a desire for the life you could have had. Within 30 minutes of this starting, I realized it probably wasn't that good of a movie based on how it looked and how it pretended the Justice League was this group with momentum rather than a bunch of actors who we know aren't playing them again. The later cameos are lazy and uninspired. Most of this tries to draw on a nostalgia for DC movies that just really isn't there for me, so it didn't really work emotionally.Some people will love this, some will hate it, it definitely makes a lot of INTERESTING choices. I think people should watch it though.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

While the popular complaint of the CGI not being up to par is true, it does not take away from the epic, emotional story that this sets out to tell. The entire cast does a phenomenal job and you can tell they were really having fun doing it too. The story quickly gets you connected and invested as anyone can relate to the fear that Barry is feeling and the desire to fix something that never should have been to begin with. It's for the best that this universe got wrapped in a bow and I am glad that we at least got to chuckle at the fate of Ezra and the entire DCEU as it is finally put to rest.

The title character is an effete, annoying weirdo who spends most of the movie being the voice of reason to a more effete, more annoying version of himself. A few serviceable cameos aside the only real bright spot is Michael Keaton's return as Batman. It's by far the biggest bit of nostalgia-bait but it actually works. The movie's best elements are when it's cribbing sets, dialogue and score from Keaton's 1989 classic and letting him run with his quirky but engaging take on the character. Whatever you think of Keaton's version of Batman he didn't play the lead in superhero movie as a hyperactive 30-year-old virgin. The contrast with Ezra Miller's Flash will make you yearn for better days. Alas Keaton isn't utilized enough to fully salvage what is otherwise a vapid trainwreck of a movie.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's puzzling how the writers and cast struggle to capture the essence of these beloved characters, despite having a wealth of comics and movies to draw inspiration from. Just look at Justice League: The Flashpoint as an example of how it can be done right. Sadly, the new generation of DC films falls short. Marvel, on the other hand, succeeds by making subtle changes from the comics and ensuring the characters remain true to their core. This is where DC is lacking; both the characters and plots are undergoing significant transformations.

I was a former Batman hater. I felt it was childish after years of hating on Batman and to hate a fictional character.However, I never felt so happy to see the batman guy. He was the best part in this mediocre movie.Sept 8th 2023What is this movie about?:It's about listening to Flash whine and talk while time traveling to save his mommy and while its barely about battling Zod.The story and the production overview:It's boring. Not much time adventure.Ezra is annoying. He hurts my ears. He's not a good Flash.I didn't like the baby scene. It was too violent and hard to watch.All of Flash's supporting characters were horrid. Iris West looks like a mixture of Rhianna and Valkyrie.Supergirl was. Meh kay.Each batman was cool.I'm not a dc guy or read the comic but this Flashpoint was horrible.Just stick to the animated version if you must.They improved on the Flash suit. It's way better than the clunky one in JL.Highlight: Wonderwoman theme music.Villian: Zod but he was barely in it or had any development. For the time he was on screen he did very well.Genre: Fantasy and superheroSoundtrack: Had iconic tunes.Duration: 2H 24M... So long with very little to discuss.Love it? Okay? Meh? Or Hash?: The movie is Hash.Last Words: I barfed in my mouth when I saw the ugly dog. Overall the movie was boring. Almost 3 hours long with no reward. Ezra Miller is a horrible Flash.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

But, this movie really says something incredible about the DCEU - the issue isn't with the actors at all; the issue has always been the script they were dealt with.The Flash opens right on point after an action sequence just for an introduction of the character. It starts with him exploring the possibility of saving his mom. The movie manages to keep your attention throughout due to the excellent humour and characters' arcs. Michael Keaton is fantastic as the Batman. So is Ezra Miller! I honestly think he should continue to play the role of The Flash in DCU too.The music was forgettable.The movie truly shines the most when it's dealing with elaborate action set pieces, especially involving the batman. They're incredibly genius and to the point, not at all over the top, and keep you wishing for a little more run time!In all, a very well balanced action fun movie with strong performances. Solid 8/10.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

That is neither good nor bad. I knew it would be awesome just because Keaton's Batman is in it. But I also knew that aside from Keaton, the film fails to stand on its own.Let's face it, without Keaton, this film is a total flop. Point blank. The Flash cannot carry his own movie, so this required some ""nostalgic"" help. But being that Keaton is heavily involved in the plot, I suppose you can call it the saving grace of this film.The scenes with Batman and Supergirl were excellent. Everything else was just...... Meh!I have a big problem the fact that the Flash can simply undo all the bad things that happen simply by going back into the past any time he wants. It makes for extremely lazy writing. And you just know right off the bat that this film will end by fixing something in the past. Yes, his mother dies. But in future sequels, Barry can simply rethink about how to approach going into the past again to fix everything that happened in this film. That would make it extremely convenient for ANY character to always come back from the ""dead"" and appear in future sequels to milk the nostalgia cow.And no, don't get me started on the terrible CGI that was impossible not to notice in some parts!But otherwise, despite all of it's shortcomings, I actually did enjoy watching this film. Not sure that it would ever need any further sequels though.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Instead, I left knowing I had been entertained for an hour and a half. Seeing Michael Keaton in the bat suit once again took me back.to 1989. It was like time had stood still for 34 years. Considering the whole concept of the movie was about going back in time, I truly appreciated all of this. There was plenty of nostalgia for all generations of the superhero genre. Were the special effects great, not really, but they were enough for the film. I thought the addition of Supergirl was excellent. I felt an immediate draw to her. Great job with that. Trust me when I say, it isn't the best movie I have seen, but it is way better than some of the other superhero movies that have been submitted in the past.

The story is strong, plot devices work, the usage and creativity of the flash's powers and Batman's gadgets were really clever and I appreciated the little, small details throughout the film. The emotional interactions with Barry and his mom really hit home for me because I'm scared to lose my mom and I'm pretty sure if we all had The Flash's powers, we'd do the same in order to save our moms.

So, pretty much everything I thought about this ridiculous movie has already been said here, but let me explain why I rated it a 3 and not the minus 10 it deserved.First of all, seeing my favorite Batman again, Michael Keaton, was a delight. Not sure how Ben Affleck ended up in that part, the worst Batman ever, but Michael Keaton is and will always be my Batman! Then, there was the homage to George Reeves and Christopher Reeve that brought tears to my eyes. I watched the original Batman with George Reeves when I was a kid! He was amazing!What I haven't seen written yet is the weakness of the story, using an amazing actor like Michael Shannon as Zod for about 5 minutes and allowing this mess to revolve around a young man, Ezra Miller, with the acting ability of a flea take center stage! Really? They could not find someone, anyone, better than this awful actor? The TV Flash actor who played Barry Allen, Grant Gustin, was a hundred times better!The CGI, as covered fully by others here, was kindergarten grade, the story implausible, the story was terrible!!! I would have taken away a star for allowing such a terrible actor to play The Flash, but decided to leave it there in honage, 100% to the three actors listed above. One of the worst Marvel, Justice League movies ever made! Not kidding. Do yourself a favor and pass it by. Watch one of the older movies over again instead and be happy you didn't give up those minutes of your life you will never get back!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now let's see who'll benifit from that? Rival studios? Movie that released a while ago? Seems like it""Across the Spiderverse"" is very very good but tickets are very very expensive for an animated movie. Even ""Suzume"" wasn't that expensive.Flash' s ticket is very cheaper than that. One week after ""Across the Spiderverse"", ""Transformer"" was released and this week ""The Flash"".

Honestly not much at all to recommend it, except for the nostalgia of bringing back old characters like Keaton's Batman. All in all, poor. Dreadful effects. Hate his costume and running style. Poor humour. Lame characters (this really is not the Barry Allen from the books), they have not done Flashpoint justice at all. The *real* Flash character is bad enough, but the different reality Barry is even worse. Not sure what Gunn was on when he said this was one of the best ever SH films. There are worse, but not many.

Infact, I travelled 200 Kilometres to see it, cuz there's no theater where I live.But man it was totally worth it!DC did absolute justice to Flash's origin story. Ezra Miller was simply phenomenal and just as good as Grant Gustin was in the Flash TV show. I've seen Flash in all the animated films and the TV show and Ezra Miller's portrayal is on par with Grant Gustin's. He brought such earnestness and relatabilty to Barry Allen that you just can't stop yourself from rooting for him. Barry's story is truly tragic yet inspiring. The way young barry looks at everything in the world with a wonder and a dorky smile is ever so inspiring.I genuinely hope that Ezra Miller can learn from their off-screen mistakes and do better in life, just like Barry learnt from his mistakes .P. S Thankyou DC for the perfect Flash film.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, I was surprised and enjoyed the movie. With its fast-paced plot, action sequences that didn't tire the audience, and well-placed humor, The Flash is one of the most enjoyable superhero films I've watched this year. It's a golden ticket for the DC Universe, which has struggled with its films lately, as it manages to recover and deliver good storytelling without disrupting the flow. The actors' good performances also contributed to the smooth progression of the film. It's worth noting the careful placement of comedic elements, ensuring they didn't overwhelm the audience, and the successful blending of these elements with the relatively dark tone of the story, which is one of the film's strengths. One downside could be that some of the CGI effects used in the movie may fall slightly below today's standards, but they didn't directly affect the film. I recommend watching it in theaters.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

For the 10 minutes she was in, she was so much better handled than the Arrowverse version, what with her being a lot more detached and resentful to Earth and humans. I also just genuinely liked her (her suit was cool too). That's really it. Other than that, this movie was goofy, cringe as hell and just awful. Ezra Miller is atrocious as Barry Allen and we all know where they should be instead of starring in this movie. GRANT GUSTIN DIDN'T EVEN CAMEO, LIKE WTF?! Speaking of, those CGI cameos looked awful, they were almost vomit-inducing and why did they use the oldest versions of the characters that probably no one cares about??? Very bizarre.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes it was... but the one who really made his mark as Batman is Michael Keaton, and it would be even better for Jack Nicholson to appear as the jokerA cool film to watch and well done.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Also, although I liked the visual effects in most of the movie, in some scenes, they were not so good.But these flaws do not mean that I didn't like The Flash.

No wonder the Zod actor says he's like an Action Figure, their actions just too few. Only the giant Kryptonian get the better fight scene.The ending was unexpected, unlike superheroes movies in general. Maybe there will be many disappointed with the ending.Biggest drawback.CG in speed force just like PS2 graphics 😂.It's great, but still under Zack Snyder's justice league.It can compete with No Way Home.

It is an exciting adventure full of adrenaline in time loops and alternate universes with a strong emotional and nostalgic charge to recover what was lost by the protagonist.In fact, it is this emptiness of maternal love that is Flash's main motivation to use his powers to reverse the earthly absence of his mother (a stupendous Maribel Verdú who shines and transmits a warm energy in her brief and substantial time on screen).The tone of the film has a perfect balance between the comedic moments, the inherent tragedy of the loss of a loved one and how it leaves indelible marks, and the fast-paced action scenes fighting General Zod again in an alternate universe created by mistake by Flash in his eagerness to modify events from his childhood.There are great movie winks like when Flash goes through a wall that has the same Raquel Welch poster that Andy Dufresne used in The Shawshank Redemption to camouflage the hole that would lead him to freedom.In the alternate world, Eric Stolz is not fired from Back to the Future and Michael J. Fox is the protagonist of Footloose.Of all the characters that appear in the alternate universe, it's Michael Keaton's Batman who takes the cake. 30 years away, he returns to print that freshness that made him one of the favorite interpreters of The Knight of the Night.He doesn't take down Supergirl. I was not convinced by the choice of actress, however her performance is solvent, showing a brave and supportive Kryptonian.I have read comments on Twitter from detractors of the CGI of the film.They seem unfounded to me as they reflect the perception of Flash at full speed.The final part is emotional by displaying a tribute to Superman in all the possibilities of his existence in parallel worlds.The movie is a firm step forward for the DC Universe.Sets the bar high for future installments.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Instead, they throw characters together in a team setting where there is no emotional connection and THEN have stand alone movies. Doesn't make a lick of sense.This could also be chalked up to genre fatigue. Sure, some Marvel movies open big but then they fizzle out.

Recently saw the director trying to explain it away: 'You're seeing things all distorted from Flash's perspective while traveling at such great speeds' or some bologna like that. Oh really? So what's your explanation for the Atari-level graphics while Flash is standing still? There's no reason whatsoever audiences should reward such cheap laziness in this day and age. Otherwise, I was quite surprised by how invested I got in the story itself and how much I enjoyed it. The terrible CGI, unfortunately, is impossible to ignore or disregard when weighing the film in its entirety. I keep coming back to the point that there is absolutely no excuse for it in this day and age and can only be attributed to utter cheapness or indifference.In my little one-horse town we have a Mexican restaurant that is about 20 years old. Service there has always sucked, and especially in the past 5 years, the quality of the place has just gone into the stinker hole. That is until this year - when word got around that a brand NEW Mexican restaurant was coming to town. Suddenly the owners of the old stinky restaurant seem to care. They've painted the place, bought new tables, remodeled, their menu has improved. All in preparation to compete with this new restaurant coming in.See, they couldn't care less about indifferently shoveling crap at the inhabitants of the town as long as they know the money will keep coming in. It's only when that money flow is at risk do they begin to care. That's how I felt leaving this Flash movie. (See, you weren't sure I had a point.) I couldn't help but think 'They actually believe they can shovel that crap CGI at their audience and we'll just gobble it down and not notice or mind because of all the cameos and whatever else they threw in there.' Well, I think it's high time these studios start suffering some losses for it.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This movie was not a Batman movie as some would believe, it was a Flash film through and through. Ezra Miller surprisingly gave a really good performance as The Flash and if they were not so controversial, I can see them continuing the Flash mantle. The only real bad thing about the movie is the horrible CGI. Some of them look like a PS2 game and that's no joke. The cameos could have been better, but they were only like 7 seconds long each. Overall, it's a really great movie that I'd recommend, but it's not the best CBM of all time.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Nevertheless, it's a pity that we'll never get to see a standalone movie with Batfleck, as I felt that he really grasped the nuances of Bruce Wayne's pain this time.Also, Ezra Miller as the double Barry was great. He convincingly played the young and dumb Barry as well as the older and more settled version.The only thing missing for a 10/10 was a more faithful adaption of Flaspoint, as Eobard Thawne as the antagonist was really missing.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The narrative lacked coherence and failed to offer a compelling storyline. The movie jumped between different timelines and dimensions without providing adequate explanations or clear transitions, leaving audiences confused and struggling to follow the convoluted events unfolding on the screen. The lack of a solid narrative foundation robbed the film of emotional depth, making it difficult to become invested in the characters or their motivations.Furthermore, the script suffered from weak dialogue and predictable clichés. Characters delivered lines that felt flat and uninspired, lacking the wit and charm associated with the comic book counterpart. The dialogue often felt forced and lacked the necessary emotional resonance to captivate viewers. As a result, the interactions between characters felt contrived and failed to establish meaningful connections.Another major disappointment was the mishandling of the film's visual effects. With a character like the Flash, known for his incredible speed and time-bending abilities, one would expect the movie to capitalize on the opportunity to create visually stunning sequences. However, the CGI was subpar, at best, leaving the action scenes feeling lackluster and unimpressive. The filmmakers failed to deliver on the potential to showcase the Flash's powers in an innovative and breathtaking manner, ultimately robbing the film of its much-needed spectacle.Furthermore, the character development in ""The Flash"" was sorely lacking. The protagonist, Barry Allen, portrayed by a talented actor, was given little depth and remained largely one-dimensional throughout the film. The supporting characters, including iconic figures from the Flash universe, also suffered from underdevelopment, lacking compelling arcs or significant contributions to the overall narrative. This lack of investment in character growth limited the audience's ability to connect with and root for the individuals onscreen.Lastly, the pacing of the film was inconsistent and disjointed. Scenes felt rushed, lacking the necessary build-up and emotional weight, while others dragged on without contributing substantially to the overall story. This uneven pacing created a disjointed viewing experience, preventing the film from gaining momentum and engaging the audience effectively.In conclusion, ""The Flash"" proved to be a disappointing addition to the superhero film canon. Despite its potential for an exciting and visually stunning experience, the movie faltered due to its weak plot, lackluster dialogue, underwhelming visual effects, shallow character development, and inconsistent pacing. While there were certainly elements that showed promise, the execution ultimately fell short of delivering a memorable and satisfying superhero film.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Andy Muschietti shows all his directorial paucity, already amply expressed with ""Mother"" or the very boring ""IT"". It's also really strange to see the lanky Ezra Miller (quite ridiculous in interpreting The Flash) on the screen, multiple accused in reality of violence, drug possession and criminal behavior. In short, yet another ugly and very expensive mess in the DC house, which copies left and right from Marvel (this time directly from the very bad, but better than this Flash, ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", to be precise): hopefully the last remnant of the Snyder era for poor DC Comics.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

I am aware of all the problems that accompanied this film, before the shooting itself, as well as those problems that remained and were not solved, that is, we are waiting for their resolution. Anyway, I liked the movie, it entertained me, it has a good story and characters, a good balance of comedy and drama.It was immediately clear to me that the film would be based on the Flashpoint comic story with some changes. I think the movie did it successfully, although I have to admit that the original Flashpoint is a better option for me, but that story will probably never be surpassed.There are a lot of characters in the film, some of which we already know, so I didn't see any problem there because this film is actually a sequel to all the other DCU films before. At times it is humorous, and at times it is serious, and the stakes are quite high.What I personally really liked were the numerous references and easter eggs to numerous other characters, the plot and scenes from the DC world in general, I think there are so many that I probably couldn't catch them all in one viewing. I also see how the film was made just for the fans, and that can be a double-edged sword, because if the film relies solely on fan service, then we have a hollow film, but that's not the case here, at least I didn't experience it that way.I complain about two things about the film. The first is that there is a lot of CGI, which in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, in fact it is even expected in such films, but the problem is that the CGI in some scenes is bad, obvious and looks like it was made with twenty-year-old technology years, at least. The other thing I resent is the direction this is going to take because I really have no idea, and I don't think the people involved are either. Considering the ending of the movie, the various problems that follow the DCU and the casting, it seems to me that this can't go in a good direction, but I hope I'm wrong.The conclusion at the end is that I really liked the movie, I enjoyed it, it wasn't boring or stupid, I had fun and that's the most important thing, I don't have any major complaints about the movie itself.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't believe all the bad press about it. Even if you hate Ezra Miller that doesn't mean you should boycott it because there are other tens of actors in the movie who are worth to be watched. Even if the CGI isn't the best that doesn't mean the story is bad. The story and plot are very good, even Ezra acting was very good. He plays 2 characters with 2 complete different personalities. This is very challenging but he succeeded in that. Some people are annoyed by his fast erratic speech and that's true that the other grown-up Ezra talks about it to his younger self. The final touch in the movie is also very clever too. Which made the ending open to the reset that James Gunn wants to make to the DC world.It really deserves the watch. Ah and I forgot to mention it's very funny too.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Little off the topic, I was watching Ghost Rider (Sir Nicholas) and was complaining about how campy super heroes are almost gone. Then I saw The Flash, after hearing all the complains about CGI, lead actor's crime spree and DCpocalypse etc. To be honest the whole superhero genre has become so saturated every single movie has become throwaway one time watch with the exception of Guardians of the Galaxy 3, which I will watch maybe 2 more times. This movie however, I will come back to time and again whenever I'll do DC marathon because for all it's flaws it has heart. It's obviously not Dark Knight or Endgame, not even close but it has all the flavors that I need from a superhero movie.Now, I've seen all projects from Andy Muschietti and this is a complete different tone from his other projects. His style of comedy is somewhat like James Gunn but not quite as dark. For this movie it wasn't as ridiculously overboard as Thor: Love and Thunder nor as grim as Batman V Superman or as dumb as Josstice League. Humor is big part of this movie. Its basically another character but I liked how serious and heartfelt moments were truly serious and heartfelt. Jokes didn't repeat and the performances were overall great.Special shoutout to Kara Jor-El who I was skeptical about but turned out to be great addition to this movie. Michael Keaton, I am not worthy enough to talk about him. I wish we got more of Batfleck but sigh, people would've complained about runtime. I really really liked the Maribel who played Barry's mother. In short screentime she really made me tear up in the climax. Michael Shannon was wasted.I really did not mind the CGI because where it mattered, it was really really great. It wasn't terrible in the sense it was unfinished. It was just terrible because of an artistic choice and that happens from time to time. It didn't bother me and after few years when people look back at this film, it's not gonna matter to them either because othewise this is all fun and great times.Great job to everyone in the crew.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie and what I liked and didn't like about it.The movie picks up at great pace with an impressive opening scene with introductions of the main characters and the basic premise of how they are.The Action scenes are very well choreographed, edited and thought out which makes all the fight/action scenes without having excessive jumpcuts making it more enjoyable to watch. This is the criteria the movie mainly excels in over the other parts.While I see many other speaking of how this movie relies too much on cameos and the nostalgia of the older audiences, I felt that the cameos just added more to the experience of the movie without weighing it down by any means by tying up the cameos into the narrative without making it feel out of place and added in just for the sake of it.The biggest gripe I have with this movie is its sometimes horrendous CGI. Although it looks decent or good most of the time, in some scenes they look really horrible. Those are in which two Ezra millers are in one shot or certain combat sequences where the facial models look horrible. Sometimes the facial models looked similar to the video game ""L. A. Noire"" and sometimes it looked worse than that too with the facial models of certain people which I can't reveal here.Overall, The movie is really great and well worth your money if you're looking to have a good time with genuinely praisable performances by the cast and not making it overstuffed. 8.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I understand there was a trial and everything with Ezra Miller but post production? I'm pretty sure the people working that was not held back by trial. Seems lazy. Michael Keaton was amazing as usual. I really enjoyed Sasha Calles performance. Would be cool to see a solo Super girl movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Of course, this is a movie about Flash, that was great played by Ezra Miller, and he played just great. This movie was also great, with mostly good sides, but also some bad. First of all, it is a lot of stuff happening, and I wont spoil, but I can tell a little. So this movie tells a story about Flash, he travels back in time, destroy the timeline, and he have to fix it immediately. That is basically the plot, but it is more going one later, that I wont spoil. Liked the movie very much, it was a great plot, character delevopment, and the action sequences were just like it should be in a superhero-movie. I especially liked when they was in the north and fighting with russians. The bad sides was that some of the dialogues did not fit in the movie, some of the dialogues where even stupid, and unnecessary. It is not a big deal, because it was not that bad, but I could change the dialogues here and there. Michael Keaton returns as Batman in The Flash, that I am very happy about. I liked the original 1989 Batman, he is way better than Robert Pattinson, if I have to honest. He played like Batman should be played. Ezra Miller played The Flash good too, but I liked him better in Fantastic Beasts. Supergirl (Aka Kara) played by Sasha Calle was ok, I guess, she did not play too much anyway, so I can not say a lot about her. Ok, I guess. Overall, The Flash is a great superhero-movie. A sequel is not necessary, it ended so well anyway, o gosh, the ending was fantastic! I recommend this movie for every superhero fan, and I can easily say that it was way better than Shazam 2.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This just makes the film feel artificial and eventually, ridiculous.I have to give it to Michael Keaton's batman, even if his lines sometimes didn't really feel okay, he does set a vibe into the film that makes it more enjoyable, and Ezra Miller's original flash, for the most part, gives out a great performance that also helps the movie.I'm personally sad about how this film turned out, I'm a fan of the series and I've been waiting a long time for this movie just to be disappointed by it, when it had so much potential. I wish I could rescue some things from the film but it just doesn't live up to the expectations. I just hope DC doesn't repeat the same thing with their upcoming projects, otherwise the franchise is looking at a dark future.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Cursed film that nevertheless is worth every penny and second!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9143942/?ref_=tt_urv","manuel1avila","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5878819/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2023","I thought I would write a review because I think this is one of the best written and most fun superhero movies yet, which was cursed by the stupidity and ego of one Ezra Miller, who is good but far from perfect in this role.Still, I think the studio, director, cast and crew deserve a break as they clearly invested a lot of love and stamina in this project, that fell under the curse of not only the Ezra insanity, but also the Snider drama, the Cavill mishaps, superhero fatigue, scope creep and PC BS.I want to explain, why I think the reasons why this film is being hated should not prevent you from enjoying it:1. Ezra Miller: The guy is a jerk, possibly a criminal and belongs in oblivion. But when you watch the movie, you will realize that it was impossible to replace him. It would have meant basically starting it from scratch. No studio could afford that. Yes, they could have scrapped the project altogether, but we would have really missed out. This film is a ton of fun and hundreds of people put their love and sweat into making The Flash come true. Give them some respect.2. Poor CGI: This one is less deserving, but I can still give it a break. I think the project just became a budget nightmare as they added that amazing score(s), cameos, giant scenes and PR damage control, so at some point they had to compromise, and the studio's decision was to use crap CGI for a very specific set of scenes. Every time THOSE scenes play, they will look like The Polar Express. It was clearly not rushed, but a decision they made to make the film's budget possible. Outside those scenes, There's just one scene they decided to also make look horrible, and I did not like it at all, I think they went for ""Let's embrace our uncanny CGI nightmare style for fun"". That did not work for me. But other than that, and believe me, it's most of the film, the CGI is quite good. At least as good as the Snyder Cut.3. Problematic Cameos: Yes, there is one problematic cameo, but I don't think it was disrespectful at all. Being a longtime Sups fan, I saw it as a warm homage. I think this is where the PC crap chimes in. Let's enjoy some cheap nostalgia for what it is. It's not like people are running to buy tickets to watch a 10 seconds cameo. Come on!4. Confusing/Repetitive script: This is the mildest of the criticism I've heard. Yes, it's like the 5th Multiverse movie in a row, yes, it reminds you too much of a VERY recent movie and yes, it can be confusing, but for what is worth, I think it handled the time travel/multiverse problem elegantly, and overall, I liked it better than almost any other attempt at multiverse. But that's just my opinion.Outside the criticism, the truth is that it really is a very good movie, with tons of rewatching potential, well made nostalgia bait and a very decent story but most of all, really really funny. Go watch it!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Maybe they had really really expensive catering on set or something? Yeah, maybe they spent 150million on catering and only had 50million left for the movie, because that's what it looks like. People made fun of the Batman vs. Superman movie because you could see how badly they edited out Henry Cavill's moustache, but this movie has 100 times worse CGI throughout the movie than one silly moustache mistake... apart from the atrocious CGI, the movie has several glaring plot holes and bad writing which just makes the entire chain of events completely unbelievable and unrealistic.

The story is good, the script is sharp and it's well made with just a handful of somewhat dodgy CGI moments (mostly in the opening sequence). Ezra Miller, putting all their personal issues and very problematic behaviour aside, is superb as Barry Allen/The Flash but Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman very nearly steals the film completely. He is absolutely, and predictably, sensational and when he quotes a line from the first Batman movie it sent a shiver down my spine. There are some lovely fan service surprises which I won't spoil here but one in particular made me very very happy and one made me think 'you've got to be kidding me!'If you like superhero movies this is the best live action one in years and certainly much more satisfying and enjoyable than all the recent Marvel movies. In fact I think it could be the best DC one so far, it's easily on a par with the first Wonder Woman.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I wasn't even a fan of the Flash... but Ezra Miller brings a unique perspective to the character.

Way better than No Way Home in terms of converging multiverse heroes, and that's coming from a Marvel fan and DC tolerator (I fell asleep during Justice League).

I finally watched it today, now that it's available for streaming and it was so much better than I expected! The movie is very entertaining, the storyline playing at perfect pace and I'm only complaining about the tonal inconsistencies here and there. There's a bit too much humor involved at times which in my opinion keeps the storyline from having the right emotional impact. The jokes are good though and Ezra Miller gives a solid impressive double performance. I loved everything Michael Keaton related and he was the main reason I decided to watch the movie after all the heat it got, but ended up liking it in its entirety.In my opinion, the second best DCEU movie after Wonder Woman storywise, but #1 when it comes to entertainment factor!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

(Some may say that they copy each other but, hey.. the comic characters themselves are almost the same at the first place, so no harm in this.. as long as we get a good picture to look)..
DC movies keep getting better and better and The Flash was a perfect proof of that.The movie is very good, it has drive, no boring gaps, the content is healthy and not messy, cast was great (Ezra was phenomenal.. as always..) and I loved how they inserted and brought back the old characters..

They could have probably spun her off into her own movie and that would have been far more entertaining.Don't waste your time waiting on the after credit scene, it means nothing and adds nothing.Overall I really wished this movie had been good but instead it just felt like a disjointed mess of bad CGI and cameos from anyone willing to take a buck.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie veers between farce and pathos so badly that it makes you seasick. It tries handwavium to ""explain"" the metaverse and space/time (this is even worse than Spider-Man and the metaverse). It has the usual painfully awkward Main Character (implies he is on the spectrum); somehow the movie industry thinks the world is full of over-aged teenagers with serious angst. It shoves music in your face (pitiful attempt to attract some age young age group).

The emotional beats in this movie were all hit and the humor was pretty good aside some cringy jokes. The story is the main bridge for this movie because it really holds it all together nicely. Ezra Miller presented a really good Barry Allen, but I don't want them to return to the role. Michael Keaton's return as Batman gave me literal goosebumps. I felt like a kid watching the old man kick some butt. Sasha Calle is a good supergirl. Now, the CGI in this movie is atrocious. It is bad. Some parts of the CGI is good, but some shots were really embarrassing.

DC's multi-verse starts very strong and hopefully that line will be continued, because the DC films are actually very volatile. A downside of the film are the CGI effects that seem to come straight from 2003, a bit on the same level as from The Mummy Returns how Dwayne Johnson looked like The Scorpion King. You simply can't get away with that in 2023 and how this is possible with a decently expensive film is really the question. The exploration of director Andy Muschietti was that all these scenes are playing inside Barry Allens head and it was done on purpose, because everything has been deformed in the mind of Barry. Well... i really doubt that story, but well. Don't let that spoil the fun in any case, because that really is not fair to burn the movie only on that detail. The Flash is just a big fat recommendation to run to the cinema for. Oh yes, and of course, stay seated when the credits roll, because after the credits you get to see a nice aftercredit.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I like experiments, new, added flavours, unlike many. It brakes the monotonicity, gives new ways to surface, even the same emotions about character, story.And in part it works, the story is compelling, the ending sequence is interesting, it's new way for sure. The older Batman is okay. Interaction with Justice League is short but okay. Action scenes, not counting bad CGI, are okay.About the negative things, why it's just average.First, I don't like Ezra, his acting is sluggish, lightweight, It has chronic ""making fun of everything"" problem. Too shallow, difficult to build depth for character this way. He is too introvert and extrovert at the same time on screen. Very weird indeed. To my suprise, he played the older Barry better after that Barry took things seriously, which is saviour.Other negatives include: bad CGI, childish dialogues, unfunny jokes, awkwardness.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is not at all the masterpiece that some early reviews have said. However, it is a film, unlike many in the genre, with soul (Barry Allen) and heart (the other Barry Allen). It's a journey for both. And guided by a mentor, Michael Keaton's Batman (proving once again that he will forever be a legend in this role), who gives the film an inescapable gravity. Also the humour is very well placed and mostly lands. And the interactions between Barries are just perfect.Here and there, the pacing isn't the best and some characters (like Sasha Calle's Supergirl, which leaves us wanting to see more) and some story points needed to breathe...... Maybe expand the story a bit and split it into 2? The CGI ain't that bad, because u can clearly see it's on purpose...It's an emotional journey, no doubt. It's not a simple movie where a hero wants to defeat a villain. It's a film with a clear purpose of the central character. And Ezra Miller, despite his problems with justice, is a top notch actor and plays two roles with impressive ease... All in all, it's a solid 7.5/10, with an extra 0,5 for all the Batmen (and i mean all) in it, in a film that manages to have pretty good and inventive stuff in a genre that's getting saturated.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Putting aside Ezra Miller's off-screen issues, the actor isn't the worst part of this paint-by-numbers film. It's the fact that Andy Muschietti and his team try to make this into a big budget blockbuster to rival what Marvel churns out on the regular.Sure, it's nice to drag Michael Keaton out of retirement as he dons the bat suit one more time. And yes, there are plenty of cameos that are sort of interesting, but the film itself is a mess. This is the point where it's hard to ignore Miller's impact on the production, as the disruption caused to filming helped turn it into the trainwreck that it is.If this signals that we're almost at the end of the Snyderverse, we should all breathe a sigh of relief.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you are not a longstanding fan of the Flash or Superman, those will go over your head and you will not appreciate some important fan-service for Baby Boomers in this movie.I am a huge fan of ""The Flash"" on CW and worried that the movie-version would not equal the TV show, but Ezra miller in a tour-de-force takes the top-2 billings in this movie and probably has 4.5 hours of screen time in this film, all worthy of the subject material and his performance is excellent.I sure for his sake and for our sake his personal life can calm down so we can continue to see him in future sequels!Barry Allen travels back in time to bring his mother back to life, and things go awry from there. After exploring hundreds of alternative solutions to allow his mom and the Earth to exist in the same timeline, the consequent solution is achieved. I didn't expect to cry in this movie but it was really an extraordinary moment and it was one of 3 times I have cried in my life.The movie ends much like the slow-mo beginning of ""Deadpool"" and the price of admission is earned instantly in this short 60-seconds scene.I loved it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Earnings were so low , so they had to get u excited by bringing u back all that memories, like Michael and ben. (Ok it worked the only good idea i saw last years. My hero batman again on screen).And second and most important to try and make a realistic excuse why the face of superman in next movies will change.We know how big mess created with the worst ever decision of DC studios to take out cavill from superman character. They tried to saved it by telling that they didnt fired him he left on his own.... When 2 months before their anouncement cavil was saying will play again superman. After they made a new excuse , they wanted someone younger. The matter took so big publicity that even ""the guardian"" made it a report.Huge mistake. Like many people worldwide, its the same for me. This movie was a death tomb for next dc movies. U made so big fuss just to change ben aflec and henri cavill. Good luck in future. Studios will need it.And seriously. George Clooney??? Seriously ? For batman ? Anyone told u clooney sells as batman ? Maybe in ocean 15 or 16 , as a batman ???? Get serious people.

I tell you why.First of all, there is no stupid superhero fighting each other caused by a stupid reason.To all Superhero fans, we know that Barry Allen is always about his father and mother, but this time it was well plotted in very simple and not too much dragged into the dramatic emotion, just common and natural human way and hope.The digital characters will bring us back to old days cast and fun to watch, especially if we all remember that before Henry Cavill cast as the next Superman there was rumors of some actor casted and it was so fun to watch how the actor would look like as Superman... hahaha...., that was fun.Some of the scenes may feel too absurd and ridiculous but hey man, this is a superhero fantasy movie,
Overall, this movie is so enjoyable to watch, you would not want to miss this.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's a fan favorite for those who love cameo's and connection's to precious franchise films. The CGI is terrible and distracting. However, there are several scenes that are great and excited in such a fun and memorable way. Overall, Michael Keaton's feature in the film brought me so much joy! After seeing him return as the Caped Crusader, not only did he reaffirm being the best Batman on the big screen, but the best superhero actor of all time! The ending of the film also allows for DC to finally do a reboot and closes this chapter of the DCEU. While this isn't exactly the flashpoint paradox like I would have liked, it's a definite must see on the big screen and would rewatch again.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

When you're suppose to like or relate to the main character in some way, it's difficult because Ezra makes the character so hard to like. He's boring and fails to portray the level of confidence this character should have, even though the flash is a little awkward.People complain about the cgi etc, but if you've watched the TV series, you get past that pretty quick. If only the DC movies didn't stray from the story line so far.For pure entertainment purposes, you'll enjoy the movie, but if you're a comic lover, this'll probably feel unsatisfying.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

First of all don't listen to the critics this probably one of the best dc movies. It was fun to arch great story and great excitement. If the trailer would have shown the action more and then focus on the fun of it. He movie would have reached a broader audience. I am disappointed because his movie won't do well, even though it will make its money back. They won't make a second or a third. Which is to bad. The thing is while the movie could have been reduce in time by properly about 10 to 15 minutes , I loved that the director did worry about showing everything at once and let he audiences decidedly what to watch.To bad ther won't be another one made it was a great showNot sure what people are complaining about. I love this movie and I have not been with the latest superhero movie. It was fun enjoyable movie. The special effects were some of the best i have seen in a long time. The way they blend together. The comedy was funny, the acting as excellent one of the best i have seen in a long time. The problem i think people find is that there was not lots of action, however a very good story and flash, the two batman were great. Would have love to see superman and move of wonderwomen? But over an excellent film. Please note there is so much action that you need to watch this on a big screen. I loved the way the action was presented instead of cuts here and there. They let the camera sit back and you can chose what to watch.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And what is most frustrating with this movie is that it has genuine great moments and quite a lot of sacrifice that the hero has to make by the end of the movie, proving that there WAS some great writing somewhere in the beginning of the production. Sadly there WAS, as it seems that over time it just became another DC disaster with god knows who constantly trying to pivot it in different directions, adding unnecessary jokes and tangents where they shouldn't be, constantly pulling the movie into conflicting directions - is it a drama, is it a comedy, is it sci fi? Make up your mind and stick with it.Seems that almost all of the main DCU or DCEU movies suffered from this awol method of movie making, and it's sad that there wasn't a unifying master mind overseeing the whole arc whilst having free reigns of denying unnecessary exec or whoever whims on the spot.Other, non main arc recent movies such as joker, batman (sic...) are a proof that DC has great arsenal of movies, as long as someone fires everyone who had anything to do with decision making in DCEU for the last 15 years.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film has an intriguing time-travel plot in which Barry using his power goes beyond the speed of light traveling back in time in order to save his beloved mother from being murdered and his father from being wrongly accused of the crime, but by doing so he changes everything and creates a multiverse in a world without superheroes. Barry becomes trapped in this new reality and must find a way to restore what was, he decides to use the younger version of himself in this reality to help him. The two Barrys seek out the reclusive older Bruce Wayne who has long retired his crime fighting alter-ego of the Batman to fight against the odious General Zod, superbly played again by Michael Shannon, who has returned to annihilate humankind from the Earth. The best part of this film is Michael Keaton's brilliant show-stopping return as the Batman and in his old age he has lost nothing and delivers a totally mesmerizing scene-stealing performance that is filled with nostalgia and is the heart of this film, another plus in the scenes with Keaton's Batman is the use of Danny Elfman's iconic score from Tim Burton's classic original Batman. The terrific introduction of Supergirl/Kara Zoe-El, impressively played by Sasha Calle, who aids the Flash and Batman in their epic climactic battle against General Zod is sensation. Solid direction by Muschiett who gives his film spectacular action sequences, superlative CGI visual effects, and plenty of humor and potent emotional scenes. I very much enjoyed this film which was a fun cinematic ride and a fitting ending to the old DC Comics universe.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But overall a cool superhero movie after ages from DC. Please do watch it in thaters and specially in 3d this will give u an amazing experience.

Seriously funny, real and gut wrenching at times, the FLASH will not disappoint. Raised on reading DC comics, I don't have high expectations for ""comic -book -turned -movie"" films, but this one made me believe in Santa Claus and superheroes again.Portraying Barry Allen, in 2 realities, Ezra Miller does a sensational job of being vastly different in 2 roles as the same human being.. which I cannot imagine is an easy feat. Having to film scenes solo and then let the film magicians fuse the acting together to produce a single seamless scene, as a viewer, I applaud the fact that Miller made me forget that there is only ONE of him. Aside from that, Michael Keaton's return as the infamous and best loved Batman of all time -delivers a powerful punch to this film as another introverted secret super hero with a tragic past. I loved going through the emotions alongside Barry Allen/Ezra Miller like a silent empathetic voyeur in the dark.I needed to go to the cinema twice to see this one.Bad publicity and nutty public bursts aside, let Miller's personal misdemeanors and juvenile hall antics, be cast aside separate from his pure and fantastic acting in FLASH. It's a whole other ballgame now for the Marvel Comics movie- verse after you see this one.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Given the current controversy surrounding the main actor, I wasn't expecting anything to game changing. I loved this movie for what it was. It had simple storytelling, a basic premise and that's just it. It gives the Flash character he's sort of origin story and also humanises him a bit better. In previous movies for both Josstice League and Zack Snyder's Justice league, Flash was mainly there for comic relief but in this one, there is a face behind the mask. I connected with this movie in that I too lost my mother young and I would want to go back in time to try and save her. Michael Keaton was fantastic in all his scenes. He's classic interpretation of the character was still there. SuperGirl has a lot of promise! I do hope they can make more use of her character. Go watch this movie!

Later on in her storyline, other characters took on a similar role, and they looked different, but Diana Prince was always Princess Diana. In the last decade, or so, comics have begun to dramatically change costumes. They've also begun to recast original characters. The movies are taking this one step further.

Watch agape as dead actors are brought back to hideous parody of life in a freakish attempt to pull on not just the nostalgia of the living but the nostalgia of the dead.

A classic story with all the elements needed. Indeeed we might have seen the same story with the tv series of flash but this movie still makes you interested. A very unique element to the world of time travel we have seen. Loads of overloaded cameo for dc fans. Best one being the oldest Batman. Ben affleck didint really have a job here. The vfx is getting hate for no reason they might look over coloured but they are visually stunning. Saw this in a avx theatre so had some extra benifit. One of the other good things was Eza miller's acting he portrayed flash in a very organized way. The film had a bit of a underwehlming start tho but then has good stuff. A new way of the multiverse too. Dc is definitely getting their game up. Overall must watch for dc geeks and general super hero genre movie lovers.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's like they went out of their way to choose an actor who embodies the polar opposite of charisma. Meanwhile, the Netflix series had us all hooked with an actor who effortlessly breathed life into the character. It's mind-boggling that they didn't consider sticking with a good thing. This film could easily win the award for ""Most Painful Superhero Movie to Watch."" If only they had taken a cue from the show and spared us from this cringeworthy disaster.In summation, ""The Flash"" movie occupies an ignominious pedestal as an exemplar of how misplaced casting decisions and a divergent artistic vision can culminate in a cinematic escapade that borders on the farcical. It is a testament to the potential consequences of not heeding the resounding success of a prior television iteration and, regrettably, etches itself into the annals of superhero cinematic endeavors as an indelible misstep of monumental proportions.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's been hyped up by critics saying things like, ""The Flash is hands down one of the best superhero films of all time,"" The trailers also made it appear to be a big movie full of fun surprises as it ultimately resets the DC Universe in epic fashion. However, as I watched, it never actually felt like a big movie, the surprises aren't extremely fun, and the reset is in no way satisfying. It puts the final nail in the coffin of the DCEU while also damaging the hope for brighter days for the DCU.In a recent interview, General Zod actor Michael Shannon said, ""These multiverse movies are like somebody playing with action figures."" That's exactly what The Flash feels like. Most of the characters and cameos are pointless. It was a whole lot of, ""Oh look, it's such-and-such,"" and then they were gone. The movie relies way too heavily on nostalgia, which actually made the main storyline of The Flash feel smaller and less important. Multiverse storylines can be so fun when they're done right, but this is more of an example of how not to do it. The way they used actors and characters felt cheap, unnecessary. And unimaginative.How you feel about Ezra Miller will really impact how you feel about the movie as he plays both of the main characters. That's a whole lot of Miller. Considering all the praise, I went in expecting to be won over, but I wasn't. I was more annoyed and unimpressed with the two characters. The Flash was a bright spot of Justice League, but even two of them were unable to carry their own movie. He was quirky and actually quite funny in Justice League, but the humor mostly falls flat and gets too samey here. You've got super immature Flash, and slightly less immature Flash. It was overkill. The theater was so quiet throughout a movie that tried too hard to be humorous. The dead silence after that completely stupid and pointless post credit scene was actually a little awkward.Despite how it might sound, I didn't hate the whole movie. I was entertained to a degree, but I couldn't shake my feelings of disappointment at how things were going. The movie needed more Batman and Supergirl and a lot less Flash. Michael Keaton is a true star and makes you want more. His Batman performance may actually be my favorite live-action Batman performance. He was a lot less stiff than Affleck's and Bale's Batmans and was closer to what I've seen and loved from animated Batman movies.Furthermore, Sasha Calle's Supergirl is a super interesting character. If you thought Cavill's Superman was brooding, Calle's Supergirl makes him seem giddy in comparison. But it works! Superman and Supergirl are such impressive characters to watch in action. I wanted more displays of Kryptonian awesomeness. As great as they are, Batman and Supergirl couldn't save this movie because their roles are ultimately too small.Do yourself a favor and go watch Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox. It's an animated version of this story that is SO much better. In fact, I've given it a 10/10 rating while the best I can do for this live-action Flash film is 5/10.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Michael Keaton does shine in his scenes as Batman to my delight. Supporting cast is good as well. Lots of cameos here, and they didn't feel forced at all. Some brought smile to my face. Only slight disappointment is there wasn't more of Michael Shannon (General Zod), he is usually a very good addition to a movie.CGI was OK, didn't notice what people are complaining to, and it certainly wasn't distracting from the story.The movie was fun, had it's serious and it's humourous moments (mostly hits) and they were overall well balanced.Last act does feel a little bit below first 2/3 of a movie therefore I'm giving it 8/10 and not more.People should see this in a movie theatre, it is one of the better movies of the year, don't listen to critics.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Miller tries for laughs and doesn't get any but is also unconvincing in the dramatic scenes, too. Miller fails over and over. The saddest part is that the story has Miller sharing most scenes with Miller which is too more than the movie needs. I have no words for the special effects, which are some of the worst I've seen in years. It's good to see Keaton again as Batman, but aside from a couple of scenes, he could be anybody driving the Batmobile or flying the Bat plane. After all the hype, after hearing over and over that it's the best superhero film ever made, I can say with certainty that it doesn't even come close.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

It was a lot funnier than I imagined it would be, and that's not a bad thing. It didn't blow me away and it was generally kind of safe, in my opinion, and again, that's not a bad thing.Now, let's address the CGI. It wasn't perfect, of course, but It was great for 90% of the scenes. I think the scenes where Barry is running is what's irritating most people. But, I don't think it was bad, they just portrayed it in an... interesting way. The other scenes where it was ""off"" was when Barry is reversing time and seeing scenes play out around him. That was not top notch CGI< ill agree with people there, but to be fair that is some pretty intense stuff to perfect and it only took me out of the movie for like 10 seconds so it's fine. Aside from one particular scene at the beginning of the movie, and the stuff I described above, it was actually fantastic CGI. Oh, and I thought the CGI suit was going to bother me but it didn't, surprisingly.Again, it wasn't perfect but I really enjoyed myself and that's what matters here. But don't take it from me, go see it for yourself and make your own judgements. Don't listen to what other say. I'm sure you're well aware that there's a lot of pop culture fans who's favorite past time is hating and spreading negativity.

Because it's impossible for this film to have a budget of $220 million and have CGI of early 2000's movies. After watching this Ant Man 3 CGI isn't even that bad, this CGI is on the same level as The Mummy Returns (2001), Catwoman (2004), The Matrix Reloaded (2003), Green Lantern (2011), etc.It does have some funny moments but the story, screenplay, the CGI, and the action scenes are mediocre, and the performances are average with a few decent acted scenes with Ezra.

I do hope he gets help for his mental illness because he needs to continue on with this character. The movie was exciting, funny (WW has a very funny encounter with Ben Affleck' Batman), and touching to the point I may have cried a little. There are several surprising DC cameos that I'm sure you've already hear about. The pacing was good and Michael Keaton reminded us of just how good he was in the Batman role. My only complaint is that some of the CGI looked a little too animated and I'm wondering if that was on purpose because it was highly noticeable. I hope James Gunn does the right thing and uses some of the actors from the current DC universe in future films. I think superhero movies are starting to wear thing on people, but this one is far better than the last several I've seen. I'm talking about you Ant-man.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

From start to finish, this superhero extravaganza had us on the edge of our seats, captivated by its electrifying storyline, stunning visuals, and exceptional performances. As a die-hard fan of the DC universe, I couldn't have asked for a more thrilling and satisfying experience.One of the standout elements of the film was undoubtedly the titular hero himself, The Flash. Played by Ezra Miller, his portrayal of Barry Allen was nothing short of phenomenal. He flawlessly captured the essence of the character, blending humor, vulnerability, and determination in a way that truly resonated with the audience. Every scene with The Flash was a breathtaking display of his super-speed abilities, leaving us in awe of his powers and the visual spectacle they brought to the screen.But the greatness of ""The Flash"" doesn't end there. The movie also treated us to a delightful appearance by Batman, portrayed by Michael Keaton. This seasoned Dark Knight brought a palpable intensity and gravitas to the story, showcasing his unparalleled detective skills and fearless nature. The interactions between Batman and The Flash were a sheer joy to watch, providing a dynamic duo that fans have longed to see on the big screen.Additionally, the inclusion of Supergirl, played by Sasha Calle, added another layer of excitement to the film. Her extraordinary strength and unwavering determination made her an invaluable ally to The Flash, and the chemistry between the characters was evident throughout. It was refreshing to witness the seamless integration of multiple iconic superheroes, each with their own unique abilities, working together towards a common goal.The director, Andy Muschietti, deserves immense praise for bringing this superhero tale to life with such finesse and attention to detail. The stunning visual effects were a feast for the eyes, making every action sequence a thrilling spectacle. The intense fight scenes and high-speed chases were choreographed flawlessly, leaving us at the edge of our seats and gasping for breath.Moreover, the screenplay was a masterful blend of humor, heart, and action. The narrative unfolded at a perfect pace, allowing us to connect with the characters on a deeper level while keeping the adrenaline pumping. The scriptwriters should be commended for delivering a story that not only entertained but also left a lasting emotional impact.In conclusion, ""The Flash"" is an outstanding superhero film that exceeded all our expectations. With its gripping storyline, exceptional performances by Ezra Miller as The Flash, Michael Keaton as Batman, and Sasha Calle as Supergirl, and awe-inspiring visuals, it deserves nothing less than a perfect rating. This movie is a must-watch for both die-hard fans and casual viewers alike, as it embodies the essence of what makes superheroes truly great. So gather your friends, prepare to be amazed, and let ""The Flash"" whisk you away on an exhilarating adventure you won't soon forget.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

In general, isn't really my thing being comparative to the others superhero movies, but i'll have to. Nothing in this universe works anymore in my perspective. The public isn't buying the narrative that movie makers and big warner's emploois are selling. We can say this without having any guilte, u just can login in all social mídias right now and certainly you'll see the public very angry saying they were played for fool when gave another (and problably the last) chance to DC. That are scenes so weirds that it looks like a team made of people that just began work for cgi's companys only a few days before they've decided what they really want work to when grow old. I didn't saw nothing to be excited for the new DC universe. The future of DC was put in the hands of Ezra Miller like the crimes him had been accused to didn't happened actually. All the critic reviews released until now questioning the weird behavior of EM as the major point to gave a low score were rights. Otherwise, who gave a large low score couting only the other aspects of the movie like CGI, script and the acting were right too. Everybody's that'll see this one in movie teathers are about to drop DC for sure. There's nothing to say to save any aspect. Time, the vilain in the film is the hero of real life. It seems the only way people can get over old superheros DC and beggining to like the new ones. Or dont'.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

From different variants of Batman/ Bruce Wayne, preventing Flash's Mom death and Dad being accused of killing his wife, and his power to time travel. Barry Allen is a crime science forensics researcher who is trying to find evidence to prove his Dad's innocence. The movie becomes more goofy when Barry relies on food more of the time than saving people. It also focuses more on Barry's 18 year old self has an obsession of being a kid at heart than focusing on what is important when you yourself experience a canon event and become more mature.Michael Keaton as Batman has its greatest moments, but not giving them a serious role and more screen time kind of disappoints. I did like how the movie explains about changing the timeline and seeing the destruction of the multiverse. I was disappointed with General Zod's screen time and how short it was. The real disappointment is the ending. I almost threw my rubbish at the screen.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

On the other hand, the script is bad, and the film is boring at times, and we can't call that boredom ""character development"" because there is no development at all.What should be some resolution of the plot and the climax of the film is predictable from the beginning, so the film itself has no exciting moments or surprises.

Ben Affleck was great in the role of Batman, but even he cannot save this film.The director tried his best, the direction is not bad, but when the script is this bad, the movie just can't be better than this.

From beginning to end, this film showcases the remarkable potential of the Scarlet Speedster and leaves audiences enthralled with its pulse-pounding action, compelling storytelling, and stunning visuals.One of the most remarkable aspects of The Flash Movie is how seamlessly it combines elements of science fiction, time travel, and comic book lore into a coherent and enthralling narrative. The screenplay deftly balances the protagonist's emotional journey with his superhuman abilities, creating a multi-layered and relatable hero. Through astute writing and poignant performances, the film delves into Barry Allen's inner conflicts, his yearning for his mother, and the consequences of meddling with time. It's an emotionally resonant tale that adds depth and substance to the superhero genre.Ezra Miller's portrayal of Barry Allen, also known as The Flash, is nothing short of exceptional. Miller effortlessly captures the character's intelligence, quirkiness, and determination, bringing a fresh and captivating interpretation of the iconic speedster. His chemistry with the supporting cast is palpable, particularly with Kiersey Clemons as Iris West, who dazzles in her role, exuding charm and charisma on the screen. Together, they create a dynamic duo that keeps the audience invested in their journey.The action sequences in The Flash Movie are nothing short of breathtaking. Director Andy Muschietti masterfully crafts exhilarating set pieces that exploit the Flash's incredible speed and ability to manipulate time. Each sequence is meticulously choreographed, seamlessly blending CGI with practical effects, resulting in awe-inspiring visuals that leave you on the edge of your seat. The film's stunning cinematography and vibrant colour palette further enhance the overall visual splendour, creating a feast for the eyes.In addition to the heart-racing action, The Flash Movie also pays homage to the rich history of the character, incorporating nods to iconic storylines and featuring appearances by beloved characters from the DC Universe. These elements not only delight die-hard fans but also serve to expand the cinematic universe, leaving viewers eagerly anticipating future instalments.Furthermore, the film's musical score, composed by Benjamin Wallfisch, deserves special recognition. The soundtrack perfectly complements the film's tone, capturing both the excitement and emotional depth of the story. It adds an extra layer of intensity and resonance to pivotal moments, ensuring that the audience is fully immersed in the world of The Flash.The Flash Movie (2023) is an absolute triumph in every sense. It embodies the essence of the character while pushing the boundaries of what a superhero film can achieve. With its compelling storytelling, phenomenal performances, breathtaking action, and stunning visuals, this movie stands as a testament to the genre's ability to captivate and inspire.

"5","/10","An Average Let Down of A Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9144243/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2023","With the DCEU coming up to its end we have finally got The Flash hit the big screen. This film has been one of the most complicated and controversial comic book films ever released but it has now released and I have seen it so here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Barry Allen go back in time and change the past which ends up changing major factors of the multiverse as a whole.Main Character
Ezra Miller has had plenty going on over the last few years but I have decided to ignore these things when reviewing this film. I thought Miller did a pretty good job as Allen, they are funny and quirky and feel like an appropriate character. The character goes through a real journey in the film and I thought this was one of the best parts of the film. However, Miller also plays a younger version of the character and I really did not like this performance, they were so annoying. I understand why the character is like this way but the majority of the film they are like this and it just misses the boat for me.Supporting Characters
One of the main things people were excited about was seeing the return of Michael Keaton as Batman and he is a real highlight here. Yes, he is pretty cheesy but it just works with his charm and charisma, as a big fan of him in this role it was great to see him return and have some real time to shine as a character he is iconic for.Sasha Calle plays Supergirl for the first time here and I really liked her performance in the role. She isn't a huge part of the film but when she is on screen she is very opposing and fits the role very well. Her character is explored enough for an introduction but I do wish we could have had slightly more here from the writers.Michael Shannon as General Zod was one of my favourite villains in the DCEU, but he is used so badly here. Even Shannon came out and said he didn't enjoy making the film, he feels pointless here and that anybody could have played his role when there was definitely more they could have done with him.Ron Livingston & Maribel Verdu do okay jobs as Henry & Nora Allen but I never felt like they stood out considering how they were an emotional core of the film. They weren't bad but I never fully supported Barry's mission because I never connected with them like I did the TV version of the characters.Kiersey Clemons reprises her role from Zack Snyder's Justice League as Iris West, but she is another dull part of the film. Luckily, the film doesn't spend too much time with the character but even when on screen I never saw any charisma between her and Miller.Story
The film has two parts to its story. When looking at the character of Barry Allen, I think the film shows how his inner conflict affects him, he is somebody who feels below other heroes but wants to do something that makes himself truly happy and selfish. The film presents this well throughout and thank goodness for that. This is because the rest of the films story is pretty bad, the majority of side characters are underused and not given time for us to grow and connect with them. But the major problem I have is that as somebody who has watched the majority of The Flash TV show, I have seen many things that happen in this film in that show and done better. The ending is also pretty terrible and I just think the really missed the mark with all the interesting things they actually could have done.Script
The film definitely had me chuckling at times. There were some actually pretty funny moments and that was nice to see here. There was also some good drama, there were a couple of really effective scenes that made us care about The Flash. But it misses quite a bit too, the film makes no sense a lot of the time, it also just drags out with dialogue that doesn't really do anything.Style
The film has some decent action sequences mainly involving Batman. It is cool to see this same Batman able to be given the time to really show how he can really work as an action star. But this is one of the worst looking films that you will see, the CGI is terrible and has truly some of the worst ever made. Also the pacing is bad, the first 30 mins are all over the place and feel like they are pointless to the film which is a major let down.Overall
Overall, The Flash just about is an average film. It really falls below the standards that were set and promised by the people in charge. It isn't terrible but I really don't think it is worth a watch unless you really like Michael Keaton as Batman and liked the TV show.Rating - 5/10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was in awe how good the speed force scenes looked. Very creative. Folks complained about the CGI. I went into the movie after reading the comments from the director, they wanted to show the world from Barry's pov so it's looked weird. I didn't find it off or weird at all. Thought it looked great.

The silver lining of positive buzz that had initially surrounded the film swiftly faded, revealing a lackluster adaptation that left a bitter taste.Ezra Miller, whose portrayal of the titular character once brought a breath of fresh air to the DCEU, stumbles in his latest performance. His attempts at humor fall flat and seem forced rather than coming across as naturally charismatic or even ironically amusing. It's a confounding disappointment, given that Miller's original Flash persona was somewhat of a saving grace in the past DCEU entries. This new iteration, unfortunately, doesn't hit the mark.Ben Affleck's fleeting appearances as Batman feel utterly half-hearted, underscoring the sense that he's ready to hang up the Batmobile keys for good. This disinterest is palpable and seeps into the limited scenes he graces, adding a layer of apathy that the film simply couldn't afford.The brief sparks of joy in the movie come from Michael Keaton's return as Batman, a moment that initially seemed promising. However, even this nostalgic novelty quickly wore off as the narrative became progressively more muddled.Kara's presence, while adequate, lacks the emotional weight necessary to form any meaningful connection with the audience. In fact, the film's entire storyline seems detached, resembling a side story that lost sight of the main plot thread somewhere along the way. The true story, wherever it might be, certainly didn't get its deserved time under the spotlight.An incoherent narrative, uninspired performances, and an overreliance on CGI ultimately culminate in a cinematic mess. It's a disappointing finale to the inconsistent DCEU, which has struggled to replicate the success of its comic counterparts on the big screen.As we look towards the future, we can only hope that James Gunn might be the guiding light to bring DC back into prominence. The current state of superhero cinema is indeed bleak, with both Marvel and DC producing one underwhelming movie after another.All in all, The Flash is a missed opportunity, a disappointing culmination of a franchise that, despite its potential, continues to struggle in the race for comic book movie supremacy. Superhero fans will have to keep waiting for the day when both story and characters are given the treatment they truly deserve.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Barry lets sandwich be sandwich and hurries to the hospital, where he saves all, while the building gets destroyed. After that he rushes back to the diner, to get his sandwich, and go to work. His biggest worries are an upcoming trial against his father Henry (Ron Livingston), who is being accused of the murder of his wife, Barry's mother, Nora (Maribel Verdu). An old school pal Iris West (Kiersey Clemons) is now a journalist and she questions Barry, if he has anything to say regarding his father's case, though both seem to like each other quite a lot, Barry won't talk with her because he is feeling misused.Thinking of his incredible speed, he wonders if he can, so to say, run back in time, and hopefully find out who is the real killer of his mother, and perhaps even save her life. He gived it a try, and at first it seems that he is lucky. He is now at his parent's house, and Nora is still alive.But suddenly he finds out that there's something wrong, because he can see himself coming home from school, only as a younger version. He succeeds in stopping the younger Barry. They talk and slowly it dawns on him, that he has arrived in a wrong timeline. Meanwhile Superman's old Nemesis General Zod (Michael Shannon) has landed, he will destroy the world, if they won't bring him the last living Krypton person on Earth. Barry can see he needs help and says he will be trying to contact Superman. But as it turns out, nobody in this timeline knows Superman. Therefore he will try to look up his friend Batman. Together, the two Barry's find Wayne's Manor.To Barry's big surprise, the Bruce Wayne they meet is not the man he knows, this Batman (Michael Keaton) has been retired for 25 years. He chooses to help them, and they find out that the last person from Krypton, is being held captive in Russia. Off they go in the Bat-plane. It shows that they're arriving in a facility with lots of scientists, and learn that the wanted person is being held in solitude, and has been for years.Of course they find the prison, and they discover that it contains a person from Krypton, but it's not Superman, it's Supergirl aka Kara Zor-el (Sasha Calle). Now the three superheroes sets off to fight General Zod, a very exciting and dangerous fight.This is the superhero movie that in my opinion makes the best use of the Multiverse. It also stands out in the way that is one of those superhero films that uses quite a lot of humour, perhaps only outdone by Batman: The Movie (1966), and the two DeadPool movies (2016 & 2018). There's really good acting all around, and it's quite fantastic how Ezra Miller is playing both Barrys. There is a couple of cameos to look out for, George Clooney, Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa. The film has been long underways, but director Andy Muschietti has done a real good job. It also must be said that it's wonderful to see Michael Keaton back as Batman. Hopefully there will be a sequel. A little fun thing: While Barry is waiting for his sandwich at the diner, the radio starts playing the fantastic Chicago song ""If You Leave Me Now"". Then Alfred calls. When Barry returns from saving all the people at the hospital, the Chicago song is still playing on the radio.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

He is fantastic as an actor in his dual roles. The story is one of the stronger ones made accessible to everyone including families thanks to its smart comedic lines. The movie really livens up with entering of Michael Keaton and his action scenes are some of the best Batman action we have seen in a long long time. The story takes on strong emotional tone despite the action and the comedy. Plus the action is never too overwhelming without clouding the story. The biggest concern is the CGI which is just bad at moments given the potential that was available here to make the movie a visual feast. If you can overcome the bad CGI then this is one of the better DC outings in recent past which is a great fun, entertaining watch with family or friends. The throwbacks, cameos are real fun and real surprising so avoid spoilers if you can!!!!

""It was done intentionally..."", confesses the Argentine Andy Muschietti to the avalanche of bad reviews that the press has reproached him for, whose 'rubber CGI' effects seem to be 'half done'... If the public gives more importance to the details techniques, clearly made on purpose -as the director of the film himself indicates- than the script and the story (written by six hands by John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein and Joby Harold, and whose perfection is more than obvious) is that, really, we have lost all kinds of critical reasoning. The 'bad guys' of real life -those who don't want us to think- have won... And this, said in a prosaic way, doesn't sound as tragic as it really is.It is very difficult to have to do a more or less in-depth review of this film without being tempted to use annoying spoilers for whoever reads this entry. However, I prefer to avoid doing so in order not to spoil the newest surprises (also called easter-eggs) to the potential viewer of the film, rather than having them... Flash is to the DC Universe what No Way Home (2021, dir. Jon Watts) was to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), only here things flow in a much more organic and quasi-reverential way to the industry of the ninth art (that of the cartoons, naturally).As if it were a macabre joke, Flash's stand-alone arrives a little delay... The film began to be shown in the glorious eighties (when Superman was already beginning to fly plausibly on the big screen and Batman of Michael Keaton stuck out his long-eared cowl from the hand of the legendary filmmaker Tim Burton...). As I said, the great Flash movie was going to be released around that time, although the eventualities of the Hollywood entertainment industry, which has been chaotically reinventing itself, have brought it to a time where it seems that superhero movies are at hand. About to give the swan song...Really, if they are going to do it (give the swan song), The Flash is the ideal film because, in addition to being (as we have said) a proper tribute to the DCEU movies, it is epic, fast, adult and fun to equal parts (even, dare I say, metaphysics - if someone has been able to grasp correctly that the spaghetti metaphor is not only culinary but divine-satirical alluding in some way to the Flying Spaghetti Monster that... really floats through our Universe... ?-The main performances of the feature film are not only at the level of the dramatic corpus of the story (in many moments of Greek tragedy) but also support it in such a way as to silence mouths... The double acting work of Miller -whose recent controversies launched more by way of undercover marketing than to feed the sensationalist press-is at the same level as his partner from the eighties, who here builds his twilight version of the Batman that, without a doubt, will remain to be remembered (with lapidary phrase included...)Also highlight the power and beauty of Sasha Calle giving life to a Supergirl of arms to take, with spectacular curves and 'fashionable' hair, whose ""expanded cameo"" leaves Wonder Woman in a ridiculous place (Gal Gadot, again) a little touched already by the undaunted passage of time. And it is that time passes for everyone, badly despite us.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is the world's only influential dceu movie led by James Gunn. This movie not only organizes dceu and shows dcu, but also allows us to wrap up and continue the big theme of dc. It also allows Aquaman and Flesh to come out the same way in Dcu. I succeed in putting the already made dc movie into dcu. Surprisingly, it is a part made up of only re-filming. It includes an understanding and interpretation of all Dc's works. The homage of ""Back to the Future"" and ""Star Wars"" was also great, and it was a work that abandoned all the shortcomings of a boring factory movie. Michael Keaton, Nicholas Cage, Christopher Reeve, Old Flesh, Old Batman, cameos and cgs from gelgadat are also fun. I think it would have been nice if it came out proudly as a Dceu work. It's James Gunn's biggest misjudgment to have this movie out already. I know the idea to finish quickly and start dcu, but if you polish this movie more and release Aquaman in advance, you can connect dcu with dcu and dcu with a new style multi-bus explanation, and a follow-up to dcu (James Gun) Batman and dcu can be fun, making up for the only worst cg. That's too bad.

Barry Allen uses his super speed to change the past but his attempt to save his family creates a world with unintended consequences that ripple into other worlds of the metaverse.The film was directed by Andy Muschietti. Writing credits go to Christina Hodson and Joby Harold.Yep, it's another Metaverse movie. It appears that's what DC Comics is doing all of the time now. It's the 13th movie in the DC Universe with a soft reboot of the DC franchise, led by James Gunn. Any other films outside this new timeline are going to be called DC Elseworlds. Are you still thinking all of this Metaverse hype is fun or are you growing tired of it? Just curious. Comment down below!THINGS I LIKED:
I attended a press screening with an audience that was ready for a good time. Within 1 minute, the audience was laughing. Nice! There was also destruction and tons of action within minutes.Ezra Miller did a fantastic job playing two characters: The Flash and Barry Allen. He gives us two-in-one characters to root for and shows us two levels of maturity with entertaining nuances.I LOVED Michael Keaton as one of the Batmen in previous movies, so I loved that they brought him back for this! I thought it was really clever how they addressed how there could be so many different Batmen in our world by utilizing the Metaverse. Conveniently, this movie ignores the story in the 1995 Batman Forever, as well as the 1997 Batman and Robin to have the 1992 Batman Returns movie make more sense to fit Michael Keaton's storyline. Michael Keaton is now, officially, the oldest actor to play a live-action Batman. He's currently 71 years old. Adam West was actually 88 when he voiced the 2017 animation of Batman vs. Two-Face!Ben Affleck hasn't been my favorite Batman, but he did a good job in this. I loved the ending of the movie that left us all hanging as to who will be the next Batman in THIS universe! Ha ha Ben Affleck had some issues with the Justice League movie but revealed in a recent interview that he really enjoyed his role in this movie, as short as it was.The audience I watched the movie with absolutely loved the montage of Superman actors, especially Nicolas Cage who was ALMOST a superhero in a Superman movie many years ago in real life.Michael Shannon always does such a great job as a villain. His clear mask on his space uniform was pretty cool.Super amusing sound effects.While this movie isn't exactly an origin story for The Flash, we get to learn a lot more about him, his past, and his motivations.Sasha Calle is the first Latina to play Supergirl. Congrats, Sasha!Others in the cast include Kiersey Clemons, Ron Livingston, Ian Loh, and Saoirse-Monica Jack. Everyone did a great job.The movie was shot entirely with IMAX cameras by Henry Braham. The only other DC movie to do that was the 2021 movie The Suicide Squad.Great special effects.I always love the Flash's slow-motion sequences, so I was surprised when the guy I sat next to leaned over and said he thought they lasted too long. I still loved them.I loved the very last scene. What a great cliffhanger.The big bad spaceship looked just like a beetle. Some of the designs for weapons were cool too.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Gotham City is always falling apart. Ha ha
If you get vertigo as I do, be warned that there will be a few scenes that make you a little bit dizzy. There mostly at the beginning of the movie. I was worried it was going to be like that the entire time, but it wasn't. Drats...I'm getting old!I wanted to hear the audience's reactions throughout the film, but the movie was really loud and drowned out most of the noise from the audience.Surprisingly, there are some fake CGI moments. Some of the action sequences looked like they came straight out of a video game.Some viewers might complain about the unnecessarily long length of the movie.Everyone bleeds from the mouth with fake makeup. Ha haTIPS FOR PARENTS:
A few conversations about intimate relations.A surprisingly high number of crude words. Come on, Hollywood!Some profanity in English and Spanish, including 1 F-bomb
Talk of the death of a parent
We see people get hurt, sometimes with blood
We see a naked guy but no private parts show
We see a guy in his underwear
Someone throws up...a lot. Gross.Lots of violence
Lots of various weapons
Lots of explosions and destruction
High dead-body count.!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is a LOT of fan service, but given the nature of the story, that should be expected, and the fan service is fun and serves its purpose... FOR THE MOST PART (sigh). The very last scene almost ruins the movie, and (at least for me) calls into question James Gunn's sanity and overall ability to guide the upcoming ""Gunniverse"" (sorrynotsorry, that's what I'm calling it) because he made an 11th hour change that equates to trolling the fans, not unlike how WandaVision trolled the fans with the real identity of Pietro in Wanda's creation.So, while the final scene leaves a REALLY bitter taste in my mouth, all the fun of the rest of the movie proceeding shouldn't be penalized as a result.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I know the VFX and CGI is atrocious but to be brutally honest, that's the only real problem with the movie. Everything else for me works so well. The character dynamics with both Batmen and the flash is great because both heroes lost their parents and their loss made them the men they are today. That's why Michael keaton's batman was a no brained to work with the flash because any batman can resonate with Barry Allen's tragic backstory. I thought this movie ticked all the good movie boxes. I genuinely almost cried at the end of the movie and all the scenes with Barry and his mom. The post credit scene was very bad though.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie is simultaneously thoughtful and clueless, challenging and pandering. The film features some of the best digital FX work, but also some of the worst. The movie puts a lot of thought into what it wants to say and not enough into how it says it. The film warns against a thing while at the same time doing a version of that same thing. The movie is well-paced and plotted, with lots of excitement and plenty of humor. It has several stirring, heartfelt moments. The Flash (Ezra Miller) is the juvenile, socially maladroit dogsbody of the Justice League, and foregrounding him proves to be exactly the injection of irreverence that the series needed. The special effects may not be as polished as expected from a big-budget film, but it's a perfectly serviceable and frequently amusing addition to the ever-increasing list of superhero pictures that unfold in multiverses or parallel realities, albeit one that covers similar territory to the recent, superior Spiderverse outing.In conclusion, ""The Flash"" movie has some good moments, well-paced and plotted, with lots of excitement and plenty of humor.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Without saying to much about the film the story line flows from one scene to another without many misteps unlike a lot of films in the past year.

Strangling incident
On April 6, 2020, a video surfaced in a since-deleted tweet that appeared to show Miller strangling a woman and throwing her to the ground. The video was confirmed by Variety to have taken place at Prikið Kaffihús, a bar in Reykjavík, Iceland, that Miller frequents when in the city. A bar employee identified the person in the video as Miller, who was escorted off the premises by staff after the incident.In September 2022, a representative for Miller claimed that the supposed strangulation was a ""spontaneous reaction"" spurred by ""a group of teenagers"" taunting Miller over their mixed martial arts skills, and that they did not strangle the woman but ""went at her collarbone"".Hawaii incidents
By early March 2022, Miller had arrived on the island of Hawaii. From March 7 through March 28, Miller was the subject of ten calls to the police because of various minor incidents, such as filming people at a gas station, loitering on a restaurant's sidewalk, and arguing with people. Eventually, Miller was invited to live with a couple at a hostel in Hilo after Miller allegedly became acquainted with them at a farmer's market.On March 28, Miller was arrested in Hilo following what police said was a physical altercation with patrons after having hurled obscenities at customers at a karaoke bar and was charged with disorderly conduct and harassment. Miller later claimed that they became enraged after being ""accosted by a Nazi"", but Hawaii Police Assistant Chief Kenneth Quiocho stated that Miller's outrage was caused by patrons of the bar singing Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's song ""Shallow."" Miller claimed to have filmed the incident so the footage could later be used as ""NFT crypto art."" During their arrest, Miller said that they were being ""unlawfully persecuted"" and, after members of the police misgendered them, accused the officers of intentionally committing a hate crime.And is the sole person making this claim. Vanity Fair interviewed people in Miller's circle and wrote that ""'He professes that he walks through this world with an Indigenous humility and spiritual awareness,' says one Indigenous insider. 'But, point of fact, he doesn't at all. Because he doesn't care.'""Harassment allegations
attempted to serve the mother an emergency care order that demanded the children's removal from her care and the home over fear for their safety... based on a caseworker's affidavit, the State Attorney's office had requested two emergency care orders over the past week that sought to transfer legal custody of the children over to the state."" Police and social workers were unable to locate the children or the mother. Miller told police that the woman and her children do not live there, and have not ""for the past two months"". Contradicting Miller, the DCF caseworker, in her affidavit to the Court, presented evidence that up until late July 2022, the woman had been regularly posting images on social media that confirm that she was living with Miller. The Vermont State Attorney's office stated that Miller's response ""seemed like an attempt to 'evade service'"" of the order.Burglary charge
On August 7, 2022, Miller was charged with felony burglary in Stamford, Vermont, stemming from what the police report indicated was theft of bottles of alcohol from a private home in May 2022, according to Vermont State Police. According to the report, Miller was identified by police via video surveillance footage. Miller was due to be arraigned in court on September 26, 2022. A week prior to the planned arraignment date, a representative for Miller stated that the home is owned by a former childhood friend of Miller's and that Miller believed that they were welcome to enter the home to obtain rice wine for cooking.The arraignment was later pushed back to October 17, 2022. Appearing in court remotely on that date, Miller pleaded not guilty to the charges. The next hearing on this case was scheduled for January 13, 2023. A day before the scheduled hearing, they pleaded guilty to trespassing, leading to the burglary charge being dropped. On the day of the hearing, Miller's trespassing plea was approved by the court.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Flash and the Infamous","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9126924/?ref_=tt_urv","SouthernViews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50037650/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2023","I'm doing a spoiler-free review because this movie has a lot of surprises. Before seeing the movie, I knew very little about the plot besides what they showed in the first trailer. Barry goes back in time and consequently unleashes a mess of events. The posters/ads show Michael Keaton as Batman, so it's no surprise that he reprises his role in the Tim Burton movies. The movie also has a new Supergirl, also featured in the posters.I highly enjoyed this movie and found it one of the best in the DCEU. I don't consider The Flash to be THE best, but it's definitely in the top tier. The humor, set pieces, and emotional core are all very well done. I held off on reading any reviews until after seeing the movie, but I agree with some critics that the action scenes, although exciting, can sometimes pull the viewer out of the movie's heart and Barry's original intent to go back in time. But I also think the movie nailed the landing emotionally, so I can't complain.Okay, so let's address two of the biggest ""controversies"" surrounding the movie.Issue 1 - Ezra Miller's off-screen bagagge. Replacing Miller and reshooting the film would have been outrageously expensive. The studio had no choice but to move forward and hope for the best. Haters will hate, and cancel-culture advocates will avoid the movie. They are most likely review-bombing this movie with 1-star and downvoting all positive reviews. I thought Miller did a great Flash in the Justice League movies and continues to shine in this film. I would love a sequel, but given what's happening at Warner and the DCEU reset, I doubt that will happen.Issue 2 - Wonky CGI. When Barry moves within the Speedforce, much of the world around him appears filtered in color and clarity. Some have vented that this is poor CGI. The director is on record saying this look is intentional and we are meant to see the world through Barry's eyes. Perhaps this is also a copout, meaning they could be a bit lazy with the CGI effects inside the Speedforce, but I will take the director at his word. The look inside the Speedforce didn't bother me at all. I also felt that the VFX outside of the Speedforce rocked. Seeing Keaton soar as Batman again, using the latest special effects technology, is pure joy.Although the movie has a runtime of 2.5 hours, the story never drags. The script and direction keep the film moving forward. The humor can sometimes come too close to being too much, but it never gets out of control. Also, unlike the recent Thor movies, the characters don't make jokes during highly emotional moments. The film is earnest and heartfelt when required.I look forward to seeing the movie a second time. There are so many jokes and Easter eggs I often found myself reaching for a non-existent remote control to jump back to rewatch a scene. If you are a Flash fan, you will love this movie. The movie can also stand on its own, meaning that if you don't know the history of the Snyderverse or other DC movies, you will still have fun.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I think this has the potential to win many awards as it show great cinematography and story telling. Michael keatons batman was one I have never seen before, after watching him in this movie I am in love with the character and feel an epic presence when ever he is on screen. The cgi and effects were beutiful and accurate, the pacing was brilliant too.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I am glad to see Keaton again since I am very nostalgic for him when quality films were really made back in the 80s but I am quite amazed compared to others, it is definitely a deserved 10. The interpretation of the actors is a crucial factor and this film was a success. This talented and committed cast brings the characters to life and made me connect with them on an emotional level. Convincing and charismatic performances kept me glued to the screen and made me feel invested in the plot.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Looking forward to seeing her in some capacity in the future.Like I said the movie is fun, if you ignore the shenanigans of the lead actor in real life.

There are some points, I can't say because there are spoilers, I even thought of leaving the cinema. Also this movie trying to be funny and bright like Marvel was also a disgrace. One of the best things about DC is its dark atmosphere and Gotham City. Frankly, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was more gloomy and dark. The script of the movie was not bad. Also, Ezra Miller played the character very well again. The cameos weren't good, I said sometimes it was better if they weren't. I fell asleep for about 5 minutes towards the end of the movie.

(It shows because I also didn't watch it when it first screened.)It tackles the story of flashpoint, one of the greatest flash comic stories out there so if you know you know.The film was actually decent and well put together, it was very fun all the way through and I was surprised.Whenever I used to remember flash, a picture of Grant Gustin used to pop in my head but now after the show went into a downfall and seeing a more in depth flash film starring Ezra Miller, he is him.Comedy was perfectly balanced in almost all of the film except some minor sections, the CGI was kinda good and passable since everytime there was a bad CGI moment, we get compensated with an amazing scene almost immediately after.Ezra Miller's Acting was really great, mixing between the comedy and the heavy drama was exceptional.This film really does well when it comes to fan servicing, seeing Michael Keaton as batman once again is really amazing with the small bits of easter eggs and references to iconic lines, it doesn't just fan service the people in that regards but it's way that is more broader revolving around the DC universes and projects that were either processed or were cancelled.If you're familiar with that kind of knowledge and information, you'll really enjoy it in that regards.Since I watched it a while ago, there might be some stuff that I skipped or just forgot to mention because no notes were prepared and written since that time.It had the perfect ending to set up for whatever James Gunn has prepared for us.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Still it's main character Barry Allen means for the good as he tries to go back in time to change things and make wrongs to a right, you even feel a little ""Back to the Future"" parody! All in the meantime he needs and wants to return to the future and continue to be ""The Flash"" and live with other current super heroes like ""Wonder Woman"", ""Superman"", and ""Batman""(the current one of Ben Affleck). However the best and most vintage and throwback good parts of the film was when in Barry's back time travel he meets ""Batman"", and I'm talking the 1989 one and the super great Michael Keaton!(the one that my era can relate to!) And it's a blast as Keaton's dialogue and sayings are from the 1989 film and they bring back memories! Overall I liked the vintage and throwback feeling help, still this was not the best from ""D.

But when that theme tune kicks in and the Batwing appears...well it feels pretty special.I often feel these modern super hero films lose their way in the third act, and typically revert to the same old 'world destroyer' tropes popularised by Transformers and the like. I thought that was where this was headed, before one of the best 'guest appearance' scenes I've ever seen.It's a shame DC seem to have decided to end this wave of actors as Ezra Miller, Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot are really very good in their roles. Hopefully this does well and a second one is commissioned (rumours abide the script is ready with Keaton returning once more), but I'm assuming all the controversy regarding Miller has put it to bed.But for now I'll enjoy this effort.

If you're one of the many people who lament that DC movies are unnecessarily dark and cannot evoke emotions, this movie breaks the trend. After the first Aquaman and the first Wondnerwoman movie, this is a great DC movie that was long overdue! This story has every ingredient required for a good story --- amazing actors who make you believe in their character, funny one liners, gut wrenching emotions, redemption arc, and finally the triumph of good over evil. After the overload of the Marvel Universe, this movie was a welcome change and I cannot express how happy and thrilled I feel after cheering for The Flash!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Flash movie however, doesn't fall into the category of terrible dc films. It's actually very good and very entertaining. Ezra miller plays a good flash, Michael Keaton killed it like always and Sasha Calle is very promising. This movie will probably make you cry because it's so emotional and has a lot of heart.

And not even the Batmen could outshine the Flashes.I highly recommend this movie for any superhero fans. And it's a must see for any DC comics fan.

And yes, The Flash is terrible. It's unjustifiably bad.Unfortunately, this movie has suffered so much from the bad management at Warner Bros. It's very clear that production was chaotic. We know directors have been changed. The direction of the whole company has changed during production. We had all the Ezra Miller PR disaster. The DCEU is going to be rebooted by James Gunn. So the whole point of this movie was lost. It's a mixed bag of pieces glued together.The idea of getting inspiration from The Flashpoint story arc was not bad. But they only kept the premise of Barry returning to save his mother. We had no Atlantians versus Amazonians war, and most importantly, we didn't have the Thomas Wayne Batman as it was foreshadowed by Zack Snyder way back in Batman v Superman, where Jeffrey Dean Morgan was cast for the flashback because they foresaw him becoming the Flashpoint Batman and Lauren Cohan would play the Flashpoint Joker. While everyone was shipping Negan and Maggie in The Walking Dead, the same couple was supposed to return for the Flashpoint event.We had none of that. Yes, Michael Keaton's return as Batman was very good, and at the very least, I think they didn't ruin our childhood memories. But we are talking about Batman 1989 when we didn't have CGI for special effects. So even cheap CGI today can deliver a good enough Batman action scene. Heck, even YouTubers can do it now. Studios don't have any justification for screwing this up, and fortunately, they didn't. It had all we expected: Danny Elfman's iconic theme song, the best Batmobile ever, the best Batwing ever, and the best Batsuit ever. It was perfect.But this was not a Batman movie. Then we had Sasha Calle as Kara Jor'el, Supergirl. And I think she nailed it. Unfortunately, they didn't give her much to do. I do think she was fantastic in the role, but the screenwriting and direction treated her very poorly in this movie. They called back to Superman 2011 event, but if you didn't watch that movie, you would be a bit lost on this part. The only thing they did to bring people up to speed was a 30 seconds dialogue exposition from Barry. This was very poorly handled.But this was not a Superman or Supergirl movie either. As a Flash movie, even though we had several cameos, at the very least, I think Ezra Miller himself did a good job, given the material he had to work with. I am not into celebrity gossip, and I couldn't care less about his shenanigans. But apart from all the crimes he committed in real life, his mental issues, and whatnot, I think he did a very good job portraying not one but two Barry Allens. In terms of acting range, he displayed a lot of flexibility and talent. Too bad this material was not good, to begin with.We have this whole surface-level ""oh, the Flash is the fastest man alive, but Barry is always late for everything"" shenanigans. It's implied that he has difficulties balancing his superhero life with his real-life persona, but this never actually plays any part in the story. It's just there. Several things in this movie is ""just there"". Wonder Woman showing up out of nowhere felt shoehorned and unnecessary. Iris West, shoehorned. I felt bad for Iris, as saying she was underutilized is an understatement.The soundtrack was mostly forgettable. I don't remember anything other than Danny Elfman's Batman and John Williams' Superman themes. And yes, it's unfair, as those are some of the most iconic theme songs of all time. But the contrast was big enough to notice.Then, there's the CGI and special effects issue. Remember when I said that even YouTubers can do better than the analog special effects from the 80s. Yeah, but Warner screwed up here as well. I don't remember CGI this bad since, I don't know, The Scorpion King. It was bad, truly bad. The director tried to sugarcoat it, saying that it was ""supposed to look bad,"" justifying that it was a stylistic choice. And I don't think this excuse works. It's just plain bad. It Felt rushed and low-budget. And I think those are the true reasons. Seriously, hire a bunch of special effects YouTubers, like the Corridor Crew. Even they could do better than this.Finally, the easter eggs and fan service. They were exaggerated. I understand they wanted to celebrate the cultural zeitgeist, but it was too much and too out of context. Instead of feeling like they were trying to honor past works, such as Christopher Reeve's Superman, it felt disrespectful and distasteful.I can see that they had good intentions, but the execution was very poor, and I know Warner's upper management is to blame. The production crew did their best with what they had, possibly in one of the most chaotic productions of recent years. I can commend the attempt, but the results were just horrendous. I can't find enough words to say how bad. Very good casting, but very badly written and directed roles.If we cut this movie into pieces, I will remember Michael Keaton. And I will remember Sasha Calle. Everything else was garbage. A very sorry excuse for a bad joke. If not for those brief contributions, this is a straight zero. I will give 3 out of 10 out of pity.Not worth watching in the theater. Not worth the effort to download from torrent. If you subscribe to Max, wait for the streaming. You're not missing anything.I feel sad for this movie and the current state of DCEU. It's the last chapter in the Snyderverse. It started in a high note with 2011's Superman, we come back to the Zod story arc, and this last chapter is a sad reminder of how things could have been but wasn't. Too bad.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Although not a model for induced change, it well defends the alleged benefits of doing nothing, supposedly so that new worlds can arise from hardship and crisis.I see Andy Muschieti's The Flash as an accidental, metaphorical manifestation of that. What this films aims to is not clear, but it surely makes effort to accelerate the DCEU to cinematic and narrative oblivion, by not establishing real threats to care for, diminishing the little impact its predecessors could have, smartly writing off the continuity of the Snyderverse to make room for James Gunn's take (albeit late) and many other corporate decisions.In an attempt to replicate Spider-Man No way home's formula for profit, Barry Allen's first solo (sic) cinematic adventure success at accelerating the audience's fatigue, boredom and indifference at multiversal-level time-bending speed, but it also accelerates Warner's numbers to massive loss, althought it does so with kinky humor, some deference and occasional emotion.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm trembling with the sheer emotional overload. This is the best movie I've seen this year, and perhaps the best movie I've seen in several years. Tight writing and a perfect pace, a truly great score and for all the SF/fantasy/superhero nerds like me, easter eggs that you need a superhero sized basket to collect. Yes, the cameos are legion, and some are rather sentimental, but they work in the story. And the STORY! It is amazing, with literary flourishes like metaphor and symbolism (yikes!). Let me tell you, when Michael Keaton flies out of the Batcave to Danny Elfman's main theme, you will be thrilled out of your MIND. Ezra Miller does a journeyman job of acting for the first act. Didn't really like his character. But canny directing and exemplary acting paid for it as his character grew in maturity and strength throughout. Miller, for better or worse, is famously nuts. And there were squeaky edges. But he's damn fine in this film. I know that the Superhero genre is getting tired and lame, but don't let that generality deter you. This movie breaks the mold. Everything matters. Every moment. My highest recommendation. Oh, and one of those easter eggs?

When you think you know what's going on - Nope! The viewers are pulled in another direction.

Ezra Miller as the lead -- initially awkward, which he's known for, then gradually coming out of his shell as Flash/Barry -- is fine, but the storyline is extremely convoluted (no spoilers for those who have the time to go watch the movie). Seeing our favorite Batman(s) was nice, but Cavil's obvious absence given the multiple Batman/Superman cameos made the film extremely awkward and ridiculous. Of course it gives Keaton a bit more time to shine -- no complaints there. But the reported excuses of ""confusing viewers"" with too many Superman cameos when they basically threw in everything and the kitchen sink into the movie tells viewers that this is simply hogwash.No spoilers to the plot.

I own every issue of comics with his name on the cover from 1987 to last week.Needless to say, I was really excited to see this movie. Only there was a problem...it's star Ezra Miller. Real world issues aside, I did not care for his performance as The Scarlet Speedster in his previous outings. He was annoying and not what I was expecting the character to be.Then I watched this film and his performance was so much better this time around. He was still kind of annoying, but he had matured as an individual. It had never occured to me that his behavior in ""Justice League"" was because he was young. He was a stupid kid who was given amazing powers. I definitely would have behaved exactly the same as a young man. Heck, I would act that way now as a middle aged man.The story was mostly what I was expecting it to be. Like I said I have a pretty expensive collection of his printed adventures, but it was a lot funnier than I was expecting. The laughs didn't feel forced and came out naturally with the story and tone they were presenting.As for the cameos, some were known ahead of time, like Michael Keaton's return as Batman, and there were some others I expected but I will not spoil. Then there were some others that took me completely by surprise and I audibly squealed in my seat. But no matter who showed up, all of these little appearances were a love letter to the history of DC.Is it the best superhero movie ever like some people are saying? No, but is is a darn good one and a lot of fun. I highly recommend seeing this one in theaters as its scope and action should be experienced on the big screen.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Adapting FLASHPOINT would have been amazing. Nobody would've been mad, the cast they would've had, would've been superb, and yet they did not take the perfect gold mine that was presented to them.

The last star is because it nailed me right in the nostalgia seeing George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Adam West and others as well as Nicholas Cage. That was pretty cool. Ezra Miller is lousy and unlikeable as Flash. Additionally, I'm more than a little annoyed that Hartly Sawyer was cut from Flash the series for some stupid tweets (yes they were sick and twisted and his excuse of wanting attention is lame) but Ezra is a pig, pervert, and one accuser called him a GROOMER OF THEIR 12 YEAR OLD but he doesn't get cut? Ok, to be fair, those are accusations and one is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but I guess I'm just personally ranting because I like Sawyer's Ralph MUCH better than Miller's Flash. It also bothers me that the series is all about redemption and second chances and Sawyer gets dropped because of some nonsense even after he apologized. Yes, Miller apologized, too, and is seeking help and I hope he gets it. But the double standard kills me. If Miller preferred he/him instead of they/them, would he have been recast? Something to consider. I apologize that this went from a movie review about Flash and became a rant about fairness. With or without Miller, this movie was awful. The Batman and Supergirl parts were cool and that's about it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Like they ran out of money in post production. I've read a review where it was suggested that they intended that but honestly why intentionally sabotage your production like that?","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The Flash and every other Dc movie has more heart, the best villains and the greatest stories. Ok enough bashing the Marvel Disney stuff..
The Flash was a excellent story the effects yes were not the best, but most movies the CGI is not really that good. It has gotten too cartoonish, Hollywood needs to go back to building sets and miniatures.Michael Keaton, of course is amazing. It was cool seeing Ben Affleck as Batman again Kara did awesome it was cool seeing her as Supergirl she did such a great job. Some of the story felt rushed probably could've been edited down a little bit, but most superhero movies are a little too long.Otherwise it was an enjoyable Movie and that's what you want in a movie.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

The Flash movie was plagued with production problems since day 1. From the time they announced the film, they made a whole CW series of the Flash that ran for 9 years. This movie went through 9 different directors. It kept being delayed for COVID protocol. The studio kept changing its mind about the DC direction after each movie release. Actors contracts expired and just a whole mess of things. That mess certainly does show in the final product. That's not to mention the lead actor seemed to have some sort of mental breakdown and could not stop going to jail. It's at that point that any pity that you had going for the movie is replaced with disgust.On the short list of positives, there are a handful of little details that the movie does right. I smiled at the joke where the title screen gets interrupted, or when Flash goes to cut off the ears on Batman's cowl.With those out of the way, let's dig in. The CGI in this film is some of the worst I have seen in any big budget film. This is ""Mummy Returns"" level of bad visuals. The comedy in this movie is irritating. First you have the Flash, and then you have a somehow more annoying version of the same character. It has some of the most desperate attempts of nostalgia bating ""member berries"" I have ever seen. I grant that the comic book logic isn't going to make sense, but at the very least it has to stay consistent to its own rules, and this film fails at that. And it concludes with an over the top nonsense CGI battle where the heroes have no plan for success. The tone is all over the place. Given the film's troubled development I would not be surprised if the finished product was an improv game where each director tried to finish the sentence started by the other. When I think of the theme that the movie is trying to teach, it is a bit insulting. It is like they are wanting to have their cake and eat it too. The whole thing does not work.I think Batman summed it up best, when in the movie he stated: ""For the record, I think this whole thing is insane.""","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well, it looks like those executives were on the same stuff as Aaron Rodgers. Watch the animated movie, Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox since it's far better. The Supergirl and Batman sequences overshadow Flash to the point, where Flash felt more like support character. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a Supergirl movie in the works. But WB/DC will probably screw that up even with new leadership from Gunn, who had his own issues. It's just a messy movie with such a large budget of $200M, why is the CGI so poor? And I haven't even factored in Miller's controversies, which should have gotten him fired. And the Batman running joke ended with easily the worst version of Batman ever.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But on his return to the present timeline he gets knocked off course and finds himself stuck in an alternate timeline where Superman is not around to stop Zod's invasion of earth.I was not expecting much when I went in to watch The Flash. The DCU had never really grasped my interest outside of Wonder Woman, Shazam, Zack Snyders Justice League and Suicide Squad so I was pleasantly surprised when I walked out having enjoyed this so much! The Flash is sort of like the DCU's version of Avengers Endgame in that is references and rewrites various events from movies past... and not just recent movies either but ALL DC related films or shows going back to the 50s. The humour can be a bit on the nose at times, but there's also some genuine comedic observations about the other Justice League characters. Although the overall plot is quite emotionally heavy and deals with loss, grief and the role pain plays in our development as people, the story is told in a light and breezy way making it very easy to watch. Generally time travel storylines get very confusing, but the explanations given in this film are quite different to how other films deal with time travel and I found it slightly refreshing. It did start to get a little confusing right near the end with what was happening inside the time bubble thing and worlds were crashing into one another but outside of that small sequence, everything else made perfect sense to me. It was great to see Michael Keaton return to his role as Batman, I can't say I was overaly happy with his portrayal mind you as it was almost too comedic but it was still ""cool"", I got giddy. There are a few other interesting faces that show up and events refrenced from movies past and I don't want to spoil it for others but it was fun pointing them all out... to a point. That was also the movies biggest let down. I don't think they needed all those cameos particularly from historic DC franchises. It just felt a bit much, they over did it and it lost some of the impact.Final Verdict: Action packed, funny, emotional when it counts and just an all round easy watch. It does start to get a bit self-indulgent right towards the end and the humour didn't always land but its one of the better DCU films in a long time.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has none of the character, depth or character needed for this to be a film. No one will be speaking of this movie in the next decade let alone when the unforgivable sequel comes out.How most cinema goers perceive a movie is based on the quality of CGI. That's to say if you take the same film with varying CGI quality, people value the quality of CGI more than the content. However this changes when the quality of the content is decent/good (i.e. The Thing & The Matrix: Reloaded). The fact that the line is the sand for whether a blockbuster is good or not is the CGI underscores what has gone wrong with modern film in general. At least when my parents brought me to watch Monsters Inc. I could take away something valuable from what was unsaid, and so could they.Honestly after this monstrosity of a film I cannot for a minute believe that Warner Bros or any other company in this space is going to pull out of this nosedive. Modern film is all pop-culture references with no substance. Please, I urge to go back and take a look at the first Iron Man for just a few minutes, then come look at any of the sequels. Infinity War was the only one that came close, then it's legacy was ruined by Endgame. Lord forgive these writers, producers & directors. The flash was a mess, ingratiating itself at the feet of the common viewer like a pug but when it comes down to it, it shouldn't have ever existed in the first place. Us as the people who pay for the tickets, recommend movies to others, and bring our children to the Box Office have forgotten that we're in charge of the $h!t show. We bred the pug and The Flash into existence, and it's deformed shape is no longer morally justifiable, it's time to undo this mess.This is while trying to ignore the controversy involving some of the cast. I genuinely gave it a fair shake and I want a refund.To quote a true graphic novel adaptation. ""Blake understood. Treated it like a joke, but he understood. He saw the cracks in society, saw the little men in masks trying to hold it together...he saw the true face of the twentieth century and chose to become a reflection of it, a parody of it. No one else saw the joke. That's why he was lonely.""","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

But they literally carried the movie. Even for a movie with multiple batmen and supergirl. It was flash movie thru and thru.. Andy killed it. Now I understand what he is the frontrunner to direct the brave and the bold. He shines.CG in the movie looks great for 95% of it. 3% is obvious face replacements that you can expect when same actor plays 2 characters who interact with each other all the time which is for 2 good hours in this movie.. And 2% is the style of CG not reckless CG.I suppose that's how film makers chose to show how time travel work and how the outside looks from the inside of the speed force..
It's was fun movie with a lot of heart.One of the few movies that is completely plot driven and doesn't loose it's sight for 1 min even.It's a solid 3.75/5 for a general movie goer and a 5/5 for a DC fan. You'll just love the references and the cameos.Keaton killed it. He once again proves why he's the best BATMAN there is..
Sasha was born to play supergirl. They dealt with her really great for the short time she was in the movie.. They couldn't have done a better job..

That was the ONE bright spot in this otherwise crap movie. Miller is a horrible actor, and apparently and equally horrible, if not more horrible person. One look at him, and you can see he is a deeply disturbed, drug-addled individual who has apparently been led to confusion about many things in his life, and maybe that has led to some of his apparent rage and acting out.

After all of the bad reviews, I skipped seeing it at the theater. I finally watched it on Max.Right from the start, the story was good. Miller did a very good job at being a likeable character. But right from a start, I had a problem. I tried to figure out whether the special effects were the problem, or if it was something else. The big scene with the falling babies was just bad. I finally decided that it was the direction. I just didn't like it. In another scene with the Bat-Cycle, it just looked.. wrong. Again, I analyzed it and decided that it wasn't the effects, it was just that things don't work that way in real life. The Bat-Cycle is powerful and can slam off walls without damage. But it just didn't look like it was happening in our world.But then we get into the main part of the story, and I really enjoyed it. Miller did great playing off himself. It made the movie light and fun.It went dark (a bit) in the story, but that was necessary and appropriate.I loved how they presented the multiverse, and I enjoyed the cameos.By the end of the movie, I found that I had really enjoyed it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Would have been treat to watch in 3d, but none the less must watch movie. Especially the Micheal Keaton scene gives goosebumps. Being a true batman fans enjoyed every bit of the presence of all characters
Dc is back with good content.Hope more content are coming like this!!Must watch movie for all Dc fans and everyone.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The cgi is bad, the actors are (mostly) bad, the writing is bad, the action is bad, even the idea of the movie was bad. Why did the bring Ezra miller back AGAIN??? The amount of crimes he's committed should effectively blacklist him from hollywood, but apparently DC has to keep using the actors they used prior despite james gunn basically now being the DC film's new overseer. Bringing a multiverse into a pre-established film franchise has been a very bad idea, as seen with the mcu. Spider-verse did it all incredibly well twice, how do other companies keep messing this up???This movie, no, this flick, is appalling, don't watch it unless you want to see microwave baby.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

I thought this was great.Like with 'Shazam! Fury of the Gods', I was not expecting much from these DCEU films as I only decided to watch them so I could catch up on this universe before the 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' finale next month. I guess I was subconsciously anticipating these to be as flat as a pancake due to the suits upstairs focusing on the upcoming DCU. Yet, I've had a terrific time thus far - 'Blue Beetle' pending.As for this film itself, I'm not someone who has any interest in comic books so my only knowledge comes directly from the films. All I knew beforehand was the rather dodgy life of Ezra Miller (just look at their Wikipedia!) apparently affecting production. That's a lot of words to simply say that I have no clue how well of an adaptation this is from the comics, though simply as a film it give me entertainment, it really did.'The Flash' features a strong performance from Miller, who portrays the aforementioned with quality throughout. I don't remember Barry Allen from the other DCEU flicks, so I'm pleased to have something memorable from the character with this. Elsewhere, Sasha Calle is very good as Supergirl, while Michael Keaton is much fun as Batman. There are some solid cameos in there too.I will say that I personally would've shaved some of the run time, it does overrun ever so slighty. That is my only proper criticism though, given everything else from the story - which brings heart - to the special effects to whatever is done to a positive standard. Rating-wise, I've gone back and forth between 8/10 and 9/10 - it narrowly nabs the latter.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not better than Wonder Woman, Shazam, or The Suicide Squad (the 2021 version of course), but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. That said, it has some flaws that prevent it from being a truly good movie, with the biggest disappointment being t doesnt have any original Flash villain. The Flash has excellent villains, and none of them gets even a mention, making the Flash look like the least appreciated member of the Justice League. Hell, even Shazam, a supposedly less important DC character, was given his own villain. The CGI is not the best we've seen in a DCEU movie, or any movie for that matters. And yes, the Flashpoint Paradox animated movie is still a much better movie. I also felt this movie came too late since there are too many movies about the multiverse these days, especially since this is the most important arc in the Flash storyline. Still, I find there's a lot to like. It has fun cameos from past DC movies, even including one that was cancelled. The storyline is decent enough although fans of the Flash will find it familiar and thus predictable. The cast members did a decent enough job with Michael Keaton's Batman being the best. I gave it an 8 because I felt entertained when I left the theater, which is what a movie should be.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Most didn't even watch the movie and outright refused to. A lot of people are just triggered Henry Cavill won't be Superman anymore. I don't think that should have any baring on this movie.The Flash is surprisingly good. The acting is good for the most part, the jokes land, and the story is very good. It follows the Flashpoint Paradox where the Flash runs back in time to save his mom, resulting in a parallel timeline/multiverse that is ultimately doomed. If you know Flashpoint then you know how this has to end, but if you don't then I won't spoil it. Is this movie 100% faithful to the comic or animated version of Flashpoint? No, but the beauty in multiverses is that this movie doesn't have to be and can still work on its own.This movie feels like the first time DC finally nailed the MCU formula (Pre-End Game not the current garbage). What's more is that this movie nailed the concept of Multi-Verses so much better than Marvel has with their poor attempts the last few years. No actor came off as bad or dragging the Flash down. By no means is Ezra Miller the perfect lead, but I think he did well enough, especially since he plays two versions of the Flash the whole movie.Michael Keaton is of course Batman in this version and he brings his A game. You can tell he very much he had fun being Batman again which fits perfectly with the character. In this universe, Batman made Gotham safe so he got to retire and move on with his life. Now that the Flash has arrived and needs help, Batman comes out of a long retirement to be Batman one more time. Eagle Eyed fans of the 80s Batman movies will also pick out a lot of Easter eggs to the films, especially in the Bat Cave.The only thing I'll complain about is the CGI. You can tell the budget suffered here. It's passable for the most part, but there are moments where you can clearly see how cartoonish some scenes look. For me, it wasn't a deal breaker and it's no where as bad as some Marvel movies/shows have become, but yeah it definitely could've been better. I don't think it's fair to give the movie 5/10 tho like some people have. The movie is engaging enough that for the most part I either didn't notice or care.Give the movie a chance. I personally think it's one of the best DC films, heck even super hero file

In many ways it's a perfect encapsulation for what the DC Universe has been so far.Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) discovers that if he runs at top speed, he can enter the speed force and travel through time. Despite grave warnings from Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) he decides to travel back and save the life of his mother (Maribel Verdu). On his return he's kicked out of the speedforce by an unidentified assailant and inadvertently meets a younger more open version of himself. Having ensured that this version still gets his powers, Allen discovers that his adjustments have had grave consequences, as when General Zod (Michael Shannon) attacks, there is no Superman to defeat him.It's unfortunate that the quintessential Flash story, ""Flashpoint"" is adapted now, when both Marvel and the ""Spider-Verse"" series are deep into their own multiverse stories. It's also unfortunately that the film has gone through so many variations and creative hands that what could have been a triumphant end for the whole ""Synderverse"" era, is again another blank squib. Roughly speaking, I liked the first half of this film, but once the team were together, I was disappointed with what they did with it.I didn't particularly want to enjoy Miller's performance, given their recent baffling legal actions, but I have to admit that old Barry talking new Barry through the powers was probably my favourite bits, along with the opening capture rescue (which clearly takes play in Glasgow, if you're going to film in a place and tell us it's Gotham, maybe don't use its most recognisable landmark in the key scene). Allen dualling tale of loss is the films heart and whenever it leans into that it works quite well. Once the team are together, adding Supergirl (played by Sasha Calle, who's fine but doesn't have a lot to do) and Batman (played by Michael Keaton who is an excellent and, for me, surprisingly emotional return) the film becomes somehow markedly less interesting, as they battle a nameless army of Zod's soldiers and Allen eventually learns his lesson (although not really). I then can't decide if the cameos are just gratuitous or if they are a waste, because none of them really contribute to the plot and I'd hoped to see four versions of Superman join the fight in something to rival the end of Endgame.The quality of the CGI varies wildly across the film, presumably based on which effects house was doing what. That's a forgivable problem though relative to the saggy middle and a conclusion that delivers much less than it promises.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

With its lightning-fast pace, the season delved into thrilling storylines that explored Barry Allen's personal growth as a hero and his efforts to protect Central City from an array of formidable adversaries. The writers masterfully balanced humor, emotion, and high-stakes action, providing a well-rounded narrative. The visual effects and cinematography were breathtaking, especially during the epic speedster battles and time-travel sequences. The ensemble cast delivered stellar performances, with Grant Gustin's portrayal of Barry Allen/The Flash continuing to be a standout, showcasing his range as an actor. Overall, the 2023 Flash season was an electrifying and must-watch chapter in the ongoing legacy of the Scarlet Speedster.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Eventually, it impressed me to a very little extent. To shorten my review, Barry never felt the lead character of his own movie.Yes, there were a lot of unnecessary fanservice along with a meddled and chaotic representation of Flash point mechanism. The CGI was too much, and at many times felt overused or was a total disaster. Keaton is the one who brings both effortless gravity and subtle levity to a film that, without him, wouldn't have much of either.Across the film's two-and-a-half hours, little time is given to developing anyone other than Miller's hero, wasting the talents of Keaton and Sasha Calle's Supergirl, who has a lot of presence but not a lot to do. To summarise, rather than the beginning of a cool new idea, The Flash now feels like it should be the last word on movie multiverses.My Rating : 5/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Its an enjoyable movie for a number of reasons but this adaptation of Flashpoint should have had the script developed, reworked and refined further before production. The story we are given is basic A to B with a garnish of ideas that could have been develop more deeply to provide an emotional ride. We are given instead nostalgic pop culture supported by extremely poor CGI. There are some wow moments stolen by Keaton and his bat toys, but majority was sadly revealed in the promotional advertising which takes dulls the surprise shine. And the fact of some of loved heroes face demise will certainly upset viewer for the wrong reason. In conclusion, instead of direct worldwide threat and JSA, this movie could have been edited heavily, cutting out the fandom, and focus exploring the emotional toll of consequences of the butterfly effect with dramatic decisions. The appearance of mysterious flash version should have remained as such setting up for more instalments. We have a fun over-hype movie that is worth watching, but not ground-breaking.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I didn't like Ezra Miller or the Flash character portrayal in Justice League, but the trailer looked like they fixed it. They did NOT!I must preface my comments by saying I don't like the concept or the movie plots around time travel. It's been done it better ways, but the theme of ""changing the past and the consequences that follow"" is just beating a dead horse. I mean, we just watched a similar movie with Spider-man No Way Home, so now we get the less popular DC version of it.Trying not to spoil it, the humor was weak, most of the characters (especially the lead) were bad, and it's disjointed. Case in point: terrible attempt at humor for young Barry to burn off his clothes at first, then he keeps them later. I agree with most that Michael Keaton is probably the highlight of the movie. The cameos were cute, but not done as well as they could have been. The end credit scene is absolutely horrible. And yes, the CGI is pretty bad in places.Superman's cousin was a nice add and Sasha Calle was good in her role. Miller's dual characters are just out of sync for me. Barry was very immature in Justice League and skittish - not the makings of a Superhero - just someone with super speed. Here in The Flash with dual roles, he's current Barry that's immature while in his timeline, but more mature and a bit wiser in the past (makes no sense). The young Barry is ridiculously immature to the degree of how did he ever become mature enough to be a hero.It looked so promising, only to be so disappointing.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

What a movie from start till end it'll give you a complete fun ride with powerful emotional scenes and superb performances by all the cast. Director Andy gives an excellent direction that only focuses on flash origin his story and the chaos that his made in the film. Screenplay is too simple and pretty good specially for those who follow flash comics or know the character pretty well. CGI is superb and you can easily connect with the character in just start of the film. 1st half focuses on storyline and 2nd half is full of action sequences and a conclusion. Dialogues are too good specially the conversation between the lead characters is amazing to watch. Bonus point of the film is the cameos that will totally surprise you and it'll make the movie more engaging to watch. Director Andy has done a fantastic job while making The Flash suachya cool film and bring back the nostalgia of the old characters. There are pretty good emotional scenes which I like the most specially in the end was heavy. The only thing that is lacking in thjs film is that they should've given little more focused on the main villain rather than just end it quickly. Don't go for the reviews this film is a treat to all DC fans and those who love Flash.

When it hit streaming, I gave it a watch, and was filled with relief. Relief that I didn't take one of my poor parents to see it in theatres.When Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) alters time in an attempt to save his family, he is met with an alternate version of himself. The two Barry's meet that timeline's Batman (Michael Keaton), and attempt to save the world from General Zod and reset the timeline back to normal.This movie could possibly contain the worst opening sequence in cinematic history. It was the closest I had been in a long time to just turning a movie off. The slow-motion part of the sequence took up half of the scene, and went way too long. All non-Batman actors in this movie should never be allowed to act again, except on sitcoms. Ezra Millers highly publicized legal troubles are evident in the film, with reported meltdowns by the actor on set. That being said, Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton deliver fine performances as different versions of Batman from different realities. Director Andy Muchietti might be a clever director when it comes to comedy, but he should never direct a big budget action movie again. I'm saddened to learn that he will be directing a new Batman film, as Batman is my favorite superhero, and I'm concerned with having the same person behind the camera for that project as The Flash. In The Flash, the presence of Batman might be the thing that saves this movie from total disaster.While I will never watch this movie again, I give it credit for having a watchable plot after the opening scene. I don't blame you if you like this movie. It's a goofy movie, that's just what it is. And if you want to watch a movie and relax and not take it seriously, you'll probably like this movie. I wouldn't. Because when I want to relax and enjoy a movie, I watch something with Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey. Not a superhero movie. We need more superhero movies like The Dark Knight. And it's a terrifying thought that instead of that, we'll be getting this from the superhero genre from now on.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I would have taken away the scene with the babies at the beginning of the movie, added something else, made the movie more serious and with fewer jokes.

Rarely can actors and their directors capture the same lightening in a bottle 30+ years later, and this is no exception. However, there's a very entertaining Flash movie in here that teases the audience of what the exciting world that could have been with Ezra Miller is like. Affleck's Batman I'd also a far cry from the killer we saw in BvS but a decent send-off for his version in some really good action scenes. All in all, it's a really fun ride if you ignore all continuities (ironically enough) in past, present, and future.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The rest of the movie seems dull and I can't even stand for the stupidity of the Flash in this movie. Even in a scene of Hospital collapse I mostly found him just standing there. He have super-speed, he could evacuate the whole hospital in seconds when he arrives, but all we gotta watch is Ezra Miller's stupid shock face. And the younger ver. Of the flash is even worse. He's 18, but acted like a freaking 12 yr old. There is no need to introduce that many batmen...Why I don't know why???

The only scenes that are worth talking about are the ones featuring Barry and his Mother and I could feel my heartstrings being pulled each time they interacted. Aside from that, they really should have done a faithful flashpoint adaptation rather then putting in their own awful take on it.

Unfortunately they delayed it due to covid and in that time Miller has proven himself to be a problem, so I don't think we'll be seeing any future Flash movies. It's a pity because this was a lot of fun.The opening sets the tone of the movie very well. It's silly serious. There are moments where it gets a little dramatic, particularly the stuff surrounding Supergirl, but it never gets so serious that you can't still have fun with it. Even the ending where everything is wrapped up all nice and neat had a great gag thrown in.It was great to see Keaton as Batman again, I'm still curious about the Batgirl movie that got scrapped. I'm guessing that movie would have given some context to his character in this one.Sascha Calle was alright as Supergirl until she needed to speak. But hey, it's Supergirl I'm not looking for some sort of oscar winning performance.Ezra Miller really does do a great job, which makes his choices in life all the more unfortunate. I'd love to see a sequel, but I doubt that's in the cards.

On this occasion, Flash is the one who breaks that barrier by discovering that he can travel beyond time and space. All because of the desire to reverse what started his story and this movie gives details about the origin of Flash in this journey that he makes. The movie is not just another installment in the DC universe, but rather serves as a spin-off of the early Batman movies directed by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton returns to play Batman after many years, making it clear that his films were part of an alternate reality of this saga. The third act even leaves a tremendous surprise by showing us that other previous DC adaptations such as the Superman series of the 50s, Adam West's Batman series, the Superman saga with Christopher Reeves, the failed 1986 Supergirl movie, the canceled Superman Lives movie with Nicolas Cage and Batman & Robin with George Clooney are part of this multiverse. That becomes a nostalgia factor for those who already knew these installments and makes The Flash a fascinating movie for lovers of DC adaptations. Argentinian Andrés Muschietti excelled when he adapted Stephen King's novel It and has now proven to be suitable enough to make a DC Comics movie as well. Erza Miller really shined in his role as Flash, the action scenes are very good and the comedy is well balanced. The Flash is one of the best installments of this saga for expanding beyond the world of DC Comics. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

While the special effects may not be polished, it's a serviceable and amusing addition to the growing list of superhero pictures that unfold in multiverses or parallel realities. Barry Allen, an adolescent buffoon with impulse control issues, decides to save his mother's death, creating another timeline with an alternative Barry Allen. He discovers a replacement Batman and Supergirl, replacing Superman. The film is efficient, pacy, and largely enjoyable. ""The Flash"" is a mixed bag of superhero blockbusters, combining thoughtfulness, cluelessness, challenge, and pandering. It features both good and bad digital FX work, and, like its sincere yet hapless hero, exceeds expectations for competence. However, it often faces challenges and faces-plants into the nearest wall. ""The Flash"" is a narrative that repeatedly resets and starts again, exploring time, parallel universes, and the possibility of altering ""canonical"" events or whole dimensions. Despite its thoughtfulness and diverse genres, it suffers from being its own worst enemy. The film also premiered after the release of ""Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse,"" a high watermark for superhero movies and studio animated features that explores similar concepts in a more innovative way. Ezra Miller stars as Barry Allen, a twentysomething forensic scientist and secret superhero. The film struggles with the impact of his mother's murder and father's wrongful imprisonment. The film's plot is described in detail, but much of it has already been ""spoiled"" on social media, online forums, trailers, marketing material, and Wikipedia. The review highlights the double bind of discussing the film's meatier parts, as the plot has already been spoiled. ""The Flash"" has a countervailing tendency that undermines its best self. Instead of repurposing library footage from earlier DC comics, the actors who originally played them have been scanned or rebuilt as vaguely three-dimensional but uncanny grotesques. This process, similar to the process used to reanimate Peter Cushing in ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" and later serve up unsettling ""young Carrie Fisher"" in the climax, paving the way for a nearly expressionless ""young Mark Hamill"" on ""The Mandalorian,"" and de-aged '70s movie stars for various legacy sequels, is trotted out and multiplied ad nauseam here, even though the technology hasn't improved much. The Flash's use of callbacks to other versions of heroes and villains from film and TV serves no other purpose than to burnish Warner Bros' properties and make the audience point to the screen and whisper the names of actors, characters, films, TV shows, and comic books they recognize. The film's principal cast undergoes a zombie CGI treatment in the Chrono-Bowl to visualize alternate realities. Some of these living actors with SAG cards and updated IMDb pages appear faintly demonic, with torsos and hands not anatomically credible. The technology used in the film may have been exploited until quality control disappeared, or it may not be yet there. The use of an animated format raises concerns about the representation of a thing not meant to seem ""real."" In live-action, the character of ""Actor X"" becomes creepy and unreal, leading to a broken spell. This is a shame, as ""The Flash"" is a well-crafted film that warns against a thing while also performing a version of it. Barry, driven by a desire to resurrect the dead, grapples with the ethics and advisability of actions, which the film constantly performs without breaking a sweat.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Not only one of the best films in the DCEU but also one of the most entertaining superhero films to be released in the past several years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9121898/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2023","""The Flash"" is a superhero film serving as the 13th installment in the DC Extended Universe. Directed by Andy Muschietti (""IT: Chapters 1 and 2"") and starring Ezra Miller in the title role, it ranks as not only one of the best films in the DCEU but also as one of the most entertaining superhero films to be released in the past several years.Sometime after the events of ""Justice League"", Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) is working as a forensics investigator while also saving people from danger as his superhero alter-ego ""The Flash"". When testing out his powers of super fast speed, Barry discovers he is able to travel backwards through time and decides to use this ability to save his mother from dying. Upon accomplishing this task, Barry learns that he has now inadvertently created an alternate timeline with no superheroes, putting the world at risk from the rogue Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon). With no Justice League to assist him, Barry seeks out help from his younger self, an elderly Bruce Wayne/Batman (Michael Keaton), and an imprisoned Kryptonian hero (Sasha Calle) to save the Earth from Zod's wrath.It's hard to believe that it has been ten years since the world was first introduced to the DC Extended Universe, kicking things off with the divisive ""Man of Steel"". The polarising reception of that film and eventually all of the DCEU's catalogue has kept it far behind the more successful Marvel Cinematic Universe in terms of overall popularity. That's not to say the franchise as a whole is a complete failure, as there are some genuinely solid films in the series as well as some notable performances from its cast. One such character who stands out is The Flash, whose energetic, overly confident personality made him one of the more memorable additions to the DCEU's Justice League. After all this time, The Flash now finally has a chance to shine in his 2023 solo film, which functions as both an excellent character study of the eponymous hero and a wonderful tribute to all the positive aspects of this decade old shared universe.As opposed to a typical origin story, this film gets straight to the point by throwing the audience and its lead character right into the thick of the action. We watch the young Barry Allen race through the city at super speeds to rescue people from a collapsing hospital, using creative and humorous makeshift methods along the way. What hinders Barry's progress is not the task itself but rather his empty stomach, which needs to be full in order for him to perform at maximum capacity. Though this character trait was comically hinted at in ""Justice League"" (both Whedon and Snyder Cuts), here it is treated more seriously, as the entire fate of some falling newborn babies rests on whether Barry is able to consume a nearby chocolate bar to acquire the necessary energy needed to save them. This is just one example of what the film gets right compared to other DCEU entries and I was impressed at how it was able to balance the humour and dramatic severity without resorting too heavily into either one.Moreover, Barry Allen's characterisation is handled exceptionally well, in not one but two different versions of the same person. The present day Barry is at odds with his double life of working in forensics while also saving lives as The Flash. He is haunted by the death of his mother, as well as the fact that his father is wrongfully imprisoned for allegedly murdering her. All of these problems reach a boiling point when he learns of his ability to fix all these issues by use of time travel. When things go wrong, Barry ends up meeting his past self, whose blatant immaturity makes him a difficult ally to work with. Present Barry is clearly frustrated at Past Barry's behaviour, and it is here the film begins to show the two Barrys as completely separate characters. Like a classic comedy duo, Present Barry essentially acts as the voice of reason to the impulsive Past Barry, allowing for some amusing comic relief scenes that help move the plot forward. But what starts off as a series of humorous situations soon becomes an important battle to save this timeline from destruction, and watching the two Barrys try to work together is a great way to develop each of their characters, with both learning something from each other along the way.Similar to what happened in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", there are certain parts that call back to previous DC films, and not strictly limited to just the contained DCEU library. There is considerable acknowledgment of almost all of the best things about DC in general, ranging from the excitement of watching their superhero movies to contemplating hypothetical scenarios of what could have been. As the film delves even deeper into the DC multiverse, we see plenty of fanservice and easter eggs to spot during our first viewing. Of course, I am not going to spoil anything here so all I will say is that there were a handful of scenes that truly warmed my heart. Most of these moments take place at the climax, but there are also some neat references to other DC media sprinkled throughout the story that should definitely make longtime fans very happy. Best of all, most of it felt like belonged there and wasn't simply shoehorned in to distract the audience from the plot. Even a Marvel fan like myself couldn't help but feel a genuine sense of satisfaction upon seeing some of the surprises that this film has in store for us all.Separating the art from the artist, I think Ezra Miller did a fantastic job playing both versions of Barry Allen/The Flash. Miller manages to successfully strike the perfect balance between the annoyed straight-man Present Barry and the cocky youthful Past Barry, to the point where they each feel like completely independent characters from one another. I found myself caring a great deal about both Barrys and the fates they are respectively aligned to, which provides a superb driving force for the story. It's a huge shame that the actor is embroiled in such disturbing real-world controversies because Miller has a lot of acting talent, all of which is sadly going to waste. Regardless, Miller's depiction of The Flash was well-worthy of the big screen treatment.But the real reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place was to watch Michael Keaton wear his Batman suit one last time, and on that note I was not disappointed. Keaton just so happens to be my personal favourite Batman, so seeing him play the character again for the first time since 1992 was nothing short of surreal. Not only can he still hold his own physically alongside the rest of the younger cast, but Keaton still has that ability to leave an impression on audiences by his presence alone. Even well into his 70s, you can tell Keaton is having the time of his life fighting through hordes of enemies and piloting those signature Bat vehicles the same way he did over 30 years ago. All of this was cleverly punctuated by the film's musical score using the original Danny Elfman theme whenever a scene called for it. If there were ever an appropriate way to pay homage to this beloved incarnation of an iconic hero, then this film does so with a resounding sense of accomplishment.After a decade since its debut, it's kind of sad that the DCEU isn't receiving as much celebratory fanfare as their competitors at Marvel. The inconsistent quality of their films means that some of their best work will likely be brushed under the carpet and forgotten about along with the rest. This is exacerbated by the fact that the entire universe is going to soft-rebooted in a matter of time, which will make these films pretty much null and void. I can only hope that upon viewing ""The Flash"", others will see that all is not lost and that the franchise is still capable of fantastic things. However, in order for that to happen, all I can do at this point is recommend it to as many people as possible, even if you are only a casual fan of DC.I rate it a solid 9/10.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

No, literally, this week we were able to see DC Comics/Entertainments, The Flash. Long believed to be called Flashpoint but if you know you know what the movie is going to be about. The fastest man on the planet Barry Allen/The Flash uses his super speed to change the past, but his attempt to save his family creates a world without the superheroes he's come to know, which then forces him to race for his life to save the past and future he knows. Fast and Flash things ensue. Let's see how it goes.This movie is one of those conundrums. It's been made in a DC universe that has underachieved a lot so now it feels like with new management they want the movie to make up for all of their past wrongs. Now, The Flash is a solidly entertaining movie. There are some nice action sequences that are hard-hitting and true to the characters many have come to love. The storyline has a few really touching moments that keep the viewer on a roller coaster of emotions.Like the MCU, this movie is throwing in a bunch of cameos from very recognizable faces but not in a throw away manner, which is slightly cool. The biggest one is not a surprise - good old Bruce Wayne played by Michael Keaton. Keaton along with the others does a valiant effort reprising his almost thirty-year-old role. Anyway, seeing these worlds collide with the Ezra's Flash was interesting and a nice touch even though this version of the Flash seems to fit a bit better with the cornier Mr. Freeze Batman franchise. Nevertheless, this leads to the most annoying parts of the movie. Both versions of Barry/The Flash played by Ezra Miller are a bit too annoying and corny even for the Flash. They definitely should've tapered that writing back to be more like the Grant Gustin Flash. I just wanted to shout out my guy Gustin because my show is ending *cries*. Anyway, the story feels a bit forced rather than organic and when that occurs the movie felt a bit predictable. Even in that, the movie was still watchable, especially once you get to the action sequences, which it does take a while to get to.Ultimately, The Flash isn't the greatest movie, but the way DC operates this feels like a vast improvement. The Flash is one of those movies where you have to see it on the big screen to get the full effect but eventually, you'll be watching this on Sunday afternoons on FX for sure. There is a good amount of action, cameos, corny humor, sentimental moments and etc. That keeps a viewer watching for 2 hours but is it perfect, nope. Grab a big box of popcorn for the Flash.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first impression of The Flash is that it has some good jokes that I could not resist to laugh. The comedy was good that made it a action-packed, but also a funny DC film. The cinematography and acting was great to seeing The Flash with two Barry Allen's (Ezra Miller), Super-Girl (Sasha Calle), and two Batmans (Ben Afleck/ Michael Keaton) all in action against fighting crime and General Zod (Micheal Shannon) with his army. Kudos to Michael Keaton still playing the role with his great acting in this new addition. I am glad to see what more of The Flash can do in his own movie of what he can do with his powers. Also, this made me more emotional because it involves Allen Barry's family. Director Andres Muschietti made sure that this superhero entry is going to be a memorable one with surprising cameos. It is simply a great addition to the DCU with its cinematography, action, acting, and comedy. I would recommend watching The Flash in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

But later when Barry realises that he can actually fix things that's when this movie gets Interesting, A FEW CGI SCENES AREN'T WELL POLISHED(That's because the movie studios push CGI companies on the lease of time)Besides that I enjoyed watching it, it feels more like a new age DC movie with a few OG characters and also a few pop culture refrences that only OG Hollywood fans knows. At a point it also makes fun of Marvel's multiverse theory, but static 'Time doesn't work that way'. It's an entertaining watchVery good for casual viewing.(Climax could've been better)

Rave reviews from advanced screenings at Cinemacon, celebrities such as James Gunn, Tom Cruise and Stephen King full of praise for the film.But the truth is it's not even the best superhero movie released this year! That accolade belongs to Across the Spider-Verse. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Not by a long shot! There are problems, for sure. Most notably the CGI, which is rough, to say the least, in a number of scenes.There are plenty of positives, though. The smart script, appropriately fast pacing, creative directing and, perhaps most of all, the humor! The zany, almost Looney Tunes-esque nature of the visual gags was a pleasant surprise, catching me totally off guard. Those gags, which start especially when the younger Barry comes into the fold, prompted a few laugh out loud moments in my theater.Speaking of Barry, the troubled Ezra Miller shows great range playing two wildly different yet strangely similar parts. Michael Keaton brings an unexpected levity to his Batman, while Sasha Calle shows why she's a rising star by bringing remarkable intensity to her Supergirl.To put it plainly, The Flash is not as great as everyone was saying. What it is though is a fun, funny and entertaining adventure that makes 144 minutes fly by. It has not only visually but intrinsically a cartoonish nature, especially evident in its (great!) opening, that reminded me of the amazing Justice League Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold cartoons.P. S.: Keep your eyes peeled for the more than special cameos, especially if you're a big DC movie history buff like I am. Try to avoid spoilers (I wasn't so lucky), as that will make everything all that more surprising. Stay until the very end for the (only) post credits scene.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

By 13 minutes in, you'll be wondering if you should even continue watching.This isn't a serious film, not even close. It is parts slapstick and just plain old stupid parading around as if it were actually comedy. It is no wonder that none of the actors will be sticking around for any further movies in the various franchise films - they don't want to ruin their reputations any further. I really felt bad for Gal's initial reveal and how Ben's Batman was presented at the start.The next issue is that the story is far from original. Sure, that is to be expected with comic book adaptations, but in this instance they're doing an adaptation that was already done better by the TV show.Then, what was worse than the script and story choice - the CGI. This was barely television level, not multimillion-dollar level CGI. I felt like this was all done during COVID and all they could get was the D crew to work on it, not the A or B teams.Sure, the film picks up a bit later on, but by then the damage is done. And it seriously isn't that much of an improvement. You can't take it seriously. The script is crap, the actors just phoned it in because they knew the story was crap and they weren't returning. The visuals and effects were crap...everything was crap.I'm being generous with three stars, but I'm sure the 12 and under crowd loved it. I'm also sure that the studio hired a company to pad the reviews, because this simply isn't a quality movie in any sense of the word.What a sad end to this leg of the franchise, all because DC couldn't pull it together after so many attempts.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Watched in IMAXSynopsis:
The Flash is DC's latest and highly anticipated film that features Barry Allen/The Flash (played by Ezra Miller) who revisits his past in a wish to fix both the past and present and to search of his childhood that was stripped away from him. This forces our protagonist to also visit the past of other universes and discover his own multiverse journey within his own past journey that he allowed himself into.The film kicks off with a sequence that is simply the weakest in terms of the action and more importantly in terms of the CGI that will leave the audience in a state of boredom towards what's upcoming as well as how visually annoying and ugly it is. However and surprisingly, what followed after is the opposite as the film (and until the end) was able to hold itself in terms of having a very solid story with a bit of drama that increases towards the end.Any action sequence is filmed in a way that will simply keep the audience engaging and entertained. As well as the concept and the way that the film presented the multiverse or travailing in time in terms of how do get to it, what are the consequences of it (both positives and negative ones), and the reason of why our protagonist is forced to discover it is simply very convincing and reasonable and is being presented in THE BEST way comparing to any other film that presented the concept of the ""multiverse"" and ""travel in time"" like Spider Man No Way Home (2021) or Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022).All of this is mixed up with heavy drama sequences that will genuinely touch audiences' hearts especially towards the end. Also, mixed with a bit of comedy that is not cheap or cheesy.Towards the end (and for those who watched the film will understand that) there is a sequence that is suppose to be an easy one to comprehend but it was the opposite and that's due to the weak script that it had. It is very complicated (even tho it's shouldn't be) to understand and it is suppose to be the scene that will connect any missing pieces together and connect all the dots together. Despite one particular scene that one character is explaining to another about what is the multiverse and how it works which is a more complected thing. However, the simplicity in explaining it by using some ""spaghetti"" is what made that scene creative and easy to understand.*Despite whatever Ezra Miller has done outside of acting in terms of crimes, bad reputation, or assaults. Etc. This review will ONLY be discussing Miller's performance within the film itself and THAT IS IT.*
Ezra Miller has successfully proven himself as a phenomenal and perfect actor for the role of Barry Alleen specifically. The film's story was able to discuss two different versions of Barry Allen, an older one, and a younger one, each with more complicated backstories and completely different responsibilities and purposes in life that help to shape their personalities and determine their actions. In that case, the story handled this very well in terms of the sequences and the writing of each one. More importantly, Ezra Millar had a huge role in achieving all of that.Ben Affleck returns yet once again as Batman. However, his presence was barely there as it felt like he was a cameo. On the other hand, Michael Keaton returns as Batman from the 80s Batman films. Meanwhile everyone expected him to appear as a cameo, he surprisingly was not as he appeared in a big portion of the film and had a very enough screen time that made him a supporting actor as well as close of being a lead actor next to Ezra Miller. Keaton was the star of the film. After decades, this man was able to play the role again more than perfectly.The Flash presented SuperGirl for the first time played by Sasha Calle which turned out to be a successful attempt to a certain limit though. The character's presence is great but the character's use in terms of supporting the story, did not add much unfortunately except for the scenes that are related to her own world and where she come from which is specifically towards the ending of the film. Therefore, towards the whole film, there is no enough deep connection that will allow any audience members to create a bond or feel something towards that character. But, Sasha played the role very well and would love to see her step in that role again in future projects.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, when Barry's attempt to modify the past unintentionally changes the future, he finds himself caught in a version of events where General Zod has made a comeback. The only people who can stop him are a retired Batman, a Kryptonian who is locked up, and a different version of himself.The Scarlet Speedster's big-screen solo debut has finally happened, and it's everything I hoped it would be: enjoyable, touching, exciting, and even novel. Although Andy Muschietti has never before helmed a superhero or action film, he certainly understands how to direct a scene. He has the talent, and I can't wait to see what he does next. Because this is the superhero movie I've been most looking forward to all year, my eagerness paid off. The true heart of this film is in Barry's character arc; meeting his younger self forces him to face his loss of his mother and his own maturation at the film's conclusion. Ezra Miller is unquestionably skilled and displayed their acting versatility by playing two versions of the character that have separate personalities from each other, despite all the ongoing controversies that still surround him. Miller's portrayal of this incarnation of the Fastest Man Alive demonstrates once more that the actor is still qualified for the role.Even if this is his final appearance as the Caped Crusader, he definitely reminded me in that powerful opening sequence of how badass he was and still is, so it pains me that we might never have the chance to witness Batfleck kicking arse in his solo movie. If this is actually Michael Keaton's final performance, he will unquestionably leave an imprint on the hearts of both his longtime and new fans. I won't say much more about Sasha Calle's Supergirl because I think she did an excellent job. It's hilarious how rough the film appears for a film with a budget of about $200 million and a lot of CGI. Some scenes are excellent, but others are just hilariously poor. Although a little overwhelming, the third act is shockingly fantastic.The Flash is a large-scale, ambitious time-travel epic that rewards its viewers with surpising cameos. Whether you agree or not, The Flash is among the most effective DCEU films in recent memory.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Too much reliance on (very bad) CGI, weak character development, obvious plotline, and a transparently desperate attempt to homage the past.This movie was not a buzz... it flatlined. The storyline was obvious, alternate timeline characters were annoying, and I felt no emotional connection to the movie whatsoever. The 'multiverse' idea was not cleverly applied; it felt dumb and incoherent.I was hoping this installment could be a good transition to the new phase of the DC universe, but it was far too self-indulgent. It felt like one long, cheap, gimmick; not a finely crafted heroic epic that created pathos for the lead character and would go further to making the Flash into a core DC character.The jokes weren't funny.The homage was too unsubtle; it was uncool.The plot was predictable.The characters weren't realistically developed.The CGI seemed blatant and over-relied upon.There was no real drama or tension.Overall, I felt the movie failed for trying too hard. It lacked any spark of excellence; fading rapidly into mediocrity as the minutes passed. It lacked substance and gravitas; but didn't compensate with effective humor or sentiment. I felt bored, regularly throughout the movie. It created only disinterest.I find it mystifying how DC have failed so many times to produce worthy movies. They have an excellent cast... and awesome source material. Why can't they just get it right on the big screen?","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I mean it's not going to win any awards for legendary cinema, but as a popcorn superhero movie with some cackle-inducing one-liners, surprising emotional moments (well, one in particular that had my eyes welling up), and a lot of nostalgia and DC film-nerd Easter eggs, it is well worth seeing in a cinema.All the performances hit their mark, and just having Michael Keaton back as the main Batman brought a smile to my face. The special-effects are nothing to write home about in 2023, but overall it's a surprisingly heart-felt finale to the Snyder-verse.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Loved the plot and the characters the acting was also very well done too. I would've given this movie higher rating if it weren't for the terrible CGI. I know the director said that the CGI was bad on purpose but I can't help but think that 90% of this movie was CGI and half of it wasn't even bad but the half that is bad is just terrible. I'd rather you just not CGI the unnecessary bits at that point since nobody really said they wanted to see ""flash's perspective"". Also I wanna add that I loved Michael Keaton's performance in this film however I just can't get over how it would've been ground breaking for them to have Thomas Wayne instead of Keaton's batman. Or even Bale's batman. Missed opportunity IMO but oh well. Ezra miller's acting in this movie was also done very well and I can see that he's a really good actor. Sucks that he caused the commotion he did in real life because he's a good flash.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Big Budget movies seem to lack brains and ability to create a coherent experience that should touch all the senses, good visuals, good story, good soundtrack. Silence would have been better than trumpets blasting your face off during each action sequence. The cameos did exactly as expected, made what would have been an okay movie, worse. Best thing about this movie... Keaton? Not exactly, but didnt take anything from it at least. Overall this movie was okay, predictable and could have been a lot better. As it is, I dont enjoy having trumpets and over the top string orchestra blasting at me for 3 hours.

A very good story, the right amount of humor mixed with action mixed with drama, likable characters, and a storyline that doesn't make you look at your watch. The story was deep enough that I didn't get bored, but not so deep that it became distracting from the movie itself. The criticisms of the CGI can't be argued, but I would take more frequent movies like this with mediocre CGI over fewer movies with flawless CGI that doesn't change anything besides the aesthetics.I know Miller has his own issues. It is unfortunate that the events that unfolded for him is what was necessary for him to get the help he needed. I don't judge most actors. If I did, I probably wouldn't have anything to watch. Ezra Miller is a wonderful actor who was a huge part in making this movie as good as it is.It's too bad this iteration of the Flash is ending in our timeline.

It is crazy that it took this long for him to have a live-action movie. Unfortunately, the DCEU Flash movie went through development hell. It had multiple directors leave the project, multiple delays, multiple reshoots, the Ezra controversy, and constant changes in leadership at WB. Despite all these shenanigans, does this movie manage to deliver a great Flash movie?Firstly, they do deliver some strong and emotional moments. It's hard to be angry at Flash for wanting to save his mother and prove his Dad innocent. Seeing Flash cope with the unintended butterfly effects of going back in time and saving his mother, is a great concept. Barry's desperation to save this timeline because his mother still lives is powerful stuff. It has a heartfelt story of grief which I liked. Funny enough, Ezra has great chemistry with himself. Ezra plays the original and new timeline Barry who both interact with each other throughout the movie. I like the contrast between a slightly more mature and serious original Barry compared to the younger whiny new Barry. There are some genuinely funny moments between the two. I am also impressed by how convincingly they made it seem like there were 2 Ezras on set.One of the biggest selling points of this movie is Michael Keaton's return as Batman. It is great seeing him again even though his performance can feel a bit stiff and wooden. I was worried about how they could convince me that a 70-year-old Batman would still be capable of fighting. However, the action scenes with him are awesome and very enjoyable. Ben Affleck also returns as DCEU Batman for 1 last time. He is not in it for long but he is good as well. His action scenes are pretty entertaining and his scene with Barry is a highlight. The music score by Benjamin Wallfisch is wonderful and I love how he incorporates the classic Danny Elfman Batman theme. The greatest part though is Sasha Calle as Supergirl. She is terrific despite not being in it for long. I also think the costume team nailed the Michael Keaton Batsuits and the Supergirl suit as they both look exceptional!Unfortunately, the Ben Affleck Batsuit looks terrible. It is ugly and doesn't even feel like a proper Batsuit. Likewise, the Flash suit just doesn't look great. It looks too polished and very plastic looking. There are scenes where it looks like a guy in a giant red condom rather than a proper superhero suit. On that note, I am very mixed about Ezra Miller as Flash. He was all right in Zack Snyder's Justice League as he was more of a supporting role with a better script. However, his performance in this film comes off as way more obnoxious and annoying. It doesn't help that new timeline Barry is meant to be annoying on purpose but the result is both Barry's are infuriating. He does deliver during the more emotional moments but at other times, not so much.I am also very disappointed in the action scenes with the 'Flash'. While the Batman action is awesome, the action scenes with Flash are just not that satisfying. They are bland to look at, especially when compared to speedster scenes from X-Men and even Avengers. The 3rd act in this movie is a little overwhelming with the amount of things going on. There are some things concerning the multiverse that occurs as well but feels kind of contradictory to the rules set. I also find the ending terrible and contradicts the whole message of the movie. Additionally, they do something in the ending that raises more questions than answers and feels a little dumb if they are rebooting the universe. My major gripe though, is the atrociously bad CGI. A lot of the shots in this film look very ugly thanks to poor CGI. Some scenes look like it is straight out of a video game than a movie. They also use it to recreate people's likeness including dead people and it is disgusting to look at.Overall, what a massive disappointment this ended up being. You can see some element of great in it but it is all overshadowed by the bad. It is sad to see how poor the last couple of entries in the old DCEU are. It makes me more appreciative of James Gunn rebooting the DCEU. We still have 1 proper DCEU movie left with Aquaman 2 but my hopes aren't high.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This witty and warm buddy comedy stands out among other DC movies, thanks to its strong lead performance.Although the film follows a predictable time-travel storyline, it still offers solid entertainment throughout. It is refreshing to see a DC movie with a compelling main character, which has often been lacking in previous films.""The Flash"" is undoubtedly the standout film from the recent collaboration between Warner Bros. And DC. It embraces its love for the comic books that inspired it, resulting in a funny, action-packed, and emotionally resonant experience. Fans of the DC heroes should not miss this opportunity and should rush to see it.While I understand that some may criticize the movie for relying too much on nostalgia without presenting an original or thrilling story, I found it enjoyable and engaging. It does an admirable job of keeping the momentum going despite its lengthy runtime of 2 hours and 25 minutes.Certainly, the film's storyline can become messy due to the inclusion of multiple cameos and a rushed introduction of Sasha Calle as Supergirl. However, I appreciate how it embraces Michael Keaton's iconic portrayal of Batman and channels the same energy with a ""let's get nuts"" approach.Overall, ""The Flash"" is a delightful and entertaining superhero movie that successfully captures the essence of its source material. It may not be entirely groundbreaking, but it offers a fun and enjoyable experience for fans and general audiences alike.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

But it's ok as every Hollywood actor gets a big paycheck for being in the film for five minutes of work.The Flash is DC's latest entry, who have been on a hot streak just recently with The Batman, Peacemaker and even Black Adam. Being entertaining and fresh. Personally, I would say that they are on top of the food chain within Marvel's recent films. The decision to show The Flash to 'critics' months before it's release was a positive sign that Warner Bros had a hit on their hands.This was the most painful movie experience so far this year, this felt like an early 2000's comic book film. The acting was very over the top, which Ezra Miller's Flash was guilty of doing multiple times. Story wise I was disinterested so much I stopped caring half way through. As for the CGI, my word, $220 million dollars was the budget. What did they spend it on? Seriously, I thought I was watching a fan made film during parts of the movie.My only highlight is most definitely the return of Micheal Keaton's Batman, he did his best for what he was given. This will only satisfy fans who grew up with Keaton's movies in the late 80's.In conclusion, The Flash was a classic example of how you overspend on the cast. There was a mishmash of terrible special effects, a poor script. This emphasises that you should never trust what you read on social media.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Such a caliber actor with a natural ability to play a character with so much depth as Batman. Sasha Calle was a badass playing Supergirl. I wish she had more opportunities to play her before now. Ezra Miller plays an okay Flash. He doesn't represent the character from the comics very well, but I know everyone is allowed to have their own interpretation. Sure he has his odd stuff happening personally, but I didn't let that interfere with me wanting to see this movie. I mean, Tom Cruise is the same way yet everyone LOVED his movie last year regardless. All in all, a great enjoyable movie that I think anyone would enjoy..especially when Michael Keaton shows up.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Flash does not come off as a hero in any way. I can't say that I liked this movie very much. The whole thing left me with a bad feeling and I'm glad that I didn't take my kids with me.

The story was somewhat engaging, but of course the end result is a half hour too long, as per usual for comic book movies these days, especially in the DC Extended Universe.Ezra Miller in either of his roles is grating. He showed so much promise in We Need To Talk About Kevin (2011). He can be a very good dramatic actor (although he hasn't shown much evidence of that in subsequent roles) but as Flash it's quite clear that he's not a comedic actor.It's fun to see Michael Keaton back in the cowl. I really liked him as Batman back in the day, but he more or less sleepwalks through this movie. Sasha Calle as Supergirl isn't onscreen that long, but the little that she does is fine.For a $200+ million dollar movie the effects are at times astoundingly bad. It's like Warner Brothers could tell they had a dud on their hands, threw up their hands and said ""good enough, we're not throwing good money after bad"".An OK two and a half hours (although I kept looking at my watch in the second half) but not something I'll bother watching again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story sounds okay in trailer but had awesome execution.The camera movement along with the people was also great. It also had some time travel aspects to understand so from nowhere it felt like a kiddish movie. The Batman was clever as usual.Now that I think about it this is maybe this has one of the best action sequences I have ever seen in a DC movie.It just makes you say wow. I would have given 9 but some scenes felt normal for some reason.A must watch overall though.It's surely above average and clearly worth a greater rating. Do watch it in a good format.

Come and see this movie and you'll know exactly what I was complaining about.I liked it. It had great characters, and great acting (one is the result of the other). I mean - I loved Ezra Miller whenever I saw him/them on screen. Sasha Calle is giving a great debut performance and Michael Keaton finally gets to be a real Batman. If only Tim Burton gave him a real chance to act back in the days. That means the writers of this movie know their job. Only problem is, it seems to me like they spent too much energy on writing the characters and didn't have enough left in their tanks when they reached the plot.I'll admit, the entire idea of time loops has been milked by sci-fi to the bone. So, going there was doomed from the start if you ask me, even with all the nice Back to the Future jokes. But Back to the Future said - your destiny is yours to determine, while this one goes back to the lazy old fatalistic cliche. And then, they commit an even bigger sin in my personal book by allowing their heroes to reach a literal dead end. I said it before: in the world of comics if a superhero has to die - someone wrote it wrong and chose the easy way out.This should've been a real great movie, but it fell short when it really counted. For me, that's a pity.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Instead I found myself bored after 30 minutes of the movie, leaving another 2 hours of mind numbingly boring nothingness left to watch.The film's one saving grace, was seeing Michael Keaton don the batsuit one last(?) time accompanied by Danny Elfman's classic Batman theme, but even this was not enough to save the film.The pacing was all over the place, the character development (especially of Supergirl) was practically non-existent and most importantly, Ezra Miller was just not up to the task leaning more towards annoying than anything else. The only moments of any real emotion, were those featuring Barry's mum and soley because of her ability as an actor alone.The film was also massively hindered by the subpar CGI, which was so jarring it took you right out of the movie (Christopher Reeve deserved better). It was like Superman's moustache, but everywhere!!I don't hold out much hope for the new DCU if James Gunn thinks this film is soooo amazing that not only does he praise it at every opportunity, but he then hires the film's, clearly out of his depth, director to helm the first Batman movie of his new superhero world. I just hope to God they manage to surprise me with something truly entertaining, but at this point it may be too late in the game for anyone to care about yet another superhero movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

First of all: Flash is a good fanservice movie, but kinda spoiled by bad graphics. Assuming that it was in a producrion hell, it is a big surprise that we got this work, yes, quite standard, but full of respect and love to DC and it's films and fans. If you think something like 6/10(assuming if this movie have ever had good graphics) isn't enough(for blockbuster), you just check my ratings, you will be terrified about other movie ratings, telling ya. Ezra's acting keeps us entertained during the whole movie, this is yeat another thing worth mentioning. The best part of this film is though it is quite light and undemanding it constantly shows you something that makes your sad face create and keep broad smile. Gosh, it was the first time in my 18!! Movies and series where i had fun! P. S. Are we really done here? After all of this? No more Man of Steel, no more Cavil? No more this Flash, that was drawing attention even in 2017 JL and blasts now? No more Affleck? No more best Bats? No more Dawn of Justice UE development(cause it os really unrivaled among the best comics movies and it is in reality a cinematographic masterpiece) Though i disliked ZS JL, i think we can surely give a shot to a guy that filmed Dawn of Justice. Yeah, i think that Wonder Woman movies are disgusting, that Aquaman's only place in the trash, but for example first SS(as well as Birds of Prey) was kinda average movie, that somehow was disliked by the audience, the second one was kinda entertaining. First Shazam was not that bad, though failed in the end, Black Adam would not be that bad if not the ending. Man of steel was OK the visual adventure. So it is something that we could work with, right? Cut worst parts, or remake them? It would be so sad, to end this after such a good example how through all the difficulties you can combine parts, actors, approaches and universes so different in a good film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Flash has always been my favorite. This movie IS NOWHERE NEAR as horrific as the reviews on social media. Let's be clear, Ezra Miller's ""external"" antic's do NOT help this film. HOWEVER, the film itself is a solid comic book film, he does a good job as Barry Allen. All the hype about Michael Keaton is overblown, he has a small part, a lot more than a cameo, and he does a great job. To this day I have no idea why they just didn't allow Grant Gustin to go ahead and play this movie version, on the TV Series he has done a fantastic job, and I think he would of done well in this film.

This is easily one of the worst films in the last decade. The acting is meh, the character they made the Flash is pathetic, the effects aren't up to video game cut scene quality. Frankly, the only worse film I have seen lately is... well, most of the rest of the DCU. This is just sad. The multiverse concept is not thought out, explained, or even coherent. The closest they come to a saving grace is Keaton, and he spends so much time as a poorly animated rag doll that even he can't help the film.Is this what movies have been reduced to? Is this the level of incoherent schlock we have to look forward to? And worse, have all of you lowered your taste to the point that this earns stars from you?

This movie made me do that, for a not so good reason.The first 20 minutes in this movie are cringe inducing. From the attempted comedy (which it miserably fails at) to the atrocious CGI, to the competition about who can be most annoying person in the movie. Ezra Miller is not a good actor, nor is he anything close to funny. He literally spends the movie figuring out new ways on how to be even more annoying than the previous moments.Once Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle finally get introduced the movie picks up somewhat, but that's like an hour in. I almost shut the movie off several times before this. It's no way near as interesting as I thought it would be, and it was more of a how-long-can-you-take-the-cringe fest throughout this movie.Positives:
+ Michael Keaton, he's good in virtually anything you put him in, the same was the case here.+ Sasha Calle, she was a good supergirl. (I was sceptical from the trailers but she can at least act, unlike certain others in this movie)
+ Some decent action and fight scenes.That's about it.Negatives: Oh boy, where do I start....
I could go on and rant some more, but it's kind of pointless. If you watch this movie, turn your brain off and try to not use logic because it will just make you mad.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Just not very uphill. The middle section seemed like it went on for hours, and most of it could've been cut without losing much of anything important. The ending went on for too long and didn't focus enough on the stuff that mattered. The grocery store scene at the end was probably the best part although it still had Ezra Miller so I couldn't fully appreciate it having to see his face. The entire part with the multiverse collapsing was so out of place and every cameo was thrown in for no reason.Ezra Miller (ignoring how he is IRL) gives an annoying and basic performance(s), and honestly this would've been better played by almost any other actor. Michael Keaton was one of my favorite parts of this, but even his performance is far from his best.The writing, while okay at times, is extremely cheesy and poorly done. The direction is bland and boring. Worst of all, the CGI. Despite what Andy Muschietti may say, the CGI, not in certain parts, but throughout the entire movie was unforgivable. Starting awfully with the CGI babies and staying at that level of horrible for the rest of the film with few moments that looked even okay by VFX standards.Overall The Flash is one giant convoluted mess with a few moments of redemption, mostly ruined by Ezra Millers existence.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I enjoyed every single moment - and really loved the action packed, story driven but yet emotional story. DC films can be very hit and miss - but this is a very.

This is the kind of comic book movie I always wanted to see. The use of the multiverse setting is seamless and very watchable. It makes me very sad that the DCEU has ended, just because of that. I'd like a sequel to be made in the same way as the Snyder Cut. (I really want to see Wonder Woman 3 too btw.) The situation where a massive disaster is caused by the sheer desire to see one's mother would probably only resonate with those who have lost their mother or a loved one. I personally really liked the interactions between the slightly different personalities of Barry(am I spelling the name right?) and Barry from different timelines, so I found it enjoyable.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

When you really think the details that stand behind, all of the narratives within the DC superhero and origin story movies have true potential, and it doesn't matter whether they're labeled as comedies or dramas, or related to DC or Marvel comics. But it feels so rare to see these concepts executed to their fullest, The Flash being an example.When Barry Allen decides to use his super speed to travel back in time and change his unfortunate childhood, his attempt to prevent his mother's death and ultimately save his family traps him in an alternate world without superheroes, forcing him to confront his past and save the future. Although extremely entertaining and paced like lightning, there is no doubt that this movie is far from perfection. Some of the CGI work will really bother the critics and audiences who pay attention to special details in the effects. In addition, some will find it bothersome that characters like Batman, Supergirl and a Barry Allen from an alternate universe get to take up a lot of elements in the Flash's story.To save discussing the film's strengths after the criticisms so we can leave off on a positive note however, the chunks of runtime in which we spend time around the other superheroes all feel like they fit neatly into the story. Batman, Supergirl and an alternate universe's Barry Allen each have necessary roles to play in the story, without feeling forced or overshadowing the main character's story. The performances are also magnetic from beginning to end. Despite the controversies and trouble he's been involved in during the past few years, Ezra Miller is very good in both his struggling role as Barry and his annoying alternate-universe role as the same person but with a completely different life.It's also an absolute blast to see Michael Keaton back as the Batman in this day and age, and Sasha Calle is also pretty good inhabiting Supergirl, although she doesn't have as much of a role in the movie as the Batman. What's equally as impressive as the talents in front of the camera is Andy Muschietti's exquisite work behind the camera. His direction is pretty much spotless in this movie, which makes the sometimes-poor CGI forgivable. And the action throughout The Flash deserves it's own discussion, it's just so exciting and fun to watch at the cinemas. Despite its cons, this is a big-deal cinema movie that will deserve its popularity, and we need to see more superhero movies that have enjoyable, well-crafted elements other than humour.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie has the potentiality to gain very high Hight but It was a digester.Now a days, there are many movie try to promoting and force fully want to see us feminist's thought but this think is not related to that movie. So as a result , may potential movies like Thor: love and thunders, Eternals, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness many other and this movie are become very bad and not wroth to watch.Movie should be natural which is connected to our thought and mind. If this think are continue many potential movies like this will be digester.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Not to be judging the book by it's cover and you know what? I was wrong and the movie actually sucked big time.Ands i won't start talking about the absolutely horrible CGI because that by itself is enough to make you walk out of the theatre. The story was bad. The acting wasn't that good and the action scenes was childish and empty.Not to mention the horrible cameos, i mean Nick cage's Superman ? Really ! You're doing a cameo for a movie that didn't even happened ? How lost and out of ideas are you seriously ?I hope DC and WB find their way back and start making good movies again because the way doesn't look bright anymore.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","My Eyes Hurt From the CGI So Much That I Remembered All of Ezra Miller's Crimes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9200117/?ref_=tt_urv","MamadNobari97","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45507551/?ref_=tt_urv","18 July 2023","I'm sorry, but if your superhero movie is relied heavily on CGI for like 85% of the movie and most (noticeable) of them are humans, I expect the CGI to be at least somewhat negligible. This was just plain awful. How is the director not embarrassed to have released this atrocious-looking movie? And not only that, why do they have to slow-motion on every single terrible CG scene? Are they that proud of this abomination that they intentionally keep showing it in slow-motion?Even if this movie had the best plot and acting ever, the CGI still would've made me rate it lower. Live-action movies are supposed to have real human actors interacting with each other and things to look realistic. But this? This is just on a whole new level. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with much CGI and it being this horrible. Even Quantumania which looked like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, still looked more realistic and practical than this. Like I understand there are two Ezras here, but they seriously couldn't have a stand-in and then digitally put Ezra's face on him? They really had to make up a whole CGI monstrosity for him and every scene in the movie? They even replay scenes that happened at the beginning of the movie, but they have reconstructed the whole scene with CGI and it looks horrible. I understand that they need to make a 3D version of it for the 360s, but honestly, if they just composited the real scene, I bet it would've still looked better.Moving on from the CGI, which I could rant about all day, the movie itself is not that horrible but not good either. It's entertaining enough but it's still meh. It's not the worst superhero movie of the year and it's definitely not the worst DC movie of the year.The plot is loosely based on the Flashpoint comic, which I have only seen the animated movie of. But the movie is more focused on throwing in cameos after cameos, which some particular ones have CGI worse than video games from 8 years ago.The movie actually starts pretty well but becomes nonsensical by the minute, and there should be a feeling of progression from the second act, but by the end, you realize that it was all just a bunch of cameo fest to pad the runtime, nothing of a value was added to the plot.They say a hero is only as good as his villain. Well, I looked and I could not find a villain. Unless they mean the one that comes at the end of the movie. If we consider Zod as the villain, he doesn't even show up for like 1:50:00 hours into the movie. Even Thanos in Endgame had some scenes before showing up for the final battle.They literally have one of the most complex and interesting comic book storylines at hand and they decide to not include even half of its interesting aspects into it. Thomas Wayne who is a hundred times more interesting than an old actor's nostalgia bait cameo? Nah, who cares about interesting characters. Wonder Woman and Aquaman who have the potential to be evil in the new timeline to raise the stakes higher? Nah, just throw them in for a minute or two as cameos, can't afford them for the full movie and can't afford good writers to implement them into the story. So this is really disappointing aspect of the storytelling of this.Then we have the characters, and even Flash himself has a really bare-bones characterization, and as much as Ezra Miller tries hard to act really well, you as the audience don't really get emotionally attached to his character. So there aren't really emotional attachments here and it's like ""eh"", except for some scenes with his mother. So it's no wonder that you don't care about Bruce Wayne or Supergirl either. Supergirl's character especially is handled really disappointingly and is basically just there to fight ad nothing more. I don't know how this movie manages to be 2:24 hours and have near to zero characterization for the supporting cast.It makes sense for the filmmakers here to have Michael Keaton's Batman in this story. But he just basically does everything Thomas Wayne did in Flashpoint minus all his interesting characterization and his stake and motive in helping Barry.The middle and the end of the movie are just pure nonsense and horrible CGI scene after horrible CGI scene with terrible cameos just for the sake of cameos that it gets exhausting by the end. It's like they decided they wanted to have all of these cameos first and then they said ""hmm, let's check Flashpoint and see how we can construct a plot around these cameos"".Now I've ranted a lot about the negatives, but I didn't hate hate this movie, I just didn't care for it that much.Some things I liked are firstly that I thought it was a decent idea that they decided to show Flash's origin story through the second Barry instead of the main Barry.Some scenes and lines were actually funny too, though some were really cringey and Barry was written as a 12-year-old instead of an 18-year-old. I also have to say that a movie making you laugh occasionally doesn't mean it's good.I also liked that they didn't really hold back from showing the different powers Barry has and how powerful he truly is.I also like bits and pieces of the story but it's all taken from Flashpoint anyway and they just reminded me of a way better Flash movie called Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox. I should go rewatch that to remember how good the story actually is.I liked some Batman action scenes too but I already forgot about all of them anyway.But I guess that's all the compliments I can give to it.The movie is also one of the worst and most pointless post-credit scenes I've ever seen that could rival some of the worst of MCU's. Even MCU ones have some point to them or they tease the next movie. This was just another excuse to have a cameo, as if this movie needed more.The movie also has nothing to say or change about the current DCEU timelines and it's just confusing how they're gonna move forward with the new movies. Not having this movie really reset the universe makes it more pointless to watch since it can barely stand on its own. Though I guess that weird ending scene with the tooth thing is vaguely referring to a reset, but it's not clear.In conclusion, the problems are:Overall, the movie is just mediocre and forgettable, it's not super terrible but it's not good either. The only thing saving this movie is that the story, or at least some parts of it is based on Flashpoint. But it's still a decent watch otherwise.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Keaton tries to recreate Batman magic of the 90s and fails as the script doesn't give him anything to work upon, besides the rousing BGM from the 1989 Batman.To think that the bosses at DC saw this as their sure shot at box office / critical response glory is hilarious.

The story is exciting, full of twists, and strikes a perfect tone of fun and heart. Ezra Miller and the rest of the cast are perfectly cast in their roles. Miller brings a charming awkwardness to Barry Allen that wins you over. The other actors also deliver emotive and funny performances.However, the CGI in this movie is shockingly bad. The Flash's super-speed runs and action sequences look incredibly fake and cartoonish. Some scenes are downright cringeworthy. The visual effects fail to make The Flash's powers feel believable or cool. For a superhero film where the lead character's main power is super-speed, this is a massive flaw.If you can look past the terrible CGI, The Flash has the makings of a great superhero film. The story and characters do justice to the comics. But the CGI nearly spoils the whole movie and taints the experience. With a blockbuster budget, there's no excuse for such poor visual effects. I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars. If they had only spent more time polishing the CGI, this could have been a 5-star film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film exhibits strong technical aspects, with impressive visuals, well-crafted sets, and commendable special effects. However, it struggles to overcome its flaws in storytelling, character development, and overall execution.Visually, the movie is captivating. The use of CGI and visual effects creates stunning landscapes and mesmerizing action sequences that immerse the audience in the film's world. The attention to detail in the production design adds authenticity to the setting, providing a visually pleasing experience.The cast, comprising talented actors, delivers earnest performances. Despite their efforts, the characters lack depth and fail to elicit a strong emotional connection with the audience. The lead protagonist, in particular, lacks a compelling arc, leaving viewers disengaged from their journey.The film's storytelling is where it falters the most. The plot struggles to find coherence, jumping between various subplots without a seamless flow. As a result, the pacing feels uneven, and certain moments drag on without significant impact. The lack of clarity in character motivations and key plot points makes it challenging for viewers to invest in the story.The movie introduces intriguing supporting characters, but their potential remains largely untapped due to limited screen time and underdeveloped arcs. As a result, their contributions to the narrative feel superficial and fail to leave a lasting impression.The dialogue, though delivered competently, lacks the necessary depth to elevate the film's emotional moments. Attempts at humor fall flat, and the exchanges between characters often feel clichéd and uninspired.While the film touches on profound themes, it does so in a superficial manner, failing to explore them in depth and leaving the audience craving a more meaningful exploration of the central ideas.In conclusion, this movie showcases effort in production and features impressive visual elements, but it fails to deliver a cohesive and engaging narrative. Despite the dedication of the cast, the characters lack depth, and the storytelling struggles to find coherence. While it may appeal to some for its technical achievements, it ultimately falls short of being a truly captivating and impactful cinematic experience.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of all the superheroes, The Flash is the one that needs to be played by someone who's actually athletic. Why does he move in slow motion while sliding all over the place? In like every scene their is no motion blur effect making it appear like his arms and legs are moving extremely fast. The Incredibles and Eternals did it best. They make the fast characters feel fast. If The Flash ran like Extra Miller does in this movie he'd be the weakest superhero ever, like the running is worse than Twilight was. I literally can't get past it, it ruined the entire movie. Plus Ezra Miller is a horrible person who has always had the most annoying voice. I've hated him long before he went crazy, but even ignoring that the movie was a joke.Comedy?The film tries to be funny, or at least I think that was the goal because it didn't land at all. The first 10 minutes of the movie is about him being hungry. Idk when that trope became a staple of Flash, but it stupid and not even funny. Why would it funny? One of the most powerful superheroes in DC will die if he doesn't eat a Snickers. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Numerous scenes feel like TikTok level comedy.Visual Effects:
The visual effects weren't good. If the story is good, bad effects can be overlooked, but the writing wasn't good either. The effects aren't the worst ever, but it feels like videogame or CW level effects in many scenes. Characters are also usually associated with a color so its easy to recognize, but the effects colors change multiple times. I don't know if it was meant to mean something, or just an artistic decision. Also a weird visual mistake is why is young Barry taller then current Barry?Final Conclusion:
I can't go on, I'm getting too mad. The Flash was my favorite character as a kid and they turned him into a movie that feels like it was made for Kids YouTube. Only watch this if you have absolutely nothing else to do or watch.I'm still mad about the running. Just put him on a treadmill turned way up in front of a green screen. It could be so simple. Please.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had seen everything at the moment, I wanted something fun , something I could turn my brain off for two hours. This movie though, I was not happy. I felt ashamed for the writers , ashamed for Warner and how did Jim Gunn approve this?The visuals are disappointing. For a film that cost over 200 Million to produce, it felt like a Saturday morning kid's production. The actor who portrayed Barry and his younger self, are the worst casted characters I can recall recently. Young Barry is so annoying, but for some reason the producers choose to put him in 2/3 of this.The film starts off well, felt similar to Ant Man, but almost right away goes to this odd time travel plot to save Mom. Others have said the same thing, Michael Keaton was the only good save for this film. The only thing I thought as I watched this, how could an exec think this was ok to be released? Why does Warner have story problems on all DC projects of late? Like my title stated, I think both Disney and Warner need to put their superhero stories on hold for a couple years.This is a hard pass.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Pfff, they haven't understood technology, it's more like video game shots than film shots, their direct designers have a good handle on it compared to VFX, where it goes unnoticed...What holds the film together, perhaps, is the character's general story, which is quite nice, where we learn about a terrible trauma, and it revolves around that, but it's not grandiose either...You can see that they're trying to copy Marvel a lot, but .... they're not up to the task, especially in this film, which really isn't that great.But I'm glad Michael Keaton is back !!!!So if you have to choose between Fast & Furious and this, I think the choice is quickly made!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Fast. The editing doesn't help because the pauses are just a bit too long to make the conversations flow. But even before hand, the character didn't feel right. They turned the Flash into, well, an idiot. We get it: he's always hungry. We don't need 20 minutes of the same joke about him needing food. Or that he's the member of the Justice League who is cleaning up the messes of Batman. Funny? Sure. For a moment. But it drags.The good: Once Michael Keaton enters the movie it moves. The filmmakers and Miller should have studied Michael Keaton acting with Michael Keaton works (Multiplicity) because he's a comedic actor. The man is just fun to watch. Thankfully he's in the film for the remainder.More bad: the fight scenes. The filmmakers are trying to pull a page from Waititi's Thor. But it doesn't work when you try to have two Flashes who have known each other for a day working in perfect synch. It's forced. And dull.Further bad: Zod. Completely support what they were trying to do. But they failed bc Zod is a one note character who was even dull in Man of Steel. His return should have caused us to care about the destruction of the world. We don't. But this isn't because of Zod. This is because the filmmakers take so much time on attempting to draw humor from two Millers that they fail to bring a human connection to the audience to make us care if anyone survives.I literally cared about the dog in the beginning more than anyone else.If they cut 45 minutes of the movie, maybe it would have worked. But at 2.5 hours? Not at all.This was far from the 'best superhero movie made yet' and people claimed. It's far from even a competent movie at all.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

The film suffers from several shortcomings, including lackluster acting, unconvincing costumes, and noticeable instances of artificiality.One of the glaring issues lies in the acting performances. While Ezra Miller tries to infuse energy and charm into the role of Barry Allen, his portrayal falls flat at times. The delivery feels forced, and the emotional depth often fails to resonate, leaving the character feeling one-dimensional. The supporting cast doesn't fare much better, with underdeveloped characters and performances that fail to leave a lasting impression.Another drawback is the quality of the costumes. While superhero films often rely on elaborate costumes to bring characters to life, ""The Flash"" disappoints in this aspect. The costumes appear cheap and unrealistic, lacking the detail and craftsmanship expected from a big-budget production. This detracts from the immersion and diminishes the impact of the superhero's iconic appearance.Furthermore, the film struggles with its visual effects. While some sequences showcase impressive CGI, there are instances where the artificiality becomes glaringly apparent. The lack of seamless integration between live-action and CGI elements further emphasizes the film's shortcomings in this regard, undermining the overall believability of the world and its characters.Despite these flaws, ""The Flash"" attempts to maintain an engaging plot. However, it stumbles due to convoluted storytelling and a lack of clear narrative focus. The script fails to deliver a cohesive and captivating storyline, leaving viewers confused and disengaged at times.In conclusion, ""The Flash"" (2023) is not the best offering from the DC Universe. The film suffers from subpar acting performances, unconvincing costumes, and noticeable instances of artificiality in its visual effects. While it tries to deliver an engaging plot, it falls short due to convoluted storytelling. Fans of the character may find moments to appreciate, but overall, it fails to meet the expectations set by its predecessors.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Years later, well into my prime, I'm seeing this 2023 version of the Flash for the first time. Stated that I'm not an Ezra Miller fan. I don't know how or why a person who has no theater experience of 15 years is chosen for a lead role. John Wesley Shipp was the best Flash. He should have reprised his role.This movie is about alternate time-lines. There is no plot. Just blind nonsensical CGI action. With a multi superhero cast, you shouldn't expect a coherent plot. In fact, Hollywood has lost the plot entirely. They should really stop making movies altogether as there are no talented actors to be found these days, let alone action heroes the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris etc., etc. These new generation of actors don't have any screen presence or skill and are just lucky to be at the right time and place to just sneak the role.Brief plot: due to a traumatic childhood incident that Barry witnessed his mother lose her life, The Flash in a burst of anger tries to undo this by traveling back in time. But this has serious repercussions and he will find out why. This is similar to the Back To Future trilogy of films where Marty tries to undo the harm he has done. The only difference between these movies is the superhero element. Back To The Future didn't boast any superheroes but was an enjoyable and exciting watch.It is good to see my childhood Batman actor Michael Keaton(Pacific Heights 1990, One Good Cop 1991, Desperate Measures 1998) reprise his role again.Verdict: if you've got time to spare than this is an average movie to sit through, just about worth one's time.More superhero themed movies: Condorman 1981, Misfits of Science 1985, Masters Of The Universe 1987, The Meteor Man 1993, Blankman 1994, Steel 1997. I have seen all of these movies and recommend them if you haven't seen them already.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Of course, this was mostly written and shot during the pandemic with multiple changes in creative direction, post-production delays, and the whole Miller controversy. The end product features yet another multiverse setting, with Allen's decision to save his mother creating an alternate timeline where some Justice League members do not exist (or are different from the ones we've known). The 18-year-old version of Miller is designed to be a complete goofball, and it feels a bit overdone in the film. The CGI also leaves much to be desired; it's a mixed bag - some scenes look terrific whereas some look downright terrible - you'll know which ones if you've seen the film (why did they do Superman dirty?).The idea to bring back Michael Keaton's Batman in a more prominent role (as compared to Batfleck) is one of the better creative decisions the film has taken. The Supergirl angle didn't do much for me, as its overall impact was left wanting. But the worst is reserved for the film's final act. The script meanders, considers various possibilities, and settles for the tamest one. This has been the case with most of Christina Hodson's scripts; they always lose steam when it gets close to the finale (be it Bumblebee or Birds of Prey). I hope future comicbook films also discard the ""change-your-past-using-time-travel"" trope.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I recommend watching the DC animated movie or reading the comics since this movie really didn't do it Justice. It was still okay overall and you could see where they were going. It just needed more life, less CGI, and maybe just a better overall direction that didn't try to rely on flashy gimmicks and really bad jokes. I really dislike the portrayal of Flash in DC movies as they lean in to to much of the negative traits of the flash, but Ezra did play the character well enough. I found this Reddit post that describes Barry Allen in my opinion the best:""To me Barry is intelligent, dorky, a bit on the shy side, and very optimistic about the motivations and potential of the people around him, even his enemies. He's always quick with a dad joke or a flash fact. A large part of the original conceit of Barry was to make him an educational hero to appeal to the comics code authority so the flash facts were very important and form a core part of his character now-Barry's coolest speed feats are things he figured out how to do via his knowledge of physics and chemistry, as opposed to Wally's more fantastical feats. On the flip side, he suffers from a lot of internally focused anxiety that can prevent him from extending the patience and understanding he has for other people back towards himself, so he tends to beat himself up for any mistakes (real or imagined) and it gives him unmanageable expectations he can't always live up to and can stop him for reaching out for help when he needs it. To me Barry is intelligent, dorky, a bit on the shy side, and very optimistic about the motivations and potential of the people around him, even his enemies.""I saw attempts at most of these traits, but the lack of a more optimistic and upbeat Barry with actual jokes that stuck made the Flash bland and boring. You could replace the Flash with any random and nobody would care since the story is still okay. Well that's basically the movie the Flash summed up in a nutshell. Okay superhero story. Worth a watch if you're bored.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story like any other contemporary superhero movie is filled with humour and lots of action. It tries to balance the dark and dramatic moments along with the comedy but is largely unsuccessful which results in this movie suffering from a vast array of tonal inconsistencies. The humour felt a little too much at times. Not to mention the movie drags on for too long thanks to some problems with the screenplay and the wildly uneven pacing.Ezra Miller's performance was okay. He might be overacting at times but overall he does an okay job. It's Michael Keaton as Batman who steals every scene he's in making the movie somewhat interesting.The direction, however, is quite amazing. The different use of angles and lenses felt really interesting to watch. The score is perfect and knows how to deal with the story while still having the sense of nostalgia.Now being a superhero movie it has extensive use of CGI and oh boy was it not good. Half of it was extremely terrible. It all looked so incredibly fake and cartoony that it took out of the movie more than once. This was easily one of the worst uses of CGI I've ever seen in any superhero movie.Overall, the cast does a decent job and the direction and score is really good but all of it can't makeup for the poor CGI quality and the screenplay which drags the movie down.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Naked jokes are funny once, dick jokes, the same. Repeating the same joke is really a sign of poor writing and a lack of mature imagination. It's sad.Additionally, I'm not sure why the director felt that 18 year-old Flash needed to act like a four year-old. Eating like a toddler, food all over his face, jumping on he bed like his first sleepover. It was pathetic and embarrassing for the lead, frankly. I wanted to give this a higher rating, but the dumbing down and lazy directing, just makes it impossible to rate it above a 4.The Marvel Universe it becoming a daycare center.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Introduce a dolt like putz of a former self right out of Bill and Ted's and slog along babysitting this character at a kindergarten level and the movie breaks new ground in boredom.

Despite promising potential, the film struggles with weak character development, unnecessary scenes, and a messy time travel theory, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment.One of the major flaws of Flash 2023 lies in its inability to properly establish and build its characters. While the film features beloved characters from the D Comics universe, their development feels rushed and superficial. The audience is left craving deeper connections and a better understanding of their motivations and personal growth.Furthermore, the inclusion of numerous unnecessary scenes detracts from the film's overall cohesion. These superfluous moments not only disrupt the pacing but also add little value to the story, leaving viewers questioning their relevance and contribution to the plot.One of the most glaring issues with Flash 2023 is its mishandling of the time travel theory. Time travel can be a complex concept to execute effectively, and unfortunately, the film fails to provide a coherent and well-established framework. This lack of clarity results in confusing plot holes and inconsistencies that hinder the audience's ability to fully engage with the story.The shortcomings of Flash 2023 highlight the need for Warner Brothers to exercise greater caution and meticulousness when bringing D Comics to the big screen. Thorough script development and attention to detail are paramount in ensuring a satisfying cinematic experience for both fans and general audiences.In conclusion, Flash 2023 falls short of its potential, with weak character development, unnecessary scenes, and a muddled time travel theory. While it's disappointing to see these missteps, it serves as a reminder that Warner Brothers should carefully consider the execution of their DC Comics adaptations in order to deliver more consistent and fulfilling films in the future.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It revolves around a question I've often posed to myself and others, ""What would I be like if I didn't go through the struggles I did?"" This movie gives an answer. I always figured, you know, I've been through some horrible stuff, but I have an idea of what I might have become without those experiences, and I don't like it. Pain and suffering gives us a perspective that helps us see our circumstances with more brevity, unless we let that pain destroy and consume us. Yes, that is what this film is really about, I found myself very happy while watching this that a mainstream action film dared to explore such themes.It is a fun movie, I have seen it twice and I enjoyed it equally both times. It was unfairly panned, the fact is, people or rather critics are fatigued by comic book movies, and I don't blame them. I won't watch anything put out by Disney/Marvel, so that leaves me with DC, and overall, I think their movies are far better because they are by and large fun movies. When I go to see a superhero film, I want a fun film. I was never a huge fan of the ""Dark Knight"" and I enjoy ""Batman & Robin"", so that should tell you something. I think comic book films are best when they understand how silly they are. The Flash does.The acting is by and large good, the script is still kind of by the numbers, but again explores some pretty deep themes which really sets it apart. It was extremely fun seeing Michael Keaton back, he is my favorite Batman, and personally, I just want a new Batman movie with him, don't care how old he is. I enjoyed the other surprises, that I won't ruin. I loved the running jokes revolving around pop culture, those were a lot of fun. Again it's just a fun movie with some deeper themes underlying it that it knows how to explore. I don't think the CGI was bad, I've seen worse in Marvel movies. So....Overall, if you like your comic book movies fun, but with a bit of pathos, you will enjoy The Flash.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The DC universe, rife with compelling characters and intricate storylines, often sparks fierce debates about character interpretations, and ""The Flash"" was no exception.Perhaps the most polarizing element of the movie was the portrayal of The Flash himself. To say the character was 'annoying' would be an understatement. Every quip, every expression, every gesture seemed calculated to irk the audience. There's an argument to be made about characters needing flaws and nuances to be relatable and human, but in this case, it felt like an overload, making the film a laborious experience for many.One might wonder, was it necessary to make The Flash this irritating? On one hand, it could be a bold choice to highlight Barry Allen's struggle with his newfound powers, his insecurities, or his efforts to fit into the superhero community. Painting him as an outcast or as someone trying too hard to be accepted can be an interesting take, providing depth and layers to a character often seen simply as the 'fast guy'.However, a line must be drawn between complexity and vexation. While the filmmakers might have aimed for a more humanized, imperfect Barry Allen, the result was an over-the-top annoyance that overshadowed the character's redeeming qualities. For many viewers, it became almost impossible to finish the movie due to this excessive portrayal.In conclusion, while ""The Flash"" (2023) had its moments and will undoubtedly have its supporters, the overwhelming sentiment is that the portrayal of its titular character detracted more than it added. In the future, filmmakers should remember that while it's essential to make characters relatable and flawed, they mustn't alienate their core audience in the process.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have watched all the previous movies that are attached to this movie's slice(s) of the DC Universe. So I won't have any opinion on how this connects to the series. :)I think, this movie felt like a good jolt, to get the franchise on track towards something a bit less serious and dark than what we have seen in the Justice League movies. A super hero that doesn't take himself too serious, even though his origin story is quite tragic. Michael Keaton is also doing a great job reprising his role from the '90s.I am sure the plot hole hunters on YouTube will have a field day with this story, as any story written around time travelling will have big problems keeping the ends tied up. The whole concept is after all chronically flawed in itself. I do think they managed to keep the story from falling as much apart as the Multiverse in that other franchise is at the moment.Only gripes I have with this movie is that Ezra Miller do tend to overact the loud teenager a bit. It can get a bit much in some dialogues with that other teenager. The end credit scene, funny as it was, might also be a bit illogical to put in there. It puts them in a trajectory that could make the stakes as low as they are in the Marvel Universe these days. But overall, I think this might be a movie pointing DC in the right direction for their next few movies in the franchise.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Attempts to bring the character to the cinema go as far back as the late 1980's, but while some approaches almost came to be ultimately it was not meant to be. We might've seen a movie earlier in the last decade if Warner Bros. Didn't drop the ball as hard as they did with their attempt at a DC Cinematic Universe and mishandled Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League and made a mess out of everything, but finally in 2020 things started coming together and cameras started rolling in 2021. It was looking smooth but change in management at Warner Bros. Led to serious retooling of the plot that resulted in extensive reshoots and different endings. As a result, the budget became ridiculously bigger, and to make matters worse its star became a source of much controversy with many wondering if they would recast to make sure it had more commercial appeal, but too much was already spent on the production.People were unsure if the movie would be any good, but surprisingly several key figures in the entertainment industry from Tom Cruise to Stephen King showered the film with praise after seeing a version of it and encouraged everyone to get their tickets as soon as possible. Having seen the movie, I have to wonder if they saw an early cut because what has been released in theatres, I would say it is...Just fine. However, nothing to write home about.This film is a loose attempt at the Flashpoint storyline that ironically also reset the DC Universe, only it is a bit more complicated, lighter in tone, and does away with some key elements from the comic book that would've served the movie better. While there are some pretty solid dramatic moments here and there, it largely plays out as a comedy, and even though most of the jokes work there are a number that do not. Most of the humor comes from the younger version of Barry Allen from the new timeline The Flash has created by going into the past, and Ezra Miller overdoes the silliness to a point where the character's intended annoyance is taken to an irritating level. Miller still does fine as The Flash, even though it is still a more Wally West version of the character than Barry Allen.Michael Keaton, Ben Affleck, and Sasha Calle are all great in what time they have, they make the most of what they can do and you do wish there would've been more time spent with them. Seeing Michael Shannon and Antje Traue back as Zod and Faora was also a plus.There is some pretty fun spectacle and engaging action set pieces, but the storytelling is largely pretty sloppy and various plot threads do not end very satisfyingly. A lot of the ""wow"" factor tends to be lost in the very poorly rendered CGI, which honestly feels like you are watching a cinematic from a PlayStation 2 video game.In the end, The Flash (2023) is a ""coulda, woulda, shoulda"" type of motion picture, some joy can be had with it but most likely you will come out not feeling disappointed in some way. It is a shame, because The Flash is a great character that has many exciting stories to pull from for a movie, and in 2023 the money and effects are there for something fantastic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At the outset, some prolonged and needlessly pretentious action scenes with poor special effects set the tone early for what turns out to be quite an uneven showing. Barry Allen's a lonely, broken forensic investigator trying to relive his past, but his inability to let go and his attempt to try and undo history leads to catastrophic results when he--quite literally--breaks the universe into alternative timelines. The dilemma is now whether he and his younger, less mature self can clean up the multiverse mess that he's made. Given the amount of fan service and characters that occupy the run time, it's curious as to whether or not this can be viewed as an actual Flash movie; Miller holds their own but the dual role does make them half engaging and half annoying, but after so many years it's a pleasure to see Michael Keaton once again don the cape and cowl, just too bad he wasn't given a better movie in which to make his Batman return. Multiverses, variants, frequent attempts at humor, callbacks, thunderous action scenes...they're all thrown at you but nothing really sticks, not to mention Marvel already played this card (Spider-Man: No Way Home anyone?) in superior fashion. How many DC duds have to be produced before they realize they're doing it all wrong? **","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Barry travels back in time, to a spaghetti bowl of different timelines and universes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9405948/?ref_=tt_urv","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 2023","For some reason I thought this movie had received a negative reception and was prepared for it not to be very good. Well, I was mistaken, I found it thoroughly enjoyable, with some novel ideas about time travel. I watched it at home on BluRay, my wife watched the first half then left, she isn't much of a Superhero fan.Ezra Miller is Barry Allen, aka The Flash. As the movie starts there is havoc in the city, Barry goes to a shop for his usual breakfast, a sandwich loaded with calories for the high energy he needs, PB, raisins, honey, bananas, and maybe a few other things. He needs it quick so he can spring into action but the usual waitress is absent that day and the guy replacing her is slow. So he has to forego that and spring into action. Interesting start to the movie to show how his super fast speed needs additional energy. Most movies and TV shows just skip that point.Anyway as the story moves along Barry experiments with backwards running to travel into the past, to a few minutes earlier, or a day earlier. He decides to try to return to his childhood and correct the incident that led to his mother's death and his dad's false imprisonment. But everything gets scrambled and, in a session with Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) he learns that alternate time lines aren't really parallel, they get scrambled like a bowl of cooked spaghetti. (At least in this movie!)Anyway all this leads to a number of complications, The Flash, Batman, and Supergirl end up in a fierce battle with Zod. In that scenario there are two Flashes, Barry Allen at two different ages.The whole story gets very complicated but is written well and all makes sense, if you pay attention.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Emotional Core and Nothing Else","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9211754/?ref_=tt_urv","Picturesinflow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163451708/?ref_=tt_urv","24 July 2023","The Flash is the latest instalment in DC's ever-troubled movie franchise. While the film has its heart in the right place, it falls short with lacklustre (bordering on laughable) CGI, forced jokes, a significantly smaller scale compared to the comics, and various other shortcomings. Despite several years of development, The Flash feels rushed and fails to deliver on its potential.The main plot revolves around Barry (played by Ezra Miller) going back in time to save his mother, a decision he couldn't make when he was younger. As expected, altering the past comes with consequences, especially when time travel is involved. Things take a turn for the worse, leading to a new dimension where Superman is absent, but Supergirl (Sasha Calle) takes on the mantle. Batman is portrayed by Michael Keaton, reprising his role from the past, and the Justice League is nowhere to be found. The film now features a revamped team of two speedsters, a Kryptonian, and a different version of Batman.Ezra Miller's portrayal of The Flash has been a wild card pick from the beginning, depicting a young Barry struggling to master his powers and find friendship along the way, which isn't easy. In this film, he has grown significantly, especially when he encounters the second Barry, who hasn't faced the same struggles. We witness how much he has matured. While no one can replace Henry Cavill as Superman, introducing Supergirl is a different story. Sasha Calle brings raw emotion, stoicism, and a no-nonsense attitude to her portrayal. Michael Keaton, reprising his role as Batman, slips back into the character effortlessly, as if he never stopped playing the Dark Knight. His revamped suit, new technology tricks, and seasoned experience make him a formidable and successful protector of Gotham.The Flash suffers from egregious CGI, severely hampering the overall experience. While it's usually better to have no CGI at all for grounded heroes, those with even minimal powers require proper CGI execution. With the film's extensive development time and a budget of around $220 million, there's no excuse for such subpar visual effects. The Flash becomes the latest addition to DC's franchise blunders. One can only hope that under the direction of James Gunn, future DC films will be crafted with more care and a genuine appreciation for the original comics, featuring a broader array of characters, rather than barely a handful.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
