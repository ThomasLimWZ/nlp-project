It was a full of your standard shark movie cliches and the middle drags a little, but I have to admit I was surprised in the last quarter of the film, and even though I was cheering for the shark (there was just too many stupid people waiting to be eaten) I did end up enjoying the film. I love shark movies though, so if you aren't generally into shark movies then this probably won't float your boat.A lot of action at the beginning and end, lots of blood, heavy dose of environmental message which is very topical. Would I watch it again. Yeah I would. And I'd watch a sequel if that happens too.","121 out of 137 found this helpful.

Audience: SHE TOLD YOU NOT TO DO IT! How dumb are you!?Those types movies. However, if they're done well, you don't mind the stupidity in it and play along.I kept reading ""If you liked Jaws, you'll enjoy Under Paris."" ""One of the best Shark films since Jaws"" - High praise. So, I had to watch it, despite low scores.The dumb people in this film don't listen, do dumb things, and get killed. But it's been filmed well; it's intense, the sound design and cinematography keep you engaged. Shark graphics - decent enough. It's got enough going on to keep you engaged, the plot is not boring at all. The ending may have you scratching your head though.Here's a perspective that I don't think anybody is considering - I don't know the first thing about Shark Biology or marine evolution, but I looked at the 'Sharks' as a metaphor for 'Climate Change' and the plot AND the ending suddenly made so much more sense. That made me feel like the movie was actually better than people are making it out to be.Either that, or I'm just trying to convince myself that I didn't waste 2 hours watching stupid people make stupid decisions.","40 out of 53 found this helpful.

This film is full of typical shark film clichés; stupid characters, ignorant person in power and strange looking CGI. It had some intriguing elements that stacked this film above the rest of shark films, like The Shallows or The Meg. This film feels a little bit more than a simple rehashing of a survival story. The two main characters have to battle a large, complex shark against the backdrop of Paris. No spoilers, but I would definitely recommend that you watch the entire film until the end for the ultimate conclusion. The characters here are forgettable and, once again, most of them fall easily into the stereotypical roles that people in shark films have to in order for the body count to be higher.Overall, this film was much better than I anticipated it to be, with the middle dragging out until the tension finally starts to ramp up.","32 out of 46 found this helpful.

Like any horror films premises don't make sense and I guess that's okay with the genre? I don't know because I am not a fan of horror movies but I do enjoy suspense and that is what made me watch it in the first place but there was little to no suspense. No plot depth. Not much good to it actually. There are no good dialogues, no good character development and you don't really feel any attachment whatsoever to any of the characters so you don't care what happens to them. If that is not a sample of bad scriptwriting, I don't know what is. The cinematography is also plain and quite insipid...

Here it is the politician who wanted a triathlon in Paris despite the shark. But as bad as she was the worst was Miks a Greta Thurnburg type environmentalist who thinks animals are equal to humans and is responsible for freeing the shark. In between both of them is scientist Sophia ( (Berenice Bejo). The ending which I will not spoil is shocking and abrupt to say the least.

O. S. Or Save our Seas saying the group have located Lillith's tracker in the Seine with incidents such as a driver crashing into the Seine and the body not being recovered. Initially skeptical, Sophia's fears are soon confirmed as circumstances soon see her team with Adil (Nassim Lyes) of the French police's River Brigade to try to handle the situation while dealing with potentially life threatening interference from both S. O. S. As well as the publicity and money hungry Mayor of Paris (Anne Marivin) who is hosting a triathlon in the Seine.Under Paris is the latest Netflix release and comes to us via versatile genre director Xavier Gens. The movie is another entry in the well tapped well of the subgenre of Shark movies that ever since the release of Jaws have come to acknowledge that bar will never be set with some opting for character studies, some using the format as an excuse for cheapness, while others go to the extreme of over the top excess (see examples of Deep Blue Sea and The Meg films). With Under Paris or Sous la Seine we definitely have an example of over the top excess and it's the best kind of ridiculousness that I'll admit I'm a sucker for.While the movie has an environmental subtext in discussing real world issues like climate change and the Pacific Garbage Patch, that's honestly pretty secondary so this is less An Inconvenient Truth and more The Day After Tomorrow if the villain were sharks instead of global warming. From the opening slaughter at the garbage patch that cuts loose with the blood and gore in a rather refreshing fashion (even if I'll admit I could've gone for some more practical work intermixed with what we have) Under Paris delivers the intensity and excess you'd expect from a movie like this and it unapologetically dives in and goes for it. The acting from our leads of Berenice Bejo and Nassime Lyes is good and I give the actors props for treating this material as seriously as they would a procedural like Spiral. Anne Marivin serves as our secondary antagonist as a greedy mayor a la Jaws who isn't even trying to be subtle from her introduction that has her gesticulating over a scale model of Paris illustrating her big plans for the triathlon. And last but not least we have the shark itself Lillith, while the effects to bring the shark aren't top of the line (it's a modestly budgeted French film), what the producers lack in finer detail and rendering power they more than make up for with creativity and spirit. While they could've stopped with the idea of ""shark in the Seine"" and that would've been plenty to sell the movie, they go several steps beyond and the revelations about the shark not only have (sometimes literal) Earth shattering effect, but become borderline apocalyptic.I'll admit it's difficult to objectively review a movie like Under Paris because you can find no shortage of logical and scientific leaps that it takes, but it's that all too rare B-movie that could that commits to a bonkers high concept premise without feeling the need to wink at the camera and let the audience know it's in on the joke. It has scares that work, the action's exhilarating, and it's just fun. Sometimes all you need is fun escapist nonsense and you'll find that here I assure you.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

There have been some really bad shark movies lately, and a few good ones. 'Under Paris' is one of the better ones. It is not trying to be like any other shark movie, and also doesn't have the usual clichés.Three years ago Sophia's crew died in a shark attack while they were searching for a shark they tagged, and named it Lilith. Now working in an aquarium, Sophia still blames herself. She is approached by Mika from SOS - an ocean conservation group, who claims they managed to track Lilith. Lost and trying to survive, the shark adapted and made its way to the freshwater Seine.With a big upcoming triathlon, time is of the essence and the Mayor insists the event will proceed, stating too much (money) is at stake, as well as her reputation. It is now up to Sophia and the River Police - lead by Adil - to take care of the shark, but Mika has other plans. The situation is aggravated when they discover Lilith is giving birth.The final act is action all the way with a good climax. The shark effects were also well done. Oh, and you gotta love that cliffhanger ending, which leaves so much room for a sequel! The film also sends out a powerful message of conservation.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The visual effects were just okay but the actual plot of the movie was not making any sense at all. I just moved to the end of the movie to see what happens at the end and I got another failure. To be honest I believe the shark was the protagonist in this movie.","17 out of 27 found this helpful.

The CGI in the movie is so bad it's forgivable only when juxtaposed against the poor logic shown in the canyon-sized plot holes that follow one after another. The Seine was pronounced dead more than sixty years ago yet somehow it supports more than a hundred salt water sharks that seem to thrive on the industrial waste/raw sewage that is the Seine. I would swim in Venice's Grand Canal before swam in the Seine. How about new born sharks less than a week old are somehow larger than the biggest Harley Davidson ever made. And where did all this water come from that feeds the tsunami that floods the 1-7 Arrondissements of Paris? The idea that this P. O. C. Is the #1 movie on Netflix really shouldn't surprise anyone after all millions of people will vote for Trump/LaPen/Polievre in upcoming elections.

But at the same time, it just didn't fully live up to my expectations. There simply were a tad too many things throughout the narrative that just didn't make any sense.Sure, ""Sous la Seine"" is a watchable and entertaining movie if you enjoy shark movies, and I do that, of course I do.The storyline in the movie was pretty straightforward and very easy to get submerged into. However, it wasn't exactly Shakespearian theater that unfolded on the screen. Not that I was expecting that, but it would have been nice with a storyline that had a bit more meat on it, so to speak. Writers Yannick Dahan, Maud Heywang, Xavier Gens, Yaël Langmann and Olivier Torres put together a fair enough storyline, provided you enjoy popcorn movies where you just lean back, munch of the snacks and doesn't have to use your brain while watching.Something that I did really like about ""Sous la Seine"" was the fact that the audience are thrown into the feeding frenzy very early on in the movie. I liked that about the movie, because director Xavier Gens wasn't squandering a lot of time to establish characters or setting the stage. You just dive right on into the bloody waters.I wasn't familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list. The acting performances were good, and that definitely counted for something.Visually then ""Sous la Seine"" was good. The effects were nice, and the CGI animated sharks looked realistic.Without spoiling anything here, I have to say that I personally found the ending of the movie to be rushed and sort of amateurishly written. Sure, it paves the way for a sequel, but it was just a laughable way to the end the movie in my opinion.Was I entertained throughout the course of the 101 minutes that ""Sous la Seine"" ran for? Sure. Will I return to watch it again? No. It is certainly a good shark movie, but it just doesn't have the bite required to become a genre classic.If you enjoy shark movies, then you should by all means sit down and watch the movie.My rating of director Xavier Gens's 2024 movie ""Sous la Seine"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Generic characters that you simply could not care less about, a woefully written script full of clichés, tonally inconsistent, some questionable acting, a ridiculous premise, consistently shoddy CGI... There's very little to sink your teeth in to, I'm afraid.

Fondly named Lilith, the shark wrecks havoc, killing most of Sophia's crew. 3 years later, Sophia is yet to move on completely from the incident and the losses she faced, an youth activist approaches her to inform Lilith is now back in Seine. The transition from saltwater to freshwater shark baffles her and soon Sophia's realizes the threat. As they try to convince the police who are dismissive, the mayor however is hell bent on kickstarting the triathlon, afterall it's one shark to contain. With the stage set up, what does Lilith bring to the show forms rest of the story.For one, I definitely enjoyed this film and I will admit that after a long time, here comes a good shark film. There is no sugar coating till the actual story begin as director Xavier Gens means business. As we are introduced to the giant Lilith, we are clear what's in store. There is an acceptable explanation to why this particular shark could transform itself into surviving in freshwater and no time is wasted in creating any drama or sci-fi mumbo jumbos. The CGI is off at many instances but that didn't put me off.Once Sophia reaches out to the police then it's all Lilith's mayhem and it was totally worth it. The encounter with the ill informed activists was definitely the highlight. However, the set up for the Piranha-esque climax with the triathlon and shark on the loose, I was bit disappointed with lesser gore and though repetitive, I still wanted to see that in full glory. They did replace it with even more crazy stuff and the CGI was actually passable here. I may not be too keen for the sequel if it were to be made but I was all the more satisfied with Under Paris. Bottom line is it entertained me.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The look of the film is pretty cool, with some good CGI scenes of Paris, admittedly a few of the shark scenes looked a bit naff but overall not too bad.

There are a few scenes in the last third that spoil the overall impression somewhat, but that's not tragic.

Jaws is a masterpiece. A perfect film. An edge of your seat thrill ride directed by one of the best directors, and staring an amazing cast. Under Paris is, in comparison, a made for TV, laugh out loud nonsensical mess. The best I can say is that the actors manage to do an okay job with what little they have to work with. Which is a flimsy nonsensical premise about a mutant shark that decides to take a trip to Paris. Mix in some clumsy environmental messaging, and the main characters reasons for hunting the shark, and another reason why the incompetent politician refuses to take the problem seriously (sounds familiar), some truly awful CGI shark effects, and we end up with something that's not as ridiculous as the Sharknado films, but definitely not as good as something like Deep Blue Sea, which is still pretty silly. If we're going to compare it to Jaws, it's definitely more Jaws: The Revenge than the original. The end of the film has to be seen to be believed.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

No other shark movie will ever top Jaws. Even Jaws remake didn't top Jaws. With that out of the way, where does Under Paris figure in the pantheon of the many other shark movies that followed Jaws?Considering that we've been fed with a truck load of crappy shark movies since the days of Jaws, I approached Under Paris with trepidation. Was it gonna be a Jaws 4, Meg, Sharkanado, 47 meters down?Well, I'm happy to report that, Under Paris is closer in terms of rank with The Shallows, probably THE shark movie that comes closest to Jaws in terms of entertainment value.Sure, it's premise of climate change causing sharks to move to the freshwaters of the river Seine in Paris might be a tad preposterous, but once you get that out the way, what Under Paris strives to give you is pure entertainment delight that is topped with generous suspense, decent acting, shark menace and the resultant bloodfest, brilliant camerawork. The pace hardly slows down, and there's enough in most of the scenes to hold your interest. That is, even when the irritating environmentalists show up to lament about how people mistreat ocean life and do their SJW act, you find yourself still willing to put up with it, because you know there's a greater action waiting to be revealed beneath the surface (pardon the pun). And for once, moviedom lets SJWs reap the consequence of their juvenile POV, in this case, the silly attempt to treat a man-eater ala a cuddly house poodle. I went ""Yippee"".And boy, when the action scenes arrive, does they bowl you over or what? No moment is wasted with silly shark vs people battles, ala Meg. Instead, what team Xavier Gens proceeds to give us is innovative shark frenzy in the underwater catacombs of the Seine. Improbable perhaps, but it's all executed brilliantly, so much so you don't spend time thinking about its sensibility.In a summer that already has its fill of movies that are below their hype (eg Furiosa), give this one a chance. You'll come out pleasantly surprised.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

It spends too much time on its admittedly well intentioned premise and goes too long between shark encounters. However, it's saved by the thoroughly serious tone combined with a third act that finally realises its full potential and just goes for broke.It wants to be one of those rare creature features where you actually care about the characters so it dedicates a lot of screen time to their struggles and past failures and yet they still feel one dimensional overall but it at least understands to give the most annoying character a memorable death. Nassim Lyes manages to make his character likeable on performance alone.Xavier Gens' direction is helped massively by the 15 rating which allows him to actually show the brutality of the shark attacks, which can create some tension in the really impressive underwater sequences. The fact that there's no in-jokes and everyone takes this completely seriously even as it starts to get into gleefully stupid territory was absolutely the right choice as well.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And this horror thriller is also an ecological thriller, as also was John Frankenheimer's 1982 PROPHECY. But at least Xavier Gens the director is back to France, where he began in 2007 with the terrific FRONTIERES. In the meantime, he worked for the Hollywood industry. This disaster horror thriller from France is of course daring, and proceeds the today's tendency for French film industry to produce action and horror flicks - film de genre, as we say in France - which was rather rare so far. Or exceptional. This one is good, not terrific, and, I repeat, it is funny that it is aired one month before the Olympic Games in Paris. But why not? At least the sharks don't fly, as in SHARKNADO. But the finale of this one is totally, definitely, entirely unbelievable, unrealistic at the most. And so fun, crazy and gloomy in the same time.

Until the climax, the movie alternates between wasting time and shark action that's been seen in dozens of movies before. Additionally, all of the characters in this film are either unlikeable or undeveloped. I would have been perfectly fine with every single character in this film becoming shark food. The special effects also leave a lot to be desired, I believe Deep Blue Sea in the 1990s had better special effects than this film a quarter of a century later. However, the climax of the film bumps this film up a couple stars. Under Paris has possibly the wildest ending in a shark movie that doesn't involve sharknados. If the characters in this film had been likeable and memorable, the climax would have been one of the best ever in a Netflix film. Ultimately, I would recommend watching this film although the first 75 minutes doesn't require your full attention.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Jaws, obviously, is the gold standard by which every single movie is measured, and so far, arguably, none has dethroned the king at the top of the mountain.This one definitely won't either.With that out of the way, let's focus on the good, bad and ugly...Let's start with the bad... If only people in survival movies weren't that stupid, may be they'd live... And it's always the same. Of course, if they were smart, the movie'd be much more boring because people would seldom die and nobody wants that in a shark movie. But some of these people wouldn't have made it past puberty with that level of stupidity in their gene pool.The CGI could be better, but I've seen way worse in movies 3 times the budget this one probably got. There's situations, shots & angles in there clearly ""borrowed"" from other shark movies, such as Jaws of course, but also Deep Blue Sea and The Shallows, but they usually work so they get a pass from me.The characters are pretty one dimensional, and performance is a crapshoot going from pretty good from Berenice Bejo to acceptable from the male lead, to forgettable ( to be nice ) from secondary characters, to really stiff and bad from extras and really small part actors, so that gives a very unbalanced feel from the movie in that department.The ugly... it's a snooze fest for at least half of the movie, and tension is pretty low except for a couple of moments. 20 minutes in and I thought about switching the TV off, but it became slightly more exciting for a minute and I decided to give it a shot and watch the whole thing. It gets better for about 30 minutes, then a little dull again, then exciting again for the last 30 minutes. But these are 30 intense minutes and that's obviously the movie's climax and ending.The good... when the movie delivers, it really does deliver. Some great shots, really intense action, some gore, and I think the ending is really really cool and unexpected. Living in Paris, that ending gave me goosebumps and it's quite original as its reference in the movie realm is really different from any other shark movie and is both open and works as a closed chapter too if they decide not to give this a sequel. Bejo is a great actress, and makes the part work. The movie looks good, and if you're a shark movie afficionado, it's one to watch and enjoy, while keeping in mind that any shark scientist will be screaming at their TV because scientifically nothing holds up, but that's not why we watch these now, is it ?","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

For the first hour and a half, almost nothing of significance happens. The characters wander aimlessly through the catacombs of Paris, delivering uninspired dialogue and making increasingly poor decisions. The film's pacing is excruciatingly slow, with scenes dragging on far longer than necessary. It's clear the filmmakers were trying to build tension, but instead, they just built frustration.The concept of ""Under Paris"" had potential. The idea of an ancient evil lurking beneath one of the world's most iconic cities is intriguing. Unfortunately, the execution was completely botched.The characters in ""Under Paris"" are another major problem. They are remarkably stupid, making a series of bafflingly bad decisions that defy logic and common sense. It's hard to root for characters who seem determined to get themselves killed. Their lack of depth and development makes it impossible to care about their fates, which, given the genre, is a fatal flaw.The film's climax, which should have been its saving grace, is another letdown. After almost 90 minutes of tedium, the action finally picks up in the last 15 minutes. However, the deaths are mediocre at best, lacking the creativity and shock value that good horror demands. The only interesting part of the movie is the ending, which feels rushed and tacked on. This segment should have occurred in the middle of the film, providing a much-needed jolt to the narrative and allowing for a more engaging second half.In conclusion, ""Under Paris"" is a mess of a horror film. It squanders its promising concept with poor execution, a glacial pace, and characters that are impossible to care about. The only redeeming feature is the final 15 minutes, but by then, it's too little, too late. This movie is a prime example of what I hate about the horror genre-wasted potential and an utter lack of thrills. If you're looking for a good scare, look elsewhere. ""Under Paris"" is a disappointing journey into the depths of mediocrity.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

Obviously they are not realistic most of the time and sharks are not these blood thirsty creatures like they are portrayed in most movies. But still I do like movies that involve animal carnage and I think sharks are great in delivering exactly that. The movie had a really interesting premise and therefore immediately stood out to most other shark horror movies. We get a short opening scene where we are introduced to the sharks and the first encounter is a pretty lame jump scare. After that something happens and I immediately knew that in order to enjoy this movie, I had to put my brain on standby. That is the case in most shark movies but some try more than others. Overall this movie had a rather serious tone and for a pretty long time almost seemed to be trying to be realistic apart from some cheesy moments. There are some pretty cliched characters and the actors did a good job portraying them. The overall production value seemed pretty solid aswell and except for some wonky CGI at times the movie had a great look. There's also some pretty decent gore involved and you definitely get some shark action.And then towards the end the movie goes completely off the rails. There's this one scene that happened which actually made me laugh out loud for it's stupidity and from that point on the movie god completely bonkers and turned really absurd. But to be completely honest I absolutely loved that. The movie went from this rather realistic approach to a shark in the Seine to this completely over the top shark carnage horror in a matter of seconds. But like I said if you put your brain on standby, you will enjoy every single second of this mayhem. Just don't look for any realism.Obviously this is not a good movie and probably won't win many significant prizes but I would definitely lie if I would say that I didn't have a great time watching this. The movie succeeds in entertaining and even brought out some laughs for its absurdity and sometimes that is all you need.

This film, set against the intriguing backdrop of Paris's underground labyrinth, squandered its potential with poor execution and lackluster storytelling.From the outset, ""Under Paris"" struggles to find its footing. The plot revolves around a group of friends who venture into the catacombs only to encounter unforeseen dangers. While the setting is atmospheric and ripe for suspense, the story is riddled with clichés and predictable twists. The characters are one-dimensional, each fitting neatly into stereotypical roles without any real depth or development. There's the brave leader, the scared follower, the skeptic, and the token love interest - none of whom inspire any real investment from the audience.The pacing of the film is another major issue. The first half drags on with unnecessary exposition and banal dialogue that fails to build any real tension. When the supposed horror elements finally kick in, they're laughably executed. The appearance of the shark, a supposedly terrifying antagonist, comes off as more absurd than frightening. Its CGI is embarrassingly subpar, making it hard to take any scene involving the creature seriously. The filmmakers seem to have relied heavily on jump scares and gore, but even these are poorly timed and lack impact.The direction and cinematography add to the film's woes. The handheld camera work, presumably intended to create a sense of immersion, instead results in a disorienting viewing experience. Dark, shaky footage makes it difficult to follow the action, and the claustrophobic setting, while initially intriguing, quickly becomes monotonous and visually dull. The film's score, meant to heighten suspense, is forgettable and fails to complement the on-screen action.The actors do their best with the material they're given, but even their performances can't salvage this sinking ship. Their efforts are stymied by a weak script that offers little in the way of compelling dialogue or meaningful character arcs. Emotional moments fall flat, and the supposed camaraderie between the characters feels forced and unnatural.By the time the credits rolled, I found myself rooting for the shark, if only to bring a swift end to the tedium. ""Under Paris"" is a missed opportunity, failing to capitalize on its unique setting and instead delivering a forgettable and frustrating viewing experience. Save yourself the time and skip this one - there are far better ways to explore the mysteries beneath Paris.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The so praised Jaws also made no sense but you don't read devastating reviews for that one. Okay this one isn't Jaws but it's an entertaining shark movie. The bloody scenes are even better than in Jaws, normal you could say as technically we are capable to make things look more real. There are a couple annoying characters, like the mayor from Paris, but that's always the case in movies like this one. The cast did a good job in my opinion, no bad acting whatsoever. As for the story it's a popcorn movie, could have been a blockbuster if made in America.

And the Mayor of Paris is adamant that the event will take place, removing the police and putting the military in place. That the military will handle security and somehow the shark.Here's the basic (and I mean BASIC) comparisons to Jaws. 1. The mayor is the same, following money and esteem rather than safety. 2. Environmental minded people cause problems. 3. People act hysterical, stupidly, and for their own interest (even when their acts cause the death of others).So watch if you like silly shark movies.

The film stars Berenice Bejo, who starred in the magnificent film, ""The Artist"", as a scientist who had a horrible past losing her crew to a huge shark. The film tried too hard to be an eco friendly environmental film, showing the vast amount of debris in the ocean caused by humans, and the potential destruction of habitat for its marine life: ie sharks. The film had great potential but halfway through, it seems that you've been there before, just in a different location.At least you get to visualize the beauty of Paris in some exquisite shots, but the sharks and many of the special effects are all CGI.

The storyline centers around a scientist who discovers that a shark she previously worked with and released into the wild is growing at an alarming rate. Coincidentally, a major swimming event in Paris aligns with the shark's current path. She struggles to stop the shark and persuade local officials to cancel the event, but her efforts seem futile.Directed by Xavier Gens (Frontier(s)) and starring Bérénice Bejo (The Artist), Nassim Lyes (Mayhem!), Aurélia Petit (Personal Shopper), Marvin Dubart (Mortal), and Ibrahima Ba (Drift*).Despite generally enjoying Xavier Gens' work (Frontiers, Cold Skin, etc), this movie is a disaster in almost every way. The cinematography and special effects are polished, making the lack of impactful kill scenes even more disappointing. The sharks move at an unrealistic fast speed, making the action sequences awkward. The scenes of sharks jumping out of the water look particularly bad. The storyline and dialogue are cringeworthy, with the swimming sequence feeling like a poor imitation of Jaws. And who says, ""These sharks would never hurt someone""?In conclusion, Under Paris is a disappointing ""when animals attack"" movie that pales in comparison to Jaws, Lake Placid, or even Deep Blue Sea.

The good part is the movie taking place in Paris. So unusual for shark movie.Synopsis:
Xavier Gens is back with his second stateside release of the year in a film that's already topped the Netflix charts, the defiantly goofy ""Under Paris,"" a movie that almost feels like it's paying homage to the master in its nods to Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" before going full ""Sharknado"" in an insane final act that will be the reason most people remember this movie. Gens can't quite find the balance between those two films, and much of ""Under Paris"" looks as ridiculous as its plotting with over-done CGI and stylish cinematography. But this is a reasonable diversion on a summer day, a Netflix flick that gets in, gets bloody, and gets out in a way that sets up an inevitable sequel that will likely be even more preposterous than this one-in a good way.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And I am not saying that in a positive way!It is a French film released a couple of months before the Paris Olympics, and it is about shark attacks during the Paris Olympics!!! This is a once-in-a-lifetime event that every country and city would hope for (I had this unique experience in my city, Athens, in 2004), and a French film spoils the party? Thank God the film is so unbelievable that it will probably be lost in oblivion before it does any damage.If it weren't for that fact, I would give it a five, but for this, it gets a four, and I am being generous.But even if we ignore its bad timing, the film still has nothing to offer.Do you remember the amazing Berenice Bejo from The Artist? She stars here as well delivering a mediocre performance. The same applies to all the cast; it's not bad but not great.The action scenes are decent, perhaps the film's strongest point, and the visual effects are okay.What is ridiculous though is the story. How the shark came to Paris and adapted to local conditions instantly eludes me! And this is one of the many unexplained elements of the story. Yes, the same can be said for most action films, but it is usually limited to a few parts of the story, not all of it.I suggest you pass on this one!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The underwater work, open swimming, location shots and GCI is weaved together pretty well. The film's pacing sets off a little slowly but reaches increasingly blood splattered levels of mayhem, after first introducing a backstory for the main protagonist. Sophia is a traumatized marine biologist who lost her spouse and crew to our mutant shark some time ago. Berenice Bejo does well to possess the same kind of haunted ambivalent attachment to our fishy friends Roy Scneider famously did in the original Jaws movie franchise. All the actors bar none are sexy and stylish of course. There's plenty for genre fans here of interest: monstrous genetic aberrations, a chilling autopsy scene, the standard disaster movie survival rules i.e. The foolhardy, hippies, people of color, plebs & all minor characters' chances aren't too good, but also surprising justice in that the days of the 'nicest' may also be numbered. Also there are insane city officials bent on vainglory putting the public at risk. Stopping the show is the last thing they want considering the prestige & preparation money involved. I imagine this will go down well in the Paris 2024 olympic village this month... even the (real) cosmetic riverside cleanup and expensive special measures to prevent E.coli contamination gets a few mentions - just when you think it's safe to go back in the water! The environmental messaging is bearable, and I guess as relevant to the context as a sharks are with Paris. I believe the absurd title and mad overall premise both have some kind of nobility and true horror heritage in them, like the classic 'Sharknado' (2013) and its sequels (with sky-bourne sharks attacking aircraft.) So it's highly formulaic, minus a twist, but still a sufficiently entertaining watery slasher. The film builds to a frenetic final section and then an absurd unexpected epic finale that acts like an ironic icing on the proverbial gâteau.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The plot is very much a one-to-one with the original Jaws film, where researchers try to warn the mayor that there's a shark in the area, and the mayor refuses to cancel the upcoming events in the town. However, in this film, it goes over the top and becomes almost tragically comical, and the last half hour is pure idiocy, but it is entertaining. It's especially entertaining when a group of environmental activists trying to save the sharks gets attacked.

At least mediocre cinematic quality is on offer here, plenty of fan service, i.e. Cross-references to pretty much every animal horror classic, as well as (possibly) a side-swipe at a difficult-to-digest zeitgeist. Probably not the state of the Paris police force, but apparently the headquarters of Generation Z environmental activists, including its stereotypical personnel and fanatical agenda. But the dirty waters of the Seine quickly wash away these rose-coloured ideas and there is a silly, but not too silly, basic premise, as well as, essentially, a pleasantly high body count. The spiral of how a problem becomes a super disaster is really quite entertainingly concocted. With the option of more at the end, i.e. A sequel, if it's commercially viable. In terms of effects, everything is also acceptable, unless the makers perhaps wanted to set their standards a little too high. Good entertainment for a select audience.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The initial scenes suggest a different approach to the typical shark movie, setting up an atmosphere that's both fresh and promising. The prologue manages to stand out from other similar films, offering a hint of novelty in the genre.However, the film quickly stumbles with some truly baffling character decisions. The characters' actions often make little sense and detract from the overall narrative. This is especially noticeable with one character, a young girl who makes a series of incredibly poor choices that are both frustrating and off-putting. Her actions not only hinder the story's progression but also severely weaken the film's character development. It becomes difficult to empathize with or care about what happens to these characters when their decisions feel so unrealistic and poorly conceived.As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that ""Under Paris"" struggles with consistency. What starts as a straightforward plot soon spirals into an over-the-top spectacle that lacks coherence. The portrayal of the mayor is particularly grating, adding to the already flawed character dynamics and further detracting from the film's credibility.The ending is perhaps the most disappointing aspect. It is highly unrealistic and far removed from any sense of believability, leaving you with a feeling of disconnection from the story's initial promise. This lack of a satisfying conclusion only amplifies the film's shortcomings.Overall, ""Under Paris"" is a film that fails to live up to its potential. While it offers a unique premise and some initial intrigue, these are overshadowed by poor character decisions, a lack of coherent development, and an unsatisfying conclusion. It's a movie I can't recommend. Unless you're a die-hard fan of shark movies and willing to overlook numerous flaws, this one is better skipped.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Stupid ideas made into a film can sometimes work, we can enjoy the silliness, the over the top plot and amateur acting and effects. So the idea on a shark or sharks in Paris can be considered good potential? Sadly not, it appears eco messages are the main part of this, as such it dampens any hope of comedy. Everyone shall meet a watery death but quite frankly you can fast forward most of it. People voluntarily swimming with sharks, nonsense and boring sharks just makes you wish you could be doing something better with your time. As humans we may have a disadvantage in water against sharks but surely this film would do better to have some comedy? Maybe mix it up with fashion week and see how sharks manage when faced with the pressure of putting on a runway show for a new spring collection?","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Absolutely not.But it's not bad either. Characters did a great job. No unnecessary information was given about them, just enough was given to know their background, personalities and worries.I wish they ""dived deeper"" into the origins of Lilith.But, at least, sharks were shown neither as dumb animals nor as supernatural creatures. They were shown as wild animals which will kill you under certain circumstances. Mistakes can be fatal and many characters died because they underestimated the nature and/or did dumb mistakes.Ending of the movie was totally unexpected. Nothing that was previously seen in any shark movies before.Overall, a good solid shark movie.A must watch to everyone who loves movies about sharks (or animals in general).","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

It also lacks the snide comedy that made The Meg awesome. Also, LL Cool J isn't in it so it's automatically not as good as Deep Blue Sea.With the much anticipated release of Meg 2, I can't help but wonder if the filmmakers were just trying to jump the shark.

As if the movie isn't bad enough.The characters were willfully ignorant. None were overly likable or bright. During the finale, you'll think that all of Paris, over decades, has been packed with military, politicians, and law enforcement that left remnants stacked up from WWII piled up this whole time.The story is ludicrous. The writers (no way one person wrote this schlock) tried to create a cheesy script into something serious. The movie itself was bad. No need to give everyone a long, serious face. You're not making Jaws. Heck, you're not even making Deep Blue Sea.I can't imaging anyone making a movie this ridiculous and trying to be serious with it. Sharknado had a more serious story than Under Paris and knew not to try taking itself seriously.My girlfriend's nickname is Bunny Rabbit because everything makes her jump. The trailer didn't worry her and one scene made her flinch. Otherwise, nothing.Under Paris is a bad movie that seems to have several different writers, all of whom are bad at their jobs and wrote different sections instead of wrote the whole movie together. And if you figure out where all that water came from, please let me know.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I thought at least 40 millions or 50 millions something like this well...no , it's very good point !!!The soundtrack throughout the film and the lights was good too !But for me the main issue it's The CGI, it was very bad maked to some moments and it broke the scenes sometimes very bad it's better to use Set effects even if it's less cheap but it's better to watching a movie even if I'm aware that some will be impossible but the people that works into this department got to get better in their works cause it's very bad sometimes, but only sometimes for some with effect into this movie ...I encourage the French to make more films like this while evolving in the negative points let's be nice for the first films like this.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Where have you gone wrong? Just as Disney and Hollywood were tripping over themselves to give us turdballs, you decided to throw your hat into the ring with Under Paris. Yes, it does say that this is a Netflix Film above the title, but that does not mean you are free of the blame. There have been some notable shark movies made over the past several decades. Jaws made us afraid of going to the beach. The Deep Blue Sea made us afraid of smart sharks. Sharknado made us aware of the deadly combination of sharks and tornadoes. All three of these examples had the right combination of comedy, horror, and action, with a unique story that makes sense. Under Paris, while a unique story on its own, showed us how stupid humans are. The shark in the movie wasn't even a supershark. It was a regular shark that adapted to fresh water and terrorized a city. The city didn't have to be terrorized by this shark if the humans in this movie acted rationally and were smarter than the shark. Alas, this was not the case.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This distraction made it difficult to fully immerse in the narrative.Additionally, the CGI was underwhelming and often detracted from rather than enhanced the film. The acting was mediocre, with performances that failed to bring the characters to life. It's a shame because the plot had promise, but these shortcomings made it hard to appreciate the story fully.Overall, Under Paris had potential, but the subpar CGI, mediocre acting, and poor dubbing made it a less enjoyable watch.

It's a pity because there is a lot really good acting talent out there that is being wasted in movies like this. Hopefully it gets better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Not particularly great, but decent entertainment.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9841254/?ref_=tt_urv","timberwolf3060","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46572982/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2024","I've seen quite a few reviews and posts online stating this is a French ""Jaws."" I'll be blunt:
It is most certainly not, and the comparison is unfair to both this film and ""Jaws,"" on multiple levels.Frankly, there is a much, much better comparison, and while the film it most takes after certainly was made specifically to cash in on the success of ""Jaws,"" it did manage to become something of a classic in its own right (even getting a nod from Speilberg himself). It's just that, well, I'm talking about a film produced by the B-movie king himself, Roger Corman. Yes, this film is better described as a French ""Piranha."" With a little bit of ""Deep Blue Sea"" added in.The basic plot is similar, as is the threat of the creatures reaching the ocean. You even have the attempt to solve the problem with underwater explosives (though in a different way).So, with that in mind, you can expect the same B-movie fare: questionable effects, excessive carnage, government coverups, and characters acting so stupid they've literally been relegated to plot devices (or shark feed). But, if you're here for a low-budget feeding frenzy rather than high art or a truly terrifying experience, you can at least expect to be entertained.Unfortunately for this film, it does lack part of what made ""Piranha"" so good: it's played too straight whereas ""Piranha"" was refreshingly self-aware. And it also meanders for a bit, rather than having Piranha's bare-bones action-focused plot. Also, unlike Piranha, this one has an inane head-scratcher of an ending.To be fair, the acting is well above par considering the writing and production values, and this does provide something of a high point. Many of the actors aren't given much to work with, but they do a decent job with what they have. There is also plenty of carnage, even if it's mostly packed into just a handful of scenes.The writing, on the other hand, is mixed. While there's a good opening, and most of what happens between the underground encounter and the climax is solid, the middle drags with unnecessary exposition. Furthermore, most of the characters were made annoyingly dumb - an accepted B-movie feature, but grating nonetheless.And the ending cannot be panned enough. It really drags the film down. Copying the one from ""Piranha"" would have been vastly superior, but this one was so over-the-top I was nearly reduced to tears - and not from laughter.The effects ranged from adequate to only a shade above a SyFy Pictures Original. Some bits worked well, but a lot of them looked very awkward, and it could switch between both extremes almost instantaneously, which was a bit jarring. Still, this remains much better in this area than most of the other killer shark films out there, which admittedly isn't saying much.That being said, there remains plenty of carnage, particularly in the two big scenes. And a there are a few other scenes that deliver. If that's enough for you, this film will still entertain. But, while better than the vast majority of killer shark films, this is still firmly in the B-Movie category.Only somewhat recommended depending on preferences.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One can't go wrong with the Eiffel Tower in the background. The sharks look pretty good for the most part except for a few bad CGI scenes. It's the people that I have a problem with. It starts with Sophia being nonchalant with the sharks at the beginning. I can overlook it as a clueless scientist and for the sake of the plot. However, there are more and more of those people. Sure, the politician can be that, but the others get on my nerves. Then there are the ammunition. This is probably not the Olympics' favorite movie. The people are dumb and the movie is kind of dumb. For a bit of dumb shark movie action, this could fulfill that desire, but I am annoyed by all the dumb people.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film takes viewers on a fascinating journey through the underground tunnels, caverns, and sewers that crisscross beneath Paris, revealing a side of the city few ever get to see.The result i conclude from this movie is that you should prefer sharks or any other animals to you. Human life is most important of all. You can't teach or make an animal understand what you mean.Director Clarence Eckerson Hill Jr. Masterfully weaves together stunning visuals, archival footage, and interviews with experts and urban explorers to create a compelling narrative that's both informative and entertaining. From the ancient quarries that date back to the Roman era to the modern-day graffiti artists who use the tunnels as their canvas, the film reveals the rich history and cultural significance of these hidden spaces.I'm amazed at how realistic all these blasts and visual effects look in the movies, even though they are fake. But it looks real.One of the standout aspects of ""Under Paris"" is its use of drone footage and 3D scanning technology to capture the vast network of underground passageways and chambers. The visuals are breathtaking, and the film's cinematography is truly stunning.But ""Under Paris"" is more than just a visually striking documentary - it's also a thought-provoking exploration of the relationship between the city's above-ground and underground spaces. The film raises important questions about the role of urban exploration, the impact of gentrification, and the tension between preservation and progress.Overall, ""Under Paris"" is a must-see for anyone interested in urban exploration, history, or culture. It's a beautifully crafted film that will leave you with a new appreciation for the hidden world that lies just beneath our feet.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The deuteragonist, Adil, was described adequately and had significant character development.+Many tragic views of reality were highlighted throughout the movie such as the wrong execution of plans that served a good cause, political neglection and other current affairs.It is my firm belief that despite the ending being not what I expected from a shark movie, as a shark movie fanatic, it was not terrible and represented an awakening call, explaining parts about the life of Paris.Overall, I hope the franchise gets renewed and a sequel is scheduled to be released in the following years, picking up the story from where it's left and summing up everything, covering all possible plot holes. It is a solid 7-8, but the extra points are a boost to a possible renewal.Thank you for your time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Having assumed it would be an equivalent to the sort of film ""The Asylum"" make, I was surprised and interested to see that it was initially not that - though in all honesty it gets there by the end.Having lost her crew, and husband, to Shark attack, on an expedition to the Pacific garbage patch, Sophia (Berenice Bejo) returns to Paris and works in an aquarium. Three years later she's contacted by an Environmentalist Mika (Lea Leviant) who explains that she's hacked shark tracking technology and that one has made it up the Seine, as far as Paris city centre. With Sophia refusing to help them, Mika and her associate Ben (Nagisa Morimoto) undertake the dive instead, with Mika being arrested. Mika, and later Sophia, try to convince River Patrol of the unlikely interloper, but with the Paris Triathlon imminent, the mayor (Anne Marivin) refuses to consider cancelling.At the start the film is actually reasonably sensible. The shark is played as a looming threat, foreboding in the background or whipping through frame too quick to get a good look at. There's a clear environmental message, where climate change and sea pollution has changed the shark's natural habitats. Berenice Bejo, who was in ""The Artist"" is a decent lead and does have some chemistry with impossibly heroic Soldier turned River Police action man Adil, played by Nassim Lyes.I guess the trouble with the film is that, towards the end it does drift into that 'Asylum' ""Sharknado"" territory with much more explicit use of the, now painfully cheap-looking, CGI Shark. I write my reviews without spoilers usually, and I'll continue to do so here, but I just don't understand how the ending happens. I liked how spectacular it was but where does the water come from?You never know with Neflix just how well a film has actually done, but there's a chance from that ending that sequels, or sister films might be forthcoming. I'd hope they'd find a more consistent tone, either way, serious, or campy, to be satisfying. This is neither.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Under Paris isn't a terrible film, but it's forgettable.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9846294/?ref_=tt_urv","nERDbOX_Dave","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur180109328/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2024","Under Paris dives headfirst into the monster movie pool, but instead of a sunny Florida beach, we get the unexpected - a killer shark lurking beneath the City of Lights. Now, there's something inherently fun about the absurdity of this concept.Bérénice Bejo is the marine biologist thrust back into the water after a personal tragedy, yada yada yada. We can't seem to escape that we've all seen this movie before, swimming alongside a larger-than-life predator with a taste for tourists.The influences are worn on its sleeve - a dash of Jaws here, a sprinkle of Deep Blue Sea there. The scares are predictable, relying on jump cuts and CGI that's a little too obvious in its chomping glory.The plot meanders a bit, with forced subplots about environmental negligence and political maneuvering that never quite gel and making you not care about the characters. There's a sense of missed opportunity, a chance to explore the claustrophobic terror of a shark in a network of tunnels beneath a bustling city.Things pick up in the final act, in a frantic, over-the-top finale that feels more like a desperate plea for memorability than a natural progression of the story.Under Paris isn't a terrible film, but it's forgettable. If you're looking for a mindless monster flick with a charming Parisian setting, this might do the trick. But for those seeking something truly terrifying or innovative, this shark might leave you feeling a little fin-ished.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"1","/10","1 star because I couldn't give it 0","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9846139/?ref_=tt_urv","sjbrown23","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30180208/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2024","I watched it because I had nothing else to watch on my plane ride or I would have stopped after the first 30 min (the opening scene was the only good part of this movie).It was so corny and predictable and I was rooting for ppl to be killed. It felt a lot like Sharknado but I liked that better because it was supposed to be corny. But I don't want to compare it to Sharknado because that insults Sharknado.I would recommend not watching it and wasting data to download it to your device and find something better. I don't see how it was trending - usually those shows are better / more watchable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
