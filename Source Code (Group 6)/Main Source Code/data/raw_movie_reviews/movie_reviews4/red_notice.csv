Had I heard about the movie prior to finding it on Netflix? Nope. But then again, I don't really bother keeping up with trailers and forthcoming releases.Writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurber definitely managed to put together a very entertaining and wholesome storyline and plot for ""Red Notice"". And it was a story that contains a good amount of action, comedy, thrills and plot twists. So yeah, I was certainly entertained from the very beginning and up to the end. And I must also admit that some of the plot twists were rather enjoyable and some that I hadn't foreseen coming.Needless to say that with a cast that includes Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson, then of course you are in for a stellar time with great performances. And the three lead performers definitely delivered. It should be noted that the performance from Chris Diamantopoulos and Daniel Bernhardt were also good, just wish that the latter had a bigger part to play in the movie.""Red Notice"" takes you all across the world in a wonderful heist adventure with interesting characters, fast paced action, good comedy and also good dialogue. And the fact that the movie was very dynamic in its cinematography definitely helped to sell the movie.You should certainly sit down to watch ""Red Notice"" if you get the chance.My rating of ""Red Notice"" lands on a very well-deserved eight out of ten stars.","239 out of 431 found this helpful.

The Rock is playing it straighter, as the alleged FBI profiler pursuing criminals around the world, but I wouldn't consider it award-worthy.It is that type of movie where scenes take place all around the world, each geographical shift announced in large, red letters screaming LONDON, BALI, VALENCE or whatever, each location being only a pathetic excuse to drag the plot along a little more. Said plot should be about recovering three golden eggs that belonged to Cleopatra, but when I wrote that, I realized how stupid it sounds, because it is stupid. It could have been about recovering Plato's papyrus or Caesar's chessboard, anything just as absurd and stupid sounding...The movie played on Netflix until the end only because hubby watched it, while I played a videogame and wondered if Reynolds was ever going to shut up.","163 out of 221 found this helpful.

First off, how can you not love the cast for this movie? Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot- clearly everyone knew that was going to be a win. The film has a lot of funny jokes spread throughout, and it's surprisingly shot very well. The action scenes are well choreographed, although familiar, and I will have to say in a technical aspect this film was really well done- as well as the visual designs, set pieces, and costumes throughout. As for the films story and screenplay though, I am far less thrilled. This film is just about the most generic action movie i've ever seen, like every heist film, Indiana Jones and James Bond had a baby- and it can be enjoyable at times, but it feels so empty all the same, and hardly makes for the potential a cast like this could have had in a film. The story is overdone, and there are so many formulaic and cliche attributes and twists that it can simply just be frustrating at times. It's quite baffling that a reported 200 million went into a film directed by the guy who did Rampage- by far one of the worst action films I can recall in recent memory- and yet it was done, and here it is? Do I think this film was worth the 200 million, absolutely not! Did it have its moments, sure. It's not a total bore, it had its fun parts, and it knew what its strengths were. In the end, Red Notice is not anything memorable or terrific.

The Rock is there for the action scenes although you might raise an eyebrow when he gets a beating from Gadot.It is high octane and a lot of mindless fun. I rather enjoyed it.

Even Gal Gadot who I like and find quite attractive in general, but have not enjoyed acting wise as much, is quite fitting overall.Ryan Reynolds is his usual funny self - stealing the show if you allow the pun. Even though he wasn't a producer on this and only ""acting"" in this one. He said in interviews that it was quite freeing (a Free guy at last, sorry had to) - experience wise.

"6","/10","A Red-Hot Heist Thriller With Lots Of Action, Twists And Power-packed Entertainment.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7508985/?ref_=tt_urv","SAMTHEBESTEST","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50463365/?ref_=tt_urv","4 November 2021","Red Notice (2021) :
Movie Review -Looking back at heist thrillers made in Hollywood, one can easily pick out best from recent franchise movies. Red Notice is a new attempt to glamorize those typical cliches and it definitely delivers what it promises from the trailer. It is not 'Mission Impossible' or 'Fast And Furious' Franchise Film but it makes a good combination of action packed entertainer and heist-thriller by altering many segments out of them. By the time we are going ahead with other franchise films and digital releases, Red Notice surely makes a fine popcorn entertainer for the weekend.An Interpol-issued red notice is a global alert to hunt and capture the world's most wanted. But when a daring heist brings together the FBI's top profiler John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) and two rival criminals Nolan and Sarah (Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot), there's no telling what will happen. John is on the hunt while Nolan and Sarah are fighting to top each other. All this is just nothing in front of what film has to tell afterwards. Spoilers are strictly condemned here! Mouth shut. There are plenty of twists coming one after another, there's breathtaking action and then there is gripping screenplay. Those 90 minutes never look boring and that's the biggest triumph for Red Notice.When it comes to acting, these commercial potboilers aren't supposed to be tidy. Most of the people don't even care as far as they are enjoying explosive stuff. Red Notice is still decent there as Johnson looks pretty convincing as he carries his best suited macho image. Gadot sizzles in her Red Hot Avatar and in some scenes she beats out both the male forces. Compared to that, Reynold is quite a break as he succeeds to keep the humour alive. Talking about the action scenes and visuals, Red Notice gets a Green Signal. However, it is still red when it comes to using those old clinches. For instance, that smart heist in the beginning. You know how it's gonna happen and how it's gonna end cause all of it has been used hundreds of times before. We should be thankful to the action choreographer for literally taking away our breath a few times as well as the cameraman for those jittering close-up frames and superfast zooms.There isn't much to bash in this film but still if there's in anything, then it's stereotypes. Visually, it's a grand film and the production value is lavish too. Watching this film on Big-Screen will snatch away lot of shortcomings so it should be viewed accordingly. Action lovers have became used to all the tricks by now so, they won't be too harsh on Rawson Marshall Thurber, as a director. As a writer, he could have done better though. Summing up everything in short, Red Notice packs a solid punch of Action, Twists and Suprises in an old healthy heist drama.RATING - 6/10*","81 out of 181 found this helpful.

Following Booth's capture after Hartley and Das secure the egg, the egg is found to have been replaced with a fake and with planted clues involving Swiss bank accounts and forged documents, John soon finds himself framed for the theft and is sent to the same prison as Nolan. Eventually John and Nolan are visited by The Bishop (Gal Gadot) who reveals she used her connections to take out her completion with Nolan and her top pursuer with John, and makes an offer to Nolan for 10% of the score if he reveals the location of the final egg. Nolan refuses and The Bishop leaves them to secure the second egg with her expiring offer. Eventually John and Nolan are forced to team up with John after clearing his name and Nolan regaining the title of the world's #1 art thief.Announced in 2018, Writer/Director Rawson Marshall Thurber's buddy action-comedy Red Notice was acquired by Universal following a heated bidding war not unlike Thurber's previous film package Skyscraper which in 2016 was also considered a highly desired package. Following the somewhat tepid response to Skyscraper at the box office, Universal became apprehensive of Red Notice's $160 million price tag and the package was put into turnaround with Netflix acquiring the project as part of the slate of originals and when partway through filming like many productions in 2020 suspended production due to the COVD pandemic, eventually the film continued with readjustment in the final months of 2020 and was a harrowing experience for the cast and crew. There's certainly a lot of fun in Red Notice, but there's not much making Red Notice stand out.The film opens pretty strongly with a History Channel esque overview of the three bejeweled eggs which serve as our Macguffins for the movie which leads into a very strong opening chase in Rome with an elaborate museum heist, some really strong visual flourishes, and an elaborate action sequence involving collapsing scaffolds that's beautifully choreographed with graceful movements and nicely sets the stage for the playful action-comedy caper the movie strives for. The movie basically mixes a traditional buddy-action film set-up like 48 Hrs. Or Lethal Weapon, and mixes it with a bit of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and maybe some National Treasure thrown in for good measure.While the movie has all the elements in place for high concept fun, the way they're assembled is unfortunately not to the level you'd hope for. Dwayne Johnson does well in the slightly acerbic hardscrabble action-hero even if admittedly it's very familiar territory calling to mind Johnson's stints in everything from Escape to Witch Mountain to even this year's Jungle Cruise but Johnson's such a charismatic presence he carries a lot of good will with him. Ryan Reynolds on the other hand I found really grating as a presence for much of the second act of the movie with the character seemingly trying to be a fast talking BSer, but instead comes off more like a petulant child who's acting out in ridiculous ways. I think maybe Reynolds was going for something along the lines of what Steve Martin did in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels where he's ""successful"" as a thief despite himself, but that type of character really only works when it has a grounded counterpoint that can give the character as good as he gets and Johnson never really attains that comedic friction with Reynolds more often looking like he's grumpy and trying to ignore Reynold's antics rather than react to them.And then we have Gal Gadot as our antagonist The Bishop and Gadot is unfortunately rather wasted here playing what basically amounts to an Amoral spin on Lara Croft (90s continuity, not the reboot) and aside from maybe a scene where she and Dwayne Johnson do a tango at an arms dealer's gala Gadot doesn't really have much presence as an antagonist coming off more as a minor obstacle more than anything else. The same is true of Ritu Arya's Inspector Das who despite her best efforts doesn't carry herself with much authority in the role of an Interpol agent and has even less presence than Gadot. Eventually after the rather flabby mid section of the movie the movie does pick up a lot in the third act with a fun sequence involving a bunker which leads into an underground car chase where multiple conflicting parties are all involved and the ending was twisty enough that I'm inclined to look upon my viewing experience in a mostly positive light, but I'm probably not going to be watering at the mouth for another adventure for these characters.Red Notice is an okay light action comedy with some impressive set pieces and a fun sense of adventure. The characters are unfortunately not on the level of other caper films that Red Notice aspires to be and Reynolds unfortunately comes off as pretty grating at certain points in the movie, but in terms of light hearted time killers you can certainly do worse.","23 out of 46 found this helpful.

After their deaths the eggs were lost until two were discovered in 1907. One is in a Rome museum, one is owned by Sotto Voce, an arms dealer, and the other is still lost.After a tip off from an art thief known as 'The Bishop, 'FBI Profiler Special Agent John Hartley believes that rival art thief Nolan Booth is planning to steal the first egg so heads to Rome with Interpol agent Urvashi Das and a team of police to arrest him. The operation appears to go well but the egg disappears; Hartley is accused of being involved and finds himself in the same Russian jail cell as Booth. Hartley wants to clear his name and arrest the thieves but to do that he will have to form an unlikely alliance with Booth and seek the eggs. Before the adventure is over they will have visited several countries and faced various dangers. There will also be further twists.It must be stated that this is a fairly silly film that requires the viewer to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride; if one can do that it is rather fun. There is a lot of action in a series of exciting set pieces; fights; chases, shooting and explosions but nobody is seen to be killed. There are plenty of laughs to be had; usually provided by the banter between Booth and Hartley. The three leads; Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Godot put in solid and enjoyable performances as Hartley, Booth and The Bishop; other notable performances come from Ritu Arya as Urvashi Das and Chris Diamantopoulos as Sotto Voce. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want a brain-in-neutral thrill ride with excitement and laughs but not much to cause offence.","39 out of 87 found this helpful.

Needless to say, they are quite valuable with the first being displayed at the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, the second one owned by a private collector and the third having never been found. So, when the word goes out that a rich Egyptian billionaire will pay $300 million for all three of these eggs to present at his daughter's upcoming wedding, ""Special Agent John Hartley"" of the FBI immediately heads to Rome in anticipation of a heist. However, when he and Interpol agent ""Urvashi Das"" (Ritu Arya) arrive at the museum they discover that the egg has been stolen only minutes before by an infamous jewel thief named ""Nolan Booth"" (Ryan Reynolds). Naturally, a manhunt is immediately ordered but complicating matters is the fact than an even more notorious jewel thief by the name of ""The Bishop"" (Gal Gadot) also wants all three eggs and she is even better at this business than Nolan Booth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say this was an enjoyable action film for the most part with some good comedy thrown into the mix as well. Admittedly, some of the action scenarios were a bit too far-fetched in my opinion, but all things being considered I found this to be an entertaining movie all the same and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

With a cast as strong as the Rock himself, I had a lot many expectations from this movie. It is a classic Now You See Me meets National Treasure and Indiana Jones to give a heist movie of this standard after a long time. With Gal Gadot and her amazing moves, the movie takes a lot of twists with history entwined to its very core. John Hartley played by Dwayne Johnson collaborates with Nolan Booth, a conman, played by our very charming Ryan Reynolds to catch the greatest art thief of the world, the absolute beautiful Gal Gadot herself. Now, if you go into the movie thinking you will have an out of the world experience and it will be something different, then you will surely be disappointed. It is like any other Police thief collaboration movie that you may have watched in the past with a pretty straightforward plot and almost expected twists at the end of movie. With a budget of two hundred million dollars and the tag of Netflix's costliest movie, it will just give you Dwayne, Reynolds and Gadot which, let's be honest, is why many of us decided to watch this movie in the first place.I give red Notice a solid 7.5 because it delivers an amazing bantership between Reynolds and Johnson as promised, lovely Gal Gadot and her moves and not so shocking twist towards the end of it. Although with a duration of one hour and fifty-five minutes, the movie does not seem like a stretch because of the action-packed scenes and Reynolds witty one liners. But if you have watched movies starring Dwayne Johnson, you will realize the character played by Dwayne is almost so similar in each of his movie, the tough guy who beats all odd and weirdly the same goes for Ryan Reynolds, funny guy with a lot of tricks up his sleeves and so help me God for Gal Gadot as well, a beautifully gorgeous lady with mind blowing fight moves and a sharp mind. These actors are so immortalized in their characters and they more or less play the same characters with the same trope that the movie really felt like a thousand version of Jumanji meeting Free Guy and crashing the Wonder Woman party.You can watch it for the action, comedy, Gal Gadot and for the marriage of convenience between Dwayne and Reynolds, our work wives. It is no doubt hilarious and delivers on the glamour and action packed party front and gives a not so subtle nod to a possible sequel that might be in the making. All in all, if you have two hours to spend and want to watch a comedy with action and glamour, this is your movie. Binge away folks.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

You don't need to look very closely to recognise aspects of films like 'Raiders of the Lost Arc', 'National Treasure', 'True Lies', 'Hobbs & Shaw', etc. There's even some jokes in here that directly point out how generic the plot is, including a funny line where Booth, while looking for one of the eggs, says ""Look for a box that says MacGuffin"". It's that kind of movie. It's that kind of script. Although there are certainly way too many plot contrivances, I knew going in that this wasn't going to be the most intellectually stimulating film. This is one of those films that you're not supposed to think too hard about. 'Red Notice' is an action comedy. It wants you to just relax and enjoy the silliness, so that's exactly what I did.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's got plenty of twists (that are so obvious in some cases its kinda still impressive the film goes for them), globe trotting set pieces and so many jokes that may not be hilarious but are consistently chuckle worthy.Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds have excellent chemistry, building on what worked in their brief screen time in Hobbs & Shaw. Reynolds plays completely to his strengths but Johnson does actually go against type at points even if it's still unfortunately on his own terms. Gal Gadot is great effectively playing against type as a gleefully evil antagonist.Rawson Marshall Thurber's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and mobile courtesy of some of the better drone shots in a Netflix blockbuster. The CG is mostly solid with some bad moments (the bull scene in particular) and the music by Steve Jablonsky is really good, it's greatest strength is how unabashedly old fashioned it is.","31 out of 69 found this helpful.

It's claiming to be action, crime and comedy, and to me that states a good pace that will be entertaining. They did not do me wrong, as Thurber's movie moves very well for the genre, making for fun, laughs, and the anticipated thrills that this combination promised. A simple story opening does little to draw out setting the stage, before the first sequence opens up for enjoyment and banter, doing little to go on tangents as they keep to the script. It's got plenty of connecting moments that help reset the faster intense stuff, and keeps that speed fairly even from start to finish, something difficult in this day and age.The Story:
It's simple, it's stupid, but it works with the promised cast and executes it well for a streaming movie, (that once was destined to come to theaters). Red Notice has some decent character insight for two of the major characters, and the third serves as a decent antagonist, allowing for three strong characters to follow. It's the crime element that I particularly enjoyed, not so much for the ""hidden treasure"" aspect, but more so in the game of cat and mouse they built. A proper foundation that served the comedy and action components, it was a success for me in the comedy crime film that again remained fun and entertaining.Twists:
The movie does a fairly good job with the twists, most of which I predicted and few I got most of the way, but not to the full extent. Thurber's writing managed to put these twists in naturally, not going out of its way to force a 90 degree turn, and never breaking the rules of the universe to do it. It's clever writing, it uses subtle gestures to lay the foundation, and then finds the right time to execute things in order to maximize the surprise. Should you be one who pays attention to the dialogue, you might find the hints obvious and giving you the pieces, but if you are a hear and forget, then get ready for some decent chess playing with this group. Overall, very happy with the script and story if you have not guessed.The Acting:
It works very well for the four people who are primarily in the film. Ritu Arya as the detective works for me, the strong woman leading the force, with her mind set on bringing justice. Her fluid international language is great, her style is amazing in the outfits, and she has the scowl very well for me. To the top billed cast, I'll start with Gal Gadot, who was not bad for me in this film, but it was also not my favorite performance. She has the cool and calm spy motif down, she's stylish in the clothes you expect of someone who is a master thief, and for the seductive parts of the movie we've proven her class in these moments with Wonder Woman. However, in comedy she still needs work, and I did not find her quite funny like others did. Her words seemed forced, her laughter seemed very fake, and her comedic delivery still has some fine tuning to get to the level I think she was going for. Ryan Reynolds executes his usually, over the top, die hard comedy role to an amazing level once again. Deadpool without the mask, swords, and skill, his mouth continues to be his strongest weapon and it works very well for much of the movie. Reynolds style meshes well with just about everyone in this film, and though its firing comedic bullets at rapid rate, most hit super well given the timing and balance with the other characters. Those who say he carries the movie, they are right to an extent about his jokes being the element to get most people into the film and keep them going. As for Dwayne Johnson, well the big guy is also comfortable in his usual role of the big, brawn, sarcastic hero who tries not to have vulnerabilities. Stereotypical, and stale, as it is, he makes it work and thanks to Reynolds, helps ground the ridiculous amounts of comedy and keep that stalwart good guy to conflict the bad guy. Regardless, the three of them play very well together, and I enjoyed the heck out of the chemistry they had during this film.The Nostalgia/nods:You know me and the movie geek I am, so naturally, was very happy with the success of sneaking in some fun homages and parodies to time honored movies. Red Notice takes a lot of motivation from the spy films of the past, and finds a way to sew them together to be present without overwhelming. Indiana Jones, James Bond, Spy Vs. Spy, and more are all ready for you to enjoy in the new pain they have. I had fun with the comedic use of these moments, and seeing how they formed the foundation for many of the scenes. And if you like to play games and tally what movies you can find, this serves as a good party game as well.DISLIKES:Some of the Writing:
It could be a sensitive me, but I felt there were times where the battle of the sexes got a little heavy handed when Gadot was involved. Red Notice has scenes that really seem to promote superiority and though some are in good fun, others are a little too agenda based for me if I'm being honest. Fortunately, those moments are few and far between, but they can derail a good moment that was building up, and I would like to continue to avoid these moments if at all possible.The Action:
It may be exciting and fun, but Red Notice's comedy stick gets a little in the way of what I like to see in my action scenes. The first scene offers a lot of promise at clever moves, fast chases, and comedy mixed together, and some of that promise is delivered. The second fight is not bad, but you start to see a major problem arising with the movie and how they handle the extras that I won't spoil, and has a few too many convenient things happen. However, the third fight made famous by viewing scenes on YouTube, it's okay and funny at times when I was watching it. However, the combat is stiff, the moves are very planned out, and the editing could only hide so much/change so much to be intense and satisfying. By the fourth and fifth action scenes, the momentum was starting to be lost and I never felt any close calls for our cast, so the action element is a little blander for people who like more suspenseful seasoning.Comedic fatigue:
The movie as I said is loaded with a lot of jokes, and sometimes that element gets a bit stiff and boring for almost two hours. Reynolds is funny, but without the Rock, his volume of comedy might have been a little too much for me given how they refused to change things up. Gadot as I said is not that funny for me and Johnson's sarcasm is the thing that seemed the most consistent and even paced in the movie for me. If you love your comedy filled with unrelenting jokes and jabs, then you are in good shape, but a little break could have gone a bit more for this film.More use of Arya:
Given the premise of the story, I would have liked a little more involvement, ingraining and planning with the use of Arya's character. She is a very good actress for me, and her character as the unyielding cop was an obstacle that could have helped further the chase and interactions of the film. Sadly, the cop has a few elements meant to be fun in her role as the tool, but never quite delivers the full justice I think she could have achieved with more time and planning.The Cameo At The End/Ending:
Just as the movie was finishing on a strong note and could have cut there, we had to go one step too far for the finale. Red Notice gets to the moment they are all talking about, and in this brief diversion, we had to force in a cameo from someone who has already proven to struggle with the camera. While there was some comedy factor for me in this person's inclusion, including a nod to the aforementioned flop, by this point it was sort of last minute tag on that felt off from the rest of the movie. And though it opened up for the ending and tying everything together into a neat little loop, there could have been something better or more imaginative given the creativity muscles flexed today.The VERDICT:
For a direct to stream movie on Netflix, Red Notice did not disappoint on many factors in terms of movie quality. Thurber's writing is clever and well-paced, allowing for the entertaining factor to ring strong in this film, and it's engaging simplistic story is worthy of the small screen. Comedy has loads of lines to choose from, and a cast of characters that plays very well together to make this crime/comedy piece a fun home viewing. Throw in the twists and turns, alongside the fun treasure hunt of references and again you check a lot of boxes for a fun film. However, the movie still suffers from overdoing the comedy at times, forcing it on to many scenes and sometimes giving away a little too much for the surprise factor. The action is okay, nothing special, but at keeps with the theme of fun this movie is going for, though again the convenient factors are a bit too much for viewers like me. Outside of the ending being a bit muddied, the movie is well worth viewing and having fun if you give it a try. My scores for this film are:Action/Crime/Comedy: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.5.","30 out of 91 found this helpful.

Yes, it's derivative, laced with clichés pointless twists but it breezily skips along like the likes of The Mummy (1999), The Tourist, mixed with the National Treasure films. With a cameo and Ed Sheeran you know who this is aimed at. With music by Steve Jablonsky, reminiscent of a James Bond score, modern tracks are thrown in for good measure. As with the film itself it tries to tick every box and hit every demographic.Overall, fun, fast-paced and frequently amusing, Rawson offers a sickly sweet competent film, you'll either love it or hate it.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

This is what it is and what you'll get, and for that the film deserves kudoos, praise and, contrary to apparent popular opinion, a solid seven stars.Ryan Reynolds is the highlight of the film and is in tip-top shape. His comedic timing is second to none in Hollywood and it shines. In Red Notice he hides a versatile actor deftly behind childish jokes, acting with his eyes more than his overly foul mouth. It's simple really, if you don't like Reynolds, don't watch. I myself, love the guy.Dwayne Johnson may be the 'woods main actor right now, but he understands he plays second and third fiddle, apart of course for his athletic abilities, to Reynolds and Gadot.Speaking of Gal Gadot, her 'dame in the red dress' suits her well: cool and calculated calm, giving the film an intelligent sexiness, at least as far as can be expected for a low IQ heist flick like this. She's having fun and it shows.Quickly the rest: good shots (especially the opening shot), extremely clichéd spy music, a flimsy script, plot-holes the size of the Atlantic, tear-jerky character development, unlikely action scenes, surprisingly great custome design and plenty of clichés in the dialogue. Also Ritu Arya, playing the fourth main character, deserves special notice.It is what it is, so do yourself a favour, ignore reviews that don't take films like this at face value, grab some of Reynolds' Aviation Gin, and get ready for some stupidity, yet also stupidly well timed jokes. And in that primary goal, it succeeds.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

That is the case with Red Notice. Only this time its two actors. Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson.Reynolds is Booth, a master thief who is being pursued by Johnson's FBI agent, Hartley. Through a series of unfortunate events they both get arrested and wind up cell mates in an austere prison in Russia. Eventually, a third thief known as The Bishop (Gadot) joins in the fun as all three are looking for some mysterious golden eggs that once belonged to Queen Cleopatra.If you ignore the obvious plot holes, this flick is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours. There is a lot of witty banter between Reynolds and Johnson, as well as the obligatory explosions and action set pieces. Oddly, no one is shown dying in the movie, but its obvious some people get seriously maimed. Its all kind of a watered down Raiders of the Lost Ark without the great set ups. Still, Reynolds, Johnson and, to a lesser extent, Gadot, are charming and you can't help but enjoy them. It just felt like Gadot's character was tacked on once they found out the actress was available to star in the movie. She doesn't really bring anything to the film, but I guess she is lovely to look at.The plot twist at the end comes out of nowhere and makes no sense in light of the events of the movie. It doesn't ruin the movie for me, but it did take off some of the luster. Again, it felt tacked on just to provide a twist without any real set up during the events of the film.I gave this a 7 out of 10 because the three actors are just fun to watch.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yet another lifeless and emotionless story finds its way into production. That is what Red Notice is, a B class movie with some big name actors to beef it up a notch. Going in I had mixed feelings, I'm a fan of Dwayne and Ryan so was excited to see them together but I also watched the trailer which didn't excite me in any way. With Dwayne you know what you're getting, a big dude who brute forces his way through walls and people and sometimes has a quirky remark or two. With Ryan you get his quick wit and style of comedy that's made him hugely successful but even with all that it just seems so off. The ""Jokes"" feel forced and the action is cookie cutter predicable nonsense that feature no wow moments, atleast not for me. The story goes nowhere and other people mention ""twists and turns"" but I was so zoned out I couldn't care if it turned out the actual queen of Britain appeared in the film and she was the master thief. Overall a poor story, poor action and only barely saved by throwing in some decent actors. In my opinion it's a film you put on in the background while you sit on your phone.","90 out of 139 found this helpful.

The formula is familiar: elaborate heists in interesting scenery, comedic banter between reluctant partners, plot twists and back stabbing, and some good ol' over-the-top action sequences. Reynolds and the Rock are having clearly having fun with this. This is the kind of lighthearted entertainment that we haven't had a lot of the past few years on the big screen.But Gal Gadot... something about the Bishop just rubbed me the wrong way. Her character is an unadulterated Mary Sue, and she irritated me to no end. And unlike the other leads, her performance is lackluster and lacking chemistry. Not sure if it's the result of the writing or the casting, or perhaps an unfortunate combination of both, but after a while I inadvertently cringed every time she appeared on screen. Too bad, because this movie could actually have been good with a better Bishop.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So I give this a 8/10. Using popular actors surely made the movie famous but I don't see anything wrong with that as long as the movie is good. Lot of plot twists were included but they were kinda predictable . Too jokes on serious scenes . But made the movie funnier . The movie actually shouldn't be categorized as crime tho . Its basically a comedy . And that's why i love it . You might love it too if you like comedy. Not recommended if you expect to see a serious crime based movie.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is a light-hearted, fun, action, adventure treasure hunt film reminiscent of the Nicholas Cage NATIONAL TREASURE movies.Don't be expecting hard-hitting, gritty action in this one. Instead, expect light-hearted action with fast banter, faster cars and bullets that - to no one's surprise - fails to land in any human being. Automobiles, equipment and buildings are destroyed - but humans...? Not so much. They just pick themselves up, dust themselves off and start all over again.The acting in this is ""as expected"". The Rock is tough, muscular and charming. Ryan Reynolds is fast-talking, conniving and charming. Gal Gadot is mysterious, tougher-than-she-looks and charming. They play off together well and add a little higher level of quality to this film than it probably deserves.That's because the script, plot machinations, twists, turns, double-crosses and banter are all pretty much run-of-the-mill. It is not anything special, but nor is it bad. It is ""fine"" and with these 3 talented performers at the forefront of this, it lifts itself to ""better than fine"", it's a good family film that all can enjoy.The Direction and Action sequences by Thurber are just as pedestrian and run-of-the-mill but just as entertaining none-the-less. I think the charm of this film is it's predictability. It's like putting on an old pair of sweatpants. Your'e not going to wear them to the Oscars, but for sitting on the couch after a full family dinner on Thanksgiving, it fills the bill very well.The film is light enough for kids (though they do drop the ""f-bomb"" once or twice). It's just edgy enough for tweens/teens (hence the ""f-bombs"") and a rollicking good time for the adults with enough self-awareness of what they are doing that the actors (first and foremost Reynolds) almost looks like they are going to address the camera to comment on what's going on at any moment.And that, too, is part of it's charm.Letter Grade A- (it's probably a B+, but since it is my answer for ""Family Film of the Holidays"", I'll give it an A-).8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, after finally viewing it I am somewhat disappointed. The whole film is so tongue in cheek that it is almost a spoof; I was not expecting that. While there is action and globetrotting afoot, the plot and character development are lacking with coherence taking a backseat to convenience, especially toward the end. I couldn't even tell you the characters names as it's all so superficial, stilted, and underdeveloped. Though we do learn the two male characters have father issues. That seems to be the theme of the film -- a rotten father can spoil a son's future.Though this film is aware of its own silliness and frequently points it out while poking fun at it. However this self-referential teasing does not excuse the aforementioned weaknesses. There are also way too many cultural references made, and the now all too common meta schtick of self-awareness by an art-form has grown tiresome. Too much of this film is snippets borrowed from other better films such as: Gladiator, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones (all of them), Fast and Furious (4 and 5 especially), and some scaffolding stunt-work we've seen better done in Quantum of Solace and some Jackie Chan movies. And the three main characters remain ill-defined to me and are little more than stock characters which each actor and actress has already played now in several movies. The Reynolds wise-cracking schtick also gets tiresome.However, I do understand that there is nothing new under the sun as Solomon once said, but there just wasn't enough meat here for me to get excited about. Nevertheless it is a mildly entertaining ride, even if somewhat long and incoherent. I rate it a 4/10.","49 out of 74 found this helpful.

This is another film about a heist of valuables, in this case the legendary golden eggs of Cleopatra. As with most films in the genre, it has plenty of action and adventure, very good direction and scenery in luxury houses, in the jungle, in old abandoned basements, etc., with an unusual trinity, the classic cool character of adventure ""The Rock"", the charming but also very smart and powerful 'Wonder Woman' and the comic athyrostomus ""Deadpool"" in an ancient treasure hunt! Despite the opposing interests and the conflicts between them, eventually either the two of them or all three of them will be forced to cooperate and the cooperation will be followed by betrayal and change of side with pot twists. A film that does not want to become as serious as the classic Indiana Jones or other films of the genre, the athyrostomy of ""Deadpool"" could have been excluded though, as well as the excessive humorous element in from time to time, as the adventure alone was more than enough to earn the interest of the watchers. Nice recommendation to spend some relaxed time and enjoy, but due to the athyrostomy of the never serious Reynolds is not recommended for families or young children.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

You can't get any better than that. I'm going to say this now, this film was way better than I ever anticipated! I love action movies, especially heist movies, and this film is Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible and James Bond mixed into one. When Ryan Reynolds is present, of course there's going to be comedy. The writer did a great job because I feel like the comedy lasted from start to finish. I've noticed with other films that there may be a couple funny scenes and that it, but Red Notice has it throughout. Not only was the comedy great, but the fight/chase sequences were amazing! I was smiling the whole way through, just blown away by how the filmmakers accomplished everything. Also, there are many twists that you probably won't except, so beware. The cinematography was great, the whole film looks beautiful. The VFX overall was great, however some shots in the mineshaft scene looked a little fake. Other than that, very well done. So if you want to be entertained for two hours straight with action and comedy, Red Notice is the film for you.","27 out of 71 found this helpful.

Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson stars as an FBI profile tracking down Ryan Reynolds' character, one of the most wanted art thieves in the world. 'Wonder Woman' Gal Gadot features as the mysterious 'Bishop' a legendary art thief who is considered a myth created law enforcement officers to hide their incompetence.Unfortunately, rather that gelling well together, the three superstars get in each other's way consistently. Ryan Reynolds does deliver some good laughs with his witty dialogues in the first half, but the jokes wear thin in the second portion and completely fizzle out by the climax. The 'Tango & Cash' dynamic the director was trying to construct between him and Johnson fall apart due to poor, one dimensional dialogues given for the Rock's character and a lack of imagination with regards to physical comedy.Buddy-cop movies like Central Intelligence (2016) and Hobbs & Shaw (2019) worked primarily because the characters had well-written back-stories that the audience can buy into, backed up with witty writing and well thought-out and expansive physical comedy. Unfortunately, Red Notice falters on all three fronts.The character back stories and motivations are flat and uninventive and make only a superficial impact on the audience. The McGuffin effect the 'artifact' they are chasing throughout the movie creates is laughable at best, such is the ease with which they track the 'clues' and finally get to it. Gal Gadot is criminally underutilized and hits every 'femme fatale' trope to a tee.British-Indian actress Ritu Arya plays the classic bungling, inept Interpol officer chasing these dreaded art thieves across all the fancy locales in the world one can think of. There is also a surprise cameo that makes you feel for the celebrity rather than take you by surprise.And ultimately that is the true failure of 'Red Notice'. It completely fails to catch the audience by surprise at any portion in the tedious 1 hour and 58 minutes spent sitting through this dumpster fire.It is a travesty that three of the biggest names in action were brought together only to achieve such disastrous results. Not recommended!","14 out of 18 found this helpful.

Apparently, like Roger Rabbit and his fellow toons, the characters can't be killed by any amount of pummeling or plummeting and a moment later they'll be cracking jokes. Nothing wrong with that, as long as the disconnect from reality is deliberate and clear. Sadly, another disconnect is that apparently a stunt double is doing all the athletic work for Gal Gadot in the fight scenes. I hope it's just age and caution that's sidelined Gadot and not her accumulation of injuries.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

There is a Hallmark Christmas Channel, right? Because that's ALL that was on 24-hours a day.Did it start before Thanksgiving or on Thanksgiving or were they able to RESIST the commercialization of the Christmas Holiday we all must endure beginning just prior to Halloween? I don't know. All know is every movie at Christmastime is the EXACT SAME STORY told with different (white, upperclass) characters living comfortable lifestyles in different places all over the country but always somewhere that it always snows BEFORE Christmas.My point? Every story is exactly the same. And THAT'S what Hallmark viewers want.And that's EACTLY what this movie reminded me of. A Hallmark Channel Original Movie that tells the exact same story every, single time, just with different characters.There is a real market for such movies and this movie could well be the Premier Offering for such a channel.It's not that the story is bad. It's not.It's not that the acting needed to tell the story is subpar. It's not. With Ryan Reynolds and The Rock playing Ryan Reynolds and The Rock the acting is wonderfully O. K.And it's not that the story doesn't have enough twists, turns, and reversals to keep the plot plotting. It does.The chase scenes, the fight scenes, the jokes and humor... it's all there!And that's what a large enough number of people want that made it financially worthwhile to produce this movie and tuck away a tidy profit for everyone.Who am I to criticize?So, hey! Six Stars. And if that's not enough of a warning for you, you deserve what you get if you don't enjoy it.

Terrible acting. Terrible writing... Terrible story... Terrible dialogues... Terrible scenes.""I couldn't stand more than 15 minutes to watch myself turning into a moron, so I just quit in time. This is one of the most ridiculous, shallow, absurd and totally unnecessary productions. Don't even understand how these two leading male actors could still be seriously taken as ""Actors"", and got fans.","34 out of 51 found this helpful.

It has action, humor, romance, bromance and a tiny bit of emotion. Perfect movie to spend time.All 3 leading actors known for their narrow acting range do it to perfection. Gal Gadot is adorable in pretty much every scene she is in. She is cute, charming and aces the action scenes. Ryan still has that Deadpool acting glued to him. If that's what you want, you won't be disappointed. The Rock is same old same old.Watch the movie knowing what you are getting into and you will have a good time.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yes, it's pretty predictable, so don't expect to be blown away by the plot or any of the twists.

It looks slick with globe spanning settings, there's great chemistry between the actors and it has got tons of humor.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Its a little bit of a formula movie. The Rock plays the same role he nearly always plays, as does Ryan Reynolds.

The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) is playing the same character as he normally plays as well.It has a few plot twists, but none that are not predictable. I honestly just enjoyed watching Ryan Raynolds annoy the Rock.It is a heist movie and sees the chasts attempt to seal 3 eggs. The police are attempting to stop the criminals.It iw watchable but felt recycled.Nevertheless, it is probably one of the best things we have to pic from currently playing in the cinema.

But... at the end of the day, it was a fun ride beginning to end. The action sequences were pretty well done, and the physical sets were so beautiful that it makes you forgive the special effects, as obvious as they may be for some scenes; not to mention the fact that The Rock and Ryan Reynolds have a natural chemistry that it's impossible not to care for their budding bromance in this movie.

Nolan Booth is, of course, pursued by the intrepid FBI profiler John Hartley (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). And somewhere in the middle is the first greatest art thief known only as ""The Bishop"" (Gal Gadot) who tries to steal the eggs out from under the guys' noses.The Bishop frames Hartley making the international police believe he is not actually a FBI agent but actually an art thief himself, which then lands Harltey in a Russian prison alongside Booth. This is where things get moderately confusing in terms of the narrative. Hartley is forced to work with Booth to not only escape this Russian prison, but to also work together to steal Cleopatra's other two eggs. Why a devoted FBI agent decides to work with a career criminal, and time and time again decide to side with Booth instead of the police is not really explained, or at least not very well, in the movie.Confusing motivational narrative aside, it is a fun enough movie with lots of plans within plans within plans, and flashbacks from different perspectives which are pretty amusing. It is definitely a ""star movie"" where Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson plays Dwayne Johnson, and Gal Godot plays Gal Godot. So if you are not a fan of any of these actors' antics from other movies then I would recommend you steer clear from this movie. I don't hate these actors so I managed to have a fun time watching Reynolds and Johnson play off each other throughout the movie.The writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber, who worked with Dwayne Johnson at least two times previous in his films ""Skyscraper"" and ""Central Intelligence,"" managed to weave a relatively complex narrative with lots of overlapping plans and timelines into a film that is easy to follow. I enjoyed how all the little things said and done earlier turn out to be significant later on in the film. There were more than a few references to previous classic films similar to this heist genre. I especially liked the underground car chase which was clearly inspired by ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""I'm not sure there was a lot more to the movie aside from some funny chemistry between the main three cast members put into different locales. There were certainly some twists and turns throughout, but by the time we got to the final two or three twists I wasn't all that surprised. I have no idea why Hartley ""needs"" to join up with Booth to steal the eggs, no clue why the eggs ""need"" to be stolen for this mysterious Egyption family in the first place nor do we know anything about this family aside from a throw away 1.5 minutes near the end. It's a funny movie made funny by the heavyweight actors but there was never any real sense of danger or surprise. If the cast was made up by less confident (or less famous) people I don't think I would remember anything about the movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't expect a very plausible story though, because there are a lot of scenes that would just never happen in real life, scenes that are far fetched, but this is exactly what you get in this genre of movies. The Rock, or Dwayne Johnson isn't the greatest actor ever, but he seems to have found his genre of movies where he performs the best, that is action/comedy. I wasn't a fan of him when he was a wrestler but in this genre he's actually doing good. Ryan Reynolds also does the best in this genre, so in combination with The Rock it works perfectly. Gal Gadot is like always eye candy. Nothing bad to say about the acting. The only minor negative thing about Red Notice is the plot, but it isn't that bad if you're not too picky. It's a good popcorn movie, the kind where you leave your brain cells outside.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The teaming of him with Ryan Reynolds works immensely good (reminds me of the old classic comedy duos like Bing Crosby & Bob Hope, Dean martin & Jerry Lewis etc, etc). Its plainly obvious by films end that a sequel will be following and I'm very much looking forward to it (I just hope I'll still be around as I am quite advanced in age at this time)! I am not a fan of Cal Gadot as up to present day, 2021, I think she is no better than a mediocre actress; I definitely do not think she is a 'Hollywood Glam Star'...I honestly would walk right by her without any recognition whatsoever! She does not bring much to the table in this -IMHO- and there are far, far better suited comedy actresses out there for good looking, 'Femme Fatale' roles.If you want to see a very funny film that will give you a lot of old style fun and entertainment, then you will do well to see this...its a damn good piece of fun!","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

( Ryan Reynolds) tries to get hold of antique pieces in the shape of large sized eggs belonging to the times of Cleopatra. He is joined by a cop ( Dwayne Johnson) who is there to clear his name. Gal Gadot is also after it and a cat and mouse game ensues as both Dwayne and Ryan travel to some exotic places of the world like Rome, Bali, Valencia, Cairo, Argentina, Sardinia and London. There is excitement at every corner and one liners fly thick and fast between them as they tackle high technology security systems and hefty mean looking guards. There is the mandatory prison break too with the getaway chopper strategically placed in the vicinity. There is a secret underground cave right in the midst of a jungle in Spain and while escaping both face bulls in the fighting ring .What keeps viewers gripped are the mind boggling special effects, the excellent cinematography, and the pulsating music. All three main actors are on familiar terrain as they have done similar roles in the past in previous movies. Think "" Fast and furious "" and both Gal Gadot and Dwayne have done similar stuff. Ryan impresses as the smooth talking, happy go lucky art thief.However, to be fair, the movie is a few notches below movies of this genre. While the action appears to be on par, the barbs and the one liners don't really match up. Also you have seen it all in earlier movies and there is nothing new in the plot or action. At 1 hour 58 minutes, the movie appears a bit too long and even the action gets repetitive and tiresome at places. A sense of deja vu hits us in most sequences.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Some of you may be thinking that the whole time you're watching this movie. It's not awful, I think Gal, Dwayne and Ryan just set themselves up by being in many good movies, or at least massive blockbusters. That's the general expectation when any of them are the leading role in an action or comedy.This movie is what you'd generally expect from most Netflix, action movies. It's in that odd place where it's a budget much bigger than a TV-movie but obviously much smaller than a Superhero or large franchise film. Many of the scenes, even the action sequences, are clearly shot on a soundstage in front of loads of green screen. All the side-characters are ridiculous caricatures or mindless goons (the kind that can't aim) for the three main leads to either manipulate or beat up. It's nothing we haven't seen in literally every action movie.All the best scenes were in the trailers because of course they were. So, like always, going in blind will give you the best experience. There are so many call-backs to similar movies that Ryan breaks the fourth-wall and makes a pop culture reference to Indiana Jones and other movie tropes throughout...because this movie is filled with them. The soundtrack and background music sounds like royalty free music you'd pull from ""generic action film"".There are elements that hold it together. If it isn't obvious, Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot is probably the reason most of us would bother watching this. They gave Ryan a surprisingly good amount of comedic lines; he's basically playing the kind of character you'd expect. Gal and Dwayne seamlessly pull off their action sequences. And I think there's enough eye candy for everyone; but I would argue the actors are better eye candy than the shoddy CGI.The story isn't anything spectacular. You could probably do your laundry while watching and still follow along. This is good if you want to eat up 2-hours on a plane or long car ride.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And Gal Gadot is like a gorgeous wooden door, she is beautiful but she has no personality whatsoever, actually none of the characters have personality. The whole thing is basically famous actors running around and shooting and dodging bullets. It's forgettable, boring, and predictable even with all the twist they put in.

So, sure, the script writing required no high school diploma, but admittedly some of the jokes landed for me, and the Rock continues to be entertaining, despite his frequent monotony. Gal Gadot, who I don't normally care for, actually had the most personality of anyone in the movie, so that can be applauded. The predictability was hilariously bad up until the end, which I'll give credit where it's due. Action and suspense is so run of the mill and reliant on ""Hollywood convenience"" that it makes me think either they weren't trying at all or they were genuinely striving for a brainless flick.

Still, it is an entertaining movie that is wildly enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously. With a cast boasting three of the most sought-after A-Listers of its day, Red Notice wisely focuses on these characters giving each actor a chance to grace the screen with their unique charm. The movie advances rapidly from action set piece to action set piece. The moments in between are filled with Reynolds and Johnson's playful banter that is funny but not as natural as Kevin Hart's chemistry with Dwayne Johnson. Ryan Reynolds does a great job playing his character that fits his strengths, but there are times when Johnson and Gadot's characters start to venture into Batman and Robin levels of cheesiness. Yes, Red Notice has flaws, but it really is an enjoyable film, and I look forward to its sequels.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even the music cues are similar.

I'm guessing most of it went on the stars' pay, because in other respects this feels like what it is - essentially a TV movie. It had already put us in mind of Muppets Most Wanted even before it reached the Gulag (a comparison entirely to this film's disadvantage) and, unless I'm very much mistaken the bullfighting scene was modelled on an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. Gal Gadot demonstrates that she doesn't really have leading lady charisma; the lads do their best, working their personas hard, and the script isn't awful; but what's missing is any sense that any of it matters in the slightest to anyone.The action-comedy genre is hard to pull off. Comparing this with a successful example, Hobson & Shaw, yes, you need good stars, good banter, and fancy locations don't hurt. To that point, Red Notice does okay. But you also need plenty of convincing action, and a reason for the action that makes sense and that the audience cares about; and you need not to rely too much on CGI rather than real stunts and location shooting. Those are the things where it falls short.(If those comments about locations sound contradictory, put it this way: in this case the cameras have been to some nice locations, but I'm not sure that the stars went with them.)","19 out of 28 found this helpful.

I also appreciate that they have set us up for a sequel...which I would watch.Lush foreign settings for this con artist caper, along with a decent soundtrack, make this a complete adventure package.

The action scenes were handled well, especially the museum and the car chase scenes. The comedy cracked me up many times, especially from Ryan Reynolds, even though this was nowhere as funny as Hitman's Bodyguard's Wife.The duo between Ryan Reynolds and The Rock was decent, and it's mostly Ryan Reynolds that carried the relationship. Gal Gadot was beautiful as always, but she didn't have as much to do in the movie as she should.Plot wise, everything was predictable. It was so obvious when Gal Gadot's character would show up.

Besides the only two mentionable black actors (one being a singer in Italy and the other is a pilot appearing for a few seconds), the racial boxes have been checked and there is no political message ruining the plot. Well I was disappointed by the bull fight in Rome and people screaming ""vamonos"". It's like, oh the Americans, still aren't aware of European cultures. But hey, given the humor of this film I guess this was an intentional prank on stereotypes?Actually some good old 80s clichés have been baked in this cake of entertainment. I enjoyed the incredible fight scenes and the slapstick comedy. Ryan Reynolds got on-point comments and one-liners to cheer up the story. The nods to the Indiana Jones franchise reach their climax only by the theme being whistled. The story is quite smart for today's standards and there are some twists placed and timed carefully. Also the character development works perfectly by the book. The soundtrack from acclaimed Steve Jablonsky is a bit generic and the resemblance to the Bond theme is quite boring.According to the trivia page this is the fourth cinema movie collaboration of Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot. The pair previously have both appeared in three theatrical feature films - all from the 'Fast & Furious' franchise - they being 'Fast Five' (2011), 'Fast & Furious 6' (2013) and 'Furious 7' (2015).","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

My partner doesn't care for Ryan or Dwayne but since Gadot can't carry any scene they fell asleep within 30 mins :/There was a decent amount of dialogue giving you more background on some characters than most action movies provide allowing you to connect a bit with character.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This one, fortunately, was well worth the time if you can overlook its flaws.And its flaws are plenty. The plot cannot hold ANY water as it's full of holes. The characters' personalities flip-flops to fit into the storyline, and there are TONS of cliches and plot twists that again, makes little sense except for the sake of having plot twists.Look beyond all those though, the movie is actually a lot of FUN. The plot unfolds quickly and smoothly, and the pace is fast. For all its flaws, at least you never feel bored. Gal Gadot looks stunning in this movie, Ryan Reynolds is hilarious and the Rock is the Rock. All I looked for was a fun roller coaster ride and for that it sure delivered.No this isn't a movie that's gonna make you think about the meaning of life, nor is it one that make you laugh so hard you fall off your chair, but it is a fun 2 hours roller coaster ride action adventure movie, and I sure don't mind if Netflix keeps making movies like this.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie is rated PG13 yet it's so unrealistic it's impossible to suspend reality because it's literally every scene. They should've made this some sort of alternate universe where prisons are on mountain tops surrounded by nothing yet 2 guys can escape by throwing a snowball. I mean it's just ridiculous and I can take some over top because that's most movies now with CGI but there needs to be some realistic scenes in a movie for adults. Now if it was PG tans geared towards kids I'd get it.As for the acting, I don't think it's bad at all.

It is a movie that makes no pretense other than to be entertaining.The movie is a mixture of art heist thriller, Indiana Jones inspired treasure hunts and fast and furious chase action. All served with a large dose of humor.I have to confess one thing right away. Ryan Reynolds grated on me. I guess he was chosen to provide most of the comic relief and, to me, he is over the top silly not to mention dishonest (most of the time) in a way that was not really my cup of tea.Luckily Dwayne Johnson largely compensated for that. I have not yet seen a movie with Dwayne Johnson in that I felt was really bad. Also, sorry to all the Gal Gadot haters out there, I did like her in this movie but then, as guy, maybe I am a wee bit biased on that, you know what I mean.The story is bordering on the ludicrous with, mostly predictable, twists around every corner but then it is just there to tie the action sequences and jokes together so it is good enough.This is a movie that you watch for the silly action, even sillier jokes and, for me at least, because Dwayne Johnson is in it. It has a single purpose and that is to entertain. No bullsh.. preaching, no finger pointing and no pretense to provide food for your brain.I liked it. It allowed me to spend two hours together with my oldest son just being entertained.Oh, one more proof that it is a movie worthwhile to watch is of course the woke crappy tomatoes score. Note the discrepancy between their far left woke ""critics"" and the actual audience. Even that bullsh.. of separating the audience in ""verified"" and others couldn't hide the fact that their ""critics"" are totally out of sync with the audience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When Hartley nearly gets hold of Booth, he has a conspiracy theory known as The Bishop (Gal Gadot). For example, he can team up with Booth in trouble and seems to get out of it on his own with Booth's help, but the question is they can work together.This movie will first hit theaters, but thanks to the Corona, several movie studios have let go of buying the movie rights, eventually starting at Netflix. Thus, this has become the most expensive Netflix original film for now.Rawson Marshall Thurber has designed this film somewhat like a crime comedy, which you often saw in the 90s. The film comes across as a mix between Indiana Jones and the Ocean's Eleven movies, but with some more comedy elements. Because the movie comes across as a 90's movie, not all elements in the movie work, want to make something look outdated or unbelievable. Furthermore, the director has written the story a bit too simple and too directed. So on the one hand it comes to look at what it can be on the far-fetched side. So can come down to it, they aren't so funny anymore. The many plot twists make the story difficult to follow, or unbelievable.They have the film in several places, which can be mentioned in the film, but unfortunately the corona pandemic were unable to portray every place. That's why they brought out these scenes in the movie studio and with a green screen the backgrounds of these places. That these moments are not really local on screen, unfortunately they are on when you can see them again. Some random shots are via FPV drone. This is the first film in which this way of filming is used.The acting is well done by the film cast. The three major stars portray their roles well, but do this a lot in their familiar way. They seem a bit standard in this film compared to their roles in other films. Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds play nice together. Yet they come across more as people who are obliged to work together. The film tries to portray them as people who start to care more and more about each other during their collaboration, but they do not really achieve this status in the film and continue to come across as a duo that is forced to work together. Gal Gadot also does well in the film, but comes out more in the middle of the film, to do something with her role.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

The plot in this film is easy to understand, even if the start is a little weird to understand, but later everything falls on the right place. My first thought of this was: That was the sound of Netflix. You know when Netflix are making action movies, it is so predictable, always epic near-death situations, epic action angles and big, massive explosions. So if you are watching for entertainment, this could be a full star rating. Becuase I focus on more, I have some pros, and some cons. So the action was good. The Netflix concept of action is predictable, but I have to admit I liked it a little. Creative action sequences and some fun jokes, with very good plot twists from time to time, made this movie a great entertainment. Dwayne Johnson did play as always in his manly, funny, ironic way, with always that fun face, that always gives the smile. Some of the cons is that the start was a little confusing, but later of course it got better. The second was the originality. This could be a better planned story, and could put more deep into the characters. And of course the russians are the villains, that is so predictable. So besides predictableness and the story could be better made, it still got some fun Netflix entertainment, this is more of a movie you can just put on if you got to put on something on your watchlist.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I will not tolerate another. New streaming platforms available are hosting their own content, removing it from your platform. While your service continues to offer less content of questionable quality you dare to charge more money.Meanwhile we observe you carelessly waste our subscriber money. What justification could you possibly have spending 200 mil for a Ryan Reynolds action comedy? A movie that in the industry costs 35-45 million. Overpaying 5-6 times the market rate for a movie is pure fraud.$200 mil is a budget of a huge blockbuster movie: The Avengers, Avatar and Titanic. Movies that extensively used CGI and featured a large cast of A-list actors.Netflix instead paid three nobodies a $20 million salary each. A compensation that the very best A-list Hollywood actors would ask for. Netflix instead paid it to B-list Ryan Reynolds, B-list Dwayne Johnson and Z-list Gal Gadot who's an awful actress and never ever was paid anywhere near this much.Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot are both actors hired only for their physical appearance. Neither one is needed in this movie. Dwayne plays the straight man to Ryan's comedy and Gal plays a character without any specific traits other than being incredible off screen.There's no justification for either to be in this movie. There are countless talented actors that would deliver a better performance without the ridiculous compensation.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

The chemistry between Dwayne and Ryan works well for me; however sometime the dialogue can be a bit too silly. Although I don't see Dwayne is an outstanding actor I do feel he is at his best when he bounces off a comedic counterpart like Reynolds. Gal Gadot brings a red dress, along with a little more of herself into this. I feel with regards to playfulness and not taking things too serious this role works wonders for her. Shades of True Lies seems to be prominent in the dance scene between Johnson and Gadot, possibly a homage. What is most clear to me is this film takes us on an adventure to find three eggs in an Indiana Jones style action comedy; whilst it would have to go a long way to be considered into that bracket of film making, it does have many merits of its own. Pretty sure Reynolds even whistles the Indiana theme at some point to further the influence Indy had on this. The story has bit too many twists that in turn make it seem one step too far although I can accept it knowing the type of genre I'm viewing. It's far from perfect, for one I can't for the life of me see the John Hartley character as a legit cop because there is too much banter between him and Reynolds. If he is a cop he is very unreliable as well as making deals with the theft he embraces partnership on more than one occasion. This makes it very unlikely that he would've ever been taken on as a cop in the first place. The bishop (Gal Gadot) would be more believable as a cop as the stunts she pulls; I mean where exactly was she trained or did I not get the memo? Very little is told of the bishops background. Yet this is a film where we suspense belief allowing all logic to be thrown out the window. Overall it is an entertaining watch due to the fact our three amigos do a good job charismatically of bouncing off one another in a very natural warming way. At the moment these three are bringing in big bucks, not down to being outstanding or versatile still they are likeable and good investment. I must say I like all three actors in this, they each suit the role they have been given however I'd have probably had the three pair up as the conflict seems daft at times especially when we see how it all turns out.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Considerably, each one creating the suspension, and engagement within the plot and the action scenes.It is also interesting that this type of ""blockbuster"" is one of the biggest on streaming services, and should create a trend, in the near future, for new Action Franchises..Red Notice is a mixture of both genres (heist and adventure) and a creative addition to Action productions. The film plays a lot with combining several aspects of consolidated franchises, such as Indiana Jones, 007 , and Fast and Furious.What is crazier about all of this, is the gathering of huge names such as: Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot, on a massive streaming production. They all contribute with their chemistry (including the comedy relief of their interaction, especially, Dwayne and Ryan) and their performance on every single action sequences, which is fluid and natural. Gal Gadot, is stunning and steals all the thunder for herslef. Additionally to an amazing performance, the construction and development of her character, is cleary potentialized by her acting and passionate action scenes. Ryan, and Dwayne are also incredible!Moreover, the fim has a concise and linear perspective throughout the motive of the characters and narrative. However, it still lacks a little bit of detail within some of the character's ""decisions"" (screenplay) or establishment of a particular setting for the story. Although this gathers up for many unanswered questions, the film is pretty objective and understanding of the intention to portray the action sequences on a simple and straightforward heist movie.Consequently, my main problem with this film is some of the screenplay decisions, that seem to be completely misleading under the purposes of the main characters, especially in the third act and in the climax of the movie.Therefore, in overall, the movie is great, with amazing action sequences, great chemistry between the characters, inviting and family friendly.Ps: this type of blockbuster provided by streaming services, with no special requirements (photography, or screen need) is one of the reasons people are preferably not going to see it on the big screen (Cinema).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The storyline was nice, basic. The characters were well-developed, they were very interesting and very likeable (especially, the main three protagonists). The casting was really good, acting too. Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds were an amazing and a very funny duo. Gal Gadot was stunning as always. There were many intense scenes, action-filled. The idea of the film, of Cleopatra's stolen eggs was just nice. Overall, it was a nice movie, nothing new, but I enjoyed it! I don't think a sequel is needed, but I'm gonna definitely watch it. Also, there were some very funny scenes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ryan Reynolds is no different. And neither is The Rock. Looks like Gal Gadot is falling into that category of non-serious but top-billing actors as well. They're just playing themselves and cashing checks I every single movie they make. But somehow they continue to get the big action films, because these popcorn money makers are 100% formulaic - and certain actors slot nicely into the formula. Red Notice is not a bad film. In fact, it's a fun waste of time. It has a decent script, some good stunts and action sequences, and that reliable, predictable, familiar Ryan Reynolds/Dwayne Johnson brand of humor that carries a big chunk of the film. Don't expect to feel anything more emotionally than a chuckle, and awe at the CG toro.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The writing for the story was very good and the scenario almost constantly kept me interested, there are also some very nice one-liners but most of the jokes are cringy at best. I did however appreciate the pop culture references, like Booth whistling the Raiders of the Ark theme when entering a treasure cave. Lastly, what I really didn't expect was the historical accuracy. Even for a very tiny part of the film that has WW2 history, it's impressive to see that the writers did their research and actually based the scenario on real history. Also the equipment used in those parts is suprisingly accurate as well!Overall, a nice movie to watch with your friends/S.

Ryan Reynolds plays...Ryan Reynolds. The Rock honestly puts on, in my opinion, one of his better performances. He works very well as a straight man who doesn't need to carry the entire comedic load. Gal Gadot is sexy. She's sexy. Really, really sexy.The plot is...there. The action is fasted paced, and fluid. The movie never slows down too much to give you time to think out it.It's not a strong recommendation. If you skip it, you're not missing out on some grand experience. It is kind of nice to see a movie that doesn't get made much today. No superheroes. No licensed characters. No pre-planned franchise or cinematic universe.

Johnson plays the character he has played in pretty much every film he's in since he got into acting, and Reynolds too sticks to his well known witty repertoire. Gadot completes the trio and plays her part well, however the part is somewhat insufferable.Whilst everything comes together oh so well for the finale, that doesn't mean that perceived inconsistencies or coincidences that happen during the film aren't irritating at the time. Remove the con-man context and this plot could have been tweaked to make a great Indiana Jones film, it is an adventure and historical additions make a nice touch.Success in the dialogue does depend on Reynolds as the Rock is simply cast as the Rock. That said, if you enjoy Reynolds' or Johnson's films, you certainly won't be disappointed with Red Notice.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What could possibly go wrong?Unfortunately, quite a bit. While I would say the chemistry between the cast was decent, it was not outstanding by any means. Furthermore, though there were many scenes that were obviously done for humour, it was simply not funny. In each of their own films, they masterfully carry out their character's vibes.

Although the rating here has dropped from 6.9 to 6.5 within a short time, this rating still screams to heaven. ""Red Notice"" has holes in its logic that are unfathomable. Quick cuts don't change the fact that you sometimes wonder whether the screenwriter and director have even noticed what kind of nonsense they are shooting here. In addition, there are the usual gay references in a buddy movie, which I find embarrassing, inaccuracies in everything that is not set in the USA, such as tango music at a party of a rich snob in Valencia. The main thing is that they sing in Spanish, or what? And finally - even though I find Dwayne Johnson likeable and Ryan Reynolds sexy - the former is not an actor and the latter should stop adopting bad scripts with lousy dialogue. Oh yes, then there's Gal Gadot, who is actually just sexy and sneaky, so the usual female cliché in a film that was enough for a single tired grin on my part, but otherwise rather tempted me to check my mobile phone more and more frequently to see if someone hadn't sent me a message. That's how ""gripping"" this action comedy was.","15 out of 22 found this helpful.

All Directors, even the good ones, cannot necessarily write as we learned with Patty Jenkins in Wonder Woman 1984, and they ought to know the difference and surrender the script to professionals, so they can do their job even better.Better to pick a genre and a skill and stick with it, apparently.

The film has lots of action, some great sets and is highly entertaining as the duo bumble their way through this adventure.

"6","/10","Star Power and A Couple of Fun Twists Help Red Notice get a Passable Grade","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7551697/?ref_=tt_urv","CANpatbuck3664","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tt_urv","15 November 2021","The first thing that's going to get you to press play on Red Notice is the cast, we've got 3 legitimate stars (Gadot to a lesser extent but she still qualifies) leading the movie and that kind of mix is exciting. I was actually pretty disappointed with Dwayne in this, I blame the script though instead of his performance. His character refuses to cut loose and it's kind of a hallmark of Thurber's previous movies that if there's dual protagonists, only 1 of them gets to be funny and the other guy is there to occupy space and give the other someone to bounce off of. I didn't think Dwayne failed but minus the fight scenes, his sizable charisma is oddly bottled up. I had kind of an odd realization watching Gal Gadot in this, I like watching her on screen and she does have a charm/presence that makes her likeable. I've been one of the people defending her in the past but this movie made me realize that while she's fun to watch, she's just not a strong actor. She just couldn't get in sync with Reynolds and Johnson and while she's not awful, I had to re-evaluate a little bit. Reynolds repeatedly has to save this movie from itself, there are long stretches where there's just nothing going on except his banter. I wouldn't put his performance in the Deadpool tier but he is pretty funny in this and I had to appreciate it because if you take him out of the movie, Red Notice is DOA. Ritu Arya and Chris Diamantopolous are both solid if unspectacular in their respective supporting partsI have kind of a love/hate opinion on Rawson Marshall Thurber (he's pulling both screenwriting and director duties here). But through Red Notice, I achieved some clarity. I want to start with the positive, I don't mind Rawson Marshall Thurber as a director. The action scenes in this aren't great but they're absolutely passable, the locations are captured in a decent manner and the movie moves along at a decent clip (minus the scenes in prison which do drag). He also let Reynolds do his thing which as I mentioned above, he kept the movie going when there wasn't any urgency in the plot. So, I'm going to credit his work as the director in Red Notice, he got the job done.On the other hand, I just don't like Rawson Marshall Thurber the writer. His only real success as a screenwriter is Dodgeball and that was in 2004. This movie has all the generic and problematic elements of Central Intelligence and Skyscraper did, the plot is lazy, implausible and without any unique features. The character development feels so forced, John Hartley's profiling is sprinkled in but it doesn't gel or have any real bearing on anything and the whole daddy issues subplot could have been tossed. Where I will give him, a little slack is the ending twists, they aren't ground breaking but they did make me perk up. They also justify Dwayne and Gal's inclusion in the movie, you needed 2 actors/actresses with their charisma to lend credence to it so at least there's that. I'm not trying to attack him personally; it just seems like the screenwriting is the weaker part of his game (just like how Robert Rodriguez and Zack Snyder are better cinematographers than actual directors).I also left this movie a little worried about the globe trotting/adventure genre as a whole. Red Notice wears its Indiana Jones influence on its sleeves and it can't even touch that level. I don't blame Red Notice for that, that's a high bar to clear and many have tried and failed. Without just rambling about the Indy franchise (minus Crystal Skull), people can't determine what elements made those movies special. But I keep holding my breath that someone is going to find some of that magic and I feel like every movie that tries just can't figure out the recipe (I have heard good things about Jungle Cruise, maybe that romp is more satisfying).Red Notice is a fun enough couple of hours and for me, it's right on the line of whether to recommend or skip. Despite the movie wasting Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds does the heavy lifting and while the plot is pretty rote, the ending was just enough to reignite my interest. I still can't shake the feeling that this should have been much better than what was delivered, the big action scenes, this cast and an experienced enough director should have made this a home run. Setting aside expectations, there's just enough here to recommend it to less demanding audiences. It grades out as a 6.5/10 but I'm rounding down because of wasted potential. If you're looking for something like this, I'd actually recommend The Hitman's Bodyguard first (the original, I haven't seen the sequel), the story is just as cliché but Reynolds, Jackson and Hayek are much funnier as a team and the action scenes are about on the same level. My recommendation is if they decide to do a sequel, maybe bring in a new screenwriter to punch things up a little more.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Do you say the same about Indiana Jones movies or Lord of the Rings or Marvel or Star Wars? This is the whole POINT! I loved this first of all because it doesn't take itself seriously and is obviously meant to be sheer entertainment, which it is! Plus, in case you don't understand that, the story and the dialogue keep dropping hints about how the whole thing is a tribute to movie entertainment from the past. I won't list them here but you can tell the writers had a ball writing this stuff. It's almost like a catalogue of movie tropes wrapped in comedy and parody almost, but done in such a way that we're in on the joke, which I found very respectful of the viewers, unlike some people seemed to imply. I laughed quite a few times, never at the movie but with the movie, which seemed to be laughing with me. The movie worked for me from beginning to end, I instantly knew what this was going to be like and wasn't disappointed. Kudos and thank you to anyone involved in making this.

"6","/10","A Mildly Enjoyable Action Comedy with Enjoyable Leads","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7574675/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2021","It has been decades since films were released and garnered attention simply due to who was in them. Yes, every now and then a film comes out that nobody has heard of and ends up making money because of the stars, but it seems so few and far between these days. Netflix's Red Notice is the prime example of a generic action-comedy that's clearly banking on its leading performers. I'm a big fan of Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot has really grown on me as an actress too but based solely on the premise, I pretty much knew what to expect with this movie, and I was right. There is some fun to be had with Red Notice, but I'll probably forget I watched it a few months from now.Working for the BAU, detective John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson)is in pursuit of the most wanted art thief in the world, Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds). After Booth is captured and Hartley is double-crossed and ends up in prison with him, they eventually begin to work together to take down an even bigger thief in ""The Bishop"" (Gal Gadot). After a certain point, this film just started writing itself. I found myself rolling my eyes at the dumb stunts they were pulling off and all of the one-liners that you would expect from all of them. Yes, this cast has a lot of charisma with each other, but it wasn't enough to make it stand out from any other time I've ever seen them before.Red Notice is a film that honestly has about an hour of story to tell, but the film really lets these performers do their thing, a lot. There were multiple times where scenes drag on and I firmly believe it was all improv. This was both equally enjoyable and annoying. I laughed consistently throughout the movie, but also while scratching my head and cringing. It was almost a frustrating watch at times, even though I still fall on the positive side of the movie overall.Director Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also wrote the film, has always made films that ride the line of being both ridiculous and enjoyable, for the most part. I have a blast watching Dodgeball and We're the Millers and I've even enjoyed his work with Johnson on other projects like Central Intelligence or Skyscraper, but his films never take the extra step. Red Notice is by far his most ambitious film to date, I just think it's also the most he has ever had faith in his performers to run with the material however they like. As I said, I enjoyed myself, it's just riddled with soo many issues/inconsistencies.In the end, Red Notice is one of the biggest films Netflix has ever released as an original film and while I'm all for them continuing to do big-budget movies like this, I also feel like they just see a big name and say yes to a project. This is why there are very few Netflix original films that end up being great. For those of you who like action, comedy, or any of these performers in general, I recommend checking out Red Notice but also try to go in knowing it's nothing special and you'll probably have a disposable good time as I did. There are far better films currently out, but if you open Netflix and start streaming this one, I'm sure you'll at least find some mild enjoyment in certain scenes at the very least. Red Notice is now streaming on Netflix.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An unoriginal BLAST of a film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7541257/?ref_=tt_urv","sjhunt-50458","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139540570/?ref_=tt_urv","12 November 2021","I was really excited for this movie, largely because I'm a huge fan of The Rock, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, and to see this unlikely trio form in a high-budget action film was a treat to say the least.I want to start off by saying that this isn't an original film by any means, we've seen this before many times. The Rock is of course throwing guys around like ragdolls as always, Ryan Reynolds is of course cracking his typical but admittedly hilarious jokes while still having some action to do, and Gal Gadot (while being new to this sort of role) still feels like something we've seen before. But unoriginality doesn't mean it's crazily bad. The trio all do incredibly, and they all work very well together; particularly Reynolds and The Rock, but we did kinda get a taste of their dynamic in Hobbs and Shaw (2019), while Reynolds only had a small role. It's nice to see Dwayne Johnson work so well with an actor that isn't Kevin Hart. And the camera work is actually very well done; you can always tell what's happening in a fight scene which is always a plus. The action, while unrealistic but not quite on a Fast and Furious level, is really entertaining. I think my favourite action scene has to be this on-foot chase at the beginning of the film, it was really creative. The comedy as well, worked really nicely in my opinion, too, which is great as I was sceptical whether or not it would work or if it would feel forced or not. I'd also like to mention a hilarious but unexpected cameo that takes place near the end of the movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed.However, I'm not sure if this film will stick with me a huge amount (not on the level of a generic action film but still not as much as expected) and that's largely because we've seen a huge amount of the film before in others like it. But like I said, I don't find it a huge problem. I did find the film to be quite predictable at some parts, but nothing too distracting. And that's really all I can think of that I didn't like about the film.Overall, Red Notice is a well-filmed, action packed blast with an incredible cast who all share great chemistry and dynamics. It's a must watch for people in need for a comedic action movie. The fun present in the film makes it very rewatchable, at least in my view after watching it once. Definitely one of my favourite Netflix original movies I've ever watched.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It did not fall on deaf ears. Lol. They work well together.Very similar to Hitman's wife's Bodyguard which has Salma Hayek in it instead of Gal Gadot and Sam Jackson instead of The Rock, all playing similar roles.

The investment seems to have paid off, though; it's now Netflix's biggest original movie, having been watched for 364 million hours within in its first month alone. I'm not entirely sure how profits are calculated when it comes to straight-to-streaming titles, since there's no real way to tell if someone subscribed to, or didn't unsubscribe from, a streaming service just to watch a specific movie. Netflix has deemed it worth at least one sequel, though, so I suppose that tells you all you need to know. The film focuses on Dwayne Johnson's too-big-for-a-tux FBI analyst as he does a ridiculous amount of fieldwork in an effort to catch a master art thief played by Netflix's new golden boy Ryan Reynolds (he's in three of their biggest original movies). The thing really kicks into gear when Johnson's character is framed for a theft he swears he didn't commit, which forces him to work together with Reynold's as-annoying-as-usual rogue in order to bring down Gadot's elusive and alluring criminal mastermind before she finds all three of the plot's physically shiny yet narratively dull MacGuffins. It's pretty much what you'd expect given its cast and concept, a predictable and toothless action adventure that pays a bit too much homage to the Indiana Jones movies. It's the type of movie that has title cards for its exotic locales (most of which were apparently shot in Georgia, likely due to the state's generous tax incentives) but just teleports its characters to where they need to be regardless of if they'd actually be able to get there. It's also the sort of film that slows to a crawl every now and then so that its stars can improvise a bit of stale banter. Yet, the relationship between the duo at the heart of the feature is actually surprisingly easy to get invested in. It's not as if Johnson and Reynolds have oodles of chemistry (although they do have infinitely more than Johnson and Gadot), it's just that the former's bland bluntness offsets the latter's grinning annoyance and vice versa. They make for a relatively compelling pair, barely breaking a sweat for their ludicrously high pay checks. Still, the film feels as though it has a B-list cast, despite the fact that its three leads are some of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Without these stars, though, the flick wouldn't be, well, anything. It's as generic as they come and actually has very little value, the sort of thing you throw on because you have Netflix but can't decide what you actually want to watch on it. To be honest, it's hobblingly mainstream; the number of risks it takes is pretty much zero. Don't get me wrong, it's decent enough for what it is. It's actually quite a bit better than I expected it to be. The action is fairly fun, featuring fairly strong choreography and mostly clean cinematography, and some aspects of the plot are enjoyably goofy. It's almost comical how nobody actually dies in this, despite the very real weaponry they come up against (the most egregious sequence involves a group of prison guards being unloaded upon by a helicopter's minigun without receiving so much as a wrinkle on their uniforms). Alongside its derivative nature and general contrivances, the narrative has a couple of more prominent problems. Though the piece knows who its protagonist is (Johnson), it often struggles to decide on an antagonist. Who is the hero supposed to be triumphing over? Is it Gadot's glamourous globetrotting thief, Reynold's double-dealing sarcasm machine, Arya's always-one-step-behind Interpol agent, or even Diamantopoulos's weak-chinned arms dealer who speaks as if he's constantly doing an impression of Richard Harris' Dumbledore? Yes, the picture is purposefully elusive and features plenty of double-crosses and fake-outs, but the issue is one of audience alignment and is prominent regardless of the characters' intentionally dubious nature. Another issue with the film is its exhausting ending. Not only does the climax completely undercut the emotional heart of the picture, it also (very minor spoilers) removes the cop/crook team-up dynamic from the sequel it inevitably teases. It also features one of the absolute worst and most unnecessary cameos of recent years. Despite its issues, though, the affair is relatively entertaining. Though it is a bit long, it moves at a decent pace and has a handful of genuinely good sequences. Most of it is just fine, of course, but the overall experience averages out as, for lack of a better term, above average. It's the sort of thing you'll forget almost as soon as you've seen, but it's an inoffensive and fairly fun way to pass the time. Come to think of it, maybe it was watched for so many hours because most people forgot they'd seen it and accidentally put it on a second time. 6/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

What little humor there is seems very forced. Unlike the Bond & Jones flicks, which were obviously put-ons from start to finish, one feels that a viewer could almost take this one at face value.Characters are always cardboard cutouts in this type of movie, but they have to be likable, including the villains, in a perverse sort of way. No one in this movie is likable. The worst is Ryan Reynolds' character, who has got to be one of the most annoying jerks ever portrayed on celluloid. Gal Gadot's Bishop is too nasty to be funny, and. Dwayne Johnson's. John Hartley seems to be phoning it in, delivering his forced-humor quips woodenly.I suppose I really shouldn't be reviewing this at all, because about halfway through I realized I didn't care what happened to anyone on screen, nor how it ended, so I stopped watching.","17 out of 26 found this helpful.

Did it? Kinda. Am I happy I watched it to the end? Kinda.Stock standard really. A stock standard soundtrack with surprises but none that surprise you THAT much.The acting is disappointing here, Reynolds seems less to be playing himself and more to be imitating someone playing himself. His lines don't hit in this movie, maybe his schtick is just getting tired. The rock is okay. But Gal Gadot woah she's bad.If you want further proof that Hollywood is discriminatory look at how they've moved Gal Gadot onto equal footing with The Rock and Ryan Reynolds...she's beautiful but I don't know if people follow movies to watch her like they would Dwayne Johnson or Ryan Reynolds... she was Actually solid in Wonder Woman, and she's trying in this film... I feel she has a few expressions which she overdoes. But potentially it's her character, which is the weakest in the film which is saying something because none of the characters are particularly likeable or interesting. Which might be its greatest flaw.You could do worse with your time than watch this. It's entertaining enough and also with a decent celebrity cameo.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The plot is chasing around the world for a golden egg. Don't over think it, that's it. Now this film has a feel that everyone on the set had a great time and at the end of the day some nice memories were made and everyone got paid. Great work if you can find it. Its just a shame no one cared about the actual movie, because its only going on Netflix so what the heck. Gal Godat has been working on getting a stronger American accent and possibly her acting skills. The rock is special guest as the rock and plays the same character you've known from any movie he has ever made. He just looks older, but is clearly relaxed and already working out in his mind how he is going to spend the pay cheque. Lots of situations are created for Ryan Reynolds to try out his ab lib skills as there is no script to speak of and its a chance for most of the production crew to get a long lunch while he has fun with his friends on Netflix's dollar. Gal's breast size changes depending on how revealing the outfit, which honestly is the best practical effect in the movie. Speakng of effects the 3D ones are awful and a lot of the green screen work is also very obvious. Still everyone had such a great time they are expecting to make a sequel, which means the writer (you really don't need two) are going to need a new table napkin to write the next movies story line and script on. Can someone please go to the Netflix head office and organise the transfer of the money. Thanks.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Featuring three major actors ranging from Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson, the film becomes unattractive as well known top artists. Red Notice has a lot of jokes in every scene. The seemingly comedic scenes are forced to make this film bland and unfocused in building the story. I think the comedic elements in this film are less interesting and don't have a good level of cuteness. Red Notice has an unflattering and long-winded story premise. Supported by dialogue that is widely conversational but full of atmosphere. It has no satisfactory conflict. The conflict between Hartley and Booth is like a child. The film is good by a series of cool action scenes, but less in terms of story. Red Notice has an unsatisfactory ending. For some reason, every time I see Dwayne Johnson playing, the movie seems to belong to Dwayne himself which is too many frames for him. Too much accentuate the heroic side tasked with saving someone. I don't deny that Gal Gadot has her charm here. Gal Gadot looks beautiful and charming. For Ryan Reynolds a lot of comedic dialogue that for me is less suitable and less able to.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is so pathetic that Matt Damon's The Great Wall will appear to be The Pianist when you compare the two. The only reason I watched this on its first day of being aired in India is nothing but Gal Gadot and when the end credits were rolling, I made myself accountable for ruining two precious hours of my life even after plenty of Gadot moments in it.This movie is a killer. It is a murderer of the genre called 'Comedy'. It serially kills the 'Thriller' genre. It actually murders everything including the reputation of its stars. Normally while reviewing a movie, I do discuss the technical aspects. But here I am going go spare you of that pain as it actually scores nothing from any aspect of movie making. Even the VFX which usually gets a high-octane value in these types of movies is buffoonery and what we are left with is a big zero. Even the perpetually petite Gadot looks old in this horror show.Is it a buddy movie? Well, you may have a break up with your best pal if you insist him or her to watch this joke. If you are planning to buy a ticket and watch it, perhaps you are making the biggest mistake of your life. If you are planning to watch it on Netflix, listen to the advice of someone who knows the world better than you. Skip the plan.I do not know how it has managed to get a score of 6.8 on IMDB but I am sure very soon it will get a place in the list of the worst 250 movies ever made. It has high chances of finishing the race with the Champion's Trophy.Sorry Gal. Looks like you spend more time on your Insta account than on honing your acting skills. Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds do not deserve even a word of discussion.Are they planning for a sequel? I will rather inflict on myself the pain of hearing the news that Netflix is coming up with the next series of 'Zoo'.My Rating 1.5 out of 10

It's exactly what you expect from this film. Some good action scenes, an easy plot to follow and classic Ryan Reynolds humour.I will say what was impressive was the clear on set chemistry the actors had. Really added to the humour and the jokes weren't constant either so it didn't feel like overkill.I was impressed with the twist towards the end also, genuinely didn't see it coming whatsoever. The plot itself is really easy to follow and not challenging at all. Which may put some off. Beyond that twist however it's quite predictable and almost too simple. But, overall it's an easy Friday night watch with some good action scenes which I'm sure will appeal to some. It also kept my attention for the whole 2 hours which is a difficult thing to do, so they did something right!There are some negatives however. For such a high budget film, some of the CGI (mainly background stuff) was poor at times and really noticeable. I found the Interpol woman agent really jarring and just wound me up every time she was on screen. Acting was neither here or there so if you're wanting to see some amazing performances then look elsewhere.But yeah there's not much else to say really. It's a non-challenging action film, it'll make you laugh here and there and overall it's a bit of fun. 6/10 from me today, just a little better than average.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But I can find value in these types of popcorn flicks. The star power in the cast alone makes this movie worth it, but I found it very entertaining at times. It also needs to be said that Gal Gadot is the most beautiful woman on the planet. I'll go a step further, the most beautiful living thing on the planet. More importantly she continues to improve as an actress and I enjoy all of her work. I think she would have struggled in this role a few years ago, but now it's right in her comfort zone.Dwayne Johnson is pretty much the same guy in everything and I'm a little irritated with him lately. His work in Red Notice has a bit of a change, but mostly It's the same old Rock. The same could be said for Ryan Reynolds. I don't blame these three for doing this movie. It was an easy paycheck. It's set up for a sequel and maybe they will do it again for easy money. Whatever they decide, I'm in.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

At the moment you can't seem to escape any of these actors at the Cinema and its becoming wearing.This feeling of fatigue is mainly driven by Ryans now irritating smart guy dialogue. In this movie its absolutely grating. Deadpool was one thing but its just incessant and needs to stop. He is basically playing the same person in all of these movies.The film itself if standard glossy rich people drama with a few twists and turns, some average action scenes and a cast which frankly bores. None of the characters are likeable.While it seems to be set for a sequel I am not sure the audience would welcome one based on this movie.It appears these actors and starting to believe their own hype, Dwayne thinks he would make a great James Bond.

The story itself was a very engaging one, keeping you engrossed in the story throughout, i was really interested in where the story went so in that sense i was not disappointed in the slightest.All in all this is a great watch to catch, Now on Netflix!Recommending this one for all of you :)","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Cast - 9 (good ole Commie-Loving Dwayne takes it down a notch)
Story - 4 (dialogue ruins the story which could have been an 8)
Dialogue - 3
Acting - 3 (Dwayne was terrible)
Cinematography - 9Don't get me wrong. I would see any movie that Gal Gadot is in. And Ryan Reynolds is another great fave. Dwayne Johnson, other than the fact that he hates his own country, is pretty great in MOST action movies - but the dude just can't act anymore. He was much better in older movies when he entertained for ALL, and not just his favorites ethnic groups. The dude has gotten so race-driven and political it's ridiculous, and for some reason his acting has poignantly gotten worse. Know who would have done it better?? Jamie Foxx or Chris Hemsworth. Shoot..... John Cho would have been awesome!The overall story is pretty good, but the nitty-gritty dialogue is blasé! How can you write a good story and then put in B dialogue???? Stupid. The dialogue ruins the story.Am I glad I saw it? Yup. It was okay. Will I watch it again? NO. Waste of time. Will I buy it? NO. WASTE OF MONEY. Glad I didn't pay to see it the first time.Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot just need to be in better written movies with real Actors. The big Movie Production companies are sell-outs, Netflix and Amazon are producing B stuff. Stick with the good writers guys - and stories that are not just entertaining, but actually MEAN something, and explore the human spirit, nature, and Truth. This movie was so over produced and lacked so much substance it was like a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich with $30 Peanut Butter, $50 fruit preserves, and gourmet fresh baked bread - BUT IT'S STILL JUST A PBJ..... not Filet Mignon with a nice Caesar Salad, Sashimi, 12 year old Single Malt Scotch, Crème Brûlée, an excellent Red Wine, and Buttered Herb-cooked Baby Potatoes.Go for quality people..... your time and your money is worth more than this kind of movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's like watching Ryan in Deadpool with endless same silly jokes with Rock as a side kick being his usual role but it just gets dull and repetitive where you almost wish they would shut up. The writer could have done so much more but this sophomoric humor might entertain a few but it's not really creative or anything new or entertaining.

I didn't have much expectations regarding the story and script just expecting it to be decent and harmless.The only saving grace was ryan reynolds who carried the whole film on his shoulders. What disappointed me the most was the lack of chemistry between rock and ryan. Either rock deliberately underplayed his role for ryan to shine or got nervous seeing ryan's energy. Rock had such an awesome chemistry with kevin hart in central intelligence and jason statham in hobbs and shaw. But with ryan, that was missing. Also another aspect was that none of the action sequences impressed me except the parker chase scene between rock and ryan in the beginning.On the whole, i expected red notice to be a tacobell movie but ended up as just a one time watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Many unpredictable actions by the characters occur that made me chuckle or question what was going on? Including a subtle plot twist towards the end, you may find it very predictable if you pay enough attention to the exchange between characters. Don't fret; the film does an adequate job of explaining what happened if you missed, by showing the cleverness of these thieves.This movie is a bit outrageous because it isn't logical, but are you watching this film for its logic? Or for a good laugh? I picked the latter.The pacing engaged me with various comical dialogue between Ryan Reynolds's character and whoever he speaks to. With Reynolds's character delivering his usual sporadic unfiltered thoughts, it refocused my attention on the film.Verdict: It's clear to see this formula has been reciprocated before, Ryan Reynolds another actor or two, comedy and action. Cough cough "" A Hitmans Wife BodyGuard"" nevertheless, a funny film more than anything. Part two coming?Does this take me to paradise? Laughing on the way but not there yet!

Why? Because I watch lots of old movies. And have you ever heard the term B-movie? Yeah. They filled the time between good (A) movies, with less-great B movies in the schedule. You were supposed to spend half the day, once a week, at the theater.Big big stars were in hilariously low budget movies of all sorts. Some were good, worked with what they had but some were NOT. Even dumb action and war movies that are really glaringly bad. With great stars doing sometimes good work, sometimes notThis is-and yes this is damning with faith praise-a movie in the tradition of old Hollywood. Charming characters doing okay-ish with each other but mostly playing their stereotypes. A dumb plot. A lazy story. And... it's fine when bored and you need something to watch not very hard in the afternoon with a headache, for example.It's fine. I will never watch it again, but have no regrets and when you need time wasting bubblegum and your brain can't do smart stuff or put words on a page together, this will do nicely.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie has Ryan Reynolds, Dwyane ""The Rock"" Johnson and Gal Gadot. The star cast is more than enough reason for me to watch the movie. Although it may not be the case for everyone, the story is a bit washed out but the comedic duo Ryan-Dwyane did a fantastic job especially Ryan with his witty and sarcastic remarks.The movie is enjoyable and it is a great entertainment if you want to kill some time in the weekends. I really didn't expect much from the movie. I honestly watched because of Ryan Reynolds but the Rock and Gal Gadot did not entirely disappointment me. It was a decent movie and I would totally recommend it if you are into action-comedy and not a story stickler.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I love also how they record the action scenes: it felt pretty dynamic and pleasant to see. I found Gal Gadot pretty stupid really and her acting felt overexaggerated even if i found her pretty hot and enjoyed her work in Wonder Woman.

There's a macguffin, a prison escape, several heists, parkour foot chases, car chases, punch ups, shoot outs. Its as if they got the action movie playbook and just ran through every element.

Yet still, it lacked depth both in story and character-wise. This doesn't mean that the movie is inherently bad. As a family movie for kids and adults alike, I'd recommend it, but it could have been so much more. The characters felt plastic and unrelatable, the unexpected twists themselves lacked substance, and the movie felt incredibly fabricated, which is bad for an ""Indiana Jones"" style film, potentially trying to develop into a franchise.Overall, this is a good movie if you have two hours to lose. And seeing as not one, but two sequels are in the making, I hope that more work is done on the story and character development. Otherwise - they might as well change the names of the characters to the Rock, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well, I can't say MTC got this rating out of nowhere. After all, this film shows no innovation and nothing even slightest sincerity. Humming the score of Indiana Jones while heading downstairs a bunker seems like quite a mock for that Netflix themselves do realize they have copied so many previous films without adding anything their own.However, this is a fun film to watch. As a matter of a fact, I did not dive into this film with high hopes. I was kind of worried that this film would abandon its entertaining core and struggle to be deep and sophisticated, yet the outcome did not let me down. They are very clear about their goal, the TRINITY. Anything beside theses three superstars is irrelevant. Gal Gadot has her sexy charm, Dwayne Johnson has showed his ridiculous muscle chunk( Although he was incredibly weak in this film), and Ryan Reynolds presented his Deadpool-ish joking ability to us(Again).So, if you love anyone of these three stars or better yet, all of them, this film would be a great and pleasant journey for you.

I was drawn in by the lead actors which I think of as fun. It's is not an award winning film, the critics didn't like it but the users (on IMDb) did. What the hell, I gave it a try but wouldn't watch it again.The introductory camera shot zooming down from the sky and into a car chase was a really cool start. We soon find out Reynolds is a bad guy, which is new. Lots of stunts in the beginning scene during which you would have to be completely blind to miss the Porsche Taycan (and later Mercedes) advertising. As things progress, Johnson seems to become a bad guy too, which is also new. We like these bad guys cuz they're only stealing fancy eggs from true villains (one of which is really short), they have good banter and they look good in tuxedos. Something I didn't know is Reynolds is tall...not too far off from Johnson who is really tall.There is a fair amount of action with helicopters, cars and a fake bull. When I say fake, a lot of the movie is just special effects where the people employed in these departments outnumbered the stuntmen 3 to 1. Make no mistake, however, this is a big budget film with total crew exceeding 1,500 persons; Netflix has money.A couple of quotes in the movie from Ryan Reynolds were rather cute:
""They're always watching, always listening.....Kinda like Alexa but with guns.""
""Doesn't matter what you do, only matters what they think you've done.""In the end the double crossers get double crossed....it's that kind of caper.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It overtly references Indiana Jones.It even throws back to Hitchcock & films like The Thomas Crown Affair, The Italian Job, & all of the ""Oceans"" films.It suspends our disbelief while keeping our interest as a nod to the Nic Cage blockbuster action/adventure ""National Treasure"" which did that exact same thing.All really great references. All pretty great, or at least entertaining, movies.Most of which were blockbusters in their respective times, right?!They spawned sequels, prequels, spin-offs, & a bunch of other profitable ip (intellectual properties).So, does this answer the question you first asked at the start of this review?In case you forgot:

It is funny, heart warming, tantalizing and filled with likeable characters. There is mild suspense and a cohesive storyline. And, what the heck, a boy gets a girl. What more do you want? Oh yeah, a few robberies, chase scenes, dramatic escapes and gunfights. Lots of fun.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

My thoughts were so naive.... hoping NETFLIX could actually make something worthwhile with these 3 actors.Boy was this generic and sometimes confusing. All three actors brought to the table the exact same style of acting as they have in their previous roles.Ryan the wise-crack nonstop babble-mouth, dwayne the tough-as-nail law enforcement figure who is funny between serious and gadot the eye-candy smart-cheeky femme fatale.Sometimes, I thought I was watching national treasure when suddenly a scene from jumanji took over with a dab of jungle cruise and deadpool.Heck, even the unbelievably long car chase ala FastnFurious6 Runway scene was thrown in for good measure. I was thinking ""why would you dig a big tunnel with ample lighting to go all that way and end up at a waterfall?""My intellect-meter just snapped right then and there and the rest of the movie was just a bunch of noise leading to rolling credits. During that time I was busy reading reviews on imdb and comparing notes to others feeling the same vibes.I told my friend that IF this movie just ends up in the ""dissapointment bin"" like army of the dead, the harder they fall and other big budget big stars hollywood output by netflix, then I would give up on continuing any hopes for this company.NETFLIX may have the big budget and access to A-list actors, but they certainly don't put a lot of effort into getting some skilled writers with original ideas in their heads.IF you find the need to MUST SEE THIS BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE BY NETFLIX, please make sure beside you and the tv, there is absolutely nothing else in the room that might distract you from the screen.DESPITE IT'S GLOSSY PRODUCTION VALUES, the movie was never engaging to begin with.Trust me, you will feel it within the first 30 minutes. You can easily turn it off and continue some other day without the slightest of anxiety to finish it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With a good script that did have a few overly convenient plot points it still kept me watching. Great action scenes and editing there were still a few things that fell short. The CGI wasn't bad however it felt more like a really good video games graphics. With many classic Ryan Reynolds jokes it did make for a fun watch with my family. The final act was my favourite and tied everything up, not the cleanest way to end but still had all my questions answered. Overall it was a fun movie with great action and good writing, however all in all it is a Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson flick and if you enjoy them you will 100% enjoy this movie.Kyle Kinghorn.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes it's silly , the plot is sort of a dollar store Indiana Jones , but overall it provided decent light entertainment. Personally I'm not usually a huge fan of the Rock or Ryan Reynolds acting and find them to be some of the most unidimensional actors out there. The Rock can usually only play the Rock or some FBI type cop and Ryan Reynolds is the exact same character in seemingly every role, essentially Ryan Reynolds himself. Still, I oddly found the combination of the two here worked quite well.Reynolds and the Rock have better chemistry in delivering the cheesy one liners than other combinations I've seen. And yes, the script is totally reliant on these one liners. Normally I find movies that are so reliant on the one liner deliveries to be tacky and annoying , but they make it work here.Overall the big twist at the end is decent although probably predictable for some. In terms of a mindless, low taxing I would say it achieves what it sets out to. It doesn't feel like it wants to drag on or overextend its welcome.I' ll definitely give the second one a watch when it's out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It adds nothing new, but wraps it all together in a very enjoyable story that tucks and amazing amount of action in without sacrificing plot. At times it gets a little too cliche, and over the top.The plot is simple. Cleopatra was supposed to have had 3 golden eggs. An Egyptian billionaire wants to given them to his daughter as a wedding present. So he put a massive reward on the eggs. Top thieves then vie for the eggs to collect the reward. Some of the scenes are indeed memorable. Some just poorly done. Lots of laughs, great stunts. The plot is pretty weak, but that's not why you watch a movie like this. It's a great way to burn a couple hours and be entertained. The humor spans the gamut from slapstick to sarcasm to subtle running jokes. I suspect it was written with Johnny Depp playing. Nolan Booth. It is definitely a role Depp would have carried off without effort.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

By all means it's should be just a by-the-numbers heist flick with light twists, enough to keep you entertained.And entertaining it is, as long as you can suspend your disbelief just the right amount.Driven largely by the chemistry between Reynolds (who seems to play Deadpool everywhere) and Dwayne Johnson (a natural comedy genius) with Gal Gadot an unlikely by charming addition, this movie is just enough of light saturday night entertainment to help recharge your batteries.But there's another side of the movie: it never takes itself seriously and at the same time it subverts your own need to suspend your disbelief. As the movie nears its conclusion, do take the time to revisit in the back of your mind all those moments that seemed too outrageous (and the script does take the time to address them either during its runtime or at the end when it goes back to ""explain"" some things). Yes, the movie mocks you for suspending too much of your disbelief and not going with the simplest explanations.This tiny bit of detail helps this movie out of the hole of generic action flicks, perhaps just enough to warrant a second watch.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Unsurprisingly, you see Gal Gadot's WW assertiveness, The Rock muscling his way around, and Ryan Reynolds doing his signature Deadpool comedic lines during this entire movie.There is no shortage of plot twists so be prepared to become lost on why some things happen the way they do. One issue I have is Interpol being so naive and borderline bumbling that it's hard to take them seriously in their apprehension efforts. Also to be honest, the originality of this film involves subtle references and mimicking of several existing franchises (ahem, like the ones mentioned up top). The plot structure is linear and predictable in terms of which way to go next and it feels like hiring three A-list actors to sell this movie is what makes up for said linear plot structure.However, this movie is watchable with gorgeous international scenery, fast-paced action, and lots of humor. The interesting part is that I did not see one person die, nor did any character shoot a henchman or security guard with a firearm which leads me to believe this is a family-friendly film. Don't bother with reason, just watch it and enjoy!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Red Notice is a fun movie, that's about it. There are moments of straight up laughs and then others of groanworthyness. The acting isn't exactly a spectacle, the effects are REALLY bad at times and the movie suffers from being a little too meta for its own good without properly committing to it, which really undercuts a lot of the plot movements. If this would've gone into full on meta, parodying the ridiculous action movies of the time and being self aware and referential it could've been a really fun romp. Instead it goes into half measures that feel more distracting than anything.Again, it's a fun watch and I don't regret the time spent but it's all fluff from start to ridiculous finish. It does kinda veer into Crystal Skull territory near the end (not aliens so much as just the overall vibe and stylings) which was a problem. Still fun though!","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Taking these characters into an action packed ride with a side of laughs.I actually enjoyed the film more than I thought I would. Lots of action and humor. A story about a FBI profiler John (Dwayne Johnson) joining an Interpol agent Das (Ritu Arya) to help track down one of the highest skilled thief con artist Nolan (Ryan Reynolds). Who is on a track of trying to steal three of Cleopatra's golden eggs. When Nolan is caught and John is set up by another skilled con artist known as the Bishop (Gal Gadot). Nolan and John in a Russian prison. They both try to join forces to escape and chase down the Bishop before she can get her hands on the eggs. And John clearing his name.The film is action packed. And a lot of fun seeing Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson banter at each other throughout. Johnson being a brute and Reynolds being the wise cracking talker. And Gal being a skilled fighter. The film is fast paced. Lots of fun set pieces. And humor.Director Rawson Marshall Thurber knows how to handle the action sequences. Taking these characters into a fun Indiana Jones mixed with a bit of National Treasure ride. Great cast ensemble. The film does have a twist that is fun and entertaining. Which leaves you wanting more after it ends. I would love to see a sequel.Overall, Red Notice is a lot of fun, fast, action packed with some humor.","48 out of 240 found this helpful.

Ryan Reynolds is the world's most famous art-thief, or at least he was until he was sold out by a competitor in a race to assemble three golden artifacts for a wealthy billionaire. What follows is a bro-oad-trip as Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds banter their way through a humiliating contest against the alluring Gal Gadot.Where Red Notice shines is not in originality, nor is it in brilliant writing, but in its comical contempt for taking anything seriously. Ryan Reynold's signature wit and comedy riffs break the fourth wall with frequency, including looking for a crate labelled Mcguffin while in an underground Nazi vault. Dwayne Johnson recycles the same character he plays in Jumanji, Jungle Cruise and pretty well every other movie he's been in, while Gal shows a little bit of her creepy side when torturing a prisoner but is never quite convincing in her relationships - one of which feels downright awkward.The production values are a mixed bag with some prominently poor green screen, and the script had the feel of being so painfully written that the actors started to adlib their own lines to improve it. This plays to that strength of goofy comedy that doesn't require much thought while hedging itself in between several sequences of action and pretentious explosions.Altogether, its goofiness will attract some, and deter others. For the family audience, frequent swearing and sexualized language push this up to a teen audience even if the sexual content is limited.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As for the contemporary update, Gal Gadot has a much more active role in Red Notice. Not a lot of new ground is broken in this movie, but there are more plot twists along with good pacing and comedy with the action.

Ryan's quick witted humour is very unique and that is used to the films advantage, the writing from a comedic element hits well.There's no doubt the action is central to the film's core and I expected it to be as entertaining as it was. The set pieces were well done and the masquerade scene is a particularly one to look out for.But the film does suffer from consistent cliches that make the narrative predictable and lazy in areas. Besides the comedic aspects, the writing is ordinary and doesn't do much to enhance the narrative.Nothing you haven't seen before from Netflix from a narrative point of view, but it's a good Friday night watch, and for most, that'll do.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Here is such a movie where you love all the 3 stars (BIG ones at that) and lot of brouhaha surrounding it. That's about it, no extra-ordinary moments, other than the big bucks which went into the making of it. You may probably not remember anything after watching the potboiler of a movie. You could probably get more entertainment if you watch the social media stories of the Rock or Ryan Reynolds or Gal Gadot. If you only saw Instagram, you would probably believe that this is biggest hit of the year. Far from it, a PG (13) rated, politically correct Indiana Jones version of a treasure from the World War II-Germans' hidden loot. Also continues with Gal Gadot's movie theme - no one is hurt or killed (like in WW 1984), justifies that family theme. No big cinematic moment or unforgettable lines that go into adventure movies. So many opportunities were created, but the stars got in the way of screen time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Starring Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds & ""the oooh soo sexy"" Gal Gadot is a comedy, action, adventure film.This is about a quest by 2 rival art thieves Gadot & Reynolds to find & steal the 3 bejeweled legendary eggs given to Cleopatra by her Roman lover Marc Anthony 2000 years ago. Dwayne Johnson plays an FBI profiler who is unwittingly caught in the midst of the heist, framed for a robbery he didn't commit & desperately wanting to clear his name.Decent one-time watch, great cast, comedy by Ryan Reynolds will keep you in splits. However action scenes are sometimes over the top. Timepass, feel-good, fun watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you are into funny action movies or more specific Ryan Reynolds or The Rock-movies, you will enjoy this one. If you don't like them, then it's nothing for you. But since I like thos kind of movies I actually really enjoyed it.The plot is mainly carried by the three stars Reynolds, Rock and Gadot, who have a great chemistry. Especially the banter between Reynolds and Rock is quite entertaining. The fact, that their characters are simply written after their basic movie persona, leads to the fact, that you never see anyone else on the screen, besides the actual actor.The action and humor is nothing extraordinary, but entertaining and it definitely has it's moments.Just don't expect too much. It is a generic action movie, that combines the typical thief themes together.Like a sweet cupcake, it tastes good while you eat it, but it doesn't satisfy you in the long run.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You need to have brains to be in it and Dwayne doesn't have them. I love Ryan Reynolds too but sometimes his routine gets old when he tries to convey even more wit than he already does. With Deadpool it's alright but lately he's been over doing it a little bit. Still love him though. Gal Gadot isn't an Oscar winning actress either lol. She's awful as well but likeable. Still don't understand how she got this far. It's all good though. It's a movie you can watch that everybody will like. There's nothing wrong with a brains off comedy/action film.

As always The Rock was okay, if you seen him in one movie, you've seen him in every one of his movies. Gal Gadot was beautiful as always and very capable. She too, plays a role similar to her famous Wonder Woman, but she's a little more sly in this film which was highly entertaining.The balance of cast was perfect. The spy stuff was cool.

This is a solid 6/10.Reynolds once again plays as himself. He is a sweet heart, his jokes are great. I think having him in cast added a few stars to this movie, in my opinion. However, action scenes with Reynolds had a big number of cuts. I get he is not an action star, but something better could have been done to avoid that. After all, he is not the first comedy actor put in an action movie.Now, the movie itself does not feel completely like heist or action genre because it has neither enough to call it any of that. Heist scenes with stealing and escaping were not that elaborate, they felt simple, ""easy-peasy"". Action scenes were good but then again, they felt watered down - as always none of numerous faceless antagonist goons died, the heroes did not feel any consequences of any action scenes at all.CGI was... not as bad as it could have been. But it definitely could have been much better. Fire, bull and falling bodies looked like they were taken from a cutscene of a computer game, not a multimillion budget movie.Overall, this is a good action heist flick. It is like Aviator gin and tonic with a twist... of lemon piece (two puns intended) - sure you can go for something more elaborate with more ingredients but it works just fine to cheer you up in the evening.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What could go wrong?Well something doesn't just quite work. Is it the rather forgettable soundtrack (despite a famous cameo singer)? Is it the writing, the direction, the editing? Is it that the whole thing was put together working within covid restrictions?Well, not surprisingly, I guess it's a little of all these. Though the pace, the one-liners and the sight gags are mostly pretty good.I think the biggest problem is at the core of the plot. It's just a bit too silly, too soon and with a few too many twists.We start with two art thieves - Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot - and Dwane Johnson, an ""FBI profiler"". They're variously after each other and three golden eggs that were gifted to Cleopatra and that are rumoured to be in Egypt, Italy, Germany, Argentina... etc, etc, etc. You get the idea. (I do hope the slightly flat end result is not because we've become just a bit too familiar with these escapist fantasies in general.)Perhaps we really should be identifying with just one lead (Ryan Reynolds?) but the focus is split between three, plus, initially, Ritu Arya as the Interpol agent. We really are missing the strong lead role - the actual Indiana Jones, the Inspector Clouseau or the James Bond.It's an enjoyable caper, though, if you don't go in expecting too much. 6.5/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Looking at the director's career, we will see that Red Notice has been his most stylish and cohesive work to date, regardless of his low ambition in action sequences. Terber's decision to shoot most of the action gives the film a surprisingly visual factor by slipping into the scene and showing strange scenes, even in the simple layout of the action sequence of the film, which involves chasing Booth along a scaffolding. He is also very good at bringing out the best comedy of his actors, so he has been a smart choice to lead the project.Ridiculous twists and turns at the end of the film: There is no spoiler here, but while the Red Notice script is largely predictable and simple, there are moments, especially in the third act, that may surprise viewers. . Frankly, the finale of the film takes on a fun color and smell by showing the large number of revelations and text-changing flashbacks thrown at the audience.Speed is one of the film's greatest strengths: Watching an incredibly expensive movie in less than two hours is certainly refreshing, isn't it? Obviously, no good movie is too long and no bad movie is too short, but the red notice stops with a perfectly reasonable run time of 118 minutes, long before it can derail. The film moves so energetically from one comedy-action sequence to another that there is little room for viewers to get bored or start looking at their watch.Negative points of the film.Simple Screenplay: Few expected Red Notice to be anything but a fun spy action comedy, but director Rawson Marshall Terber's screenplay is essentially literally a complete copy of the dozens of adventure action films before him. Indiana Jones, the Pink Panther franchise, and the National Treasure are the most obvious benchmarks for the script to be copied, but even if you take the film as a tribute to it, almost all of the film's major scenes are detached from its iconic sequences. All the action and comedy moments are a reflection of what we have seen in the genre for years, even decades: as if Terber had spent a month watching classic action-adventure movies and then writing his screenplay over the weekend. This is a film that has very few characters and instead deals with the existing successes of this genre.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Dwayne Johnson plays an FBI agent trying to stop them and gets entangled in an adventure with the thieves to find the McGuffin.The acting is non-existent as all leads just play their public personas with different backstories (instead of 'Ryan Reynolds is a rich actor' it's 'Ryan Reynolds is a rich thief') and the rest of the cast keep it generic. This isn't really a criticism as the movie appears to be exactly what it wanted to be: an action/adventure movie that appeals to practically anyone. The action is inoffensive but bland. The effects are serviceable but nothing notable. The costumes look great.The movie doesn't necessarily drag but you definitely won't get invested in the anything that's happening. There is some character building done in the start but it's just verbal exposition dumps, so nothing the audience will feel connected to. No action scene has tension and any twists this moch spy thriller takes are uneventful if not predictable. There are plot contrivances every scene but you shouldn't even try and suspend your disbelief or you'll become delusional.I recommend Red Notice for kids or adults looking for something basic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It met expectations but didn't exceed them. Disappointed that the chemistry between Ryan and Dwayne just wasn't up to par with what I had hoped given their brief encounter in Hobbs and Shaw. In many ways this reminded me The Rundown with many similar plot points. Then there is the whole Indiana Jones knock off the final act. I'm also pretty sure they did a call out to Raiders of the Lost Ark when Dwayne shined his flashlight at one specific box.I'd say my biggest gripe is that Ryan was too sarcastic throughout the movie. I like his schtick but this was excessively written that way. I'm not sure he had one serious line throughout the whole movie.Overall, if this movie had been released in the theatres; it would have bombed commercially but being on Netflix; it was a good time and I look forward to a sequel if Netflix deems that it brought in enough viewership to justify another.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Adding some ""ha ha double crosses"" along with ""ha ha celebrity triple crosses"" isn't entertainment, it's just predictability for anyone with more than twelve brain cells. I have no idea how this cost two hundred million dollars because even the ironically-poor special effects are worse than something from the '50s.Every single aspect of this experience is cliche. Every aspect is predictable. The dialogue has no nuance. The ""chemistry"" between the leads is manufactured and only plays off our expectations from their past roles. Throwing what I assume is a popular hip hop tune at the end while some CGI sun flares go off behind the Louvre and everyone walks away from the camera with sunglasses on does not blind me to the waste of two hours I just experienced. Nice try, but I know psychology and I know what you're trying to do.If your IQ is above what a shiny stone would measure, there is nothing that will surprise you.

However, with the likes of Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson starring in this film you should know to not take it too seriously. Reynolds is up to his usual funny antics, and unless you hate the guy, he's quite enjoyable. I, myself, enjoy Dwayne Johnson in a lot films, however, I found in ""Red Notice"" his acting was a bit too rigid and his fight scenes just felt complacent. Gal Gadot also fell short of my expectations. She tried to play off this mysterious, sexy thief, and unlike her role in ""Date Night"", things felt stale coming from here. A couple positives for me were the fight scenes and the unexpected twists. I also found good humour in Reynolds and had some hearty chuckles.Truthfully, nothing in this movie should be taken seriously. It's just one of the action movies that provides decent entertainment value. I would definitely recommend giving this movie a try, especially, if you enjoy any of the three leads, but I wouldn't call it a must watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The way the screenplay goes along with the elements makes it stand out not quite smooth but a bumpy journey. Presentation as well as the direction of Rawson Marshall Thurber in this film tries to stick every together like a nice harmony and gets quite victorious from it, not because of having a really good plot but because of the pure adrenaline rush it offers from time to time.

To attain tangible success, movies need much more than that! And Red Notice is simply being another testimony to that same fact.From a story perspective, this isn't something we haven't seen before! Neither the film tends to follow any unusual routes nor did it propose anything substantially unique in its course; Truth be told, this whole Fiasco has been heavily reliant upon this core group of Protagonists (or Antagonists, if you may suggest so) and their charismatic abilities to withhold viewers' imperishable interest.Not gonna lie, myself being a staunch admirer of both Ryan Reynolds and Dwyane Johnson, I enjoyed what it had offered. Well, for the most part, I mean! You see, there are indeed some funny banters and lots of meme references to help pass your time. And there's also 'Wonder Woman' in it. What do say about that huh?Speaking of Gal Gadot, she is one of those performers that by definition I may not be a 'Fan' of, but yeah I quite like how she goes with her business and man! I just love her infectious smile, Who wouldn't right?When Netflix first made the announcement of this ambitious 'Crossover' between Black Adams, Deadpool and Wonder Woman (See, what I did there?); Everybody, including me, was super excited, not only because these actors will share the screen for the first time but also for the limitless possibilities they might bring to the table.Unfortunately, the Director as well as the Writers they all failed to capitalise on the prospects of such a rare happening! As a result, we got only a half-decent outcome! Nowhere near what it could have been in a perfect scenario.Don't get me wrong, for the sole objective of entertainment, this might amuse a lot of people by providing them with enough value. But my argument is, the amount of buildup and marketing Netflix had gone with before its release; I'm sure, the majority of us had higher expectations. And as I see it, the film didn't stand up to all our wishes and prayers.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was super entertaining and you didn't want the movie to end.Ryan as always is hilarious in this movie. Gal creates the spark in the movie and Dwayne completes the package.I kept thinking during the movie why Dwayne wasn't showing much emotion like he does in his movies, but then I read that his father passed away beginning of this movie. So now I know.It's not like he shows a lot of emotion in his movies, but at least a little bit. But he was almost completely stone-faced here. As if he was gone, understandably. But that didn't affect the scenes.But there are many hilarious scenes in the movie, you will enjoy it!A very entertaining movie that will take you away for a couple of hours.Gal, Ryan, and Dwayne were a great team for this movie. I read there will be a Red Notice 2 soon, awesome.Totally worth a watch!!!Have your popcorn ready and enjoy!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is solid action sequences, silly light comedic moments and humor, great scenery views and the actors playing well off each other. Nothing too great or classic worthy but enough entertainment to satisfy casual audiences.As others have mentioned, the leads don't exactly bother stepping out of their comfort zones. Dwayne Johnson plays Dwayne Johnson. Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot plays Gal Gadot.The chemistry and back and forth dialogue between Johnson and Reynolds makes the film worthwhile. Meanwhile Gadot is the eye candy.Overall the film was a Netflix success and apparently a sequel is in the works. There are a few different directions they could go towards. Interested to see how it unfolds.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot, background stories, music, etc are also good. It never makes you feel bored.But the ending part was not like that as expected. I am greatly disappointed with the injustice they did to the character of Ryan Reynolds, Nolan Booth.Here all the 3 characters have all these 3 traits of Beauty, Brain and Power in common. But from what I have observed from the movie, Ryan was supposed to resemble exclusively brain, The Rock resembles power, and Gadot resembles beauty. And I also liked that distribution. But it would have been great if they have executed that clearly and dynamically in the movie.A great expected ending was destroyed by the large twist where we got The Rock & Gadot as the main hero-heroine, while my most liked character of the movie, that is Ryan with the 2nd highest screen time in the movie was moved just as a gay side comedian, like in an Indian movie.Looking at the ratings, I think this deserves that well, for turning its good story into bad ending. Even an emotional ending would have worked out to save it from getting to be an average heist movie. Despite these, this movie deserves a watch.Let's wait and expect Ryan to take his revenge in the sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

These are, the movies would like us to believe, the good guys. The world of this movie is inherently fascist which I guess makes the Nazi fetishism make sense.In the final act, stolen Egyptian heirlooms are returned to Egypt. Only for interpol to show up and say: ""no no no these were the Nazis possessions and now you can't have them. You're own history is a crime."" Yeah that happens, along with a lot more orientalism and dehumanising of the native Egyptians which the movie does so casually I don't think any of the creators bothered thinking about the Egyptian people as actual humans.This is truly awful stuff. Incepting hatred and bigotry into the working classes stupid entertainment. In other words, classic Hollywood.

To be true it's probably one of the most used stories ever. Cop capture uncapturable thief only to just at that moment need his help and so on.The movie is quite good. It's actually almost great at the beginning and get some good parts then and again. Strangely all the good parts are when Gal Gadot isn't on screen.Or no. Ryan is funny as hell, but he's just being his regular self so that's not surprising but also not to special (but he is funny). Dwayne is also playing the same character he usually does. Big, tough, smiley and cute and looking like a nice guy (even when he tries not to). Not much acting really but he charms his way through.When it come to Gal Gadot i loved the first Wonder Woman movie. Maybe more becuase finally a strong female heroine in a good movie and all. She fitted the role I thought, the english pronounces, the stiff persona, it fitted.But... That seem to not have been acting at all, just her reading the lines because damn she's dull. She can't act. Every time she show up on screen here it ruins the moment and the immersion. She's the same as in ever other movie she play in. Nothing change. Not a single emotion she tries to pull of succeeds, ever. Had she not been in this movie I'd happily been seeing it a couple of more times, but now, no. There is sadly no acting talent to be had there and it ruins every movie I've seen her in apart from Wonder Woman (which she was great in as herself, not because she could actually act).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is good to watch in a evening time which itself gives a lot of time to eat snacks rather the screen presence
Story-
It s just a quest for 3 eggs which was earlier with Cleopatra and the capture of these eggs by a thief and story revolves around this .. I'm not saying more about this bcz if I say then then entire red notice will become a short notice..and u won't watch it ..only ull read the review
Happily it doesn't get bored only because of the cameo present..good to c gal Gadot in a movie other a adventure
Screenplay was little dramatic and no thrilled experience..normal fight normal chasing.still I can't understand y the police are as usual late in every con movies even when they get the clue earlier and also they were not able catch them and the chase end in vain
Overall- Red notice- the police con game could have been still better and served more to us .a predicted story line with usual suspects and transparent storyline.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The storyline and humour is always written around his physical appearances which means he may never be challenged to break the mould. Overall, the chemistry of the actors was brilliant which made the movie enjoyable.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

With some caveats.Red Notice's best feature is that it has three charismatic actors: Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds. Their characters are pretty much as advertised. The Rock is the cop; Wonder Woman is the thief; and Deadpool is the con artist. And there's much back stabbing and alliances of convenience that play out across three continents. All in pursuit of a lost artifact once treasured by Cleopatra. They play off each other very well. Especially in the movie's slower moments. It's obvious they had a blast working with each other.The pacing is something weird. It clocks at around two hours and doesn't really waste time. But it does feel like a first draft. Revelations and plot turns move a bit too quickly than you'd expect to see in something released in theaters by comparison.The action scenes are plenty and they are pretty fun to watch. Highlights include an escape from a Russian prison on top of a mountain or a high speed chase through abandoned Nazi bunker. It's the kind of pulpy globetrotting goofiness we don't get much of anymore. Also It feels like it would take place in the same universe as The Fast and Furious. Or that other action-adventure movie did called The Rundown;hopefully people remember that movie. It's really good.As far as Netflix movies go that try to ape the style of Hollywood blockbusters, it's not half-bad. Though there are moments where you know it can be better. I would actually not mind a sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was reasonably well paced and filmed (mostly) with a good eye. It was stylish in parts and inoffensive. But sadly thats where it ends.I found myself fairly early on muttering 'if the twist ending is.... I'm going to be very disappointed.' I was disappointed. I'm not going to give it away, but frankly anyone who doesn't call it within the first act probably hasn't watched a film in the last 40 years. It was so laughably obvious, that the longer they held on to it, the more it overshadowed the rest of the film. I found myself wishing they'd just get it over with so that maybe, just maybe, they'd slip something unexpected in afterwards. Sadly not, just the usual franchise-launching open ending.It's not a bad film, it's just not a great one. Maybe if they can find writer who can come up with something original for any sequel, they might have something worth making.The question below that I have to answer, 'does this review contain spoilers?' No, but the first half of the film has plenty.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Or if you really like the rock and ryan reynolds.They try to make up this historical treasure mystery tied to the story but it just feels tacked on just to excuse this constant traveling all over the map. It doesnt make the movie better or interesting. Just takes room from the only good things in the movie, the action and the comedy. And the comedy isnt the laugh out loud kind it just kinda makes you smile (the usual ryan reynolds jokes).But it most certainly isnt a good movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The characters themselves were great too, The Rock I feel has been playing himself in a lot of movies lately and although this isn't a major change it is a step out in a new direction. Gal Gadot was stunning as always and she brought a lot of humor and banter which I enjoyed immensely. And now for the one and only Ryan Renolds... he was a godsend in this movie, his timing was perfect. The movie was amazing and pure entertainment. The set design is beautiful, including but not limited to the Russian castle, the cars, the costume design. This film is like a strangely entertaining hybrid of Bond, Indiana Jones and Deadpool (thanks, Ryan).

I also liked Gal Gadot in Wonder woman as the titular character so since it's also an action movie, I thought it would be some what interesting. Well, it's definitely better than the last movie I've watched called ""Encanto"", but how's it? Let's find out!The main characters are two completely opposite men: Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds), who's a thief and John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) who's an FBI agent. They suddenly teamed up in a russian jail because both were mistaken for stealing one of Cleopatra's eggs (even though it was only Nolan who stole it). Now their goal is to find the lost third golden egg before the bishop (Gal Gadot) comes in.Let's just say that the plot was pretty good and I was invested in it. Especially when Nolan and John tried to go through the security system and the treasure room of a rich man Sotto Voce, and then the Bishop suddenly knows everything about their plan and fights them. I enjoyed the action scenes, like the already mentioned security room fight or the car race scene in the end of the movie. Although the plot was engaging, I can't say the same about the characters. John and Nolan are the typical duo where they are the exact opposite of each other, but for a specific mission, they need to team up, sometimes they argue and sometimes they are friends, but they still reach their goal and become teammates. The Bishop was a pretty interesting antagonist, she's powerful and cunning, she wants to get all 3 treasures no matter what, thus putting the duo in various dangerous situations, like tying them up in the basement and using the electric taser to tease John, or hacking the systems so no one could notice that she was the one who stole and replaced it with a bootleg. There was also another female character whose name I forgot, but she was one of Hartley's allies before discovering that he's working with a criminal.Overall, I would probably recommend the movie to fans of one of these actors or people who enjoy movies like fool's gold. But it's not exactly a must watch, since there are probably better heist/treasure seeking movies out there.

It's a fun action comedy with a fitting cast. Yes, Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson are playing their typical roles (Hobbs and Shaw, Deadpool, Welcome to the Jungle, etc.), but guess what? It works. Both actors are well capable of range. But for Red Notice, it wasn't needed.All in all, it's a good movie. Nothing more.I just wish, people on imdb would stop crucifying movies, just because they had a disappointing experience. There are always 1-star reviews. What point are these people trying to make? Are they trying to get the average rating down, so they give it one star?I have seen one star productions. They exist. But not on platforms like Netflix. Not even 6 Underground deserved one star, even though I really disliked that movie.So would you please stop overreacting? Give your bruised artistic ego a couple of days to cool down and then rate the movie for what it really is, instead of what you were feeling right after watching it.The same goes for the 10-star crowd. Red Notice is clearly not deserving of 10 stars. Very few movies actually are.Please remember my plea the next time you are mad at some director for not making the movie of your dreams. Otherwise, yuo can't be taken seriously as a critic. You're just a troll.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Being a very humid day and having been rained out at golf, we trawled through the unpromising list of movies currently showing and decided somewhat reluctantly on Red Notice. Used to like Ryan Reynolds but he has been in a few stinkers (in my view) over recent years. We settled in and it looked like a random action piece for the first 5-10 minutes. It then took off on a wild ride with snappy dialogue and unpredictable twists and turns and did not let up. Much better than I expected and would be willing to see again (which is a real recommendation). All actors play their parts well. Some unexpected appearances and if you wait 10 mins to the end of the credits you get to hear Gal Gadot sign off . The end leaves you hanging: will there be a sequel? Thought the same at the end of The Phantom but sadly it did not eventuate. Left the theatre in a really good mood. Highly recommended.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The cat becomes the mouse and the story borrows sparingly from many of the references they make on-film!The three must reunite the three golden eggs Anthony gifted Cleopatra for an Egyptian's millionaire's daughter's wedding, ironically named Cleopatra as well. But one egg is lost in myth and mystery!Stuck in Russia now. A black site holding cell for the double crossing agent and an escape artist, the Shawshank Award is begging for a winner, as they smart-talk their way from one fight to the next, trying to get out before the Bishop beats them to it.Meanwhile, The Bishop in London has her own plans as she makes her way to the second egg's location at the wealthy Sotto Voce's palace in Valencia. Jet-setting never looked as fine! An Eyes Wide Shut nod later, and we find out one of three knows where the 3rd egg is...
Indiana Jones meets the Usual Suspects with Ocean's 11 and Inspector Clouseau chasing Pink Panther's Golden Egg. Through twists and turns the comedic gags come as hard as the awesome action pieces to make a film that would have been worthy of a cinematic release.Highly entertaining even though nothing knew!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I have had all today to think on the movie, and how enjoyable it was to watch on a Monday night after an eventful weekend. Not only is there many laughs, there is the crime ""thriller"" part, that actually cleverly keeps the viewer guessing as to what will happen next. There are various twists and turns, and some unexpected occurrences. For being a comedy, it has been cleverly written to keep the viewers attention to the storyline. Perhaps there was a few silly things, and the part with the ""bull"" was pretty poor CGI, however there are more plus notes than negative ones. Sometimes the movie is like Indiana Jones and the last crusade, sometimes a bit Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, sometimes a bit James Bond or Jason Bourne.

It has a 150 million $+ budget, plenty of star power, and still manages to barely even cause a single thrill in its audience.Take any metric by which you would like to rate a film. Dialogue? Makes all the mistakes, from exposition to flat references. Comedy? Somehow manages to make Reynolds unfunny. Suspense? Utterly predictable. Plot? Utterly stupid, complete with faux twists and everyone showing up everywhere at the right time (literally).Every scene left me feeling bored and annoyed. I even felt stupid when the twists were revealed because they were the one thing I didn't see coming, but this was only because they were so asinine they felt slapped on post hoc. Yet even if there had been genuine clues, I would've been far too unengaged to spot them.Why is this film so mediocre? In part, it is because it's designed as a Hollywood 'tick-all-the-boxes' kind of film. No one took any risks, it was meant to attract people with the star power and barely sit through it. I understand that, but that answer has never satisfied me, because with this budget they must've at least had a writing STAFF, i.e., multiple writers, who received at least one million. How, then, is this the result?I rate these films harshly, and I think we all should, because just as it isn't hard to score a C when your parents bribed you into college, it isn't hard to make something mediocre on a blockbuster budget. This film is comprised completely out of spam, filler content. Not a single risk was taken; nonetheless, it was rife with mistakes the industry should have learned by now. Compare this with any thrilling low-budget film, any rough gem, and you'll see it for the polished turd that it is.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot proves, once again, that she is good looking.The story is that Ryan Reynolds is the world's best (?) art thief, looking to steal Cleopatra's eggs (which I refuse to google whether or not exist). The Rock is an FBI profiler out to catch him, and Gal Gadot is a better (?) art thief who's also in the mix.This movie was a ton of fun. I honestly had a smile on my face throughout the majority of it. The jokes (mostly from Ryan Reynolds) all landed.Sure, it's formulaic and not particularly realistic, but it was never supposed to be. This movie harkens back to the great fun action comedies of the 80's and 90's. Big summer blockbuster vibes, just happened to be a November Netflix release.In my opinion, one of Netflix's best original movies. Not Oscar great, but fun great.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Toplining a blockbuster cast, with Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds joining Johnson in this action comedy, the Netflix release gets its title from the Interpol term referring to locating and arresting wanted persons.Red Notice isn't a serious heist film. The plot is feeble, but the A-list star power and humour are loaded enough to make the madness enjoyable.FBI profiler John Hartley (Johnson), on a tip-off from The Bishop (Gal Gadot), is in Rome, trying to foil the theft of an Egyptian egg, one of three priceless spherical jewels dating back to and belonging to Cleopatra. John is close on the trail of art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds), second in skill and reputation to the sharp and swift The Bishop, but always first with the glib one-liners.Both are competing to be first to find the elusive third egg and complete the trio, which would make it a prize sale in the jewel thief market.The race for the treasure takes them from Italy to Bali to Russia. When Hartley and Booth team up, the wisecracks fly fast and furious. Will they outwit The Bishop or will Interpol inspector Das (Ritu Arya) catch them before they get their hands on all three eggs? That's the bare bones of the story. There's a big twist towards the end, leaving the floor wide open for a sequel.The backstory gives a fedora-shaped hat-tip to the Indiana Jones movies, with some very obvious tributes such as the treasure hunt, Nolan's costume, and Nolan's whistling of the Raiders of the Lost Ark theme tune.There is something for the fanbase of each of the leads. The Deadpool devotee can expect trademark Reynolds humour, Wonder Woman fans can bank on Gadot glamorously delivering the goods. Johnson's followers can be sure of self-deprecating jibes as well as chunks of action. The Johnson-Reynolds combine is a quintessential buddy comedy tie-up.That the cast is having a good time is evident. And so they should, as this is the film's greatest - and maybe only - appeal. As mindless entertainment built on silly jokes, a thin plot, visual effects and window dressing, Red Notice is a 117-minute distraction, easily forgotten in half that time.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Another Netflix film entertaining and sucking me in for 45 minutes and then slowly jumping the Shark from funny / action/ somewhat routine but fun story...to overfamiliar poorly laid out good old triple cross with ZERO shock or surprise.This pattern because I'm figuring 60-75 million just for the salaries of Gal Gadot, The Rock (I will not call him Dwayne Johnson his overly exceptional Dwarfing of Hulkamania went beyond saving wrestling) and Ryan Reynolds who is practically a partner at this point is irritating me.Don't misunderstand it's our society and that's what Box Office names get. However combined with production costs I rather pay Five dollars less a month than be bombarded by costly productions that get a lot of viewing hours are logged.Another ridiculous metric...the metric is ""Did making this film with hours lead to a matching increase in membership at least for that month.I guess this is more about Netflix that had it stuck to its original plan to replace stone and brick video stores. And with advances continued with that concept modifying to by today a huge video store for a flat 40...Then there would be no 500 streaming services.I have a globalized entertainment company with mediocre content, rarely a new theatrical release unless it was a bomb or overly successful. I rather have access to everything remastered bt FULL HD From 1927-Today for a flat rate. The % of actually good entertainment in shows and films produced by Netflix compared to how many they make is low....
This business plan post COVID this movie in theaters would bomb. I doubt there'd be a studio willing to make this film for theatrical release. It's the type of movie that opens #1 and by week 2 it's not in the top 5 the following week.I don't think this plan is worth 25 a month.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

You'd think there was at least an off chance of them striking gold with a production, but everything they do is just hardcore Hollywood throwback fromage. This is yet another Netflix Original along with 6 Underground and Spenser Confidential that features either copy/paste action sequences or cliche hooks and twists. They get decent actors like Mark Wahlberg and Ryan Reynolds and make utterly forgettable films one after the other. Another poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly written, soulless film. Gal Gadot is already overrated as an actual actress, and, as much as I'd love to lie on top of her, was an utterly piss poor choice for this kind of role. She has the looks, the elegance and the body, but she is hardly the sly vixen type that the role clearly calls for, just being realistic here. Great Wonder Woman though, and never unpleasant to watch.

The trio in the faces of Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot turned out to be just perfect. I'm thrilled! The film met all my expectations. To begin with, I will tell you for those who do not know what a ""red notice"" is and continue my opinion. Interpol uses the phrase red notice as an international request for the arrest of particularly dangerous criminals. As soon as I found out the cast, I immediately decided that I would definitely watch the film itself, and when I came across footage from the filming of a new action movie, the desire to watch it only grew. The novelty turned out to be exciting, dynamic: fights, chases - something is constantly happening, I didn't want to be interrupted, distracted for a second .... Funny jokes, unpredictable denouement, delightfully chic shooting. The film held my interest from the beginning to the very end. He seemed to absorb into himself, into his atmosphere, into his incredible dynamics and mood. I look forward to the continuation and really hope that it will not be worse.

Promising cast, very cool cinematography and beautiful scenery. The setup is clichéd to death by this point, good guy chases bad guy and it turns out they have a lot in common.Plot seems very disjointed though. The movie is edited in a way where the protagonists magically appear in the next stage as if they were characters in a video game. No sense of passing time (other than letters on the screen telling you where you are and how long it's been), and most importantly, no apparent struggle of getting into very well guarded places.In terms of cast, Gadot is mediocre at best, (we get that she's pretty, you don't need to rub it in every movie she's in), the Rock seems old & a little bored, but luckily this movie has Ryan Reynolds' energy and delivery to weirdly make up for all its shortcomings.It's a fun action flick but it seems you need to switch your brain off to enjoy it.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yes, movies needed to change. But they didn't have to be the same cynical clones of each other. Now, there's a sub genre of ""old"" movies, but why do we keep revisiting them? Simple. They don't make them like they used to.Ryan Reynolds plays the worlds greatest art thief, and Gal Gadot is the world's second greatest art thief. Pursuing them both is Dwayne Johnson, who belongs to the FBI. However, Dwayne Johnson gets framed and put into prison along with Ryan Reynolds, and they agree to team up to get out of there. They succeed, and pursue a priceless treasure in a race to beat Gal Gadot. Ryan Reynolds wants the treasure for himself, but Dwayne Johnson just wants to prove his innocence. They crisscross the globe with numerous hilarious encounters.The directing is top-notch. A movie doesn't have to be a serious drama to be artistically beautiful, and Ryan Marshall Thurber demonstrates that amazingly while having a good time. The cinamtograohy, adds to the excitement, with an (in my opinion) Oscar deserving score. Not too serious, but it fits the movie perfectly and beyond. The acting isn't anything new, but the actors do an amazing job of almost playing themselves and their stereotypes, which, lets be honest, is what we really want to see in a movie like this.A harsh critic might not enjoy this film. There's no question there are a lot of happy ""coincidences"" that occur that are not realistically plausible. But this is a crime that Indiana Jones and Star Wars are frequently guilty of anyway. Some movies you just can't over analyze, and that's ok. A movie can't be silly, but it can be fun. I've seen a lot of terrible movies that in their attempt to be fun they just end up being silly. A joke of a movie. But Red Notice is not only good, but it's fun too. And that's why it's my favorite action/comedy movie ever.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But 10 minutes into the movie, I am beginning to tune out everything that is happening. Same old, same old.One, Gal Gadot is hot but that's all there is to it. She can't carry the character with her basic acting. And don't even get me started with Dwayne Johnson. Please stop, just stop taking acting gig that requires you to be cheeky, funny and cunning because you are none of the above. It's like watching a brick (or a rock in this case) kissing another brick. Unlike Brendan Fraser in The Mummy, Dwayne is not even close to being charming. Cringey is more like it. Looking at you too Jungle Cruise.Second, let's talk about the plot twist. It's like halfway through the movie, the writers decided to take a shortcut and threw in the most boring and laziest twist ever. Because, hey the viewers are stupid and they won't see this coming. *rolls eyes*Trust me, this is like all the other Ryan Reynolds' movies. Snarky, smart ass comment. Weird jokes. Movie references yada yada. Nothing new there but still, not as bad as Gal Gadot's and Dwayne Johnson's on screen chemistry. The dance floor scene?

Ryan Reynolds is starting to get seriously annoying. I think that's the reason why I didn't appreciate Free Guy and here I also rolled my eyes several times with all those constant (failed) jokes. Gal Gadot surprisingly is not that bad. Not something special either, but cool and with a lot of charm.Most of the film is predictable and most of the jokes didn't work for me. I also don't understand how you spend all this money in a film and you can't even present a bull looking like a bull. The CGI on that scene is bad, bad, bad.Either way, some good action pieces, some funny references and good (at least entertaining) 20 final minutes saved this from the total disaster.

It's an action flick.And it is a Buddy Film.I was hesitant to mention with my initial write-up but of all the comparisons out there for this movie the one that hit me the most, and perhaps because of my age, was a comparison to The Road to....... movies with Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy LaMour. It's all there the buddy film, the double-crosses, the romance aspect, and of course the comedy. Homage can be found to many films here but you can't neglect the Road Series.The Chemistry is there between The Rock and Reynolds. Their interactions and timing are there. And they were just plain fun to watch together. I can see them teamed up this way again.The writing was good. Filming, editing and effects were good.And no, I did not forget Gal Gadot, she's always a joy to watch and played off Rock and Reynolds well.This film is easy to enjoy.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Ryan Reynold's movies are starting to get tiresome. It's not all about him. What about developing the other characters a bit more and giving them some humour to act out. I so nearly switched off half way through because his smart alec approach was becoming very annoying, but I stuck with it and I am more the fool for doing so.I like Ryan Reynolds but he seems to be hell bent on having all of his characters become these fast talking making up on the spot non funny lines, where he should become more focused on developing his character, cutting out the quantity of jokes and going for the quality.I look forward to seeing this happen in his future movies. Come on Ryan, you can do it. 😁👍","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

A really, really annoying Bugs Bunny.How is he still getting those roles, I'm not sure. Why is he still accepting those roles, I'm even less sure. This character served him well in Two Guys and a Girl, and fit Deadpool, but it really feels old now. What's up, doc?Together, they endlessly chase each other to obtain three artifacts, ride weird CGI roller coasters, and mix and mash bits of every other, better heist/adventure movie they could come up with. Problem is, it feels very cheap and childish, with zero tension. Actors seem to be trying hard, even The Rock, but there's just nowhere to go with this weird soup of a script.Grand adventure movies like this are rare nowadays, but Red Notice doesn't seem to reinvigorate the genre, even despite star power and insane budget. The final taste ends up being bitter, and you're not quite sure if you watched a heist movie, a parody of one, or an episode of Looney Tunes.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","An Average Entertaining Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7658315/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","Over the years Netflix has been getting bigger and bigger and Red Notice is the biggest film project that they have ever done and I have now watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a police profiler have to work with a thief to clear his name.Main Character
Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays the lead character and he is exactly what you would expect. He is charming and cracking one liners left right and centre as you would expect by Johnson as he is a pro at doing just this. But I just feel like this is expected by now and the actual character here is really dull, I know this isn't a film to be taken too seriously but I just need some more character depth or else this is just another Dwayne Johnson action film with no substance.Supporting Characters
Ryan Reynolds plays the thief in the film and I kind of feel similar with is performance. He is entertaining as he pretty much is in everything with one liners a plenty and the two of them have some decent chemistry. His character is handled better but it still leaves quite a bit to be desired and the humour was the thing that was chosen instead. Gal Gadot plays the antagonist and she seems like she is having a lot of fun. It did feel like something different for her as an actress and it made her performance stand out more to me then the other two more prominent characters in the film. Ritu Arya from The Umbrella Academy plays an interpol agent and she is functional but I guess I wanted to see more of her and what really motivated her to the plot of the film.Story
The story of the film has some fun and exciting set pieces with decent chemistry between Johnson, Reynolds and Gadot with the situations that they are placed in. But the film is so generic that it makes the whole thing worse. If you have watched some films you have seen plenty of story elements from this film and then they throw in a twist that makes little sense just to try and spice up the story a bit more.Script
The script has some funny lines and interactions in it, which considering this is a film that sees Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds share the screen you would expect that. But the film is pretty illogical and the drama falls really flat that by the end I kind of wondered what was the entire point of it overall.Style
The film does have some good action scenes, they are fun and have lots of great stunt work and action co-ordination in tact. But there is just something a bit off, the pacing is okay though I think even the style is quite generic and it hurts the overall feel of the film.Overall
Overall, Red Notice is an average film. Despite the A List cast and heavy financial backing it falls short and needed better writing and creative decisions being made.Rating - 5/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Instead we are fed mediocre fare, with the actors the only redeeming feature.The story is a big disappointment, especially in how predictable it is, and the blase manner of the plot lines. The action sequences were good, but that is not the point of a movie is it? It is like putting on some icing to cover a badly baked cake!Five stars just for the actors - I mean they do a very good job with a below-par script.

I haven't seen any new comedy movie even close to what Jump Street and The Hangover were. It's suffice to say that comedy is dead and now we have high budget action ""comedy"" movies with A-list actors, because that's the only way people are gonna watch your movie, put Ryan Reynolds or Dwayne Johnson, or in this case both of them, in your movie and you'll be rolling in dough.And I know it's a cliché thing to say - and so are their roles - and many people have already said it before, but are we not tired of seeing Ryan and Dwayne in the same exact role for the millionth time? Are studios so afraid to make something different and stop writing the same characters for these two?And can someone please tell me where the ""comedy"" was? The only time I chuckled in this movie was with the Putin pictures scene and that was a low hanging fruit. You shouldn't expect to just put Ryan Reynold in your movie and give him some dumb lines to say and call it a ""comedy"". Seriously, wtf were those dialogues? Who wrote the things Ryan had to say? You're not writing Deadpool, even though you are trying to copy it, but you're really bad at making decent funny dialogue, it's so forced and weird and unfunny.This movie also tries to be a smartass and self-aware, while being a parody of itself, it's copying every movie imaginable and there are twists after twists after twists that you're expecting 99% of it and it gets really boring. And by 99% percent, I mean that surprisingly I didn't see the last one coming, which I should have, but you throw all these twists from the beginning that your major twist don't really have an impact.What worked in Game Night with it twists, was that they were few, but smart and unexpected and they knew not to go overboard with it.Also lo and behold, the pinnacle of characterization: Daddy issues.All in all, the movies is predictable, full of cliché, full of self-indulgent twists, bad dialogue, lack of realism and weak plot.But you may ask why did I only rate it 4 and not lower. Well, as I much as I wanted to not like this movie, I realized at the end that it surprisingly didn't bother me that much and I kinda liked the ending twist, even though the movie way overstayed its welcome. But the movie wasn't that kind of movie that goes on my nerve and make me hate every minute I wasted on it (I'm looking at you Life 2017 starring Ryan Reynolds!), so I go kinda soft on it.But for the love of god, next time you're making an action movie with these two in it, please please don't call it a comedy.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Dialogue that is almost entirely exposition. A clumsy score that oversells what's on screen.And where did the rest of the budget go? Locations, it seems, but not on wirework, CGI or cinematography. There are far too many quick jump cuts and tight shots, and no sense of scale.It's also half an hour too long for its meagre material, and drags badly in the middle. A cheap quota quickie that's neither quick, nor cheap - although it looks it.Netflix are becoming masters at wasting talent, and having entire productions simply phone it in.

Everything falls apart due to the occurrence of some unexpected events and something has to be done to change it.I enjoyed this movie because it had an interesting plot, filled with plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. The combination of comedy with action was very good and created a nice atmosphere in the movie. The interpretations of Ryan Reynolds' who played as Nolan Booth, Gal Gadot's who played as The Bishop and Dwayne Johnson's who played as John Hartley were very good. The direction which was made by Rawson Marshall Thurber was equally good with the interpretations of the cast, and he presented very well both the plot and his main characters. Finally, I have to say that ""Red Notice"" is a nice, entertaining movie and I recommend you to watch it because you will laugh and you will have a great time.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

I just don't like anything _other than_ the cast. Only recommended as background noise.-----
Maybe my excitement and expectations were too high. I realized halfway through that I was less into the story than I was seeing what the much-adored cast were going to do next. A few more mins went by and it was clear that I was only watching it for the cast and, if they were replaced with lesser-known actors, I would have turned it off in the first half hour. Obvious product placement from stars' dueling alcohol brands aside, Red Notice just didn't bring anything new to the table. Gadot played a character marginally different from what she's done in the past, but Reynolds and Johnson just played Reynolds and Johnson. The script was full of clichés. Very clever lines and scenarios may have been funny the first 50 times I've heard them, but they just didn't work for me this time. Finally, the action was marred by poor editing (obvious green screen, too many cuts, shaky cam).Even now, as I look at the score I gave it, I think it might be way too generous, once again taking advantage of my affinity for the cast. I mean, if you like these actors, even with a low score, you still kinda have to see this movie, don't you? That's fine. Pop some popcorn and try to enjoy yourself. Just keep in mind it's probably better suited for background noise than a watch party.4/10 ... +1 pt each for Gadot, Johnson, and Reynolds. Only 1 pt total for everything else.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Of course, I added it to my ""Wishlist"" and finally found time yesterday to watch it.In one of the main roles, handsome Ryan Reynolds starred, he plays one of the most elusive thieves in the world - Nolan Booth. He is not only charming and charismatic, he is well educated, smart, he is dexterous and quirky. Having committed many ""high-profile"" crimes, this time he laid eyes on one of the three golden eggs of Cleopatra, which is stored in the museum of Rome (look at the sights and rejoice, you were there)FBI agent John Hartley is trying to stop Nolan - everyone probably knows the actor ""The Rock"" - Dwayne Johnson (wow ... he's really huge! He's also 196 cm tall!)Well, how without seductive, fatal women? Of course not! Gal Gadot, whom I personally met recently when I watched the movie ""Justice League Zack Snyder""The film itself for me is a hybrid of ""Agent 007"" and ""Indiana Jones"". The same rapidly developing events, fights (cultural), chases, struggle for possession of the rarest value. There is not a single moment of ""sagging"" in Red Notice, there is always something going on here. But you know, I watched 1.5 hours in one breath, and then I realized that somehow it was already enough ... tired ... tired, so the next 30 minutes already looked a little harder. Although I think if I had watched it in the cinema, the whole film would have flown by like one minute.Funny and relevant to what is happening jokes perfectly decorated this film. In general, the film is very dynamic and atmospheric, it looks easy, but somehow does not leave any special emotions after itself. I watched it, enjoyed the action, well, I forgot after a couple of days (which, probably, sounds insulting to the creators and Netflix, because the budget of the film is not a joke)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The last remark greatly raises the bar for the film compared to the obscene ""The Bodyguard of the Killer's Wife"" with R. Reynolds ... Probably, D. Johnson was able to influence the script for the better, since he is more removed in ""family"" films. Or R. Reynolds took up his mind after the success of the family ""Protagonist"" and decided to no longer go too far with toilet humor ...In fact, a GOOD FILM filled with chases, gunfights, scuffles, special effects and other bells and whistles typical of an expensive action comedy...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

One big budget. One powerful outlet. But all we got was another Netflix copy and paste high def glossy action cliche. A story so predictable and dull you could have asked a child to write it. So lazy was the story that it felt a little insulting.Gal Gadot is always amazing on film. Fact. Ryan always funny. And The Rock so 'insert same character' here. But all three great stars just took a pay cheque and sleep walked through one cliche after another. It was painful to watch. It looked great. But the story was so weak and the convenient plot twist so damn lazy.It tries to cover for the lazy story with humour. Trying to be 'self aware', but this dint hide the money grabbing intent of such poor writing.Yes you will be entertained. Good actors. Special effects. Action. Fights. Adventure. All the boxes ticked. But this is nothing more than a quickly made cheap cop out created to optimise profits. Nothing more, nothing less.Recommended, but with your brain in neutral.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot was also there, and even after all these years, she still cannot act.It felt like a generic adventure film for quite some time, until they gave up at the end and just started throwing stuff at you.When the twist bombardment began I was just laughing cause I gave up trying to understand why anything in this film had to happen at all. I wasn't into the 'big stakes' from the beginning, and there wasn't anything mysterious about this, but in the end, everything was just rendered pointless.There were two funny jokes, one good action shot at the beginning, everything else was supposed to work, but was indeed either CGI or green screen. So all the Indiana Jones-sy stuff (besides the crate reference) didn't feel at all, because it wasn't real-life.They set up the sequel and the film will probably sell, but even as these mindless adventures go, in the end, this was a waste of time.Mildly entertaining/no characters/no story/no attachment out of 10.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot are interesting draws, which only highlights how disappointing the rest of the movie is. A production that snagged three A-listers would hopefully possess more substance. Red Notice isn't necessarily bad but it definitely isn't good. It simultaneously looks like an expensive blockbuster and a cheap knockoff. The decent CGI is grossly overused, smothering every action scene in inauthenticity. This artificiality extends to the production design as well. Red Notice tries to be global and elaborate, but is failed by limited sets that shrink the world it attempts to construct.Meanwhile, although the cast is famous, their acting is underwhelming. Gadot is wooden and Reynolds' constant quips are downright annoying. Johnson plays his usual role, which isn't much but is fine. Perhaps this is because the material is largely uninspiring. There is a twist that keeps the script from being completely unoriginal, but that only helps so much. In the end, this all adds up to a film that is shallow in every sense. Red Notice may be easy to advertise but is totally void of craft.Writing: 4/10

It's got a charismatic cast sent globe-hopping to beautiful places on a treasure hunt straight out of an ""Indiana Jones"" movie. How could it go wrong? Well, for starters, Thurber and everyone involved forgot a little thing called personality. Rarely have I seen a movie that feels more processed by a machine, a product for a content algorithm instead of anything approaching artistic intent or even an honest desire to entertain. When the poster for ""Red Notice"" was released, most people lamented its Photoshopped, bland nature. They didn't realize how honestly it captured the movie. The film opens with an awkwardly inserted info dump about three coveted eggs that were once the property of Cleopatra. Only two have been discovered, making the missing golden egg into a Holy Grail for treasure hunters, including one of the world's most notorious criminals Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds). In the film's relatively effective opening sequence, Hartley catches Booth trying to steal one of the eggs, inadvertently tying the two for the rest of the film into a classic buddy comedy dynamic-the muscle guy and the fast talker. They battle the authorities, a few bad guys, and another criminal mastermind nicknamed The Bishop (Gal Gadot) as they bounce around the world, trying to obtain all three eggs and sell them to the highest bidder. Films like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""National Treasure"" were clear inspirations on ""Red Notice"" but to say this movies lacks the identity of great action/adventure movies would be an understatement. ""Red Notice."" Made for $200 million, none of that fortune was spent on anything that retains a human touch-it's the iPhone app of action movies. So much money, so much charm, so much movie, and yet it adds up to so very little. ""Red Notice"" is as disposable a movie as you'll see this year, something that most Netflix subscribers will have trouble remembering exists weeks later. In theaters tonight, November 4th. On Netflix on November 12th.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I genuinely don't understand why it received such a low rating, but I'm glad I decided to give it a chance because I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie reminded me of the Indiana Jones series with its quest for a vanished treasure, clever puzzles, humor, unexpected twists, and non-stop action. The film's plot is full of thrilling moments, and the treasure hunt aspect kept me on the edge of my seat. The mix of action sequences, witty banter, and unexpected plot developments created a perfect balance, making it an enjoyable and engaging watch.In conclusion, I highly recommend giving Red Notice a chance, despite the initial low ratings. It's a fun-filled and exhilarating movie that will appeal to anyone who enjoys action-adventure films with a touch of mystery and humor. I, for one, would eagerly anticipate any future installments.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was interested to read that this was the most expensive Netflix film at 200 million dollars to make, and was intrigued to see what this would be like. After watching Red Notice i can liken it to films like Indiana Jones, Lost City and Romancing the Stone. In other words a fun Sunday afternoon adventure type film. The plot has lots of twists and turns and although it is nearly 2 hours long the film zips along at a good pace never being dull. All three leads have good chemistry, The Rock being..well the Rock, and Gal Gadot putting in a fun performance. Reynolds is good but his performance does border into annoyance at times with the comedic elements. Action scenes are good, although as is the way these days there is too much CGI which can be a bit off putting. All in all though i really enjoyed Red Notice, it is a film i would revisit again and a film i certainly enjoyed watching. Everything is set up for a sequel and i hope they make one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We've seen the overpowered Interpol agent in a load of movies in the past few years although the celeb guest appearance was pretty annoying.It's a fun family action movie with humour and interesting locations aplenty, no more no less.

Forget about the sad and awful mess the world is in for a while and kick back and enjoy the ride. Critics are critics for a reason, if they don't find something to bitch about they're not doing anything worthwhile. I truly appreciate the three leads of this movie, they ENTERTAINED ME!!! They did they're job and they did it well!!! I don't want to think about how certain things can and cannot happen in real life!!!! I want fantasy!!! Isn't that what movies are for?!!

Three eggs of Cleopatra and the best of the art stealers of the World are behind them - Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot .Action stretches from corner to corner with funny remarks from Ryan takes me to memoirs of 007 series with Sean Connery and Eva Jones . The movie drags in between but the sharp changing of location would keep you hooked. Some scenes look illogical but you have to give liberty to the director when you are enjoying Action- Heist.Probably our Bollywood should take lessons as to how a normal plot can be made an engrossing one .

It's somewhat saved by Ryan Reynolds comedic talent, though whose dueting with Dwayne Johnson falls rather flat. Gal Gadot is pretty and all, but her constant turning up out of nowhere, finding the two without any effort what so ever, is an annoyance. That is, up until the big ""reveal"" by the end. A pretty lame reveal, that is. It must have been a rather costly production, wich makes Red Notice a watchable movie. At the most. A scary thought I got, was not me fantasizing about them in a 3some, but the notion that there seem to be an underlying promise to a sequal.

The three main actors are top notch actors and have great chemistry together. You can tell the three main actors are having fun in the roles they portray with great back and forth banter between them. The writing is witty and contains great twists and turns. It has good action scenes, but it also brings you a nice adventure story with some Indian Jones go find the hidden artifact feel to it. I don't understand all the negative reviews especially from the people that say they've seen this type of movie before. Those negative reviews come from people that need to seriously lighten up and think his/her own poop is somehow gourmet. I've got news for those people as if you've seen one James Bond movie, you've seen them all. If you've seen one Marvel movie, you've seen them all. I'm not trying to knock Marvel or James Bond, but simple to point out that certain criticism doesn't make sense. This movie is kind off a parody of many action/adventure theft movies and they execute it perfectly. Many action and/or theft movies can be so incredibly stuffy and boring, but this movie has a great vibe to it and doesn't take itself too seriously. This movie leaves you on a high note for another theft to take place with an Interpol inspector doing all she can to close in on them. I look forward to the Red Notice sequels.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There were no likable characters, nobody to relate to, no character growth and all of the protagonists were flat out annoying. Like, yeah sure they added a plot twist near the end, and Ed Sheeran was a nice touch, but frankly, that was the only interesting part of the movie. And then it became the movie that just won't end. The plot was predictable most of the time and many scenes are so overdone. I'm out.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

One thing that becomes obvious from the outset is that Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, isn't an actor.. Ryan Reynolds plays a quick-witted, happy hour lucky, ace art thief whose exploits put him on the most wanted list 18 countries..The Rock tries to play an FBI profiler on an international hunt to track down and apprehend Ryan's character. To our surprise, circumstances compel the two to work together as partners. Not necessarily a new idea, but one that seems to work well on occasion. This doesn't qualify as one of those occasions. There was no chemistry between the two, largely due to the lackluster performance of Dwayne Johnson's character.Dwayne Johnson is a monotonous albeit articulate script reader, and his total lack of dynamic range is painfully palpable. The Rock's aspiration to branch out as an actor is analogous to an aspiring singer with a vocal range of one note (which is slightly out of tune). If anything, I kind ofI felt bad for Dwayne, as he really seemed confident in his abilities. My misplaced pity quickly evaporated as I realized he was likely paid more to make this film than most who would watch the film make in a year.The story consists of the same sequence of events repeated over and over again, albeit in different locations. The action scenes, like the other scenes in the movie, were quite tame and often made little sense. Who cares? It's Ryan Reynolds and the Rock! (kinda' sounds like a song title... like ""Benny and the Jets). Like the movie does so often, I digress.All in all, there wasn't much creative effort put into this film. The producers banked on the draw power of Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.starring together in an action/buddy flick, and I doubt they were wrong to do so..There isn't much in the way of violence or other issues to warrant a PG-13 rating, and as such, it's a fairly family friendly movie.Would I watch it again?. There are too many great buddy/action movies worth a second watch. This isn't one of them. Do as you will...Five stars is a stretch, but Ryan Reynolds hasn't yet worn out his unique acting schtick. I would like to see Reynolds take on a more serious role, if only to see his potential range., but that's neither here nor there (especially not here).Have fun, kids!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But mostly it is a collection of adventurous movie stamps and glossy pictures from all over the world: Egyptian pyramids, jungles, bullfighting, costume ball, Nazis - whatever your heart desires. A separate gift to the Russians is a large fragment in a Russian prison. The prison is something like Wolfenstein Castle on top of a snow-covered cliff. I remember the guard who likes photos of a half-naked Putin on Instagram during working hours. The actors quickly, but with invariably sour faces, move from one shooting pavilion to another. Johnson looks especially confused, who, according to the author's plan, needs to portray two or three conflicting emotions, and this is one or two more than he is used to. But Reynolds, who in contrast with him should bubble like champagne, pulls at best on yesterday's duchess. Their implied bromance causes only excruciating awkwardness, and nothing changes from the visits of Wonder Woman: it seems that these three were simply created not to be together.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A project where the Rock is not clichéd, but on the contrary is completely different - pretty aged and shabby, with bristles, with a different dubbing, in a brown leather coat that is uncharacteristic for him, a white shirt, here he is constantly tormented by everyone to anyone, and at the same time in Russian prison clothes he carries stones and washes dishes! (The question is, where are you such a world-wide creation of a multimillionaire and the most expensive actor of our time!) This is a project in which the beauty Gal Gadot at the peak of her form has never been extremely sexy in the cinema, as she is now, and where she even fully manifests - sexier, than anyone else on planet Earth!This is a project that constantly surprises with a change in the dispositions of forces, a change in the results of the winners, a change in the main characters. This project is constantly dominated by the color RED, so brightly highlighted in the name, by the way, a very unusual name for a multi-million dollar project. A project that is similar in some ways to the public 'Jumanji': it evokes the suit of the Rock, a little action, but nevertheless the film is not boring, but interesting. The project, where Ryan Reynolds whistles the main theme from 'Indians', once again hints at the connection with the adventures of the fourth part of this franchise. A project where a major from 'Silicon Valley' is pleasantly charismatic, where a bust of a law enforcement officer from Interpol sparkles. Where many worldwide locations. Where the camera operator does nice interesting things. Where Russian inscriptions are written without errors (glory to those, Lord! ..)!! ..The only thing that probably spoils the impression, and this is typical for almost any recent film with The Rock - is a HUGE amount of chroma key for ANY little bit moving scene. It even got to the point that it even happened with the exit to the Louvre and that one was filmed in the studio. It's unfortunate, of course ((.. In modern films, realism is already lacking (which Tom Cruise and Christopher Nolan are actively fighting against), but when NREALISM is squeezed into the main main scenes, this, of course, is frustrating ... But this is all lyrics and a small wish!In general, in my opinion, the FILM MORE THAN SUCCESSFUL! Here 3 main characters are very cool modern superstars! Here is an interesting picture. Adventures. Nice number. One impulse. Single style. No sagging. Watching is interesting, tasty, easy, captures and falls in love, even if there are practically no chases and shootings! So watch the movie for sure and don't hesitate! To be honest, I still don't remember that from the last single copy there was something more suitable than this tape!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had 2 glasses of vodka and still couldn't get into it. This movie wants to be a fun adventure movie with interesting action sequences and quirky humor, but what it it really is is Netflix's latest waste of money. I'm writing extra just to fill the word count for this review, which is the same approach I believe the script writers took towards this movie. Three famous actors who apparently are desperate enough for cash to agree to this film.

Red Notice was full of cliché's and actors playing their most popular characters, there's nothing new here. Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool without his suit, Dwayne Johnson is a version of Luke Hobbs and Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman without her powers. Though Gal Gadot (The Bishop) didn't have the passion of a villain, nor expressions, she seemed like great eye candy. Ryan (Nolan Booth) and Dwayne (John Hartley) had such good chemistry, I'd love to see that in more movies. Nonetheless, Red Notice is entertaining and fun. It's shot well, the visuals draw you in, and it's perfectly paced.The action scenes and stunts don't disappoint. The heist is barely technical so extremely easy to follow. The twists are fun, neither surprising nor shocking. Avoid logic though, it will fail you at numerous spots.Overall, it was nice, it was fun and it was entertaining.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is the perfect blend of comedy and action with plenty of twists and turns, adventure in exotic locations, and a worthy premise to match. I've read some pretty lowly reviews for this film and I honestly don't know what else they could've been looking for. This movie has it all.We are introduced to the story by way of a quick history lesson on Cleopatra and the three priceless, bejeweled eggs that Mark Antony gave to her, that have been scattered over time. Two of the eggs's locations are known, whereas the third is lost to the winds. Enter our characters who have more than just a curious interest in the eggs. We have our FBI Profiler, John Hartley, and two art thieves, Nolan Booth and his competition (as it were), Sarah Black who is also known as the Bishop. The race is on to find the last egg, each one trying to get to it first and chaos ensues.I know that the story is a bit weak and some of the double crosses going on doesn't compute, but what a fun ride this movie was! The cinematography was awesome with some excellent special effects. Ryan Reynolds was at his comedic best, and you could tell everyone was having a lot of fun with this film. It had your cat burglar appeal with some good ""heist caper"" moments, and a healthy dose of Indiana Jones thrown in.Movies are escapism - they are made to entertain us, make us smile, laugh, and excite us to elaborate stories and adenalin raising action scenes. On this note, ""Red Notice"" delivers all the goods. I had a lot of fun watching it, and am looking forward to seeing it again sometime down the road. And if all the indications at the end come true, then hopefully we'll be getting a sequel as well. 8 strong stars out of 10 and a high recommend.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ryan Reynolds is the only redeeming feature...he's his usual comedic self (nothing new but gives an otherwise bore fest, some humour).The Rock is....the Rock, he plays himself very well but don't expect anything that you haven't already seen in his other movies.Gal Gadot has a good part but just doesn't come across as a serious thief...more a spoof version of a thief.Overall it passed a couple hours but it was boring in my opinion and only watched to the end as family were watching also and I was hoping it'd get better.....it didn't.Very forgettable and a one time watch, for me.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot is simple: an FBI agent named John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) teams up with a notorious art thief named Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) to catch another art thief known as the Bishop (Gal Gadot), who is after three priceless eggs.The movie has some moments of action and humor, but they are few and far between. The chemistry between Johnson, Reynolds and Gadot is not enough to save the movie from its bland and predictable script, which relies on clichés, stereotypes and lazy jokes. The action scenes are uninspired and over-the-top, with no sense of danger or excitement. The plot twists are obvious and contrived, with no logic or coherence.The movie also suffers from a lack of originality and identity, as it tries to emulate other successful action-comedies, such as the Ocean's series, the Fast & Furious franchise, and the Mission: Impossible movies, but fails to capture their charm or style. The movie feels like a generic and forgettable Netflix product, with no memorable scenes or characters.Overall, Red Notice is a disappointing and generic movie that does not live up to the expectations of its cast and genre. It has some moments of fun and entertainment, but they are overshadowed by its flaws and shortcomings. It's not a terrible movie, but it's not a good one either.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Currently, it has an IMDB rating of 6.6 and I'd like to question those who decided that this film warranted such a generous score.This offering reminds me of a kid on a bike pulling wheelies, showing off, shouting to their friends ""look what I can do!"" without having any real skill at all. 'Red Notice' is a pretty boring and unbelievable pseudo-comic romp through the world of Interpol and organised crime. Ritu Arya plays an Interpol inspector who, at one point in this awful creation, is seen brandishing an enormous hand gun whilst she herself is dressed in a skimpy evening gown - just where on earth was she concealing it until now?Chris Diamantopoulos plays, well I'm not really sure who, but he's a bad man with an equally awful English accent with forced pronunciation. The dubbing on his character has been polished to the point where it's as plain as as the nose on my face that no on-set microphone (hidden or otherwise) could possibly reproduce every last detail of inflection quite so clearly as we have in the finished product.Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds are just themselves - as you would expect in a buddy movie. Nothing special, true to form and exactly as described on the outside of the package. The film stumbles over its own untied shoelaces for the best part of 2 hours, with nothing to show for itself apart from the money thrown in every direction and the weak and feeble storyline (if you could call it that). Netflix must be questioning their investment as nothing says ""Houston, we have a dud"" like wall-to-wall promotion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You could also start watching it from 30min in and still have same conclusion and feeling, or you could stop watching it at halftime being satisfied with what you saw and forgetting it after 2 hours.Chemistry behind Ryan, Dwayne and Gal is at moments great, at moments stretched but always on point and keeping you watching. However story is dull as it can be, it's overblown, trying to be smart but being dumb, forcing itself and failing to actually be innovative. It tries to sell you movie because of people that are starring in in instead of actually being good and because of that wanting you to see it.It will get you laughing couple times, and having a cringe face more often but when it comes to challenges it has non, and surprises are non existent because you probably aren't paying much attention to story as just letting movie play out.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ryan Reynolds is a cute nice guy. The Rock is a cute Wrestler turned actor. Put them all together and let them do their schtick. Make it a globe-trotting CGI laden action film and as it keeps jumping from place to place, the audience is rewarded with ridiculous plot contrivances, corny humor, unrealistic action scenes and a cheap thrill ride of a movie.If you want a dumb pop-corn movie I guess this it. There is nothing serious about this movie from the get go. From the McGuffin they are all chasing, to the ridiculous gangster and his special room that they must breach, to the finale in a treasure room, the writers went back to Mission Impossible and James Bond and about a zillion other past stories and hobbled together this thing that is based upon the charm of the three leads to overcome how everything is preposterous.Throw Gadot into hot red ballroom gown and a bathing suit, and I'm pretty happy. If you find the oh so overdone smarmy syrupy humor that is now become Reynold's trademark acceptable, then you'll be happy. The Rock plays it fairly straight and goes along for the ride. Technically it might have worked better with someone who is not a roided out giant in the role, but for the most part he is fine as a mostly straight-man to Reynold's tiresome jokester. So his fans will be happy.Bored is not really the right word for this movie, the leads are all so polished and the action keeps it moving.

You got Ryan Reynolds for the laughs, the Rock for the action and Gal Gadot for some sexiness. And that's what you get, not a bit more.The story is a bland heist plot weakly copied from several classics. Everything is so on the nose and predictable, it would be laughable if it wasn't for the entertainment routine Reynolds and Johnson bring to the table. Gal Gadot seems to just have fun, as her character isn't even written convincingly. That said nothing is there to convince you this is anything but a stupid, short-lived action flick.What's really bad is that for the money spend the movie looks amazingly amateurish at times. There are some really awkwardly cheap blue-screen shots aswell as bad CG-effects and the set design drops occasionally to a highschool stageplay level. For the budget spent, this is rather embarrassing.Furthermore the movie steals far too bluntly from James Bond and Indiana Jones movies. So much so, Reynolds obviously had the urge to comment this in his typical snarky way surprisingly often throughout the movie.The only reason to watch is the fun the two main actors have on the screen. Reynolds manages to pull any aweful screenplay around and here he saves this from being another horrible Netflix star hodgepodge.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, I didn't quite get that experience from this movie. I expected that this film would do something different, and would expand past the other cliched films of the same genre, because that's what makes these kinds of films fun. And it didn't really do that until the end, which didn't really change much for me.The ending was mediocre and just convenient for the sake of it being convenient, and many of the jokes didn't really land. Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds, and Dwayne Johnson plays Dwayne Johnson.Don't get me wrong, I love watching both actors on the big screen, I absolutely love Free Guy, Deadpool, and the Jumanji series. No complaints there. But when their performances can't carry the film, it really just doesn't need to exist.Only reasons this is getting 4:1. Loved the Indiana Jones references, the music, the action, and the concept all kind of reminds me of that impeccable franchise2. The jokes that did land were witty and fun3.

It has a woeful story, horrendously cliched, with very little to any thought going into the story.It's a movie that is clearly designed to make money by getting big name actors, namely a buff action guy, some comic relief, and a pretty leading lady, then throw them into a sub-par story, with no depth. Add in some actions scenes and the occasional catchy one liner to use in the trailers, and you'll get plenty of people coming through the door, or internet browser in this case.Furthermore, the film uses CGI so extensively that I genuinely wonder if they ever even needed to the studio to film this movie.Everything about this film just feels cheap, lazy, and designed by using a formula, rather than any kind of creative writing and production. This is the movie equivalent of those mobile games that take a catchy idea, promote it through a bunch of ads, but then put very little money and no effort into the design and production, and rake in the profits by getting people to pay to remove ads before they realise the game is rubbish a day or two later. This movie does the same thing, make it look appealing, spend very little time or money on it, and turn a profit before people actually realise they've been duped into watching a piece of garbage.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

That really doesn't give anything away, but by the time you watch the entire movie, you will know what I mean, that is, if you have the time to waste.I watched the film only because I like the individual lead actors. They were OK, but the script is so formulaic and the lines were just so cheesy, it was painful to watch. There is lots of banter with zero emotional connection between any two characters in the entire movie. Zero chemistry.Ryan Reynolds lines were the cheesiest and could not possibly have been delivered for real laughs by even the best of actors, which he is. OK, I laughed a couple of times. But the action was so ""canned Hollywood"" in its nature, it was boring. If you want to turn off your brain for two hours, watch the movie...Note: A rating of 5 means ""Barely Watchable.""

He's always been a solid actor that provides a good laugh... and he did it once again in this movie. However, he was probably the best thing about it. There were some good moments, and a good twist, but they left it way too close to the end to reveal that twist. There were some good stunts, but they were largely overshadowed by the lack of character arc in the Rock's character. But it did entertain for a few hours, and that's what a movie should do. It was a fun concept, and if you lower your expectations, you might just enjoy it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Her so-called acting is all about symbolism as you may find in low budget soap opera from the 90's. She just can't endorse a character, can't produce the right voice tone, she is so fake in acting, God it hurts so much watching her pretending to be an actress, not even close. Working in a fashion shop should do it for her, just leave the industry. Now Ryan, it is a shame that this actor play the same role again and again. Nothing changes, same all attitude, mimics, jokes... no really it's a shame, it's like Bateman. They both can't act someone else but themselves. I never imagined saying that the rock was good, he really is in such movie.

But the CGI usage looked horrible, like someone tried to save money on it, Gal's character was supposed to be sexy and seductive but instead, she seemed lame and not too smart (and don't take me wrong, I absolutely LOVE Gal Gadot and I love to watch her in almost anything. Almost anything, just not this.) The only thing that kinda made us watch the whole disaster until the very end were Reynolds' obligatory comments throughout the whole thing (for some, this might seem like a paradox).

The Rock plays The Rock as he has done in so many movies. Ryan Reynolds defaults to wisecracking Deadpool style. Gal Gadot shows some sparks as potential diabolical villain (she should really explore that) but it is all very very bland.To keep things moving, there is added an Interpol.agent thrown into this who chase Johnson and Reynolds around - with the little factual mistake of American writers having once again gotten the idea that they are an international FBI.I would have to say this is utterly forgettable and could easily have been made much, much better - certainly very easy money for the 3 leads.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

COVID was one reason since the film was shut down. I was excited for Red Notice despite the early reviews. Red Notice was okay as expected, its a cliche action comedy.The acting is good, Ryan Reynolds gives the best performance. Johnson and Reynolds have good chemistry like with Hobbs & Shaw in fact I think their banter inspired Red Notice, Universal was the original studio. Gal Gadot is good but her role is small or you could say its average.The plot is formulaic, it could of been worse. You know what's going to happen from beginning to end. There are a few twists but they don't work in fact the final twist is forced. Red Notice is exposition heavy so you must pay some attention.The action is crazy but serviceable which may sound weird. No, its not really crazy like the Fast & Furious series. Nobody dies so there's no tension or grit I suppose.Overall, Red Notice was okay. Its a goofy Netflix movie which plays it safe. If you like the leads, give it a shot. If Red Notice spawns a sequel, hopefully its better.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Especially The Rock shouldn't brag about this being the most expensive movie Netflix ever made, when he took a big chunk of that budget and it looks a notch above dogsh**, pardon the expression.Why do an adventure movie in the first place? If you don't show exotic places and real stunts, but instead a green screen with poorly integrated actors. Honestly, the post-production on Netflix movies (and even Marvel movies) are reaching below mediocrity. Not only are the performers terribly integrated visually, but the actors don't even make an effort of bringing the scene to 'life' with their performance. The worst example being the bull/Arena sequence. The bull looks and moves like a cartoon, the characters behave like they aren't in danger, but nothing is funny or exaggerated. So what are audiences supposed to feel watching this? It's almost like the studio is unable to grasp the concept of a movie.The Rock stars in his 50th movie with a milquetoast script where he has to partner with a comedic sidekick. As executive producer he makes sure to look cool and probably directed the movie himself.Ryan Reynolds is chewing the scenery with his schtick that was already grating on the first Deadpool. Gal Gadot, says lines... They cast these three actors to play themselves and I guess that probably alone cost half the budget. I hope it was worth it for some Netflix executives who paid the bills.For everyone else (aka the audience) this is a complete waste of attention.Avoid it.2 out of 10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"5","/10","An entertaining yet ultimately generic, forgettable Netflix blockbuster","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7576537/?ref_=tt_urv","JoelAlexanderr","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94233651/?ref_=tt_urv","23 November 2021","It seems the Mecca of dumb quippy action movies has arrived. RED NOTICE, a recent arrival on Netflix, is an expensive and overblown spy thriller starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot. Supposedly it boasts the largest budget of any Netflix movie thus far. This is impressive, but it appears that much of the money went into collecting the A-list stars and planting them in elaborate sets with CGI backgrounds. The plot almost never makes sense for more than a couple minutes, and almost every scene is over-the-top to the point of absolute absurdity. And yet, because of Reynolds and Johnsons' charisma, the movie is constantly entertaining and engaging. RED NOTICE knows what it wants to be and never aspires to be too much more, which seems to call back to old Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. Does this make the movie good? Not really -- but I can see RED NOTICE , and many of Johnson's other movies, seen in the same light as Stallone and Schwarzenegger films in the near future.The plot of RED NOTICE isn't anything new or exciting -- it comes across as a typical globe-trotting spy thriller at best. Ryan Reynolds plays Nolan Booth, an art thief who self-identifies as the best in the world at his craft. However, FBI Special Agent John Hartley, played by Dwayne Johnson, is hot on his tail and knows where Booth is headed next. Both are on the hunt for three expensive and beautiful eggs that were supposedly a token of appreciation gifted from Marc Antony to Cleopatra back in Ancient Egypt. The variable that thwarts them both throughout their pursuit is The Bishop (Gal Gadot), a mysterious kingpin who manipulates the world of art theft to her own benefit. In order to outplay The Bishop, they must team up to find the three eggs before she does while trying to chase their own ulterior motives.One trait that a spy movie needs to have in order to succeed is the smarts to outwit its own audience. If any movie has characters that constantly double-cross each other, then the movie needs to trick the viewers into believing these same tricks. Unfortunately, RED NOTICE director/writer Rawson Marshall Thurber seems to think his script is far smarter than it actually is, making the twists and turns of this movie feel laughable instead of shocking. On a dramatic level it doesn't quite land either, because although the two main male characters are given some solid backstories, the constant twists render these stories pointless because certain motivations are tweaked as the movie progresses.So if RED NOTICE doesn't quite work as an espionage thriller and a dramatic character piece, then how exactly does it work? Well, it's a ridiculously overblown action movie with Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson in which they banter and throw insults at each other for damn near the entire runtime. I'd argue that the movie doesn't need to be much more than that. Reynolds is his typical scene-stealing, hilariously entertaining self, and the movie would be a complete failure if it weren't for his presence here. While Dwayne Johnson gives a fun performance as well, Reynolds elevates the quality of each passing scene just by making stupid comments, and this alone, along with the fantastic chemistry between the two actors, is reason to check this movie out on Netflix.The rest of this film is generic and forgettable fluff, and despite the two charismatic lead actors, I cannot see myself looking back fondly on RED NOTICE in the future. Every other character besides the main couple ultimately falls flat, which includes Gal Gadot as The Bishop. This character seems like it was designed to give Gadot a chance to become a prolific deliverer of killer one-liners, yet she never steps up to the task, delivering another mediocre performance that makes me wonder why Gadot keeps landing such coveted roles. The CGI is also astonishingly inept given the enormous budget of this production -- roughly 200 million dollars that must have been spent to pay the A-lister stars on the poster. The film is jam-packed with big-budget action sequences, all of which look as if they were filmed in a green-screen studio in Los Angeles rather than an actual location. To me, this shows the amount of effort that was injected into this film: enough to let the major stars shine but not enough to make a quality movie worth remembering.Many critics are treating RED NOTICE as if it is an existential crisis for the state of filmmaking, and that the quality of movies will forever deteriorate because of this formulaic Netflix hit. I think they're overselling the issue, because RED NOTICE to me seems like a harmless and reasonably entertaining action thriller that knows its audience won't be looking for The Godfather: Part IV. Sure, it's a formulaic and conceptually average film that never delivers anything that isn't just a carbon copy of one of the four Indiana Jones movies. This, to me, is not a complete condemnation, although it does stop the movie from being one I would ever pay money for (some movies deserve to be on Netflix). Ryan Reynolds and The Rock fans will rejoice regardless of the quality, and I must admit that on that level, RED NOTICE is a success more than it is a failure.C.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

They are the bread & butter to my ability to completely tune out all of the daily stress. The problem with a good cheesy movie, is that it walks a fine line of awful and clean fun.I watched this today hoping that this would be a fun cheesy movie. Afterall, what else is Ryan Reynolds good for anymore? Sadly, this was a big ole fail.It tried way too hard to be the sort of irreverent spy movie that Reynolds is constantly doing. What put it solidly in the fail column were the tasteless product placements (Aviator Gin, constant reference to cell phones & plans etc). Do all of his businesses really need this much help? Does he (Reynolds) need to fire his accountant for giving such bad advice?Sadly, this is also a big spotlight on how bad an actor Dwayne Johnson is. It also didn't do any favors for Gal Gadot but we all knew she wouldn't win any Oscars. Mr. Johnson seemed to just be going thru the motions in this movie. There was none of his usual energy, heck, he didn't even pretend to show his 'charm'
So, to sum up. A big ole waste of Hollywood money in making this movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Despite boasting an impressive cast consisting of Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds, the film falls flat in almost every aspect. The storyline is a convoluted mess, attempting to blend action, comedy, and heist elements but ultimately resulting in a chaotic and disjointed narrative. The plot lacks originality, relying heavily on tired tropes and predictable twists that do little to engage the audience.The film's main downfall lies in its poor character development. Johnson, known for his charismatic performances, is reduced to a one-dimensional action hero devoid of any depth or emotional range. Gadot's character feels woefully underutilized, serving more as a token love interest rather than a meaningful contributor to the plot. Reynolds, often a reliable source of humor, is given a script filled with forced one-liners that fall flat, failing to elicit genuine laughs.Furthermore, the action sequences, touted as the film's main selling point, are underwhelming and lack creativity. The choreography feels uninspired, and the use of CGI is often glaringly obvious, detracting from any sense of realism. Even the supposed ""twists"" and ""reveals"" in the story are telegraphed well in advance, leaving little room for genuine surprise or suspense.The overall tone of the movie also feels confused, unsure whether it wants to be a high-stakes thriller or a lighthearted comedy. As a result, the film never manages to establish a consistent mood, leaving the audience disconnected and disinterested.In addition to its narrative and character flaws, it suffers from pacing issues. The film drags on for an excessive two-hour runtime, filled with unnecessary filler scenes that add little to the story or character development. This results in a movie that feels bloated and self-indulgent, struggling to maintain the audience's attention throughout.In conclusion, Red Notice is a disappointment on multiple fronts. Its lackluster storyline, poor character development, uninspired action sequences, and confused tone all contribute to its status as a bad movie. Despite the star power behind it, the film fails to deliver an engaging and enjoyable experience, ultimately leaving audiences with a forgettable and regrettable cinematic experience.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This goes out to this movie's director and all other bored directors out there that are planning to make a heist movie, stop with all of the fancy nonsense and place some emphasis on an intelligent script. All of us are tired of seeing the same old heists and when we see twists and turns, we know that you the director and actors know that the script is weak. Extremely weak in this case. And, if you want higher ratings, for the sake of God, somebody get Gadot some acting lessons or stop casting her in major releases. Her acting is lacking in depth and her timing is way off. Not many times do I look forward to watching a movie and less than halfway through it, check my watch a couple of dozen times for it to be over.

Considering they probably spent 30-50 million just on the cast alone you'd think they would have spent more on the script. It's tired and uninspired. Perhaps if you're twelve and you haven't seen this formula a 100 times before it might entertain you, but if not, then you'll see the dialog is flat, the story is completely implausible and unfortunately it just isn't interesting enough to let you overlook those issues. Even R Reynold's trade mark quips through out seem to drop like lead balloon as the directing and editing don't have the comedic timing to get laughs. D Johnson plays the strait man, but he is just too strait and serious and it has you doubting if he is in the same movie as the others. It's hard making a good and entertaining movie and this is exhibit A. But films like this really make you appreciate when you do see a film that really works. So, I guess it is good for something.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Heist movies can only be reinvented so many times, but the plot offers nothing new. You'll see the same tired act we've seen from Ryan Reynolds since Blade Trinity and Dwayne Johnsom fails to deliver any depth to an already poorly written character. For the record, I'm not a snob who only appreciates smart films. I realize it's meant to be mindlessly entertaining, but it's an insult to B movies.

Starring Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot, I got excited and gave it a watch. Sadly, it turned out to be a very middling experience.One would expect that there would be a great deal of charisma, enthusiasm and quality back-and-forth banter with the Actors (particularly the male duo) the movie has at its disposal but one would be wrong. It's not that there isn't any but what you get for the most part and for a lack of a better word, is pure MEH. It's not terrible, you can stomach it but there is nothing special here. Ryan Reynolds felt like he was doing most of the heavy work by being his usual self with some of the Deadpool persona bleeding in improvising in a not-so-good script still being my favourite part of the movie, whereas the Rock was oddly enough living up to his name, by being a rock, and for whatever reason, he or the director decided this would be the movie for it, against Deadpool... It's good to live up to your name but you still gotta choose an appropriate time and this was not it. Gal Gadot, while being gorgeous and someone who looked like she was having fun, also came with a heft dose of cringe in some of her scenes.Couple that with the goofy nature of the movie which, in a better-written film with interesting comradery between the characters could have been highly entertaining, with a plot that is easily forgettable with the propensity for ""twists"" without the wit to carry whatever level of self-awareness that movies try to present leaves you with a mishmash of elements taken from much better films where neither the sum of its parts nor the whole is as entertaining as it should have been. Again, it's MEH.Also, with a reported $200 Million budget, it has some pretty shoddy visuals at times while having some cool shots and sets otherwise. This is a repeated trend I've seen in big-budget movies lately where they'll have massive budgets but you don't see that reflected in the visuals/production properly. And if DUNE can look wonderful with a relatively lower budget, these other movies have no excuse with the level of CGI they end up using.Anyway, I was hoping for a lot more fun than I ended up experiencing. You get a massive sequel bait at the end and there are two more entries greenlit by Netflix, so we'll get more of this Trio. Not excited but who knows, they might end up being better. This is an average experience at best which I can't really recommend unless you have nothing else to watch and just want something to pass the time. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He seems to have written his own lines, while every other character's seem as if they were written by an AI. The Rock's character is rock-like, Gal Gadot seemed to be trying as hard as she could, but ultimately brought nothing to the table.Then there's Chris Diamantopoulos. He must have read the script, thought ""Well this is the worst attempt at an action movie I've seen in a while"", and decided that no matter what he did in his role, it couldn't possibly make the movie worse. The result is an accent that I can only describe as an attempt to copy Eddie Redmayne's accent in Jupiter Ascending, which itself was one of the most cringe-worthy parts of an overwhelmingly embarrassing movie. I don't want to see Eddie Redmayne in another movie until he's seen on video giving his Oscar back for that travesty.The CGI, and it happens a lot, is unfinished at best. There are movies that came out now 20 years ago that have better CGI. Textures are too smooth, people fall faster than physics should allow, people bounce off of bulls with no injuries, and at no point is it convincing.The plot was on par with Godzilla vs. Kong's cinematic interpretation of a four year-old smashing his toys together and calling it ""plot"", only this movie was clearly done by an older child. Maybe aged six. It constantly bounces back and forth between ""THIS character is actually with THIS character...and they're betraying THIS character"" with such regularity that plot beats became predictable down to the five second window in which the next rotation of betrayal would happen. The most surprising thing that happens in the entire movie is that Chris Diamantopoulos's character doesn't show up one last time after he may or may not have been killed by a hatch.This is just another garbage movie that Netflix has tried to release, continuing their trend of making passable shows and resoundingly mediocre movies. I don't know why I try anymore, because they ALWAYS result in disappointment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And because of that it is a lot worse than it should have been. At the start you might think that you're in for a Bond movie tribute but unless you're a fan of Roger Moore's silliest outings as 007 you're gonna be disappointed. It's not a buddy movie because the chemistry between the two male leads is lacking. It isn't a comedy either. Bad jokes, worse puns and poorly executed slapstick at random moments drain every drop of fun from the movie. As a heist movie it doesn't work either. And as a hommage to Indiana Jones it fails horribly and it comes across as a cheap disrespectful parody instead. No amount of self-awareness (whistling the Indiana Jones theme tune: seriously?!) will overcome that. I was somewhat entertained but I will never watch this again. A pity because with this cast and budget this could have been great!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Reynolds looks like a bad parody of Deadpool, and Gadot just crooks and overplays terribly. The Russian prison is straight from cheap action of the 80s. Disgusting graphics quality. 200 million budget? That's how much Avatar cost. And it clearly shows what the money was spent on. The Red Notice shows nothing that can cost such money. Obviously, half of the budget was spent on the fees of leading actors..

Can't we get a fun, light and upbeat action comedy that's at least a bit original?What we have here... Generic escape scene, generic fight scene, snarky remarks, generic prison fight scene, generic escape scene, generic ""funny"" dialogue, generic conversation about feelings that's supposed to reveal some ""depth"" to main characters. I mean, even opening a very huge and expensive vault is so stupid. How is it possible to have an open usb port on the lock to an expensive vault door?! How?!Dialogues feel forced. Characters are shallow and predictable. I believe actors were sleepwalking through this boring script. Don't get me wrong I like some lighthearted fun and popcorn flicks. Not everything has to always make sense in a movie for me to enjoy it, but this one was a chore to go through. By the time you see the ""big"" plot twist you'll be half asleep or you won't care at all.Dwayne Johnson plays the same character in every movie. Instead of a suit put a khaki shorts and a tshirt on him and you'll have jungle-something-whatever instead of so called fbi profiler in Red Notice.Ryan's comedic style is amazing, but feels forced in this move. Jokes don't exactly land where they're supposed to. There's no chemistry between main characters. Gal Gadot is stunning as always, but I'm afraid her role is reduced to eye candy in most movies. I belive she could do so much more with a better script.All in all it's a 4 from me.

Alas! None of these.Red Notice is as bland as sipping water and pretending it's martini with an olive. The film is also as processed as fast food but without the salt and sugar but that's what followers of the three primary cast actors blindly sought after. At least fast food is enjoyable although it may not be good for your health.Frankly, by now, you'd have got tired of Reynold's Deadpool-esque bland humor. How about Gadot? She's just strolled in and out supposedly with intelligence and grace but she just have to be reminded that she is not wearing the Amazonian super power swimsuit here. (No thanks to the script writer and director.)And as for Dwayne Johnson, why bother going for any movie he is in?

"5","/10","A predictable heist film that boasts of a pricey cast..","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7547655/?ref_=tt_urv","tkmce2008","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34153767/?ref_=tt_urv","14 November 2021","At $200 million, Red Notice is the most expensive Netflix movie till date. With a cast that has a huge fan following: Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot & Ryan Reynolds; this film disappoints big time.FBI agent, John Hartley teams up with a cheeky art thief, Nolan Booth to stop the suave Bishop from stealing Cleopatra's three bejeweled eggs. This puts the trio on a globe trotting adventure with either party trying to best the other.Despite having a cast that boasts of some of the most popular actors of our time, Red Notice is a massive disappointment. Ryan Reynolds needs to do something about his characters. They are all basically the same person; they all have a cheeky nature; cracking similar jokes. He is as good as Varun Sharma or Aparshakti Khurana. Dwayne The Rock Johnson stars in what is one of his weakest films yet. Gal Gadot has the charm to pull of this role and she does. Her presence is the only saving grace.The plot is basically a medley of scenes from different countries across the globe. Most of it I guess was shot on set (except the scenes in Rome). The essence of a global film is lost when it doesn't truly capture the location in all its glory. The visual effects are pathetic for a movie that boasts of a 200$ million price tag. The heist theme has been tried & tested and there is nothing more to innovate here. Even the twists don't come as a surprise: very predictable.Red Notice is mildly entertaining solely because of Gal Gadot. Ryan Reynolds is repetitive and Dwayne Johnson seems lost when he isn't the centre of attention. You are not missing out on anything by skipping this.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

So, they picked a crew for the score. After hiring the actors, they found a writer to write something that wouldn't fail based on the actors level of fame and status within current cinema brands. It was written in a day. Then they found a director to figure out how to make it all work. He shot it all in a day, and phoned a friend to help edit; finished before the end of the third day. It's a movie that will never leave you guessing because of the juvenile and recycled concepts. The only surprise was how the movie showcased the weaknesses of all the actors. However, I did love the performance by Professor Dumbledore. Yes! Dumbledore! Listen, and you'll hear it. It took a couple of days, but I was able to finish the entire movie; regrettably. Sadly, it was so successful that I think the sequel has already been written, cast, filmed, and edited; pending a release date.Prediction: It's probably going to be the same movie with a mystical religious theme.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And there is an FBI agent (Dwayne Johnson) chasing both of them. That's pretty much what can be said about it without giving out spoilers.Positives:
It's pretty. The cast is a bunch of beautiful people and it's visual spectacle. And that's pretty much all the positives.Negatives:
Everything else. Acting and writing were the worst of them.Let's begin with acting, it was just bad. But since I adore all the three of them, and their previous works, Im going to go out on a limb here and say that they weren't given much to work with, that is with their characters and the script.Which brings me to the biggest issue of the movie - it's writing and screenplay. It was extremely lazy and underwhelming and frankly insulting to us - the audience. Example: Why is Ryan Reynolds a thief? Because daddy issues. What about Dwayne Johnson? Why is he FBI? Because daddy issues. Want to explain why the rich villain guy is the way he is? Sure, daddy issues! What about Gal Gadots character? Why is she a thief? Yes. You guessed it - because daddy issues.The whole movie is just as lazy as this.Here's another example where they are stuck in an underground bunker and need to run from someone who is chasing them through the main entrance - behold! There is an old car in the bunker (been sitting there for half a century, but apparently fully fueled), but how do u drive the car out of there? Oh wait! There was an old road from the underground bunker to the outside that just conveniently appeared.So yeah! It solely runs on star power and is cashing in on their fame. Nothing entertaining, or memorable. Just Meh!3 stars for the 3 stars in the movie - Gal Godot, Ryan Reynolds & Dwayne Johnson.

To be more accurate, I guess the plot twist made sense, but everything that preceded it didn't. Almost as if they came up with the idea for the twist first, and then tried to build a story around it. Why did Hartley (the Rock) casually let the valuable egg out of his sight, in an unlocked car, immediately after going to so much trouble retrieving it? Why was Hartley so willing to turn to crime and help Booth (Ryan Reynolds) steal the eggs? Why didn't he turn Booth in and clear his name when confronted by the interpol agent? Why didn't the Bishop shoot them both when they were tied up under the coliseum? So many moments that didn't make sense until the plot twist explained it all.There were other moments where characters actions seemed strange/illogical, seemingly just for simplicity of writing. Such as Sotto Voce taking the 2nd egg with him when he went to torture Hartley and Booth, thus allowing the Bishop to easily take it. Or the interpol agent always showing up two minutes later...shouldn't professional art thieves be slightly better at covering their tracks?And the cast, while promising, was very miscast. Ryan Reynolds and the Rock are both too likeable to be ""bad guys"". I use quote marks, because we're obviously still supposed to be rooting for them, despite them being thieves. The problem is, we have no reason to. Usually, similar characters in other films have some sort of character development, moral ambiguity, or redemption arc. Not here. The film ends with them double crossing each other, and then planning their next heist together out of necessity. I guess we're supposed to like them just because they are charismatic and attractive.All in all, just a very lazily written, cliched, predictable plot. I wouldn't recommend, for decent heist films try out of sight, or one of the ocean's films. Or if you just want Ryan Reynolds brand of humour and some action, re-watch Deadpool. I know you've all seen it already, but even on the fifth viewing, it's still better than this.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Dwyane had 1 expression throughout this movie and Gal got half. She is very flexible though unlike Rock's brain and body. Only Ryan knows how to deliver his lines.

It copies from Mission Impossible, National Treasure, Indiana Jones and the Ocean's Trilogy among others.2) There are plenty of plot holes/oversimplifications just so the story can move forward.3) The characters are badly written/feel unrealistic. Most of the time Johnson and Reynolds play themselves teasing each other and at some moments they play their characters and become sincere with each other. And Gadot's acting was too poor to convince me.4) They try too hard to make the plot unexpected when it actually isn't.5) There are too many (bad) green-screen scenes - I can let some of them go, since they had to film it during the pandemic, but then why put so many? Green-screened prison, jungle, Paris...PS.

As others have noted, the Rock plays the Rock and Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds. Unfotrtunately I find both pretty annoying. Gal Gadot seems to be having a ball playing a character more on the wrong side of the tracks than is normal for her. And there we go.... the usual exocic locations and cities are visited for mere minutes just to tick them off. Lots of CGI and bad jokes.You can see the executives sitting around a table deep in Netflix HQ saying, ""...yes but we have $200 million so we can make a spy movie AND a comedy AND an adventure film!"" We even get generic looted Nazi treasure at the end in a blatant Indiana Jones rip off.It is not awful, you can pass some time with this movie, it is just amazing the money spent on it and the blandness of the result.

It was entertaining, had great production values, acting - and a mostly clever script, with one elephantine exception. It is disturbing that the audience is meant to cheer for the art thieves in the course of their getaways as they murder dozens of innocent police officers for doing their job. I think that's a little vile and crosses a line ethically. It undercuts the humour and the pleasure. There is really no way to applaud the glamorizing and trivializing of cop killing as entertainment. This is a plot that should never have been written.

Needless to mention that both Hartley (Johnson) & Booth (Reynolds) are no way inferior than superman taking leaps from almost thirty feet heights. So for watching these kind of pseudo realistic movies, we must not use our brains. So keeping all the rational views aside, an impostor (how much high profiler might be) can penetrate within the police. Still some queries remained unsolved about the true relationship between Hartley & The Bishop. And with reference to that, how Hartley had to risk his life when there was quite another smooth option of obtaining the third egg. Anyways, but for action lovers & twisting thriller fans, I'll surely recommend this movie. For one time watch only.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As for the Rock, I can take or leave him in all honesty.This is probably the first time I have struggled to watch anything from RR.It was like a cross between White Collar, National Treasure, Indiana Jones & James Bond with the attempted humour of Deadpool (but just not upto par). Then to top that off, the far fetched-ness of the Fast and Furious franchise, with at least 10 different twists and turns through out the whole movie. For me personally it was a complete mess, and didn't gel together at all like it should have.The humour alone just felt too forced and try hard, and just became irritating rather than entertaining or even funny after a while. That coupled with the fact that RR and DJ argued like little children through out the whole movie, just made it less than enjoyable. And Ed Sheeran at the end???? It was just bizarre.I'm sorry to say, but they could have done way better, especially with the script. Didn't work for me. Very average imo.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

All enemies are so bad and fight with you 1 by 1, you have bullets in a gun exactly as much as you need, I can continue for ages. So this is just a picture with fighting and a trivial plot.This movie isn't an exception.And honestly, I wouldn't say I like how they created this movie. I saw a lot of scenes where the green screen and special effects were so bad, despite a huge $200 million budget. Plot logic is another topic, I expected a simple plot, but not a super simple one... There they even don't try to explain something, they just have it, as fact. Some scenes aren't necessary and create additional watching time.Also, I am not sure about the cast combined with the characters' story. They just took superstars and haven't thought about the script. Some of them are just not fit for their characters.I haven't noticed comedy, they tried to do something, but these jokes are pretty trivial and expectable. I have laughed a few times because of cringe.As a result, I can recommend watching this movie in several cases:
1. If you want to play something in the background
2. If you come from work or any activities, tired and don't want to think so much about what is happening here. Watch some fast screen slides.If you want something deep, I can't recommend it enough.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Engaging storyline although nothing you havent seen already. Ryan Reynolds is a delight to ears just like, The rock is a delight to eyes
Afterall movie could have been far more commendable had it been a little plot driven, the characters are not so much as cliche as the action comedies demand. I can understand most of the action comedies ask us to not seek intense logic, but Red notice literally misuses logic almost to the point of convincing the viewer to give up on his expectations of amusing himself. Along pre-climax, the plot starts getting so absurd, actions scenes seems to get more funnier and it wont take a genius to guess how crappy and underwhelming the climax is gonna be.Upon enduring the whole film for 2 hours, the most disturbing aspect is you cant even dislike the film but certainly you shall be disappointed on a whole.Just skip it. Not worth it. It never is.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Presumably 85% on Dwayne, Ryan and Gal's salaries because this film is extraordinarily average. The plot isn't new and takes a large number of influences from far better movies from the 80s, 90s and 00s, for example Raiders of The Lost Ark, The Mummy, Thomas Crown Affair and Oceans 11/12. The visuals are poor, the camera work shoddy, action sequences are boring at times and the fight choreography is miles off something like The Raid. The dialogue has some funny moments but it's really all few and far between. Acting is standard from Dwayne, Ryan is probably the winner out of the three stars as Gal is sadly not great at all, being beautiful doesn't mean you can act! Overall worth seeing if you have Netflix and probably best aimed at families, but I'm sadly disappointed with this effort, perhaps the sequel will deliver something original and polished.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ryan Reynolds did make some funny jokes, and Gal Gadot did get some nice action scenes, but this movie is still pretty forgettable.My biggest problem with it is that the plot and character backgrounds were very surface level and not fully developed. For example, the Bishop seems like an urban legend in the beginning. But when we meet her, she seems more like a talented con woman who took some fighting classes. The Bishop just isn't that dangerous criminal or multi-layer character that I was expecting.The same goes for Booth and the Rock's character. While they are involved in some plot twists, they aren't really that complex or unique themselves. Booth seems like a Reynolds' character we've seen before. The most exciting thing about the Rock's character is that he doesn't fit the typical profile of a profiler.I truly enjoy each of these actors and value what each of them brings to the big screen. But this movie, or maybe just the script, seemed to take one or two of those strengths and use them in ways that weren't thought out or just didn't work.So it was fun to watch, but I probably won't recommend or watch it again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is like watching the same scene three times. However, the good acting of especially ryan who is fit just right for the role makes it entertaining to watch. Could have have been a 6,5 if it wasn't for the garbage action scenes (just look at ryan's stunt double there went 0 effort in making him look the same).

He's just Deadpool without the mask in every movie he is in. Even back in the days of Blade Trinity he was just cocky, wise cracking, self deprecating fool. It worked in Deadpool and it worked in the Hitman Movies but it's time to move on, try acting for a change, you did a pretty decent job in Safe House.The Rock is actually making a bid for his worse performance in a movie EVER.......where is the beast from Ballers or the kid like enthusiasm from Jumanji.......even go to the weird and wonderful Scorpion King and there's something to see. Here the Rock is literally playing a rock or a similar inanimate object.As for Gail Gadot, Wonder Woman? Woman, I wonder what possessed you to climb on board. Maybe you read the script which probably in it s first iteration was decent.We're left with a mess. It's attempting to be 007 with the multiple locations but ends up more Johnny English than James Bond, perhaps the humor of Spy but unable to match the comedic timings of Jason Statham. At one point it shoots for the unmatchable True Lies but ends up way short and can only manage to truly lie about its intentions.In the end it is like watching a comic strip come to life, not a good one like TWD or Sin City but one of those free comic strips like Striker from the Sun Newspaper.It lacks style, class and charisma and feels like a patchwork quilt made from blankets stolen from the homeless. It'll keep you warm but you'd prefer to stay cold in a pinch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a fun globetrotting rival-thieves story with charismatic actors, and a premise of coveted/lost ""Cleopatra's eggs"".Has great production, enticing camera work, average action, and reference-filled scenes for those that feel rewarded for knowing things.Personally, I think this movie works because of Ryan, which is a good thing for those that tolerate that kind of persona or find him charming and funny. His talent for being himself in every movie he is in, is astounding. His delivery of lines is agreeable and the primary reason why I enjoyed the movie. He has a way of making fun of things people normally take seriously that makes him a nice change of pace. Put literally anyone else around him, and it would probably have a similar effect!! But the Rock being the Rock (kind of a boring straight man) works with Ryan as a partner.Considering how the ending is a flat-line, and a second viewing is not worth it.. the convenience and pandering of most plot lines, it's amazing it isn't terrible.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie is most enjoyable when taken as a campy action-adventure flick, but it's final twist requires taking the plot so seriously it spoils the effect. The cast is decent, but all have done far greater work, and the spectacle, in set and choreography, lacks any memorability.

As always entertaining! Screenplay was funny. Story line, although predictable, very pleasant and entertaining. What killed it for me was Gal's performance. I did not feel the chemistry, especially between her and Dwayne,and have a truly hard time buying her act. Unfortunately if there is a sequel will most likely pass. I couldnt watch the whole movie at once, I ended up watching it in three segments. The moment Gal appeared, it killed the movie imo and that was my first STOP.If your a fan of Gal and enjoy Dwayne and Ryan, then I'm sure you will enjoy this movie. If you are like me and do not see Gal as a class A actress, then you might get really disappointed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Almost everything here is bad - the script feels like it was written by a child (so many contrivances, it's actually painful to watch), the acting from the Rock and Gal Gadot was fairly atrocious. Ryan Reynolds played himself again, which may be the only redeeming factor. How did this cost 200 million, by the way? I guess a fat chunk went to the A-listers, but that doesn't mean the movie should look like an amateur college no-budget short. The green screen in Rome was so awful, it looked like my boy Tommy Wiseau on the roof all over again. None of the sequences stood out as exciting, none of the twists work if you possess half a brain cell. And the product placement, wow. If I didn't watch the credits, I would've thought Michael Bay directed this garbage. This is almost as bad as Olive Garden in the Sonic movie.

It's a heist/intrigue/spy/action thriller and pretty easy on the eyes. The predictably complex plot has all the twists and turns you can imagine wanting, with James-Bond-like exotic settings all around the world, snappy dialog, expensive toys, fight scenes. It never really drags. And the end, just as obviously, is a setup for a sequel.And of course, just like most such films, it's ultimately just entertainment. The surface is all there is. I thought toward the end it started to collapse of its own weight of double, triple, and quadruple crosses -- as classic reviewer Gene Siskel once said, if anything can happen, then who cares what happens? More isn't always better.Of the three leads, I thought Ryan Reynolds won. The scriptwriters gave him lots of clever dialog that fed perfectly into his talent for Deadpool-like offbeat snark (""Look for a box labelled MacGuffin"" put me on the floor laughing). Johnson and Gadot were kind of underused, oddly. I'm not sure that these three actually fit all that well together, in the end.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Because for now it seems like every Netflix movie is just one big cliche. Red Notice is no different. Ryan Reynolds is just another Ryan Reynolds persona. He seems to be the same guy in every movie. With the same jokes, the same ""serious but funny, with a wink towards the audience"" attitude. Dwayne Johnson is generally one huge muscle with some sensitive side (wow, that's really original), and Gal Gadot is just sexy, smart vixen (who really enjoys torturing men genitalia, that part is really creepy).It's not that this movie is bad. It's just mediocre. You just don't care about the characters, the plot makes you sleep, the stakes of the whole movie are just not interesti g. You can literally turn it off at any point and just go to sleep without wonderinf what happened next. Bevause you just don't care.That's because Netflix just doesn't want to hire good screenwriters. Or hires good screenwriters and forces them to write these crappy cliche stories. For example, the whole idea for every character can be sum up in two or three words (at maximum). Gadot: sexy. Reynolds: joker. Johnson: big but sensitive. There isn't a ythong more for any of these characters.It's just so strange that anyone can spend so much money for the movie that has every aspect average at most. The budget of this movie is estimated for 200 mln $ (and it's hard to say why so much, since most of the movie is shot on green screen). To put that into perspective, for this amount of money you could film Nightcrawler (8,5 mln),
Sound of metal (5,4 mln), Promising Young Woman (10 mln), AND Mission Impossible: Fallout (178 mln) That's just crazy! Please stop watcho g those cliche Netflix movies, so maybe one day they will try to make more ambitious movies. Like Amazon does. Or HBO. Or Apple.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The three lead actors have all excelled in other roles. The actions scenes were competent if not particularly thrilling. There's humor. There's an art heist. This should have been a good movie. Somehow, it wasn't.It reminded of the old Bruce Willis movie the Hudson Hawk. That had a good cast, humor, an art heist. It should have a good movie. It wasn't.Both movies suffer from a Saturday morning live-action cartoon feel. It's too obvious they're actors being filmed on a movie set: nothing feels authentic. You can all but hear the director saying ""action"" and the actors asking ""line?"" as everyone is more focused on the craft services table than they are on the script. It's pantomime as the British would say.The usually reliable Rock needs to put his political ambitions down and work on his acting. He was the worst of the three big names. Ryan Reynolds played Ryan Reynolds, as he does in every performance, such is the extent of his acting gifts. Fortunately Ryan Reynolds is a likable persona, though woefully miscast here. He comes across as a likable dimwit, not some mastermind art thief. Gal Gadot has incredible screen presence, but her comedic chops are non-existent. Her jokes were well-written, but her timing is off and they landed with a thud. She should stick to dramatic roles.What I saw deserved three stars: one each for Johnson, Reynolds and Gadot. I gave it five stars because I turned it off before the end. Maybe it got better? I'll never know. It simply wasn't holding my interest. Five stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The final shot itself looked gorgeous; a beautiful sunset, as a crane panned over the glass pyramids of the Louvre Museum. Of course this isn't be the worst movie ever made. Everything looks sleek, professional, and generally just aesthetically pleasing. It can't be the worst movie ever made. Maybe the stupidest. Maybe even that's an exaggeration, but my feelings towards the film, while exaggerated and humorously vindictive, were not disingenuous.I was appalled, outraged, and often couldn't stop myself pausing the film to outwardly express my baffled and perplexed questioning of how the film was so comfortable being stupid. Stupid in the sense that it just did not care about anything between the broad strokes of the story. Character actions, intentions, wants, and needs were crystal clear, but it was not in the interest of the film to leave space to ponder if they made much sense.To call the film unrealistic would of course be ridiculous. It is an action-adventure comedy after all. But as the film kept up a snazzy pace, bombarding forward in big, bold, cavalier steps, however clear, brash, and successful a currier of story and character information, I felt I had to put my foot down, pause the apple TV and scream ""This is a cartoon!"". I never actually did this. But after the credits had rolled, this was the thought lingering on my mind. The logic of the film was more cartoon-like than film.I've heard this criticism frequently and generally you get what it's trying to say. But I promise man, the movie is like a cartoon. In the same way watching a cartoon doesn't always require you to question the details of what's going on. It eases your ability to suspend disbelief. You're watching drawings giving the illusion of a world beyond the screen. Because it's a cartoon, an exaggerated, stylized, version of the familiar, you don't have to question the minutia of how a character's watch operates. Film props similarly take advantage of this as well, but in a cartoon it's simply a drawn representation of a watch. A drawing that implies the inner machinations within; ones that you don't need to see. You accept this drawn representation as a symbol and take it at face value. You recognize the symbols, tropes, and broad strokes a cartoon can imply, but you don't place the practicality, probability and feasibility of its world and characters under the same microscope you would use on reality. These fantastical worlds can create rules and machinations of their own; some unique and some that mirror, reflect, and pay lip-service to those found in the one we know all too well. To put these two worlds under the same microscope would of course defeat the whole purpose.Maybe this is the trap I fell into by allowing the world of ""Red Notice"" to affect me the way it did. Of course we understand the ""Hollywood"" representation of the world to be a fantastical one. Some films choose to faithfully depict reality, and some choose to ""Hollywood-ize"" it. Give it the pinch and dash of unique fantasy and heightened reality a ""Hollywood"" picture can offer its audience. Maybe I'm wrong to place expectations that clearly differ with the ones the film presents. And my outrage is simply as meaningful as battling windmills.Well, I reject your reality and substitute my own.The film does exactly what it sets out to do. It offers us likable, charismatic performances from a trio of two impossibly good-looking people and Ryan Reynolds. It casts this exaggerated team of ""best-at-what-they-do"" thieves and special agents on a fun globe-trotting adventure; with plenty of quick-witted banter and emotional character-informing scenes along the way. It generally looks very pleasing, with world-spanning locations, sexy costumes and a generous helping of golden beams, bathing and highlighting the sense of grandeur and adventure.It's a fun comedy action-adventure movie!But it's stupid! It's silly, it's ridiculous!It may look pleasing but always phony. Not real. Consistently sleek, well-designed, live-action cartoon fluff. I guess you could make this accusation against a lot of big-budget studio productions, but... no but. It's a fun ride with charismatic characters that depend on the charisma of the actors. As overly dependent on the stars as they are on their function in the story.I don't think it holds all that much weight.I want to compare it to another action-adventure comedy from what is now two decades back: Saharah. The one starring Mathew McConoughey, in a high budget, start-driven adventure production. Also globe-trotting. To be fair, you could cast a lot of similar accusations against this film. Criticisms about the substance of the characters and the tropes it indulges. But I recall this adventure with far more fondness and tangibility than I think a kid watching ""Red Notice"" would in two decades from now. Maybe not a perfect story or comparison and one that's seasoned with a big dash of childhood fondness and nostalgia, but a story that feels a lot more real than the quick-witted, sleek, phony facade this film puts up.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I found myself laughing out loud when drone shot after drone shot were paired alongside each other.The film attempts to have the international feel of Jason Bourne but slapping the names of cities in big bold letters over yet another drone shot doesn't quite cut it to convince the viewer they're anywhere other than a studio or ironic location.Eyeing off the set in the prison scenes makes me almost smell the cardboard and spray paint through the screen.Casting was great, Reynolds nails the charisma as always and The Rock does what The Rock does best. Unfortunately Gal Gardot is treated a little too much like a piece of meat in this film, she doesn't need to be in a revealing dress or predictably skimpy swimsuit to be visible.Let's hope this kind of film is some sort of horrible joke that won't survive the next generation of creators.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, the movie itself, quite disappointing. I was excited to see Rawson Marshall Thurber directing another film in his favourite genre. The basic Action/Comedy Genre that's been pulled through the wringer a thousand times with movies such as Central Intelligence. I can confidently say the man loves some Dwayne Johnson in his films! Does anyone remember Skyscraper? Yeah. Neither do I. However, I did enjoy the twist. Was it necessary? Probably not, but after watching over 40m of an uneventful heist movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Did Ryan Reynolds have some funny and witty lines? Sure. But that tactic hasn't worked for a while now. There has to be a solid and intriguing story with a strong theme, no matter the genre. A-list actors should not be your number one selling point. And my god, they're already teasing a sequel? Yikes.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As things begin an American fed who's an expert profiler is working abroad to aid Interpol in the capture of an elusive art thief, until the plot requires them to team up. Self-referential, with flavors of buddy movie, double-crossing, and espionage, but clearly pilfers from other films (ahem, Indiana Jones) and some too obviously unreal visual effects dilute the lush scenery. The banter between fast-talking Reynolds and muscle-bound Johnson frequently falls flat, but Gadot brings some heat as a masterful thief whose skill and savvy dwarfs their own. This would be really disappointing, but with all the comic schtick and conveniences of the script you never take it seriously. **","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
