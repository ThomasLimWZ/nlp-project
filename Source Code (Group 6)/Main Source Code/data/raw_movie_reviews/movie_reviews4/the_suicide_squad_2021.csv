"8","/10","A Superhero Spectacle with Improved Characters and Witty Action!""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9199033/?ref_=tt_urv","pawanpunjabithewriter","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54077131/?ref_=tt_urv","18 July 2023","In ""The Suicide Squad,"" the action-packed sequel to ""Suicide Squad,"" the thrill starts right from the beginning. Set in a lush jungle on a mysterious island, the movie immediately captivates the audience with its promising backdrop. The second installment outshines its predecessor in various ways, particularly in the realm of characters.While Will Smith's performance in the first movie was rather commendable, Idris Elba takes the reins in part 2, displaying his immense talent and becoming the perfect leader for the squad's perilous missions. The addition of Peacemaker brings a refreshing dynamic to the team. Harley Quinn's character undergoes significant development, making her role even more delightful. Unlike the first movie, where some superheroes seemed out of place, each character in ""The Suicide Squad"" has a well-justified presence, contributing to a greater character arc.Engagement and entertainment remain consistent throughout the film, with very few dull moments. The writers skillfully follow a classic approach, bringing the story full circle by ending with a scene that harks back to its origins. Among the diverse cast of superheroes, Bloodsport shines as one of the best, while ratcatcher 2 also impresses with her captivating performance.While the script is engaging overall, there was one instance that seemed implausible even in a lighthearted context. A character's head is chopped off, the peculiar part was that his eyes continued to move. Although this added an element of dark humor, it might have stretched the bounds of believability even within the superhero genre.In conclusion, ""The Suicide Squad"" surpasses its predecessor by delivering a gripping and action-packed adventure. With improved character development and a smart balance of humor and action, it keeps the audience entertained. Director James Gunn masterfully crafts a superhero spectacle that fans and newcomers alike thoroughly enjoy.","44 out of 58 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Dumbest Squad Just Made the Greatest DCEU Film EVAHHH!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7200780/?ref_=tt_urv","iamianiman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58447224/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2021","Remember when James Gunn was 'temporarily' fired by Marvel Studios and we were all disappointed by the decision? Well, it turns out that was a blessing in disguise when Warner Bros. Booked him for a slot of this movie and months later, he was reemployed by the giant-sized company for GOTG 3 and he just killed two heroes with one stone. 2021's The Suicide Squad is indeed, THE Suicide Squad that we all deserve!The most outstanding thing about this latest squad is the way they blend and mix in everything into the recipe. It's like you're watching a bunch of genres; comedy, dark comedy, fantasy, action, thriller, drama, superhero, spoof and commentaries; political, social contexts, world revolving issues all together and yet, it tastes très bon! Often enough, movies that try to do everything together fail big time but not this one. This is a cinematic achievement.James Gunn, who also directed Guardians of the Galaxy, knew that the Marvel/DC films have rehashed their materials multiple times; basic origin, romance, giving up, final battle. Hence, Gunn develops a non-formulaic approach that seems suicidal at first but triumphantly creates something unique and unpredictable. From the get-go, Gunn's vision is unconventional but polished, enough to make the audience feels they have never seen anything like it before.Talking about unpredictability, it indeed is what it is. You never know what will come next, who will die or survive. There are a few times that Gunn uses the head fake technique to deceive viewers from its sequential but engaging storytelling. Like Deadpool, something unexpected happens at the moment when you least expect it.The juxtaposition of both the 2016's and 2021's is evidently visible. While 2016 has its moments, almost everyone could agree it was disappointingly bland af. The 2021 entry has a strong direction and far better pacing, let alone twists that are fully captivating. The only couple of things that 2016 did it better were the trailers and the soundtrack.The Rated-R is straight up hardcore to the face. It's superbly gory, darkly comical and unabashedly funny, all without pulling its punches. This is how DC films should be, not as dour as Zack Snyder's but not as light as Marvel's either.When it comes to flaws, albeit its powerful opening scene, I feel that they waste many of the potential characters here insofar some of them never even got the chance to show their abilities, skills, talents or superpowers.I am also not impressed by the intensity of the movie's brightness particularly on the background in some scorching white scenes. It defaces the texture of the film and should dazzle some viewers, left distorting of what could have been an iconic scene like the slo-mo segment.All in all, 2021's The Suicide Squad makes for a suicidal task with flamboyantly sheer colourful characters that collectively sign up for one thing amidst this pandemic chaos; blasting out loud the volume of fun and violence, subsequently climbing to the top as the best DCEU Film ever made.","940 out of 1,476 found this helpful.

I don't know.Maybe because Gunn was clearly let off the leash he didn't have to restrain himself and so moments that may have been handled with more care were allowed to simply explode?There is a lot of blood and gore, which is not necessarily a bad thing.As I said, I enjoyed it, and I will watch it again someday, I'm just in no big rush to revisit it.A generous seven out of ten.I've read the Suicide Squad and DC comics for a very long time, and all the low reviews with the 'restore the Snyderverse' hashtag can go away.","160 out of 309 found this helpful.

The 'twist' early on, and the comedic flow, especially between Elba and Cena, was fantastic.The thing is, although I normally do not find many movies to be rewatchable, we just got through watching it (for me, a third time) with family, and if anything, I found it even funnier than the last time!

Material like this needs Gunn's flair for irreverence, clever dialogue and, most importantly, instilling characters with engaging personalities. He may not have created Suicide Squad, but this adaptation has his stamp all over it.And for the first time since his directorial debut, Slither, Gunn is unbound by the restrictions of a PG-13 rating, something else the material really needed. Hence, the film is vivid, violent and vulgar, yet at the same time, seldom feels pandering or gratuitous. Punctuated by gobs of gags and hilarious dialogue, the movie earns its dismemberments and f-bombs along the way. In fact, the whole thing plays very much like Guardians of the Galaxy without a filter.And like Guardians, it's ultimately the characters that matter. Ironically, the one we're most familiar with - Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) - is the least interesting, perhaps because she's already been established with two previous films and there isn't much more Gunn could do with her. But everyone else is wonderfully realized and played perfectly by the ensemble cast. As Bloodsport, the de-facto leader of this new team, Idris Elba strikes the right balance of stoicism and uncertainty, while John Cena (as Peacemaker) once-again demonstrates he's more adept at comedy than pure action. Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmaichian) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) are also fun, each with amusing backstories. But King Shark steals every scene he's in, a perpetually hungry manfish who manages to be both monstrous and endearing (and a role Sylvester Stallone was born to play).With the exception of Task Force X director Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the antagonists are perfunctory. Their plan, however, is gloriously insane; the dictator of Corto Maltese plans to wipe out America using a 30-year-old experiment gone wrong: Starro, a giant extraterrestrial starfish that spawns face-hugging offspring to re-animate & control the dead. This leads to a final act that's as hilarious as it is grotesque, aided by amusing visual effects.Unlike the first film - which was mostly just bells & whistles - The Suicide Squad is the complete package, delivering an abundance of action, humor, violence and well-realized characters. James Gunn's playful approach is just what was needed, making it the best - and maybe the smartest - DC film since Christopher Nolan hung up his spurs.","61 out of 92 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The REAL ""academy award winning"" Suicide Squad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7174916/?ref_=tt_urv","hotrobinproductions","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46169466/?ref_=tt_urv","29 July 2021","I remember as if it was yesterday my utter disappointment in 2016 when I purchased my tickets to watch Suicide Squad back then. No hate towards David Ayer, the studios definitely meddled with his film to the max, I would LOVE to see his version but nonetheless, what we got was such a terrible film.... Fast forward 5 years & Warner Brothers turns the tables and makes what is probably one of the GREATEST comic book movies of all time. The film is very ballsy, violent & full of heart. The characters are eye candy & I'm VERY happy that James Gunn kept what worked in the original. Because it was a bad movie but there were some good in it. This film James really respects David Ayers film by keeping what worked while just sticking to what needed to be done. The R Rating was needed, I'm also glad the studio acknowledged that. I'm VERY Tired of seeing studios go for a PG-13 rating so they can get more views. Like cmon now, grow a pair please. Sony doing it with Venom & all other types of examples of studios fearing the R Rating... I think ever since Joker Warner Brothers has discovered that they can really get the same numbers if not more regardless, Then Birds Of Prey happened, which I enjoyed too. BUT my point is ALL of this led up to this movie RIGHT HERE. So again, kudos to Warner Brothers for the R Rating!!! Now first things first, The action is GREAT & the twists are even more magnificent. The Comedy is SPOT ON, and lands when it needs to, the use of dark comedy and balance of character development is done so well that it doesn't feel out of place or that one is taking over the other. BloodSport carry's this movie, his performance was SCREAMING Will Smith for me, (meaning the role just looks like it was meant for him because he had daughter issues too) but I gotta say, Idris Elba grew on me more than Will Smith did. His performance is GREAT and he has amazing chemistry with another character and it just feels special. Polka Dot man was absolutely hilarious yet gave me a bittersweet taste in my mouth, but in a good way. King Shark was an amazing joy to watch on screen. Peacemaker was awesome too. Now what I mean by awesome is off their importance, performance and role in the movie. Some of these characters are not like able... mind you... and some things will happen over the course of events and make you not like characters more and that's where this movie shines. It's VERY unpredictable. And when you feel like you think you know where the movie is going it pulls the rug from under you hard. Very enjoyable ride. When it was over I wanted to watch it again.*Pros*
Well written characters / performances
Comedy/Action (is not repetitive)
Effects/CGI
Story / plot / script*Cons*
Thinly written Villain
Climax for the ending felt just a bit thin wish it would have required more ""teamwork"" and not one character being the reason they won (you'll see what I mean)
Some Characters I felt died a bit too soon and would have liked a little more depth before they went.WB needs to keep this up and we will continue to want more. If they understand the character they should know the direction needed to continue the character. Superman doesn't need to be dark and suicide squad should never be PG13. Not saying these are ""impossible to do"" but just saying if you REALLY understand the character you should know what works and what doesn't, and as far as I see it... this is the RIGHT direction for The Suicide Squad Peacemaker show is something to look forward to! And I will be more than happy to call this Film an ""The REAL Academy Winning Suicide Squad"" because it deserves the title more than the 2016 one... #releasetheayercut.","790 out of 1,362 found this helpful.

"8","/10","THIS IS HOW A SUICIDE SQUAD FILM SHOULD BE","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7204092/?ref_=tt_urv","Aziz24","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur105044330/?ref_=tt_urv","7 August 2021","Before I talk about the film, let me talk a bit about DCEU. The difference between DC and Marvel (and why Marvel is more successful than DC) is the people behind them. The people/company behind Marvel (Disney) know and plan everything. They even planned this whole MCU thing ever since 2008's Iron Man. They know what they are doing, where they are heading with their characters, stories, and films, and how to do them and write them right. That's why their Universe is more successful. But, for DC the people/company behind it (Warner Bros.) are ruining this beautiful universe that's filled with great characters by bringing the wrong people to direct/write their movies which brings chaos to the films and world of the DCEU. Or they create issues with the right director like Zack Snyder (which we all saw how he was building that big/creative universe in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and where it was going). However, this time DC choses James Gunn to write & direct this film which if you're not familiar with, he directed Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017). And this is the second proof (after Snyder's) that when having the right person/people behind a film, they will kill it. And THIS IS HOW ""The SUICIDE SQUAD"" STORY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. And that's all thanks to James Gunn.So happy that the film got an R rating because the suicide squad story should be like that. It should be full of blood, comedy, craziness, violence, disgusting action scenes, and curse words. Thank god they didn't care about the film being PG 13+ or whatever so more people could see it. And I feel like James Gunn was behind that part. It's not a suicide squad film if there were no sexual, bloody, violent, and disgusting content.The cinematography was beyond amazing and the film presented some new ideas. Like, in one scene (dw no spoilers) two characters were fighting and we were seeing it through the reflection of a helmet. Or in a specific fight scene, instead of ""blood"" coming out of the bodies, it was ""flowers"" which made the 3 or 5 min action sequence very colorful and fun to watch. The camera movements were also great and felt that they sometimes were steady handheld which was so unique. Also loved how the film picks slow motion in certain times only to show the chaos that's happening around and they were very limited which is a good thing.For the third time, Margot Robbie proves that she is the best portrayal of Harley Quinn and I cannot imagine anyone other than her as Harley Quinn. She presents the beauty, craziness, and wildness of the character. Idris Alba really surprised me. His character was very well written and Idris played it so right. The real surprise was John Cena. Personally, I don't like Cena's acting. But, in this film his acting was alright and the thing that helped him is how good his character (Peacemaker) is written. Especially that Peacemaker has a huge impact on the story of the film and the future of DCEU. Daniela Melchior gave the film such a warm/soft vibe and her acting was well done especially in the emotional scenes. The whole cast was just amazing and each actor/actress played their role perfectly.Really loved the music in the film. And if you have seen Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) you'd know that it has the same style/vibe. The costumes were brilliant and loved how James kept the original costume of each character from the comics which made the film/character even more special & real. Also, loved how the film jumps back in time suddenly to explain where a specific character is or how things ended up that way and there was something different about it which I can't tell what it is.My rating is 8/10

Gunn tries his same GOTG style with the DCU and while visually and stylistically it's an objectively fun film to watch, the comedic overtones never land well. I may even prefer Ayer's brand of humor and even that wasn't even serviceable for the most part. The cast has such a weird dynamic and once again Margot Robbie is scathingly annoying but a bit more tolerable . Joel Kinnaman and Idris Elba are the standouts without question but they feel way too above the rest aside from Cena at times which can be unexpectedly brilliant in parts. The action is pretty well sequenced and delivered but as I said earlier the CGI can get down right bombarding in its delivery. The brutality is highly welcome however and satisfies unlike any DC film does in that aspect. And probably the most predictable yet ridiculous thing about the film is the audacious soundtrack choices. Sure you can play a novelty song during a specific scene to throw off tonal perspective but at this point it's just cliché. Overall I'd have to say it's a zany and enjoyable film but an overall scattered re-attempt to adapt a great comic.","135 out of 318 found this helpful.

Much has been said about it so I want to just add my two cents about universe building in movies. From the very first scene, Suicide Squad made it clear what it was. You understand the world you are in and the rules in place, or lack there of. It then follows those defined rules throughout. Comic book movies can take many forms from gritty realism like Joker all the way to off the wall zany like we see here. As long as the movie follows it's own rules, viewers are willing to go wherever the director wants. What an absolute blast of a good time this one is.","50 out of 82 found this helpful.

The crazy DC fans and the gang really made me think this was gonna be some best film of the decade type stuff..Thats probably why I am a bit dissapointed after watching it. Simply because it was sooooo overhyped.But just cuz it was overhyped, doesnt mean that it was a bad movie. Gunn did it again, this time for DC, helping the Universe to get on a new, better path for the next movies.To put it as it is: It is an entertaining movie, very original with crazy characters and a load of fun, goofy action.Dont expect it to be more than that, cuz it is not some groundbreaking new experience of a lifetime or anything. Its simply an alright movie that you probably will forget in a few weeks.NB: if it wasnt for King Shark I probably would have rated it a 6/10.","54 out of 120 found this helpful.

As I said in the title, the movie was full of life and colour. You can just pause the movie at any time, take a screenshot and it could be a great wallpaper for your PC. I was just looking at the screen and just thinking how the hell did James made this movie, maybe with magic...
I didn't get bored for one second. The movie just attaches you with it. But, don't get so attached, 'cause you'll fall in love with the characters and you'll have to see them suffering.Before 30,35 minutes from the ending you could think that, okay, it was a great experience, but now maybe it needs to be end. But just wait a few more minutes, you'll just shock and then you'll never want it to be end. You'll say I want more. The actions were so unique and dramatic. I loved the chemistry between the characters especially Bloodsport and his daughter( and it was far better than deadshot & his daughter's story from the first movie). And King Shark, oh my goodness, he was just great, he was just bringing life to the movie with his every appearances. You can just see that the actors worked so hard for their rolls.It wasn't like a DC movie or any kinda movie attached to a superhero universe. It can stand by it's own. It was a totally different experience, a much much better experience than other DC movies. I hope it joins the Billion dollars club 'cause it's worth it. I am sure you'll never get bored by this movie doesn't matter how many times you watch it.At last, l can say to james gunn that he just changed DC by this movie. Thank you very much.","464 out of 868 found this helpful.

The casting itself was also really well done with Daniela Melchior being the standout to me.Overall I loved this movie, it was such a breath of fresh air in, at times, today's over saturated superhero movie genre and I would highly recommend that people go see this film in cinemas for a truly unforgettable experience.","332 out of 629 found this helpful.

I feel like the film makers took on criticism from the first movie and put improvements into this. To me, this was basically like an Avengers movie aimed at adults with violence, gore and swearing.The film is filled with a great cast who all do a terrific job, especially Margot Robbie, I couldn't see anyone else doing the role of Harley Quinn. She is to Harley what Heath Ledger was to the joker. The movie is filled with funny one liners and never takes itself too seriously. I felt the first Suicide Squad was bordering too much pretty humour and seriousness and wasn't sure what it was. This reboot blends humour and seriousness perfectly. Some of the scenes between John Cena and Idris Elba were hilarious, as well as the lines from King Shark.I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this to be honest based on the first film, but this delivers exactly what you would expect from a team of anti-heroes, it's funny, entertaining and aimed at a mature audience, and for me it's an 8/10.","326 out of 632 found this helpful.

Something that I didn't expect before.The story still follow the same pattern. Convicted criminals with special powers were given the task to save the day. This time there are more characters introduced than before. I personally like the character King Shark, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. The chemistry between fatherly figure Bloodsport (Idris Elba) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) is so good here.I like the comedy here, so chaotic. The CGI is believable, the action is cool, and as I said before, it's gory. So many blood splattered, body dismembered, throat cut, they're not for those with weak stomach for sure.

The magnificent plan of taking a genius director like James Gunn and giving him budget and time to come up with something brilliant worked perfectly as this version is not just superior to the previous one, but also one of the funniest movies of the year.This success has James Gunn's name written all over it. This man took a risky task like making a Guardians of the Galaxy movie and turned it into one of Marvel's most interesting projects. With his fresh vision and his abillity to add effortless comedy into great adventure stories, Gunn is a true goldmine for the superhero genre and The Suicide Squad is another brilliant example of his talent. Instead of forcing dark realism, he embraces the silly nature of this concept and combines the blood-filled action scenes with the most casually hillarious jokes to create an irresistable result. It may not be something everyone would enjoy, but it's a fantastic self-aware film that doesn't try to present itself as a deep story and accepts the fact that its purpose is pure entertainment. Are you not entertained?Of course, the screenplay was brilliant too. Gunn refuses to play by the rules and focuses more on creating silly little side-stories to develop the characters, than constantly building the bigger picture. That's what makes this movie so fullfilling, the viewer feels like he's part of the group and enjoys this journey with them. Gunn makes every moment count, not just the final battle and a few heartwarming interractions, but every single scene.Margott Robbie steals the show once more as Harley Quinn and proves the world that this is the part she was born to play. It's too bad that superhero movies get snubbed in the Academy Awards as her performance is without a doubt Oscar-worthy. Joel Kinnaman is still an amazing choice as Rick Flag and he gets to prove it in this movie. Idris Elba and John Cena, the big signings really shined in this film as they were both extremely funny and overall quite amazing casting choices. Especially Cena is a weird case, as I never enjoyed his performances up until this one. Peacemaker fits him perfectly and his abillity to fully utilize the character's potential was a very pleasant surprise to me. Daniela Malchior, David Dastmalchian, Viola Davis, they all brought their A game and contributed to a fantastic movie.It's time to talk about the best thing this film has to offer, Sylvester Stallone's King Shark. Even the biggest hater of this movie would find it hard to not acknowledge how amazing he actually is. The cute, hillarious predator takes comedy to a whole new level by producing some of the funniest moments I've seen all year and yet remains a big threat and establishes his dominance when he has to. This may be a hot take but I think King Shark is the best James Gunn character ever.Overly stylized, colourful and silly, this is The Suicide Squad, a relaxing and fresh superhero movie that embraces the childish theme and doesn't try at all to be mature and sophisticated. After all, we need this kind of films too, simple and goofy but extremely entertaining.Rating: 8.5/10.","20 out of 32 found this helpful.

Great action, Harley, Bloodsport, King Shark were great and I liked certain character interactions, large set pieces. There were some political themes that really was done well in this film; when you see it you'll know what I'm talking about and it had a few great emotional momentsWhat I didn't like: most of the jokes didn't land w/me (Gunn's style of humor isn't my cup of tea; I only laughed a handful of times but that's it), when Peacemaker was trying to be funny, it seemed too contrived; still on the fence about him overall. There was also a lot of pacing issues; parts of the film dragged too long as if they were saying ""we'll wait for you to laugh before we move on."" I have a few minor nitpicks but I don't want to spoil anything on here.Overall, while I'm not on the ""one of the best comic book movies of all time"" train, I think it was a solid film.","31 out of 71 found this helpful.

At all.Action is on top, but at the same time, the very course of the plot sometimes sags. Because of this, it seems that the film runs not for 2 hours, but longer. That's just discouraging.All characters are dragged into action, and some scenes are reminding us, that we are watching the movie not about good boys and girls, but criminals. Yet, some still manage to see that what they are doing - wrong. The last words of starfish are heartbreaking.Overall, funny (but sometimes the ""jokes"" were straight up awful, honestly), seems a little bit longer, than 2 hours, but crazy action scequences compensate that. Bloodsport and Peacemaker showing off scene is funny and brutal at the same time, so is the movie in general.In conclusion:
Entertaining and boring at the same time. Funny and unfunny. Emotions change, like when you riding a roller coaster. The movie deserves 5/10, in my opinion, but one more star for showing off scene. Can't help it. R rating justified fully.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Ignore anything you see that mentions this movie and academy awards in the same sentence. Let's start with the pros.Positives:The R rating was a great call and allows for most of the films better moments, the graphic violence and language just allows for a much more authentic action movie and fortunately I think this movie will contribute to studios being more comfortable with giving mainstream comic book movies that hard R they really should have.Weasel. He was an easy top 3 character and he has 4 mins screen time (maybe)Fans of earlier James Gunn will notice some parallels in The Suicide Squad to his Slither (2006), and this did feel like Jame's movie which is nice to see WB learned their lesson it would seem. (Just give us the Ayer version already look how it worked with Syndercut)Cons:Comedy was a generous 50/50. Some genuine laugh out loud moments but repetitive and childish more often than not. (That Norman Bates line was golden though)Bloodsport was a recycled Deadshot. At least try and make him original? A no nonsense, insanely accurate military man with some estranged daughter issues that lead him into joining the squad (sigh) I'll say Idris's performance topped Will Smith's but Will was the highlight of Ayer's SS it should be said.Amanda Waller wasn't written well and I question her role going forward in the DCEU honestly.King Shark was a dud character. Giggled a couple times but his presence felt silly.Harley Quinn was the only standout as being being significantly more enjoyable in Ayer's Suicide Squad, I can't look at her anymore without thinking of WB's agenda and how she's used as a marketing tool. She's way too OP for the limitations of her character.Won't be catching it again soon but it's not 'bad' by any means, just be weary of the 8-10 reviews or you may feel disappointed as I was. Will give it a rewatch and see how things change over time but for now I'd rank it slightly below Deadpool? Cheers if you read this far!","24 out of 55 found this helpful.

However, after I saw that many people liked the movie, I started to expect something. And I can happily say that movie meet my expectations and I liked it. So now it is time for me to say that DC is starting to redeem itself.I expected this movie to have entertaining scenes and characters with some gore in it, so as you can guess, I left the cinema saloon very happily. James Gunn nailed to make the movie extremely entertaining. He also succeeded in introducing many characters to us sympathetically in a single film. I think he has a great style, but I still think that the film got too childish at some moments even though it is R-rated. As I said, I loved his style in general, especially for action scenes, but when many titles show up, and every character is trying to be funny, it just does not feel like an actual film. I also liked that the movie had a clear story. It did not change its focus and still gave us a plot twist, although I still think that they may have worked on that plot twist a bit more. I also think that film sometimes tried to become too emotional but instead killed the vibe. I loved how the film made brave choices, and I will not mention anything further for no spoilers.My final remarks: I think it was a genuinely entertaining movie, and I would suggest you expect something less serious.","17 out of 37 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Violent and not trying to soften the villainy of the characters, Gunn bets in humorous interactions that arise naturally from their contrasts and idiosyncrasies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9534746/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","1 January 2024","Functioning as a kind of reboot of the terrifying work released by David Ayer in 2016, this new film maintains some of the characters from the previous one, eliminates others (in every sense) and introduces us to a mostly new team made up of Bloodthirsty (Elba), Peacemaker (Cena), Ratcatcher 2 (Melchior), King Shark (voice of Sylvester Stallone, fabulous) and Polka-Dot Man (Dastmalchian), who displays the most absurd superpower I've ever seen in a production of this genre and that his interpreter, assisted by director, makes it work in a surprising way. There is also another formation that is presented with the group walking in slow motion in front of the United States flag and whose fate is one of the good surprises that the film introduces in the first act of screening. Aided by the same Colonel Flag (Kinnaman) from the original and again acting under the orders of the ruthless Amanda Waller (Davis), the Squad is sent to a fictional country in South America that has just suffered a military coup (knock on wood- three times) in order to destroy the mysterious Project Starfish before it falls into the hands of the new rulers.Right away, James Gunn's own script avoids the most serious mistake made by Ayer in 2016 and abandons any artificial attempt to soften the villainy of the characters, who show no hesitation in slaughtering anyone who gets in their way - or even who is sleeping nearby (as evidenced by the horrifying and funny moment in which the Peacemaker casually stabs an unconscious soldier several times). Furthermore, each villain-antihero has a well-defined personality, resulting in humorous interactions that arise naturally from their contrasts and idiosyncrasies - and even Idris Elba, who rarely has the opportunity to flirt with comedy, displays a side lighter like Bloodsport without betraying the subject's cynicism. Meanwhile, John Cena plays the Peacemaker as a brute incapable of perceiving his own contradictions and who, precisely for this reason, stars in some of the film's most entertaining passages. And if Viola Davis composes Waller as a figure who seems to be always irritated and out of patience, Margot Robbie appears increasingly comfortable as Harley Quinn, moving away once and for all from the clumsy approach of the first film and investing more in the nuances found in "" Birds of Prey"" - and the animated flowers and birds that involve her in a more violent action sequence help to enrich the villain by visually expressing her detachment from reality and the horror of her actions. The biggest surprise in this sense, however, is the character Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior). She was created especially for the film and everyone wondered why James Gunn preferred to use a second version of a Batman villain as boring as the original Ratcatcher. And the film responds to this very well, delivering one of the best characters in the film and adding a lot of heart to the story full of blood and explosions. In fact, she is also responsible for bringing Sebastian to the DC Extended Cinematic Universe (DCEU) - this is the best thing about the entire film.This plurality of villains who turn out to be big surprises is the main asset of ""The Suicide Squad"", as you don't really know what to expect from any of them and director James Gunn manages to make each one has their moment. Even though the main role is around Bloodthirsty, the leadership he assumes of Task Force X justifies the presence of each of the other members and it's great to see everyone in action. At the same time, the great dynamic created throughout the story also makes each loss felt. Unlike what we saw in 2016, the new film is not afraid to kill anyone, breaking one of the biggest taboos in superhero films. After all, how can you impact yourself when you know that the good guys will always escape? Because ""The Suicide Squad"" shows that, in this case, no one is safe - and that's why the connection built with the public is so important. But, as vital as this dynamic is, the film's great success is in accepting how ridiculous it all is. The script makes a point of highlighting how bizarre each of the characters is, how the idea of bringing this bunch of crazy people together makes no sense and that invading a South American republic to face a giant starfish is absurd. And by making all this clear, it is as if he had safe conduct to create exaggerated situations and weigh his hand even in violence. The bizarreness is highlighted all the time and you simply accept it. Just like a good comic book, all that nonsense is just there to entertain you - and, in that regard, the film does very well.In total, ""The Suicide Squad"" is 2h12 long, but its story could easily be told in about 15 minutes less without major losses. There is a huge belly in the second act that breaks the rhythm of the plot and stretches the script without any irremediable need. This is a section made to give Harley Quinn more prominence, but it doesn't take the film anywhere, and can be resolved in one or two lines of dialogue. The reason for this is obvious: Margot Robbie is one of the stars of the film, the character is loved by the public and she doesn't have a big role in the plot as a whole - although all of her appearances are great. Thus, the impression that remains is that there is a whole section that was imposed by the studio to please the fans, but which ends up seriously harming the progress of the story. Another problem preceded the arrival of ""The Suicide Squad"" in theaters. Warner was so eager to show that the new film would be different from the 2016 one and that, this time, we would have all the madness that the group demanded that they didn't skimp on the trailers. The problem is that this not only gave away all the jokes in the promotional material, but also revealed the almost complete plot of the film. Despite everything, these problems do not hinder the film, which shows itself to be the comeback of a group that had everything to be buried and forgotten in the basements of Warner. It's proof that you don't need medallions like Batman and Superman to tell a good story.Clearly in love with the Suicide Squad comics by John Ostrander (comic artist who revolutionized the team in the 1980s and even makes a cameo in the film), the filmmaker has no shame in using elements of the ninth art when appropriate, and this is also reflected in the look of the film. Film. Unlike Zack Snyder's work at DC, who preferred to seek references from Renaissance painters in the composition of his paintings and low-saturation colors, aiming to impose a more ""solemn"" atmosphere on those productions, Gunn allows himself to play with elements specific to the visual narrative. Of the comics, with more colorful photography and a more stylized look. Amidst the true carnage that occurs on screen, we can actually understand what is happening in the frame - something unfortunately rare in productions of this size nowadays. The director shows that he has full control of the scenes, preventing the set pieces from becoming confusing or excessively polluted, in addition to being very different from each other, featuring battles with armies, one-on-one combats that pay homage to John Cena's wrestling past, duels with weapons, and even the climax of the narrative proves to be effective despite having already seen kaijus destroying cities a million times (of course, the look of Starro, the creature in question, helps by breaking away from the usual design of monsters of the type , surprising with its strong and cheerful colors that do not make it any less threatening). And to top it off, it is interesting to note how Gunn is not afraid to invest in political subtexts in the middle of fantasy, using the plot to criticize - even if in an obvious and superficial way - the interventionist foreign policy of the United States and the cheap rhetoric of the ""search for peace "" to justify all kinds of atrocities around the world (""I value peace with all my heart"", exclaims the Peacemaker at one point, adding: ""And no matter how many men, women and children I will have to kill to achieve -there!"").Becoming the first director to helm super productions starring both Marvel and DC characters (strictly speaking, Joss Whedon would hold the title, but he did not receive credit for taking on Justice League after Snyder's departure), James Gunn seems to have found his ideal niche. And considering how these films have become increasingly generic - even when they work -, it's a relief to see a filmmaker who at least manages to maintain his own voice despite the impositions of executives who call ""art"" ""content"" and see their projects as more as ""intellectual property"" than as an effort of creativity. Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" is a sequel that doesn't force you to see the previous one to understand the story. It stands on its own and adds to the pantheon of memorable DC characters on the big screen. The narrative structure, the approach to the characters and James Gunn's directing style transforms this practically episodic adventure into an instant classic of comic book films. Full of violence, personality, action, severed limbs, zero slow motion and a more than pertinent political message, this ""The Suicide Squad"" opens up a whole new horizon for truly bold and new films within the genre at UDC. They just need to maintain this proposal of really talented directors who know the source material in depth, like Gunn, who work according to the chosen characters and have the freedom to bring their visions to the big screen.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

1. The editing is slick, vibrant and creative which not only helps to infuse the film with these qualities, but they make the transitions between the differing story-lines to occur smoothly.2. The special effects, for the most part, hold up really well, and unlike the first movie, the lighting isn't lowered to enhance them.3. The comedy largely works in cementing the relationships between the characters, for example, the initial back-and-forth between Bloodsport (Idris Elba) and Peacemaker (John Cena).4. The heavily saturated lighting reinforces the over-the-top and comical nature of the film.5. The fight scenes are fast-paced and fizzling with energy.6. The blood and gore, although mostly reliant on CGI, again helps to reinforce the crazy and ludicrous nature of the movie, as well as making for some truly uncomfortable viewing.7. The film is, for the most part, just mindless superhero/ super-villain fun, and in that regards, it's very entertaining.Cons:
1. The last 30 minutes of the film descended into a Godzilla-esque scenario with the monster running around and destroying buildings, which became tiresome after the first 5 minutes.2. The movie is a little tonally confused at times when it tries to insert humour in somewhat serious and tense moments.3. There were too many characters, and as a result, a lot of them were poorly developed and given nothing to do. Some were just introduced just to serve as cheap laughs and deaths.4. The theme of hawkish American foreign policy creating far more problems than it solves is heavy-handed in its execution to the point where it induces eye-rolls frequently.","31 out of 77 found this helpful.

That being said, the trailers were fun and Grandson released a fantastic tie in track which has been my song of the summer so I was ready to be proven wrong and boy was I? James Gunn's The Suicide Squad is an absolute joy to behold. It is relentlessly violent (uncomfortably so at times), hilariously funny and the thing I expected least, emotional; I cared about each and every member of the team despite the tagline's suggestion to not get attached and was on the edge of my seat from the absolutely bats*** intro to the touching climax. It's impossible to pick a standout performance as everyone was wonderful but if I absolutely HAD to? It would be Idris Elba or Daniela Melchior. They brought so much warmth and heart to the film and it's difficult to pick out anything I didn't like about their performances. In fact? I loved this whole film. I'm sure if I sat and really nit picked I could find plenty I didn't like but the sheer enjoyment I felt watching it and the surprise at just how much i enjoyed it surpasses any critique I can give it. I will say though, this is NOT a film for the squeamish! From credits to credits this film is brutally violent and even those with a strong stomach are gonna get some bang for their buck. If you're a self respecting comic fan or just like a good action blockbuster, give this one a chance, I think it'll surprise you.","132 out of 285 found this helpful.

An X Man giving the middle finger to X Men movies.Only Warner Brothers and DC have ploughed on with movies lacking the fun factor.It's James Gunn to the rescue with The Suicide Squad, the follow on to the 2016 original.Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Bloodsport (Idris Elba) Peacemaker (John Cena) and some others including a shark that likes to eat humans become part of Task Force X assembled once again by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis.)Their mission is to infiltrate the island of Corto Maltese which recently had a coup. It also has a facility with something alien inside. To find out more they need to get to the Thinker (Peter Capaldi.)This is a zippy action movie that eschews the traditional three act structure. It plays fast and loose. It's faithful to its comic book origins.It is violent and darkly comic. It also has a lot of heart thanks to Elba and Daniela Melchior who plays Ratcatcher 2.Despite what looks like a scattergun approach Gunn also manages to add some political subtext to the film.","156 out of 342 found this helpful.

He introduced a number of characters who, at least to me, were largely unknown. I got a little lost there because it wasn't clear to me why the film has 20+ characters, but later everything still makes sense.I don't know if it's up to me, to the numerous extremely positive reviews for which I had slightly higher expectations, but I'm not thrilled with the end product. I got the impression that the film is quite popular because of the many bloody and violent sequences the film is full of. Literally from the first to the last scene, the film records numerous victims, liters of blood and internal organs that are everywhere. In addition, the film is full of humor that often seemed forced. So that combination of blood and humor seems to be popular in the world so then logically the film is also very popular. For me personally, not everything went well, I didn't laugh many times.I would draw a parallel with two similar films that are remarkable to me: Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool. GotG is a film with several main characters who go on a difficult mission and is full of humor. Deadpool is a movie with one main character who constantly talks nonsense and is full of blood. Both films work with their formula unlike this film.Also the film was supposed to have a simpler plot. A team of strange people with powers gather, go on a suicide mission where all sorts of things start happening. Any exit from the main plot or addition was unnecessary for the story and contributed nothing to the quality of the film. The villains aren't top notch either, easily forgettable, and the main villain was a little too grotesque to me.In the end it turns out that I was too negative in this review because the film was not catastrophic for me, but I tried to understand the many positive reviews and enthusiasm for this film, I failed. This was an ok movie for me, nothing special, I would put it in the category of popcorn movies - you watch it to have fun for two hours, and you turn off your brain.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I liken it to Tropic Thunder, which I didn't enjoy since I'm not a fan of silly. But for this movie, I was able to stay more aloof due to low expectations and I ended up actually enjoying it.To be sure, I skipped past some things - I was warned about the birds, and a lot of the fight sequences were so long and brutal. But surprisingly I could handle the lab scene, which somewhat traumatized someone I know. I just saw it as cheesy, like in the many haunted Halloween tours that featured torture which I've been on.The rats, though, were awesome. I had pet rats whom I miss like crazy, so I enjoyed every scene with them. While logically they probably got hurt whenever they came to the rescue, I'm happy to say not one hurt rat was shown. (That was my biggest worry.) And that scene at the end with Sebastian is possibly one of my top favorites scenes of all time.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

There isn't much plot, the jokes mostly missed for me, and the action scenes were just your standard affair. Even Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn didn't really hit the mark in this like she did in the first movie. You could tell they tried to focus on her a lot in an attempt to save the movie, but the character wasn't given enough to do to justify the screen time. They stretched Harley Quinns/Margot Robbies act to the point that it almost became annoying and repetitive. Which is weird, because she was such a highlight in the first movie. I dunno. In the end, Margot Robbie is still gorgeous, the action scenes are fairly entertaining, and it is not as bad as the first one, but it is just not good enough for me to recommend it to most people.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

"","","You have to know how to say it, you have to know how to recognize it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7176793/?ref_=tt_urv","OniReviewer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61353154/?ref_=tt_urv","29 July 2021","Warner continues to drain the surplus from its blockbuster catalog, and the latest screenings are neither the most reassuring nor the most memorable. The same goes for the competition, who wanted to project themselves with a pale and deeply trivialized ""Black Widow"". Yet in the midst of this intercosmic mush is James Gunn, who is reborn and whose style eventually flourishes in the Hollywood limelight. Recovered by the neighbor, then rehired by Mickey's house, the filmmaker bounces on so many occasions that clear him of ambiguity. And it is on the same ground that stumbled David Ayer, that he is building a zone of solace, combed with blood and entrails under the sunlight of the tropics.Flames ? We'll assume so, because in general terms, the father of ""Horribilis"", ""Super"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" had fun doing what was once forbidden to him by his studio. And overall, we find all his filmography there, with a good touch of dark humor and a zeal to iconize his characters, whether they are ephemeral or not in the story. It is then good to remember that the villains that we follow have different degrees of humanity and it works from the first minutes, which undoubtedly ruin the development of some, but who keep the promise of not awakening the heroic instinct that we have. Will have exhausted, even ejected from the universe. But water has passed under the bridges and this remake takes the form of an informal sequel, which is not fun to reprimand the version of 2016. On the contrary, it captures with delicacy, its routine and its scenario taking on a post-it. The characters that we keep in mind will have evolved or else chance will have helped Gunn, like the agent of perfect chaos in the mess he announces.So it's all about casting, and that's why this factor achieves a diversity that would make any previous heroic reunion at DC pale with envy. Unheard of on the big screen, the summer period inherits a bunch of suicidal broken arms. However, it remains in a harmonious bubble, where the mirror of the United States is shattered and the marginalized, or even the invisible ones in society, reveal their grotesque nature. This does not spoil the narration, which appreciates each character and which transports them in a choir of the most gory, recreational and enjoyable. Idris Elba embodies a somewhat smooth Bloodsport, but responds to Will Smith's Deadshot, whose solo score illustrates the team's failure. Here, it is not necessarily around a handful of mercenaries that we gather, those that we will meet forever untouchable, of course not. Margot Robbie once again extends this dark Harley Queen madness, which flees only in loneliness and in the glitter it creates for itself, as if to free itself from the yoke of a push, poisonous and immoral.Peacemaker is therefore introduced with the firm intention of articulating his vision for peace, but often confronts his makeshift partners against his share of quips, which always hits the nail on the head. John Cena camps him with an address, which perhaps destines him to find a way out in this kind of role, cynical and ruthless. Too bad for the fairer sex, it is a little more delicate, because we do not dig enough Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to understand her limits, if she has any. Likewise, Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) is undoubtedly too readable and predictable, like a climax that stretches, but whose disconnection will end the whole thing in style, until it takes full view. The graphics of the shots are fundamentally neat and sequenced in a necessary time frame, because everything is a question of timing. The broken tones and the variety of kills bear witness to this.Villains, movies, blood and emotion are things that Warner's previous promise failed to get us to digest. ""The Suicide Squad"", although it forces a little too often into overexplicative ellipses, is a magnificent transgressive, visually poignant work and an adaptive gem paying homage to comic books and its finest boards. Without revolutionizing the genre, what James Gunn manages to convey will no doubt find the echo sought by producers, whose overexploitation of decorum deconstructs his myths more than he constructs them. The irony is that the filmmaker does not follow a guidebook by following the wick. He prefers detonation at close range, in the heart of the action, in the heart of good emotions.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Idris Elba (BloodSport) and John Cena (Peacemaker) absolutely steal the show above all the other villains in the film. Said characters have the most screen time and are absolutely hilarious whenever they interact with each other. Fan favorite Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) does have her moments to shine but ultimately takes a back seat in terms of the craziness one would expect from her. Robbie is still perfectly fine as the character but just not as dynamic as the other leads.2. The other supporting headliners of the film includes Polkadot Man (David Dastmalchian), Rat Catcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) and King Shark (Sylvester Stallone). There is a reason I failed to mention the rest of the cast, but if you've seen the film......you know exactly why😉. Each aforementioned character is given their time to shine and are written well enough to where you actually care about their respective well-beings when the stakes get high.3. The comedy is executed much better this time around and there are genuine laughs to be had. However, some running jokes land flat and are outright unnecessary at points (i.e. Polkadot Man's ""Mom"" joke). Other times it feels like the film could have been trimmed a bit as there are some forced scenes just to give certain characters extra screen time (i.e. King Shark and the aquarium of strange creatures/Harley Quinn's brief romance).4. By now (if you saw all the trailers) we all know that Starro the Conqueror is the main antagonist who makes his appearance during the climax. I personally enjoyed the last sequence in parts but was expecting a more grandiose/hyped finale given the fun yet bloody tone set in the first two acts. However, Starro (despite having minimal screen time and no dialogue) is leagues better compared to what they did with the Enchantress in the first film.'The Suicide Squad' is a fun and exciting blockbuster that I personally was dying to see again after it was over. Chances are we won't get another sequel for a while but I certainly want to see more of this villain-focused world expanded in the DCEU. All credit to James Gunn as he was certainly the right man for the job in fixing what was previously broken.","44 out of 91 found this helpful.

Special effects were good if overdone. Robbie was good as HQ, though she doesn't stand out as much as the first(not sure if this is because the writing for her isn't as good or that the actors around her do better). I like Elba and thought he did well enough. The rest at least held there own. King Shark added a few amusing moment and honestly TDK's brief moment of glory was probably the most amusing. Good soundtrack.The not so good:
Pacing was okay, but the movie is overly long with a few slow spots. Writing was mediocre at best, probably want to avoid writing at a 5th grade humor level for a movie with a hard R rating.Overall it was okay and we already had HBOMAX so it was free.

All in all, a pretty good time. Better than expected, and NO WILL SMITH!!! Woooo!🙌🙌🙌","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's set pieces, like characters running across falling buildings and Kaiju devestation, are big and hilariously brought to life in crazy cinematic ways. Gore, while some times cheesy, is also shot boldly artistic at times. Director and writer James Gunn always seems to be trying to out do himself with set pieces. The same goes for his passion in the lesser known and unloved characters that he spreads throughout his movies, the man can make even the worst character endearing. Here, characters like Rat Catcher 2, Polka Dot man and king Shark become one's you want to see and root for. There's a particular scene in which Idris Elba's Bloodsport and John Cena's Peacemaker bicker while one upping each other's kills, that is hilarious and character building. There's also a great use of scene transition being experimented with that feels very Wes Anderson like. This is where the problems start though. The entire movie feels a little to experimental. Those transitions, while inventive and beautiful to look at, don't feel like they fit. The structure of the film plays with time in a misused and strange way. Random flash backs to characters stories feel strangely forced in with cliche dialogue. A character even says ""that's my father"" while watching a news break on TV. Some characters are just bond villains with little reason or explanation. Peter Capaldi's Thinker seems criminally underutilized. Elba is good in the movie, but his Bloodsport is a total swap out for Smiths Deadshot. Margo Robbie has a bunch of funny scenes as Harley Quinn and one hell of a fight scene, but is to heavily used and her characters path in the film is hugely obvious. Speaking of obvious, you can tell just by the roster of characters who will make it out alive and who will have only moments of screen time. Gunn seems very hell bent on making this as far from what he did with ""Guardians of the galaxy"" as possible, even if it means sacrificing structure. The movie is fun though and it gives plenty of love to comics and comic fans , it's just no where near what the early reviews claim.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

The actual movie, by David Ayers, gave me the impression that there was a good flick buried in the dreck - this even before voices that the ""Ayers Cut"" was different from the studio's one.James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" is a strange experience. I laughed, and a lot, during the many sequences and visual gags. I liked a lot the vast cast of actors and characters (except for the two-dimensional bad guys). The interplay, banter and the comic timing of many sequences was pitch perfect.Yet, the story bored me. It is, actually, a very plain plot. Strip it down from all the funny scenes and concepts and what remains is an also-ran comic book movie. The local rebels were useful for a single very, very funny moment. Was this enough to include a whole subplot about them? IMHO no.This movie also lacked narrative consistency. One moment it is, literally, Scooby Doo & friends; then it becomes a straight comic book movie; then we move in the territory of ""Airplane!"" and ""A Naked Gun""; then all of sudden the level of splatter and violence is off the scale. I have nothing against splatter by itself. I love Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"". ""The Suicide Squad"", however, is not ""Dead Alive"". Characters explode in bone fragments and entrails no matter why, just because Tim Gunn acts like those kids that have fun in putting firecrackers in turds.Which leads to the final BIG baddie, something as funny as hell, but that, once again, does seem to belong to a different movie. The very CG is Pixar-level excellent - but this only underlines that you are seeing something belonging to ""The Incredibles"" spliced into a totally different movie.I loved Margot Robbie and how she is born to play Harley Quinn (even if Harley's big fight scene is so derivative from those in the ""Resident Evil"" movies that I wondered if they hired the same choreographer; she is even dressed like Milla Jovovich in the first RE movie). I loved Idris Elba. I loved Daniela Melchior's narcoleptic take on Ratcatcher 2. I even loved the small team surrounding Viola Davis. Many gags had me in tears from laughing. But ""The Suicide Squad"" is a montage of gags and sights from three different movies, with the resulting plot wallowing in derativeness and mediocrity. I can't wait to rewatch some scenes. I doubt I'll ever rewatch the whole movie.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Cena's just got this presence that brings a certain comedy and...surrealness? I found myself eager to see what he'd do next.Viola Davis is easily the best Amanda Waller we've ever seen. All the intensity, pragmatism, and utter devotion to her cause. Perfection.There was an underlying ethical line that revealed itself at the clutch point of the movie. It might've been too subtly hinted at throughout the movie, but it did bring a nice sense of closure at the end.Outside of that it just seemed like a lot of shock value. Character does comic book thing that is usually survivable, but dies this time. Check times one thousand. A couple instances were fun, but most came off as lazy.Bad guy was again incredibly contrived. We could've had Lex Luthor, Vandal Savage, any member of the Justice League.... Superheroes are in part judged by how compelling of a villain they rise against. When that villain is this abstract, it's really rough to show ethical development.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yet as critics have stated before, this movie feels less like a movie and more like a directorial reel to boast about (IE: look how epic I can make this set piece! Look how cool the characters are! Look at this decapitated head, look at that shark with legs and arms eating people! Ohhh-ahhh). That's the problem with this film: it's all eye candy with little to no substance/character development. NOW, I understand it's a comic book story (for kids...?) but Gunn wanted something much deeper than that alone- eluding to very serious social and political issues that felt forced and awkward juxtaposed in a very silly and slapstick world. I will say however that the movie is extremely confident with every choice it makes, no matter how ridiculous (I'm looking at you, giant Patrick Star). It's better than the first by a mile but when the bar was set so low is that really an accomplishment? I wouldn't say it's great or even good, just mindless entertainment like the millions of other dc/marvel machines already out there. Now can we stop over-saturating theaters with these derivative super hero movies? Thanks world, we have plenty!!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

.""Relive the Superhero Experience with James Gunn""
.When James Gunn brought Guardians Of The Galaxy in 2014 he brought about a revolution in Superhero Movie experience. It was an antithesis to traditional emotional Straight-Faced action based superhero movie. After 7 years, I should say, James Gunn brought out our ""SUPERHERO MOVIE PRO MAX""
.GOTG was a movie of Misfits. And which group is the Legendary icon of Misfits? Yes, the one and only DC supervillains The Suicide Squad. So when a proven director is given the task to bring out a fitting flick with this misfits, he didn't miss..
Suicide Squad is a cliched film. This is A Film of mostly Cliches. But sometimes that's what we need. But everyone do their cliches perfectly. There is a Groot in King Shark who wants to ""Nom Nom"". The Harley Quinn is 10 times better than Star-Lord. And there is some original characters to sympathise for, like Colonel Rick Flag, and even ""The Starfish""..
Apart from the MVP Margot Robbie, James Gunn pretty much changes the Squad ensemble, and boy, How fine they were!.
This movie doesn't takes it seriously for a split second. But still it will reach your heart with the one-liners. And regarding technical things, what a superb production design! Discovered some great songs through the film..
DC are redeeming themselves with their later projects, TSS gives them a Nitro-Boost. Go watch the best Superhero movie of This decade!.
Personal: 8.5/10.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's relentless bloodshed. Blood splatter after blood splatter. Which is ok but after a while, it started getting on my nerves. You can kill characters off without resorting to it being a blood sport (no pun intended/ it's the name of one of the characters).Putting that aside, the story is told reasonably well from a good start to a weird end fight scene.Ultimately, this is not as good as Guardian's of the galaxy. It's fine but I think you need to be in the mood for it.Unfortunately, I was looking for an action film with intelligence but got something akin to Tropic Thunder.Silly, fun but way (way!) too bloody than was necessary.I was wary as I was watching it with family and that's probably why I felt uncomfortable about it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

That kinda stuff you Won't get. But what you'll get will be a Gaint improvement from the 2016 version. This Movie is incredibly well Edited. It's Light hearted,very colourful. There's no unnecessary dark tone in this movie. The dialogues are massively inspired from Tarantino's writing. It'll always keep you hooked. The Performances are quite good. John cena was a huge surprise. I didn't liked him in F9 but here he works really well. Whatever,Idris elba as 'deadshot' was underwhelming. He lacks the natural flair for comedy needed in this Movie. He's more suitable for serious Roles. In short,It's a good fun to watch movie just Don't expect something extraordinary.","17 out of 49 found this helpful.

The pure unadulterated action spectacle of it all was something to behold, peering into the eye of a madman. Literally the eye in one case (you know the scene if you've seen the film!). How James Gunn can take the aggressive and the grotesque and turn it into something beautiful is nothing short of genius. Not only that, but in the world's greatest mulligan this Suicide Squad takes all the things that worked about the first film and runs with them while fixing all the mistakes. Amanda Waller is still here, and she kicks things off with no BS telling us this is Task Force X, this is the mission, and here we go. Within minutes we're on our way and into the film and into the action. And what action it is! Absurd action too, Polka dots slicing people to bits and a King Shark chomping a guy down in just a few bites? Excellent. That's not to say the film doesn't have a heart though, it does when it needs to. Bloodsport has a surprisingly genuine relationship with his daughter. It's not a happy relationship, but it's real, and it's the relationship this character would have. Similarly, Ratcatcher is a highly sympathetic character with a tragic origin and probably the most likable of the squad. All this combined makes The Suicide Squad one of the best films of the year, and one of the most purely enjoyable superhero films I've seen in a very long time.","32 out of 68 found this helpful.

I will say it was nice to have Harley Quinn not dominate the entire movie this time, and some new characters be given bigger storylines than her.This film is more successful in getting the 'Deadpool' style humor they originally wanted in the first film and there were lots of laugh out loud moments.After watching this, I'm hoping DC will continue this momentum now.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

But when I saw the Snyder name pop up in the intro, my expectations sank a little, especially coming off of Army of the Dead. Seemed like my fears were rightfully realized when all was said and done.What holds it back is a lot of cheesy, inorganic humor and a fairly underwhelming big bad and final showdown. In the early scenes of the helicopter ride toward the team's objective, we see Davidson's character struggle to attach a standard seatbelt. Is that really supposed to be a cool joke? Later we get introduced to Ratcatcher sleeping in bed and unwilling to get up when summoned. ""Millenials,"" Cena quips. Hilarious, right? There's a few more of those where that came from. There's also the many time jumps that interrupt the flow.Then there's the end boss, which is too campy/cartoony (both in style and substance) and uninteresting for the tone of the movie, which ranges from sarcastic to serious. It might fit in the comic book universe and those fans might get a kick out of it, but it didn't jive with a layperson like me. Almost ""Galactus"" as a pink cloud kind of thing.Overall, I found it to be a ""one and done"" kind of deal. Not terrible but nothing that floored me to be craving another viewing in the near or far future. James Gunn's name gets broadcasted for ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" but I felt this was the opposite of that franchise with all the wrong ideas.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Idris Elba gives the film its most entertaining character and Daniela Melchior its heart.

The plot was crazy, ridiculous and at times cheesy which I liked until around the last 20 minutes of the movie with the starfish where it just became too ridiculous for me and I became less intrigued and wanted the movie to end. I know the plot shouldn't be taken seriously, but for me there's a limit of how crazy a movie plot should be. One of the things I did like about the movie were the action scenes which I thought where good and thrilling. I would still recommend this movie, but maybe I would say skip the ending.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The beginning of this film is brutal but as the second act progresses it becomes a bit tedious and there is a lot of sentimentality that ends up overshadowing the violence. The special effects are good and the sound is good too, most of the performances are convincing. The ending feels very long, it is very strange and it is predictable, it did not provoke as much emotion as the beginning did, some jokes feel forced but there are also some well achieved.For me the second act is very long and I don't know very well what to say about the ending, but I think the beginning is good and it's worth watching it to vindicate the thought we had of these characters with the previous film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'll give you a brief and simple rundown of why all the negative reviews are true.-All of the dialogue is sloppily written and the comedy is at the level of middle schoolers. There is no chemistry between any characters and the script tries to be more intense and meaningful than what it really is.-The humor is dreadful. Everything is ""state the obvious.""
Character 1: Is that rat waving at me?Character 2: It appears it is.Character 1: Why?Character 2: Because it's friendly?Also there's nothing but dick jokes, middle fingers and bathroom jokes. There is no brain or thought put into the comedy. Ex: ""Mario kart-racing d-bags"" -Harley Quinn.-The movie is horribly paced. First it's fast (which I can get behind) bc it assumes you've seen the first movie, then it slows down tremendously, then speeds up again, and it's on repeat like this for the remainder of the movie.-Gore is cool but they overdo it.-It tries to do something different which I can give it credit for but it's not executed properly which defeats the whole purpose.-I only saw the movie as a true Harley Quinn fan but I hate how they don't know how to write for Harley Quinn in anything since the original cartoons.I expected much better from this movie but it's just extremely disappointing. No wonder no one really saw this movie.","19 out of 30 found this helpful.

Harley (Margot) is the standout in all the cast, she is outstanding whenever she gets the screen, Peacemaker and Blood Sport are well done by Cena and Alba, Melchior playing Ratcatcher impresses along with Sebastian.

The mash up of slapstick humor, action, adult one liners and engaging story (the hall mark) means that there are very few dull moments within the runtime of 132 mins. The starting scenes set the tone and it only gets better till the end. There are inspirations taken from 50s military classics as well as a bit of Rambo and bit of dirty dozen. One thing that differentiates it from the previous movie .........is the visual appeal (so many colors), soundtrack and the character development. The 02 movies may have the same premise but this one raises the bar.A must watch for lovers of ""golden age of action movies"".","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

So I waited few days upon release to see what the general consensus would be. The reviews were overwhelming positive across the board and I was more then excited to see this one based on that. But upon conclusion while I did enjoy the movie, I was left scratching my head as to why the reviews were really high.First off the pros, the cast is very good and the acting was to across the board. The visuals were great, and for 2 hour plus movie the pacing wasn't bad by any means. The movie did contain alot of action and good amount charm too. It overall was big step up from its predecessor.With all that said though there was quite few negatives. First there was hardly any plot at all and at times the story did meander around. The comedy aspect the film tried to obtain was cringeworthy and very awkward. I also just felt the film direction was odd. The movie was kind of campy at times. It diddn't have that darker, more serious tone that the prior film had which I felt was about only thing its predecessor had done right.Would I recommend this film? Absolutely its definitely fun and good time killer. I just wouldn't personally see it again and don't agree with the excessively high reviews.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's quite over the top with violence which makes for not taking it all too seriously and adds to it's dark humour. Even the opening quarter of the movie with the inadvertent misfits that serve as a diversion is quite similar to the ""X-force"" set up in Deadpool 2. A scene with a plan going horribly wrong resulting in a lot of deaths was way funnier in that movie but not too bad in this case.Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn's ability to take down tough opposition in all 3 DCEU appearances is a bit hard to swallow. While in the comics, her friendship with poison ivy resulted in the later giving her powers, the writters could have done well to explain how she's overly resourceful with special physical abilities in these movies. Also, what technology does Blood-sport (Idris Elba) use to assemble his weapons and tech?There's a lot of colourful creativity in this movie which makes for good popcorn non-stop action. The characters were sufficiently developed for likeability. King Shark (voiced by Sly Stallone himself) was always a delight in his scenes. Beautiful and satisfying.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

That said, I quite enjoyed this film for what it is, a really gritty war movie with boatloads of heart (plus simultaneous hatred), an underlining dark comedic tone and cascades of spectacularly over-the-top, sick action-violence that completely goes off the rails in quick succession right from the get-go (oh yeah, and a few satirical elements come into play). To put it blunt and simply, this is the most mainstream Troma-esque film I've ever seen be made, which is no surprise given the director got his start in the industry thanks to his mental former mentor Lloyd Kaufman - the madman schlock maestro himself. Since this film is centred around a ragtag bunch of rebellious antiheroes, it draws pretty strong correlations to the nitty-gritty Spaghetti Westerns of old with its unpredictable ""rough and ready, no holding back"" attitude, various double-crossing plot twists and the fact that not every character makes it out alive to see the end; A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) are the prime examples that spring to mind. Only difference here is that instead of being about gunslinging cowboy outlaws in the archaic Old West, it's a government led team of incarcerated bad guys with super-powered abilities who're all burdened due to their own internal conflicts and seeking some mild form of redemption for those past struggles (so not totally the exact same thing, but fairly close).I recall back to when folks once hailed Alex Garland's grounded DREDD 3D (2012) as being one of the most ultra-goriest superhero films ever made, and how that honour soon quickly went over to Fox's screwball Deadpool duology (2016-2018). But I can safely say after seeing this, now they have to bestow that title onto The Suicide Squad because those previous comments couldn't be anymore redundant by now. Although saying that, if you've already seen a whole load of disturbingly gruesome imagery in prior genre films beforehand - such as the many body-horror movies of the '80s and '90s - then really, you might be a tad disappointed to find that it's not all that much gorier than most of those older horror-oriented ones are. What makes all the gory parts in those old-school horror movies more effective is that the practical-effects in them (i.e. Special prosthetic makeup and other physical on-set props) felt tangible to the human eye, whereas conversely the polished visual-effects bloodshed you see in modern splatter flicks today are all one big digital graphic generated on a computer screen and yes, while they may look way more convincing to audiences nowadays, they just never give me that same sort of feeling I get when I watch the classic older effects; which is a raw sense of dirty realism because it was all actually done in-camera during the principal photography shoot and not just composited in the scene later on in post-production after filming the whole thing (the point I'm driving at is that VFX don't affect me in the same way like how SFX do).The main expendable group of awesome supervillain lunatics are all given their manically memorable moments to sadistically shine; whether that be them displaying frequent outbursts of psychopathic actions (some of which can be rather disturbing, at points) or just simply showboating to one-up each other on the mission, it's all good character-building stuff considering the fact they're supposed to be black ops baddies that we shouldn't like or be rooting for with their drastically unhinged personalities (this is further reinforced by their ever-present erratic behaviours). I'd say that out of the entire task force, Idris Elba's mercenary persona stood-out as the only one with a mostly cool, calm and collected frame-of-mind; a somewhat levelheaded ""I don't care very much for your nonsense"" type demeanour, especially when he's reluctantly forced into the awkward position of temporary leadership. Seeing as how it was partially featured in almost all the marketing (which includes trailers, teasers and TV spots), it's NO spoiler that Starro the Conqueror is in this film as the penultimate antagonistic threat. As someone who knows next to nothing about comic book lore but who's right into black-and-white creature features from the ""Atomic Age"" of classic 1950s cinema, this gargantuan one-eyed starfish-looking alien would've fitted in perfectly with the bonkers Gamera franchise (being a big daikaiju addict, it's appearance properly satisfied me). And Sylvester Stallone giving his voice to a slow-minded man-shark (who's constantly famished and friendless) in a prominent live-action role sure is one heck of an anomaly, one which I never thought I'd see happen to such a high-profile Hollywood actor as him (seems like it'd be the sort of thing you'd likely see in a cheesy low-budget B-movie).Just some miscellaneous things I want to comment on now; I found it kind of distracting how Gunn's script brought up the word ""children"" several times throughout the course of the film, placed in the context of preventing something really bad from happening to them. It seemed to me like the man still harbours an awful amount of emotional guilt over the numerous risque mistakes he made on social media years and years back, in reference to him posting tasteless, unfunny and downright offensive ""jokes"" (his own failed attempts at doing edgy humour publicly) about certain sensitive subjects on Twitter long ago. I get he may continue to have a guilty-conscience about his previous actions and wants to atone for what he did by facing his inner-demons (from a certain point-of-view), but sometime or another you're going to have to let go and move on, hold your head up high and look forward to the future, try to better yourself and ultimately be the bigger person than you once where before without dwelling too heavily on your past wrong-doings because otherwise it'll gradually consume you (if you're not careful, it can leave you writhing around in a lot of guilt-ridden pain). I also wasn't a fan of the uncomfortable ""bird cruelty"" scenes, but I get they were all fictitious depictions and never really happened (so I'm not too distressed). I'm typically not that much of a prudish person but there's a big overload on the excessive usage of swear words spouted out for juvenile jokes, as it's shock value starts to wane when they're said over a billion times in the same scene (thus rendering them ineffective to the senses as your mind becomes numb after a while of listening to it).So overall, The Suicide Squad was a ridiculously fun time. I may not like it as much as David F. Sandberg's tongue-in-cheek Shazam! (2019), but I think it's miles better than Zack Snyder's miserable and depressing Batman vs. Superman (2016). And just to reiterate, if you were expecting to see a high amount of extremely horrific gore in this movie, than you'll probably be a little let down with it's actual content. Sure, the pacing might drag on a bit halfway through when we reach the Second Act and people can complain about certain plot-holes all they want by nitpicking them to death, but I say anyone who takes movies too seriously is going to miss out on enjoying the immense entertainment value something as absurdly stupid as this has to offer the viewer. It's just an unapologetically CGI-heavy gore-fest with an appropriate soundtrack comprised of licensed music, tons of cleverly-written sarky quips to keep you amused (Gunn's trademark quirky style) and some gruesomely exaggerated sequences of crazy ultra-violent action set-pieces (most were seemingly done on-location in the real world with wire-work stunts and pyrotechnic explosions going off, and weren't all solely performed in front of a studio green-screen), all of which are surprisingly rich in exquisite detail. Accept it for what it is and you'll have an absolute blast watching; a hilarious ride of black comedy that's got an unleashed level of self-awareness which tells you to go along with the daft premise as this knows exactly how dumb it truly is by embracing it's barmy source material. But only watch if you're really feeling in the right mood for an insane war zone-type film with a morbidly-humorous silly vibe and vibrantly colourful superhero-motif.Just one last piece of interesting trivia for you; if you've ever seen any one of his previous films before, it would appear as though James Gunn has a weird ""tentacle fetish"" going on in his prior body of work as his past filmography literally has them in almost every single feature he's directed so far - from Slither (2006) to Super (2010) and of course, his Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) for Marvel - and now, in addition to all that, The Suicide Squad as well. Man, Gunn sure likes his slimy tentacled thingies, doesn't he.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So imagine my surprise 10 minutes into the movie I was absolutely hooked. Many genre's rolled into one this dark comedy, action thriller is well paced, well acted and surprisingly well written. Miles ahead of the big budget turd plopped out by DC in 2016, birds of prey or any other franchise movie with the exception of joker or the dark knight trilogy (dark knight rises aside maybe). If you're looking for a deep character driven Oscar film look elsewhere. Joker it is not. But it you are looking for well timed action sequences, a good plot/story, excessive gore, a lot of laughs and ridiculously over the top characters that actually work and mesh well together while keeping you engaged throughout the entire film then give this a chance.

Tbh i went to watch it without much expectations and i enjoyed this newly formed Task Force X led mission to destroy a Nazi Lab and project Starfish....
The characters Harley Quinn , BloodSport were very likable...
Even John Cena fit in well along with polka Dot and RatCatcher 2... Although i thought i would find Cena as Peacemaker really annoying:P
I found King Shark to be the most funny and he was good....
The film also surprises us in the beginning and makes us feel that those important characters should have been there....
I liked the amount of bloodshed that was there but by no means this is the best Superhero movie made by DCEU as many fans are claiming...
The film lacks background at certain moments like why Cena opposes the task force X etc and is unevenly paced throughout....
The Sex scenes of Harley Quinn also looked very forced... Wasn't necessary...
Overall i enjoyed this James Gunn version of the movie and i also quite liked the 2016 version which many people claimed to be the worst...
Definitely DCEU can do better than this they have the potential....
But I feel Warner Bros keep screwing it up....","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Such was the case with Zack Snyder's Justice League and Joss Whedon's theatrical release, now we have James Gunn's The Suicide Squad, five years removed from the disastrous film that mostly shares its name. From the circumstances of Gunn's hiring to direct the film down to the decision to keep elements of a movie that was critically derided, The Suicide Squad manages to defy expectations and become one of the better films within this flailing superhero franchise.Taking place after the first film, The Suicide Squad rounds up a new team of criminals sent to do government stooge Amanda Waller's bidding, this time attempting to infiltrate the South American island of Corto Maltese to destroy an experiment known as Project Starfish. After a first act shakeup, the team learns the true nature of Project Starfish, it's danger to the world, and America's role in it. The Suicide Squad, a film that is humorous, cynical, and has a bit of a mean streak in it, is another solid addition to James Gunn's filmography.Over the last few years, Harley Quinn has become of the centerpieces of DC Comics. An already beloved character thanks to her time on Batman: The Animated Series, the resurgence of affection for the character is due largely in part to Margot Robbie's performance of the character. Quinn's personality disorder is unfortunately still played for laughs, but thanks to Robbie, the former right hand woman for The Joker is still seen as lethally unpredictable. With each appearance of Robbie's Quinn (three now, after Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey), another facet of the character is explored. If Robbie wants to continue playing the character, by all means let her.Idris Elba's Bloodsport is also at the forefront of the film. With performances as cool and as full of charm as Elba's, it's hard to remember that these characters are all horrible criminals that we probably shouldn't be rooting for (especially in lieu of how he treats his daughter). Still, Elba plays the grizzled professional assassin as a man who doesn't suffer fools lightly that now finds himself surrounded by them. Elba gets to flex his dry sense of humor as Bloodsport clashes with Peacemaker as the odd couple pairing of bickering killers. To that end, Cena's straight laced, no nonsense Peacemaker initially carries the brunt of the humor as a man willing to achieve peace at any and all cost. Cena plays the part wonderfully with excellent comedic timing that is at times an extra meta look at Cena's wrestling personality. Perfectly casted, his willingness to throw himself into the role shows on screen as he constantly steals a number of scenes he's in.The talent assembled in The Suicide Squad remains one of the stronger points of the film. An all star mixture of staples from Gunn's repertoire, members of the previous movie, and new faces to the franchise all mesh together while letting the actors have fun regardless of how ill fated their characters are. Joel Kinnaman is allowed to cut loose, reprising his role as Rick Flag, playing the character with less intensity. David Dastmachian and Daniela Melchior as Polka-Dot Man and Ratcather 2 respectively are the heart of the movie, with Dastmalchian playing an outsider amongst outsiders and Melchior the beacon of hope and positivity throughout. Both performances are genuine and heartfelt and serve as character breaks in between the insanity of the action and arguing.Directed by James Gunn, The Suicide Squad is the type of film that sits firmly within his wheelhouse. Unleashed from the family friendly restraints of The Mouse, Gunn is able to cut loose and have a field day crafting a story centered on a disparate group of men and women sent into an impossible situation facing incredibly long odds. Gunn plays off the expectations of the original Suicide Squad and immediately upsets the apple cart, shocking audiences in the first act and keeping everyone on their toes. This is reflected in a somewhat meta wink at the viewers in a scene where Amanda Waller's office workers are actively placing bets on which members of the Squad will live to see the mission accomplished. Gunn is in full control, creating a film with just enough humor to cover the dark undertones of America's negative worldwide influence throughout the ages. Dynamic camerawork, great cinematography from Henry Braham, and Gunn's ability to draw out great performances from even the smallest roles are the highlights of the film.Overall, as the traditional summer blockbuster season begins to wind down, The Suicide Squad stands as proof that the decision makers at Warner Brothers are indeed capable of making a good superhero film based off the DC Comics property. While each DCEU movie has been hit-and-miss with fans, The Suicide Squad stands out along with Wonder Woman and Shazam! As surefire successes. Full of surprises, laughter, and action, James Gunn's love of off beat outcasts and ensemble crews is made apparent. This is the perfect movie to watch with friends on a Friday night with drinks in hand. The Suicide Squad is now in theaters and streaming on HBO Max.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I rarely quit movies, but decided half-way through that I could not invest another hour in something that *completely* uninteresting just to write a snarky review (and I love writing snarky reviews). Given that, I admit to being skeptical about whether this reboot could work, even with James Gunn. It didn't just work. It worked well. Gunn's script is so much smarter and funnier than its predecessor. I generally don't love when films heavily rely on graphic comedic violence - and this was excessive at points - but I was still laughing early and often this time. If all the DC movies were dark with actual wit (vs just dark), they could maybe find some identity. In the meantime, this one was thoroughly entertaining.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Funny, but less interesting by the end","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8271910/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher_Reid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13995491/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2022","DC is just a mess. Clearly. I haven't seen Batman vs. Superman, nor have I seen the first two Suicide Squad movies. And I probably never will see them. But this one seemed to have a better reputation so I thought I'd check it out. Well, it's a mix. Some parts were legitimately entertaining and I was excited for its potential early on. However, it becomes more average in the last act.The best aspect is the offbeat humour. Gunn did well with the Guardians of the Galaxy so I guess it makes sense for him to tackle this kind of thing. Although, at the same time, I really wish there was more loyalty within franchises. Eg) JJ Abrams shouldn't be making both Star Trek and Star Wars movies. They're too different. By having the same director, everything starts to blend together which is not a good thing.Anyway, this movie does have some very funny parts. However, it doesn't really quite sustain or hold together. The plot becomes more humdrum. Once we get some funny introductions and creative sequences early on, the movie settles into more familiar action stereotypes and loses its originality.Margot Robbie is attractive and a good actress, but pretty annoying as Harley Quinn. It's such a shame. She's a very likable character in the animated series of Batman which invented her. Quirky, silly, fit, dangerous. Her costumes are cool - basically a full jester outfit. She's not completely evil but kind of insane.But in these movies, Harley Quinn looks lame. The style is off-putting with tattoos, coloured hair, torn clothing, pants too short. She has no elegance. No mystery. And her character is even worse than she looks. Super annoying. Anything ""random"" (TM) is hilarious to her. Everyone goes through awkward stages they regret. But she's like the worst part of teen girls permanently. Mildly amusing at best.The rest of the cast are fine but aren't used consistently. Elba seems to be the heart or backbone and he's very good. But even his character is somewhat flippant. Some of the powers are creative, but aren't used as best as they could be. The shark guy is funny as well.The problem with a movie like this is that it doesn't fully commit. One version is completely silly, almost like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Just a movie completely falling apart for the sake of comedy. That can work. But opposing that is a movie with a heart or some core of realism. The Suicide Squad can't pick and ends up failing at both.I can't care because the violence is so over-the-top and anyone could randomly die a gory death just for a quick gag. And I can't laugh constantly because there are too many moments going for drama or suspense which break the momentum.Also, on some level you need to like the characters. I liked several, but by the end I really disliked some of them. It breaks any tension there was. Now I'm very confused about who's good and evil. But not in a clever or deep way. Just in a ""I don't care anymore"" kind of way. And with such over-the-top action, it's hard to be invested. Deaths don't mean anything because they happen so casually.In summary, The Suicide Squad was a fun ride, at least for some of the way. A few moments were really funny. But they didn't build up effectively. Some of the visuals are cool, but none of it feels real. It's not bad. But it's not that good either. It's somewhere between great and a complete mess, never reaching either. It's shocking that it remains above average for DC. My goodness.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Is attempting to build a program out of creating lemonade out of lemons.""Suicide Squad"" was a sloppy, watchable catastrophe in 2016. It has honed that rogue attitude to a far sleeker edge of anger in 2017. It's an origin story about a gang of scruffy cutthroats that feels authentically steeped in the grunge underworld. ""The Suicide Squad"" is more enthralling and evocative than you may think. There are rats (a lot of them), bullets that are dangerous enough to shoot through other bullets, and the fact that, while our heroes have powers, most of them aren't particularly powerful.""Suicide Squad"" is a never-ending garbage can of characters. Amanda Waller, played by Viola Davis, assembles a band of aggressive con artists for missions that will almost certainly end in their deaths. The film's tone establishes the film's tone of utter nihilism. King Shark, portrayed by Sylvester Stallone, is the closest thing to a superhero and the film's main competitor. ""The Suicide Squad"" is unapologetically simple, and this is a constraint.For the first hour, the film rides on James Gunn's punk-factor flair. It lacks the captivating intricacy of ""Zack Snyder's Justice League.""""Suicide Squad"" roars to life as a full-throttle comic-book film. James Gunn directed it in a bad boy manner, but that was his mandate. Make no mistake: ""The Suicide Squad"" is a grandly scaled down-and-dirty trash.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However slightly too long. Harley's stuff feels unnecessary, however it results in a great action scene. I feel her stuff should have been cut or trimmed down a bit. Miles better than the 2016 one.Performances are all great. Standouts being Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher ll, Sylvester Stallone as King Shark and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag who's actually a character this time round. Surprisingly John Cena as Peacemaker was actually great. Looking forward to seeing what his show has in store.I got exactly what I wanted from The Suicide Squad: fun bloody action with colourful characters and a high body count.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

James Gunn struck gold with the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and the attempt to repeat that formula is apparent here - only it's amped up to the nth degree. The plot, if one can call it that, is one long exercise in subverting expectations. But Gunn is no M. Night Shymalan and no Monty Python either. This is pure randomness and lack of structure masquerading as subversiveness and edginess. I found myself reminded of the old Ren & Stimpy cartoon show at times, the bad later seasons, not the good early ones. Trying so hard to be edgy that it just becomes cringe worthy.This film reeks of studio desperation. It's Homer's makeup shotgun from the Simpsons in movie form. A bizarre, unfocused and pitiful smear of concepts, moods and sounds.Speaking of sound, the use of music in this film is awful. Different genres of songs are used randomly like in a late 90s Tarantino rip off. Most of the pop songs don't even work with what's happening on screen. Harley's escape is such a case. Frequently the score is interrupted full stop by sound fx or jokes. Again another attempt at ""subverting expectations"" and a simple trick at that. People expect music to go on, so when it's suddenly interrupted, they feel surprised. It's a dumb man's clever movie.It's not entirely without merit. Some of the photography is nice. Some of the acting performances are good (Polka Dot man, Idris Elba, the Shark and Rat Girl stand out) and some are awful (the villains, the nerds in front of the computer screens who do nothing but comment on things). Some of the character interactions are funny. Most are not.The first 20 minutes are amusing. The movie grinds to a painful halt in the middle and never regains its momentum. It's one exceedingly long, constantly interrupted, unfocused stew. Worst of all is the blatant disrespect this film has for its audience.I compare Marvel movies to fast food. Simple, safe, unhealthy junk food for the brain with very few nutrients. This is worse. This is vomit cooked up with artificial flavoring and sold as haute cuisine to people without taste buds.Bad as the original Suicide Squad was, this made me nostalgic for it.","535 out of 1,130 found this helpful.

I clearly understand everyone has their own taste to like a film but I don't think you should dislike it not hate it. Surely this movie is not for all, it's a risky project in a market. Creative people will definitely like it, people who wants to enjoy or expect something new from superhero genre and just want to get entertained will also love it but people who don't like silliness and expect it to be masterpiece will definitely not. If you've watched Doom Patrol and you've liked it then this one is for you. To be frank I liked the 2016 SS so much because of Joker, Harley & Deadshot even today I'll watch it for them. I wasn't happy when I watched the trailer for 2021's SS. It felt weird to me even tho it had Doom Patrol vibe. Tbh I didn't Wanted SS coming with Doom Patrol vibe. The characters felt so not intresting to me at that time but......
I watched it and I love it. Yes it has flaws but not that makes you hate it or cringe or even boring. The only thing I felt bad here is here I miss the Harley. At some point you get Harley Quinn and suddenly you feel it's not her especially there's a scene where Harley has a Sex with a guy she met in his place an hour a back which is super awkward. I'm personally a creative person and I appreciate the art & creativity james gunn had put into this. It's definitely not a masterpiece but it will definitely be entertaining and it definitely is a good movie to watch of you're okay with gore, violent blood bath, nudity just like Netflix stuff. If you like those movies then you gonna love this.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Most DC movies have disappointed me (when Zack Snyder does them) by changing characters badly or having people in dark outfits fight in dark rooms. Thankfully this movie avoids both and is fun. Not unbelievable fun but good enough. Viola Davis is incredible! She does the perfect Amanda Waller. Bloodsport and Peacemaker have great chemistry and work well together. Almost all of the characters work really well but it is hard to beat King Shark since any scene he is involved in seems to be stolen by him. I felt Harley was just in it to pander to people but she does become an important part of the movie adding the right amount of crazy (like in previews where she tells a captive ""and if you have personalized license plates, you die"" while Bloodsport is trying to threaten the captive).I wish we got more of several characters but there are none I wish we had less of for the most part. It is worth seeing.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's vastly superior to the first Squad movie, unsurprisingly.When broken down, there really isn't very much to praise. The story is 'government conspiracy' claptrap, the humour (outside of a couple of decent visual gags) is almost entirely sarcastic and postmodern, regardless of which character's turn it is to be 'funny'. The dialogue is often mumbled in a variety of bizzare accents and difficult to make out. Peter Capaldi is dreadful as the 'villain' who looks like he got his prosthetics from ebay and has an accent that's apparently from everywhere.The soundtrack is loud, intrusive, repetitive and disrupts the flow of the movie every five minutes. The action is weak, over-choreographed and very stagey. CGI is relied upon, heavily, for absolutely everything.However, it's held together with good performances by Elba and Robbie who prop up the rest of the (average) cast. It also has a great monster that lights up the screen.The Suicide Squad is shambolic and sometimes charming, but ultimately gets it right where it counts - entertainment value.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I mean i had no expectations cuz the SSQ (2016) was an abomination and the marketing for this movie was terrible (I didn't even know when it comes out), so i just went in with a clear mind. I think the problem is the basic plot and the predictable pacing. At the end of the day, you are not going to remember the movie the next day (perhaps one or two scenes) and if it wasn't a DC film, it would have a 6.5 or less rating. Definitely better than the first one, like that's a given, but nothing interesting really happens so ..
Ps. I've read reviews that say this is the best DC film after Nolan's trilogy, but the truth is this the best DC film after WW1984 (which I didn't really enjoyed). Shazam was way better than this tbh.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","This was cheesy fun...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7204458/?ref_=tt_urv","paul_haakonsen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22654354/?ref_=tt_urv","7 August 2021","Well, if you enjoyed the 2016 ""Suicide Squad"" movie, then you will certainly enjoy the 2021 movie ""The Suicide Squad"" as well. Why? Well, simply put, because it is the same kind of cheesy entertainment.Writer and director James Gunn definitely managed to keep the movie up to par with the 2016 predecessor in terms of oddball characters, an outrageous script and an abundance of action.It should be said though that the 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"" is a step up in terms of graphic violence and sheer mayhem. For better or worse, then ""The Suicide Squad"" was rather bloody and gory. That was something I had not expected from the movie, but it was definitely something I welcomed to the movie, as it just felt rightly at place in the cheesy movie.The storyline told in ""The Suicide Squad"" is a no-brainer, and very much reminiscent of the 2016 movie. So this is essentially a movie where you lean back, munch the popcorn and just enjoy the action-packed ride.I can't claim that I was particularly impressed with the bad guy, villain or whatever you want to call a starfish of that size and magnitude. Sure, it made for some great spectacle of destruction, but the creature itself and the concept of it was just a bit far out there. But hey, then again, anything is possible in these movies I suppose.The characters in ""The Suicide Squad"" were colorful and bizarre, to say the least. And that was something that I definitely enjoyed in this 2021 movie, as they upped the character gallery quite a lot in comparison to the 2016 movie.I feel that Harley Quinn (played by
Margot Robbie) was a bit underplayed in this movie, as her character wasn't really given enough time to show the usual level of whacky crazy that we saw in the other movies.The Bloodsport character (played by
Idris Elba) was definitely one of the more detailed and layered characters in the movie, and let's just be honest here, Idris Elba was superbly cast for this particular role and performed it so well. It was fun to watch Michael Rooker portraying the Savant character in the movie, despite of not having all that much screen time.Then there was the King Shark character. When I first saw him, I must admit that I was ready to face palm myself. But as the movie progressed, I must admit that the character grew on me, and he definitely was a good comedy relief in the movie. And of course having Sylvester Stallone to do the voice was just great.I am not much of a fan of John Cena and his 'acting', but the character he portrayed in ""The Suicide Squad"" was actually a well-written character and one that felt very much in place in the movie.Having mentioned King Shark, I also have to mention the Weasel (played by Sean Gunn). Wow, what a character. He was something unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen, both in terms of appearance, mannerisms and what part he played in the movie. This character was just glorious. But I bet there will be a lot of people out there disliking the character. But, to each their own.And it was really, really nice to see actor Joaquín Cosio in the movie, taking on the part as Mayor General Mateo Suarez. This guy seriously is a great actor, and a much underrated one at that. He was so nicely cast for the movie and brought a lot of flavor to the screen.Visually then ""The Suicide Squad"" is great. Of course it is great, given it being a D. C. movie about anti-heroes.I must admit that I wasn't initially expecting all that much from writer and director James Gunn's 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"", but it proved to be rather enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.My rating of ""The Suicide Squad"" lands on a six out of ten stars - or starfish...","20 out of 68 found this helpful.

Basically, The Suicide Squad is exactly what 2016's bummer should've been. It's entirely obvious to identify, but it was tremendously unnecessary to add all the extreme carnage, language and other overdone graphic material to the story. What people truly want is just a fun, comical, ridiculous and entertaining flick packed with engaging action that's worth witnessing in the cinema.Despite the major gore, The Suicide Squad is surprisingly improved and is certainly much better than most sequels we've experienced over the past two years. However, the film owns some weakness that makes it worth warning everyone to not let their expectations move too high. It's mainly just the prolonged climax and the film's whole pace in general. Considering it isn't fast and feels noticeably extensive, the characters, action and jokes make it worth a watch.The creators basically just completely ignore the existence of 2016's Suicide Squad, aim at the fun centre of the target, fire the arrow, miss the bullseye, but unexpectedly achieve a high score. Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Rick Flag, King Shark, Ratcatcher and Polka-Dot Man lead as entertaining and engaging characters, placed in the middle of an action-packed mission. The silliness in the centre is loveable and it's all a really funny adventure, but isn't worth way too much hype.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

No, but this is certainly one of DC's greatest productions. The entire film is over the top in every way from extreme gore to the main villain being a starfish but it offers a nice fresh take on the super hero genre and I had a great time watching it. The best way to explain the experience is a Marvel movie for a more adult audience.If I had one complaint it would be that the plot had some troubles pacing towards the middle with some weird jumps in time, but this movie in no way deserves the 1 star reviews I've been seeing and I suspect these reviewers haven't even watched it based on what I've been reading.Overall, I recommend watching The Suicide Squad.

If you're taking the time to read user reviews, you know how these movies work.Throw in some comic book heroes, lots of action, some bad guys, and an ultimate boss character, mix in some dark humor, and make sure the good guys win. Or, in the case with the Suicide Squad, the psychotic antiheroes win. Don't take yourself too seriously and entertain your audience.This one did all that fine. I appreciate that the movie didn't try to push any social agendas or identitarian politics and instead focused on making the ride entertaining. For that, it gets an extra star.The Suicide Squad (2021) is one of the better DC comic movies I've seen. Not up there with Nolan's Dark Knight series, but not terrible like Birds of Prey. I think it was much better than the first Suicide Squad movie and put it on par with Zack Snyder's cut of Justice League.With that said, I didn't see this one in a theater. I watched it on HBOmax.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Take 2016s suicide squad for example a convoluted mess that got torn adpart by clueless studio executives and with a potent combination of botched edits.The trailer left a lot to be desired, it stuck me by how little impression the suicide squad made on me, so I was pretty skeptical going into the movie, and after watching it today for the most part I had a good time with it, for the most part.The suicide squad is a vast improvement over it's predecessor although that isn't that much of a hugh bench mark. It gives it's characters much needed levity this time around and allows them to kickass again. The suicide squad isn't without it's problems and I can tell you there's a lot of problems with this movie. First off the majority of the jokes do not land in the slightest, and that's a problem because it makes up most of the movie. The gags are cheap and obvious that drag on way too long, and it's quite excruciating to watch.You are bombarded by so much ridiculous nonsense it's hard to follow, and that is the same for the pacing of the suicide squad, it juggles a lot of ideas and it definitely drops the ball at times. Like for example there's a non exact plot about Leo capaldi character that was the key to pretty much everything and suddenly he's there with the squad with a very bleak reason to the convenience of the plot, it just felt cheap.The best thing about this movie was the characters and the twist in the final act, to a final act that is far from perfect. It really caught me off guard and it's the single reason why I rank this movie so high. It's ballsy and this is risks marvel doesn't take and it's the single reason why I think DC has immense potential. The characters are well constructed and James Gunn is a seasoned professional at this and can take any character and make them like able, it's what he did with guardians of the galaxy and it's no exception here.If I was to describe this movie is that it's potential, potential DC can finally get their act together and finally get back on its feet, because this movie is a great leap forward for the DCEU as a whole and excited to see what the future holds for film in dc.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Instead of feeling like you're being asked to barrack for a bunch of bad people, as with the first one, characters have development and redemption arcs. Also, the worst Joker ever imagined does not make an appearance, which can only be a plus.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Went to watch this with a friend in the cinema, humour throughout was so forced and unfunny to the point where every time another joke was cracked me and my friend would just look at one another on the verge of tears because we were cringing so badly. The 'gore' looked incredibly fake and was overall very unnecessary, the characters were just a bad version of the original film (shark guy was cute though must say and Idris Elba and Harley carried the movie the best they could). Possibly the worst part for me was the completely unnecessary use of words for time stamps made from the unrealistic gore, smoke etc. I'm unsure how to describe what I mean but it felt like I was watching a Spongebob movie, you'll understand if you make the unfortunate decision to watch. The Spongebob feeling was strengthened when a large one eyed Patrick Starr appeared as the movies great villain. The villain looked like it was taken straight from Monsters vs Aliens. I was also confused at the age demographic the movie was aimed at as the humour was childish and the villain very mild and cartoon-like yet there was nudity and although poorly done there was a lot of gore. Overall i would not recommend this movie as I hated everything about it apart from Harley Quinn and a couple other characters. Don't get me started on rat girl and her sob story.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Movie Review -DC universe after Nolan Trilogy has surely struggled, especially compared to Marvel Cinematic Universe. That huge box office collection and universal acclaim didn't really come for any film before 'Joker' and couple of films before that like 'Wonder Woman' and 'The Aquaman' which brought them respectable results, if not great. This Supervillain franchise was completely new kind of experiment for DC as well as for Audience because such wild and nasty theories in comedy genre and negative characters was something unachieved. Suicide Squad (2016) didn't really live upto the hype but surely has its separate fan base and now after 5 years we have the standalone sequel 'The Suicide Squad' for the betterment and improvisation of this new cinematic universe. Supervillains aren't the thing people love and maybe the makers know it and so they present it without any polish or soft corner. They Suicide Squad gets it right and gets it right for 2 long hours with bigger dose of comedy. It's brutal, vulgar and abusive entertainer and so is only made for adults.There is nothing much to talk about the story cause it's not that important nor it offers anything special to be mentioned. Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. The mission turns evil by the end and expectedly we get to see the villains turning into Superheroes. As if we didn't know it from the start. However, the villain here, i mean whatever Kaiju Starfish it is, it's terribly powerful. It's hard to believe that these little birds from The Suicide Squad were up against a humongous monster. A complete one-sided face off it was. But as we all know, heroes always win so just don't try to find any logic in it.The acts and action scenes are superbly performed by all the actors. Margot Robbie has got a ripping-off kind of stuff twice, holy smoke. That's more than what male supervillains have got there. The problem with all the characters is, after a while all of them look cheesy. The same jokes and abuses we enjoy in the first half, starts boring you in the second half due to lack of originality. That's where the screenplay falters, the second half, where mostly there was nothing much of a scope for the writer as major portion is filled with over explosive action sequences. The VFX in last 20 minutes looks poor when that over-imaginative properties fails to create the scary images accurately.James Gunn isn't that bad, but he isn't that great either. He does few things right and so naturally misses some to leave you have space for bashing. I am using that space but i would like to Praise him too for getting few things right, actually better than expected. Overall, The Suicide Squad is a healthy dose of entertainment and undoubtedly the best thing coming out in this Supervillain category recently after Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" but yes it has its own dragging moments that you have to endure.RATING - 6.5/10*","9 out of 29 found this helpful.

Grant you I really have no idea this genre type of movie. But the way they plot at this movie in the characters is like a 12-year-old directing a movie. Grant you before you say reviews bad, my point is there's no coherence movie all there is that's OK I can understand that because movies of this genre have that, but Cena seems to have found this place as the big moron in this movie this part fits him perfectly no brain actor no brain part in this movie. He won't get a better movie that fits his personality than this one no brains. As I said this movie genre people loving this type of vigilante type of flair, but frankly speaking anybody could've directed this movie all they had to do is get some pretty good special-effects people and do it. Senseless violence is common place in this movie genre but the dialogue the characters I just who's who and who is stupid enough to show up destroy their career. Grant you saw this but I am really happy I didn't pay to see this movie. Otherwise I would give this a subzero rating. Don't get me wrong I understand people like this type of movie and it's that's sad. Cena is the only one that seems the perfect part in this movie brainless stupid and moronic he will never get a better part than this one. I don't really want to write this movie because you can't read what they put on the screen but you can't rate is the quality of the actors that portrayed them in that case I'll give it five stars. Dont read just react you rating is meaningless.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And given how frequently movies in the DCEU have not met my expectations, I thought this being adequately enjoyable was a massive plus point on its own.The casting in particular was perfectly done; especially that of John Cena, who I thought was the best of the group. The characters were very memorable and (unlike the previous SS movie) didn't totally suck. Another major plus point for this movie is its pacing; helped very much by the editing that stands out from the get go. And technically, it's a very colorful and visually pleasing experience.The story however, was kinda shallow, with no stakes as much as there should have been, and one where the ending is as cliché as it could have gotten. But it was stupid and fun, so who cares.Overall, I actually enjoyed it more than I did any previous DCEU movies that tried to be as funny and easy going as this was (The original Justice League, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam and WW84), so I'm glad I didn't feel disappointed by the end of it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The painfully absurd back stories of each, trying to switch from typical James Gunn funny over the top comedy (which isn't funny in this context) to a serious scene trying to explain each character doesn't work that well.The evil plot is dumb. Either Rick and Morty ripped it off, or the writers of this ripped them off.I guess I just don't like the suicide squad and nobody can make these silly characters likeable for me.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

The characters were no where near as likeable as Guardians of the Galaxy which was a missing element for me. I found I wasn't really invested in any of them. Humour was really lacking as well, I found the majority of the jokes to be old and tired. My other gripe was the colour palette of the movie, extremely bland and boring. Robbie looks like Harley Quinn, but just can't seem to nail the character, I always feel like she's trying too hard and/or over acting.Beside that, I welcome the freshness for the genre and hope other directors get a chance to be totally unleashed like Gunn was.I will end by saying that even though this was an okay outing, I have no want to see a sequel or any spinoff stories. I hope this is a one and done situation and DC gets back to its better characters.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Well, it's time to wave them goodbye because James Gunn is going to blow them away with this cocktail of dysfunctional individuals. This is what Suicide Squad was always meant to be about: a bunch of psychotic villains shooting, slashing and bashing their way through countless enemies while trying to stay alive. They are a sick bunch that definitely enjoys violence as many have legitimate issues and yet, many are portrayed in a way that made me genuinely feel sad for them.The film gets off to a fast, bloody and unforgiving start as the prologue aims to show that this is no PG 13 kindergarten. Asides from Harley Quinn, who gets an excellent rebranding, every other character is brand new and nearly all are well written brining something unique to the table. What's more, their team ""chemistry"" is portayed very well. While I expected Idris Elba and John Cena to be entertaining, I certainly didn't expect to connect with Ratcatcher who added genuine humanity to this dysfunctional gang.However, the greatest standout for me was King Shark, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. Only James Gunn can make you genuinely care for a walking shark, much like he did with a walking tree in Guardians. The movie was highly unconventional and I barely felt like I was watching a formulaic story. The action was fun and a lot of the humor was natural and hit the spot. Sadly, there were moments where the film could have used some juice to energize the dullness and the narrative needed a few tweaks. Besides that, I was thoroughly entertained by this wild ride and I will be waiting for the sequel if Gunn were to direct it.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

It lacked everything a whacky movie about villains being the heroes needed!The Suicide Squad (2021) hits the nail on the head. From the moment the movie starts, it's fast-paced, violent, and absolutely ridiculous in all the ways that matters. Many of the characters don't make much sense, all are expendable, and the ride the movie takes you on is FUN!Because that's the point, right? Having fun? The Suicide Squad offers emotion: highs and lows. Characters are given real depth that the first movie lacked.I HOPE James Gunn does a sequel and finds a way to step this up a notch. Seeing this makes me think he would be a GREAT choice to direct a Deadpool movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It earns its R with lots of comic book gruesome violence. James Gunn knows how to make comic book movies that's for sure.All the characters are well cast. Idris Elba and John Cena have very good chemistry as rivals. Margot Robbie is excellent again as Harley Quinn, a shame they didn't have Gunn direct Birds of Prey.The movie shines at what it is, a comic book movie. No great political statements being made. We didn't have to put up with anyone's virtue signalling in the run up to release. A movie with a cast and crew that knew what their job was, to entertain, and hit the mark. Too bad Marvel forgot how to do this. Hopefully now that DC remembered with their last couple of releases they won't forget as well.","20 out of 44 found this helpful.

Concise and clear stakes laid out, hilarious character moments, and some shocking bits all coalesced into my grinning and laughing for minutes at a time. The film couldn't maintain this momentum, however, with some character building that teetered on the edge of boring at times.The stand out performance that must be mentioned is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. It was so good that I almost want to go see the commericial failures that were Birds of Prey and the original Suicide Squad just to have more of her.

I love Margot as HQ, but we also get time with the other characters which is also a huge plus. I think my biggest problem with this film is pacing. It feels super long. Another minor complaint is some of the humor doesn't land well. It's just cringey. For the most part tho, it's funny. I really enjoyed how he didn't let humor overshadow the stakes as they rose throughout Act 3. The tone surprised me too. I expected it to be another superficial comic book movie in the oversaturated genre it is becoming, but it is quite original in terms of spectacle and story which is very refreshing. I definitely recommend.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Regardless of David Ayer's original intentions, the 2016 Suicide Squad was unfortunately an absolute mess of a film. It was overly dark-looking, characters were flat and had little to no banter or dynamics between them aside from the occasional forced one-liner. And oh boy, I don't think I need to mention what an embarrassment that take on the Joker was. From hearing that James Gunn was behind the camera and seeing the trailer and promotional material, it seemed that although DC were going in the right direction, it could very easily go wrong. Initially I had my concerns that they were relying solely on James Gunn and the strength of his previous efforts to do a redo and fix their mistakes. However I am glad to say that that was indeed the right decision, because damn was this a blast.Ever since the Dark Knight trilogy, it feels like DC have kept trying to recapture that dark, serious tone without really knowing how to pull it off without Nolan (while also tampering with every other director's vision who tries to attempt it). It's apparent before the opening titles that this is not the case at all with this film, as it seems James Gunn was really given free reign to make it as stylised, bloody and whacky as possible. First off, the cinematography is colourful, vibrant and some of the best I've seen in a modern DC or Marvel movie. The characters are fun and distinct from each other, and play off each other really well throughout. I was pleasantly surprised to see Harley Quinn not being half as annoying as she previously was while still getting plenty of time to shine (including an insane action scene!) The action choreography is bloody and pretty brutal at times, but always has an element of slapstick and is very fun to watch. Speaking of which, the comedy is actually pretty well done and lands most of the time. Sure there's the occasional joke that doesn't work or a silly one-liner but it's much more forgiveable considering the light-hearted and zany tone of the film.Overall, this was basically just a complete blast to watch from start to finish. Doesn't overstay its welcome or try to force you to care about its plot through exposition or shove some message down your throat. The main goal of this film is to ENTERTAIN you, and it does so far better than 85% of comic book movies coming out today. With this, Aquaman and Shazam it really feels like DC is prioritising entertainment in their films again, regardless of how silly or crazy it is. Honestly, continuing a run like this, they could easily overthrow Marvel as the top dog superhero studio that everyone wants to see and talk about (especially seeing Marvel really running low on good ideas after Endgame). If you want to just watch a campy, over-the-top DC movie with an emphasis on 'fun' for 2 hours, this is the movie for you.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

Thankfully it was far better than the first movie but still it was a bit boring at some moments. In addition to this, comedy was too much sometimes and it had as a result to lose the whole meaning of the movie. The direction which was made by James Gunn who is also the writer of it, it was good and he presented very well his main characters and the plot twists gave a different touch in the movie. The interpretations of Margot Robbie who played as Harley Quinn, John Cena who played as Peacemaker and Joel Kinnaman who played as Colonel Rick Flag were very good and the combination of them worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Suicide Squad"" is a nice action movie to watch and far better than ""Suicide Squad"" of 2016 and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure that it will entertain you.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

It wasn't usual DC movie, with dark themes and overpowered heroes. It was a Gunn movie with Marvel colors and DC characters.The movie desperately tries to replicate the success of the ""Guardans of the Galaxy"" with adult rating. But where the latter succeeded big time, the squad had failed in a majority of scenes without actual glue to keep it together.I guess Gunn was right about the superhero genre needed change, but I doubt he will be the one who can achieve this goal.Plot doesn't' make much sense in terms of the world filled up to the brim with overpowered superheroes, they choose the worst possible team to take out gigantic alien creature. Amanda Waller suppose to be a ruthless and brilliant character that chooses the right people for the job, but here she seems ridiculous evil character who is guided by her ego and not strategic calculations. I think that everyone who understands strategy and tactics a little bit would devise a better plan to complete the mission.She sent a decoy team (which suppose to be a shock value for this movie) and actual team who is so underqualified to take down the creature, that it's amazing how they managed to survive almost up until the end.The movie desexualized one of my favorite characters, Harley Quinn, which is simply rolling with a ""woke"" times, but Margot Robbie managed to pull this off.

It was a complete mess of a movie that was easily forgettable and lost in the wind of better superhero films. The Suicide Squad (2021) followed the exact same formula, but this time, stuck the landing.It did a great job of telling the story in a way that led you down the conventional path, only to throw the plot on it's own head and subvert expectations with the unexpected. It also seriously stood out in it's comedy; I'm a stickler when it comes to humor and I'm not easily impressed with most comedy in movies, but this film had me laughing out lead many times. Did I also mention it's brutally violent? From the first moment of the first action sequence I was in complete shock of how graphic some of the fight scenes are. This just further cements in my head that the days of PG-13 rating in superhero movies are numbered.I highly recommend watching The Suicide Squad in theatres. I watched it at home, but this movie is best suited for a packed theater to share in the howls of laughter and echoing booms of violence.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It kind of felt like watching a deadpool to some extent.Unfortunately, the last two-thirds of the movie were not as convincing especially considering the slightly dull narrative around project Starfish.Still a cool movie that I would recommend (just not in a rush to watch again honestly) with powerful action scenes, entertaining new caracters and an overall fine DC anti-heroes blockbuster.In my opinion, it deserves a strong 7/10, not much more.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The real Suicide Squad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7456476/?ref_=tt_urv","MoviePeek","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139667078/?ref_=tt_urv","18 October 2021","Many films of recent memory have failed to live up to their title; not a single deadly arachnid was present in Black Widow and last year's big pandemic release Tenet, failed to feature an individual taking residence in rented accommodation, where month in month out he tossed his income into an endless cash sinkhole with nothing whatsoever to show for it, only for his moss-eyed landlord to arbitrarily decides he wants to turn the residence into a breakfast bar and you have less than a fortnight to find somewhere new to live. The Suicide Squad finally puts an end to the long legacy of disappointing titles and fully delivers on the promise of its name.Directed by James Gunn, who previously directed both installments of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, The Suicide Squad, much like Gunn's previous works features a rag-tag group of misfits who must put their personal differences aside and learn to work together for the greater good, saving the world and possible themselves along the way. However, it cannot be overstated that The Suicide Squad is a very different beast from the Guardians series. For one, DC's flick carries a more mature rating (15 certificate in the UK), enabling The Suicide Squad to get away with a hell of a lot more bad language and dismemberment than Guardians of the Galaxy ever could. But The Suicide Squad's real drawing point is the very concept itself, as it features a large roster of obscure D and F list ""super villains"", any of which could be offed at any moment. And without ruining anything, all I will say is that not everyone makes it to see the credits.Without further ado, let's address the elephant in the room, and by elephant, I of course mean the 2016 release, Suicide Squad. That film was a critical and commercial disappointment, and The Suicide Squad acts as a kind of reboot/sequel/let's just not even think about it too much and make an entertaining movie with this cool premise. The predecessor is in no way necessary viewing in order to enjoy and relish in The Suicide Squad. The film sees a deadly squad formed, known more formally as Task Force X, made up of villains, who are given a mission in exchange for 10 years off their considerable sentences. This time around they are sent off to the remote island of Corto Maltese where they will have to fight their way through an avalanche of gunfire and other nasties, on an appropriately suicidal search and destroy mission.Aside from the return of Harley Quinn, Rick Flag, and Captain Boomerang, the squad is made up of entirely fresh characters. Including the equal bizarre King Shark, a Shark-man thing with a tiny IQ and a huge appetite for human flesh. In addition, there is the eerily terrifying Mongrel, whose backstory is unknown and is probably best left that way. With bulging haunted eyes and the appearance of a Wes Anderson puppet that has been left out in the rain and then run over by a sentient car that has a special hatred for whatever the hell this nightmarish thing is. My point is he's weird, in fact, the whole film is weird, in fact, it's outright strange. The Suicide Squad revels in the weird and offputting flaws and shortcomings of its characters, weaving them in the very themes of the story, leading to a satisfying resolution that will not only leave you satisfying but will also tug at your heartstring in a way that feels earned and cathartic.The film's more adult-orientated rating enables it to up the violence to eleven and delivers some truly shocking and gleefully gory moments that only villainous characters could get away with. These action scenes come thick and fast with every member of the team getting more than enough chance to show off their special set of skills and abilities that earned them a place on Task Force X. Featuring a great balance of fast-paced fisty cuffs and shooty-shooty bang-bang action, these scenes are undoubtedly highlights of the feel and never feel boring or a slog to get through. The opposite is true as they continue to tell the story and illuminate the characters.Make no mistake, however, in addition to the over-the-top violence and spectacle The Suicide Squad also features plenty of jokes and comedic moments that prevent the film from ever taking itself too seriously or forgetting that this whole thing is a very silly affair. And the good news is most of the jokes are winners and elicited a round of raucous laughter from the theatre I saw the film in, not 100% land, but a hell of a lot. The balance of humor works well and never felt exhausting or diminishes the stakes of the film, as can sometimes be the case with some superhero flicks.What more is there to say really? If you like so many were put off by the prospect of another Suicide Squad movie, rest assured that this is, in my opinion quite possibly the more improved sequel I have ever come across... yeah I stand by that. The Suicide Squad is a great comic book movie and without question one of the best movies DC has ever produced, and if they continue on this track, they have a very bright future ahead.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), Bloodsport(Idris Elba), Peacemaker(John Cena) & a host of other crazy convicts from Belle Reve prison, are tasked with an almost impossible mission on the super dangerous island of Corto Maltese.The Suicide Squad is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director James Gunn has given us a hilarious, shocking, action-packed & overall extremely entertaining movie. This film surpasses its 2016 predecessor by leaps & bounds. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are impeccable. Every single character is unforgettable, no matter the screen time they get & this is the highlight of the movie. Margot Robbie is spectacular as Harley Quinn. Idris Elba is outstanding as Bloodsport. John Cena is fantastic as Peacemaker. Sylvester Stallone is adorable as the voice of King Shark. Daniela Melchior is amazing as Ratcatcher 2. David Dastmalchian is excellent as Polka-Dot Man. Joel Kinnaman is awesome as Colonel Rick Flag. Viola Davis is superb as Amanda Waller. Jai Courtney, Nathan Fillion, Flula Borg, Mayling Ng, Pete Davidson, Sean Gunn, Alice Braga, Peter Capaldi & Storm Reid are great as Captain Boomerang, T. D. K., Javelin, Mongal, Blackguard, Weasel, Sol Soria, Thinker & Tyla, respectively. The supporting cast is good, too. The Suicide Squad is a must watch for DC Extended Universe & James Gunn fans. Go & have an absolute.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Firstly, the comedy is the real star of the show and many of the jokes land throughout the film rather than being met with awkward silence. The characters are also brilliantly crafted, not realistic in the slightest, but brilliantly crafted nonetheless. Unlike the first film, the limelight is shared fairly equally between all the cast which means each character's personality is explored properly. The weakness of the film is the plot itself which is slightly too similar to the original for my personal liking. However, i feel that this isn't the focus of the movie and that the comedy and action are the key selling points. If nothing else, this version of the suicide squad is a sensational parody of itself and there are a number of self-deprecating moments throughout the film that show this. I would definitely recommend this film for the comedy if nothing else and if you go in not taking it too seriously you will definitely have a better experience.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's not about heroic deeds, a grand establishment story or the first story of a great trilogy. It's a comic book movie that goes out of it's way to make sure you understand just how ridiculous everything in it is. And that's how it should be, who is supposed to take a character called polka dot man seriously? And yet it does make you take them seriously, giving the team a sense of real camaraderie and genuine moments in between everything. The plot does get a little slow in between and all the jokes don't make you laugh, but it's a wild, exhilarating ride that knows exactly what it is. I want more comic book movies that know what they're doing instead of edgy CGI fight scene filled movies. No shade to the first movie's director, WB executives tore his film apart but hopefully they learned from their mistakes.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Director Ayer took the source material way too serious and delivered a film that was not funny and too dark. But DC realized the idea of Suicide Squad is good enough to give it another try. So they kept some characters (particularly Margot Robbie's delicious Harley Quin and Oscar winner Viola Davis) and hired the mad director that made Guardians of the Galaxy a smash hit: James Gunn. And boy he was the right man for the job! He hits the perfect tone for this film, in the story, its script, the costumes, casting, special effects, music...everything. This is a blockbuster that doesn't take itself serious, fittingly for The Suicide Squad. That is why at the end when we finally meet the bizar big antagonist we fully embrace the ridiculousness of the whole thing. It is a colorful, violently funny and at times absolutely crazy film and therefore a perfect night out in these dark times.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

James Gunn grabbed a group made of of DC No-Names and Suicide Squad staples and mixed them all together in a way that constantly keeps you guessing who will live and who will die. The visuals are truly next level and give your eyes a feast as the characters costumes, powers, and landscape come together in a beautiful medley. Each actor sells their performance at top tier and you can feel how much fun they are having with the script, specifically Daniela Melchior, John Cena and David Dastmalchian as some of the stand-outs. To compliment the cast, James Gunn crafted an epic journey for them to embark upon and fits together the humor, action, and heart in a way that only he can. As a lifelong DC fan, this felt like the comic was being ripped straight onto the screen and I can finally say I am hopeful for the future of the DCU on the big screen.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The conflicting personalities are not only fun, but seem very natural. The movie did a little more than ""he's the fat one, and she loves shopping."" But I don't care about their origin story. Every scene designed to add depth to the characters was pointless. I'm not concerned about so-and-so's mommy issues or why such-and-such is afraid of rats. It's been done in so many movies, and each of their problems are solved in seconds.I appreciate and enjoy the excessive (and sometimes creative) violence in the film. But I'm extremely tired of CGI blood in action movies. It makes every death look artificial.It's a more unpredictable movie, which is definitely a plus. You never know which main character is going to die next. But it's still the same exhausting comic book movie plot as always: a group of kooky superheroes band together to destroy a giant whatever.As much as I loved the banter between the ""heroes,"" a bunch of mismatched super beings setting aside their differences and learning to work together isn't exactly unique (every Avengers movie, every Guardians of the Galaxy movie, etc.).Hollywood doesn't seem to understand that comic book stories can be told in a variety of ways, as long as you stay true to the material. It may sound difficult, but both the DC and Marvel Universe have an immense variety of characters and places to work with. With the right story (an actual story from the comics), you can make a scary movie, a romantic comedy, a crime drama, and so on.Most of the non-action scenes were interesting, but way, way too long. The romance (?) between Harley Quinn and some evil dictator (the villains were very hollow and boring, by the way) went on for hours.And the words between the movie's chapters (there are actual words placed throughout the movie that only the audience can see that are either the title of the chapter or ""8 minutes earlier"") were very irritating.Honestly, most of these problems can be solved by making the movie shorter. A movie like this should not be 2 hours and 13 minutes.I still had a good time.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","James Gunn takes the DCEU to unimaginable heights! [+73%]","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7213312/?ref_=tt_urv","arungeorge13","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tt_urv","10 August 2021","James Gunn knows how to build chemistry between his superhero leads. This is exactly what worked in GOTG and what works in The Suicide Squad. It is THE Suicide Squad movie that we always needed. We have (relatable) anti-hero characters that make sense, have solid motivations, and supported by splendid-looking set-pieces. As one might expect with Gunn, the humor lands - and it mostly lands well. When you have a bunch of anti-heroes coming together for a do-or-die mission, it's not always easy to pen (and stage) scenes that paint them differently from regular superheroes in the DCEU. They have to be subtly contrasting (when it comes to decisions and actions), but never in-your-face. Gunn visualizes it in a manner that few other film-makers could.The ensemble (comprising majorly of Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Daniela Melchior, David Dastmalchian, and Viola Davis - with cameos from Michael Rooker, Jai Courtney, Pete Davidson, and more) is tremendous. Gunn approves of David Ayer's casting choices though he does away with some from the 2016 version albeit in a highly amusing way. The R-rating is fully warranted as human bodies get sliced, diced, and exploded in bizarre ways only someone like Gunn can envision. He's able to seamlessly blend multiple genres into a single film - that in itself is quite an achievement.The pacing, the twists, and the one-liners are all conceived better in 2021 version as opposed to the 2016 version. I even liked how Gunn adds a very comic-book-like effect (using the specific scene's environment) to let viewers know if the timeline / location had suddenly changed. I suppose the only gripe I had was that I wanted to see a little more of what the characters in that explosive (and completely unexpected) opening scene could pull off. They're quickly written off for the film's actual leads to take centerstage, though I absolutely did not see it coming. Idris Elba takes up the space of Will Smith from the 2016 version (but as a different character), and the daddy-daughter chemistry he shares with Rat Catcher 2 (Melchior) was sweetly portrayed. Robbie is once again a knockout!Gunn's love for animals sees The Suicide Squad incorporate a vicious-but-adorable King Shark (with Sly's voiceover), a CGI rat named Sebastian, and the very odd Weasel (voiced by James' brother Sean) into the screenplay. They all feel organic to the film's plot and irresistibly funny at the same time. The antagonists come off as somewhat thin when compared to GOTG, but that thankfully doesn't deter the overall viewing experience. The Suicide Squad is just the kind of gory, flowery, and supremely entertaining mess that you'd associate with a set of characters like this. The writing of each lead character is unique and does the film a lot (I mean A LOT!) of good. The future of DCEU looks bright, thanks to its recent good run.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's too bad if you don't like jokes in the movie, nothing can help. However, with the latter, extreme violence in this movie effectively built up the images and mood of its theme - villains with low moral standard. This was not supposed to be a PG-13 superhero film. Violence did add unpleasant feelings, which made movie more complexed. Despite quite long running time, Gunn successfully made his B-film ideas into ""enjoyable Hollywood action movie with quailities"" as he'd done with his previous marvel series, while delivering vivid and dynamic sceneries. It was a satisfying film overall and definitely worth to watch at the theater.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

From a comparison perspective to the original Suicide Squad, this is hands down the superior version, by miles.What James Gunn does extremely well is balance the characters' emotional journeys to a point where you're actually engrossed in their background origins and want to see a development - which he successfully demonstrates too. This is something that has been missing from a lot of the original DC superheroes, and even though these guys are villains, you still feel affinity towards them.There is a great mix of humour and graphic violence leaving you shocked but entertained. This sets apart DC from Marvel, as the movie does not shy away from blood, gore and gruesome deaths. On a movie based on serial murderers as the main protagonists, this is definitely a necessary part.I think this movie more than holds up in the superhero cineverse today. It's energetic, colourful, beautifully directed and has all-round action that never feels overdone. Every fight scene is unique and dramatic, and leaves you longing for the next one.If you're going into this with disappointment from the precious DC installments, you'll be thoroughly surprised with just how much this movie gets right.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I think they're fun and flashy, and I can turn my mind off for an hour or two. What I do mind is endless reboots of franchises. The fact that I saw three separate Spider-Man reboots in 15 years accentuates my point. Now, I understand that The Suicide Squad (2021) is allegedly a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). Still, it felt more like a reboot since Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) were the only recurring characters. And, let's be honest, they can't cast Harley Quinn with anyone other than Margot Robbie now.For those who thought that having a great director like James Gunn on board would make this film better than its predecessor, you're partly right. Sure, there's a bit of his style of humor that is on display. Still, it's essentially the same plot as the previous iteration in this series, with different characters filling the main roles. Granted, some of the storytelling is better, even if it felt like the character introductions seemed to drag on forever. At least they sped through the whole ""this is what the Suicide Squad is"" spiel in the first 10 minutes.To its credit, The Suicide Squad has a couple of great set pieces (which most well-done superhero films have anyway), even if one of them is an obligatory Harley Quinn sequence. I can also appreciate how this film didn't try too hard to tie into the greater DC Extended Universe since it's clear now that they can't get their act together as Marvel did. In the end, The Suicide Squad is a fun, R-rated superhero romp that improved on its formula with the help of a better director with more creative control.The same plot as five years ago, but with some improvements, I give The Suicide Squad 3.5 stars out of 5.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

David Dastmalchian is so funny and has such a level of charisma that makes you always feel sad for him
Viola Davis is so strong and imposing, and she makes you and gives you chills
John Cena is insanely funny and most important, imposing.The soundtrack sometimes is overused, because sometimes a song comes immediately after the last one.The polithical message it has is so strong, with the squad being basically pigs for slaughter for the government to fight and help the undercover of different war crimes.The action sequences are outstanding, with very well choreographed and viable, yet crude and savage.Conclusion
The Suicide Squad is a very original well done comic book film with outstanding performances, thrilling and strong action sequences, falls a little bit but rises strongly and most important with bold and strong choices by it's filmmaker and his outstanding visions.An action packed yet deep and strong feast and a relief of the COMIC BOOK MOVIE formula.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

with out standing performances from some big names, channeling their given character's egos and expressing their characters in top form.With over the top action and plenty of gore and destruction, the film never fails to entertain, sometimes falling short on its jokes, humor is still in high regards and will keep you from leaving you're seat, along with its edge of the seat suprises.Though the story is yet simple, there's plenty of heart in it, with back stories and shockers to really grip you.Again James Gunn provides us another hit movie and yes with an amazing sound track !!DONT MISS IT !!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

From the moment I found out it was rated R, and James Gunn was attached, I knew it was destined to kick some ass but I was pleasantly surprised of how much effective humour he injected into this blood soaked action sci-fi ""super-hero"" flick.While it might not soar to the heights Guardians of the Galaxy did, Gunn unquestionably benefited from having the chance to let loose and go wild with this R-Rating. Disappointed viewers of the original Suicide Squad film are sure to be pleased with this completely outrageous yet clever and, surprisingly enough, very artistic piece of cinema action.As a bonus; It doesn't feature any distracting agendas and focuses 100% on just delivering pure entertainment. Die-hard fans will also appreciate all the deep cuts, thanks to the many obscure characters that we're given solid parts and cameos in this film.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Some people worry that giving him creative freedom might disappoint others who are more sensitive. But, I think that we should be able to enjoy a film without letting our moral compass get in the way of our enjoyment. The quality of a film depends on whether it achieves its goals and realizes the director's vision. Gunn created a unique and detailed film that balanced humor and action while also creating emotional moments.The cinematography, with its use of colors and contrasts, is reminiscent of a comic book. The performances are great, and the characters are written and executed in a way that makes their demise deeply affecting. Special praise goes to characters like Polka and Sebastian the Wonder Rat. The film is a fantastic black action comedy that is as amusing as its protagonists, despite its moral ambiguity.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Idris Elba's Bloodsport deliver standout performances, injecting charisma and complexity into their characters. The film editing maintains a brisk pace, with sporadic bursts of chaotic action. The film's strength lies in its willingness to embrace the absurdity of its premise, offering moments of gleeful anarchy. However, it falters with uneven character development, occasionally sacrificing depth for humor, and a plot that meanders at times. The music adds a frenetic, punk-rock energy, while the cinematography captures the colorful, comic book-inspired visuals effectively. ""The Suicide Squad"" may not be a game-changer, but it's an okay addition to the DC cinematic universe, offering a dose of irreverent fun for fans of antiheroes and mayhem.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is worth seeing in a theatre if possible, you'll enjoy the action much more and the comedy is great with a crowd.

The team actually feels like a team, the mission is an actual mission that makes sense instead of a haphazard one that just happens because they needed a villain, and there are some solid dialogues between characters. Margot Robbie delivered a speech in the movie that really highlights the growth of Quinn since she was first brought to life in the DCEU.Where the film falls flat to me, are the jokes. They're not necessarily bad, but they feel unnecessarily juvenile at times (in other words: James Gunn is very James Gunn here).Regardless, this was a solid film and everyone got their chance to shine instead of just Robbie and the sharpshooting male lead.

Brilliant.I decided to give this a go due to James Gunn and the great reviews. I expected something fresh like when Guardians Vol 1 first landed, but boy was it disappointing. The first 20 minutes were funny and there were enough plot turns to keep things interesting... but then its just slowed right down, plodding along for the next hour or so. The flair with which the movie started pretty much disappeared and any other stylistic elements become repetitive and overused. AND YET AGAIN theres a final 30 minute sequence of SMASH, BANG, WALLOP that just follows the well worn-out formula of every other movie. For the amount of money and talent used to produce these movies you would hope someone could come up with something slightly more original. It astounds me to see huge box office takings and top reviews movies like these generate. It just means they'll fire another formulaic replica at us again soon.

I was told The Suicide Squad (2021) was better than Suicide Squad (2016). However I found the characters and story in Suicide Squad (2016) more interesting and had greater depth, than The Suicide Squad (2021). Both movies are very similar to each other.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Dont get me wrong its a fun film has some humor lots of blood and gory, but for me it never quite hits the mark.Personally too much of Harley, we've seen that nothing new and the character isnt showing anything new or really developing. John Cena's Peacemaker should have more development it kept you just waiting for that little bit more (maybe cause of the TV series coming out) and never actually got quite there. I felt that for all the characters in general. Ratcatcher 2 back story felt abit not needed really, Polka dot man could have stole the film if the character was better developed. Elba's Bloodsport like all the characters could and should have gone to the next level, but was just missing that spark. The 2 hours and odd minutes was alittle long for me, it felt could have been wrapped up 20 minutes earlier. After a second viewing maybe will feel different, but first impressions was a fun film which with a sequel I beleive will see better development of the characters IF they come back.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film works because it does not hold back on anything. It's a premise that is easy enough to understand and the concept's that are brought up are downright hilarious.It's creative in it's presentation and is completely aware of what it is. It delves deep into the wackiness of it's plot and it's characters as from the beginning action scene, you already have a clear understanding of how everything will be like.An aspect that I really liked in this film is the chemistry between the character's. The first Suicide Squad didn't do any of that so I was really glad they were able to at least give these character's some dynamics with one another. My favourite characters in the film were Bloodsport, Ratcatcher and surprisingly Polka-Dot Man but overall all the characters seemed quite enjoyable.The Suicide Squad exceeded my expectations with James Gunn turning this Action-Comedy hybrid into a thrilling joyride. Needless to say, The Suicide Squad is one of the best films of the year and maybe the best DCEU movie so far.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Fun, Explosive, Gorey - Somewhat Shallow.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7336084/?ref_=tt_urv","abloodynova","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur134460385/?ref_=tt_urv","12 September 2021","First off, I do feel like this movie is certainly a touch overrated, and in similar fashion to Snyder's Justice League, I feel it is primarily due to the simple fact that it's often compared to the previous theatrical iteration from not so long ago - yes, of course it's better in that regards. Being decapitated, I assume, would be better than Suicide Squad (2016). In some ways, it hits some of the same beats and still hit some of the same issues as the 2016 movie. For one, there were a ton of licensed music peppered throughout, although the selection were seemingly more fitting this time. There are a ton of jokes - some works, some don't really works, and others just ruins the pace. It is mostly petty sexual jokes, but eh- I've watched Revenge of The Fallen, I'm practically used to it.The premises are better. Not the best, but again, compared to the whackfest of the 2016 movie, it is more than acceptable. The ultimate villain is surprisingly better, too. Who would've known that a literal space starfish with a zombie army is an ultimately more engaging villain than an ancient demon of sort? Not me.The characters are actually much more interesting as a whole, which is what I think carried this movie beyond its somewhat mediocre core story. You can say goodbye to cringy pimp Joker; Harley is not as in focus anymore here, but thankfully, unlike the last movie, the supporting characters are actually characters instead of super-powered cardboard cutouts; Bloodsport is an interesting character and Idris Elba's performance is stellar, although he practically fills the role of Deadshot; Peacemaker and King Shark/Nanaue were amazing; Polkadot Man was great although severely lacking screen time; and Ratcatcher 2 and Rick Flag were the only pretty somewhat below average character for me - although, they didn't have a ton of screentime and they still have some moments.However, I personally, I think Gunn wanted to focus too much on gore and sending the ""message"" of them being a ""suicide squad"". Lots of characters died, and some are just a total waste of potential unless this is an isolated incident (which with Peacemaker series in the making, probably not), because I'm not even sure God knows the state of the DCEU right now. It's a pretty good movie, a really fun popcorn flick, but even though it does feel like Gunn's Guardians of The Galaxy at times (and it does work better than Whedon's MCU flavouring on Justice League), I feel like it's a bit lacking heart and character compared to, say Guardians 1 or even 2.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In the first few minutes, we're introduced to the characters. They are, in my opinion, better and much more memorable. The best for me is still Harley Quinn, who could not be played by anyone other than the wonderful Margot Robbie. As for the new characters, I quite liked King Shark there. Next up are some excellent action scenes, which are unusually frequent for DC. Aside from being frequent, they are really good and Gunn's hand has made his mark on the CGI here, as Weasel like this reminded me slightly of Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy. Where else the change in the director's chair was felt is without a doubt the music, which was really great and I devoured some scenes because they were epic, although I would add that there's not much play on any epicness here. In fact, the film throws in one joke after another. If you found 2016's Suicide Squad too ""serious"", then I have good news for you because the darker atmosphere has been replaced with a funnier one. To sum it all up. For me, a good film that has rectified the reputation of Suicide Squad and I wouldn't complain at all if there was a sequel that built on this 2021 Suicide Squad and forgot about the 2016 one. I'm not a hater of the older one. In my opinion, it had a darker atmosphere and smaller doses of jokes that I liked about it. But otherwise, the new Suicide Squad offered us much more and I can recommend it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is a lot of murder, brutal murder, but for some reason all of it presented like - haha, so fun. - No, it's not. Especially when Louis Prima sings during a murder sequence. It's just sooo out of place. I don't know what this movie is trying to be. It's an R rated action movie with lots of gore, but at the same time it's acting like a PG13 movie. So weird. The plot? It's there just to be there. Again, it's a PG13 plot. Nothing extraordinary. During the movie I had a thought a couple of times, like 'why am I watching this, again?'. For me, this movie is a waste of time, just like the old one, but this time it's a little bit better, doesn't feel like a complete mess.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He brought us the Suicide Squad movie that we wanted in 2016 to life in 2021. Gunn's humour and story works together amazingly.The R-rating or 15 rating if you are in the UK was needed from the start. A film about villains need to be ultra violent and gory and Gunn gave us that and more.Fight scenes were amazing from start to finish. The actors were superb. Idris Elba was phenomenal as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker was brilliant against Idris. Peter Capaldi was great but deserved some more screen time. You don't often see Doctor Who stars in superhero movies. Polka Dot Man was amazingly funny and a standout character. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was perfect as ever. Viola Davis was fierce, deadly and amazing to watch on screen.Watching this movie in the cinemas in IMAX was an experience I will never forget. A full screen experience for one of DC's best movies to date. I've seen this film twice already and I have to see it again. I loved every minute of the movie and wanted more. Thank you James Gunn for giving us the Suicide Squad movie we needed. Hopefully the success of the movie can get Warner Bros. To go forward with making the David Ayer cut of 2016's Suicide Squad.","20 out of 49 found this helpful.

Aside from the goofiness, this feels like the Snyder cut of the Justice League in quality of storytelling and quality. The movie is just fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. With DC's (mostly) standalone movie universe, the characters and a the movie actually get a chance to shine. To contrast, the last funny Marvel movie was Thor Ragnarök which was one of Marvel's better but still relies on Marvel connections like the Hulk to enhance it. This felt akin to Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy movies which are among Marvels best and (the mainline movies at least) don't rely on the Marvel Universe and its supporting characters to make the viewers interesting. Each of the main players on the Suicide Squad were good and interesting additions to the team, with special props going to John Cena's Peacemaker who was good for a few laughs. All around a very solid superhero with the main knock being that it is probably a little too goofy, and one of the better DC movies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The narrative made sense, cinematography wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either and the characters could be annoying at times were much less annoying than the trailer might have made it seem. I feel there's always a huge rift when the movie switches from not taking itself too seriously and then a few moments later to be completely immersed in the story and cheering the characters on and that overall lessened my enjoyment of the movie.

I liked the 2016 edition more, and I liked ""Birds of prey"" less. One of the things that I liked more in the previous ""Suicide Squad"", and less in ""Birds of Prey"" is the character ""Harley Quinn"". In the 2016 edition I loved how ""Harley"" changed moods, but in ""Birds of Prey"" she just seemed mad. Here I found her somewhat in between, but somewhat better and closer to the 2016 edition.What I dislike about this movie is the immature and stupid humor, the satirical monster, and disposable characters. The humor does not fit a movie like this. Darker humor, more like the dark humor in the ""G. I. Joe"" movies and ""Boss Level"" would fit much better considering the situation the characters are in! I really do not know where to start to write about the monster in this movie except that it would have been more at home in a 50's or 60's monster movie or in a satire movie than in a modern super hero movie. The movie continues the recent trend with killing of established (super) heroes and invent new uninteresting characters that can be disposed of during the movie or later movies. A couple of cringe worthy dialogues was also found time for among the rest of the dialogue...Some positive aspects were some good humor among the bad, very well made sound and visual effects, a relatively good Harley character, and some good action sequences even if it could have been more of them, and they could have been better in my opinion.All in all, a movie that could have been better. But it is still a good movie and worth the watch if you like superhero movies and liked the 2016 edition, even if this one is not as good in my opinion. I rate it to six solid stars, closer to seven, but not quite there...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are great moments, but too sparse to deserve serious accolades. The cast is fine, Robbie again a stand-out. Maybe it was the script I was let down by? I didn't really lol once, at least to any degree I did with Guardians 1 & 2 (although he co-scripted those). But the witty humor the actors in the MCU play out so well, seems Gunn didn't achieve or wasn't even trying for in Squad. I'm not saying I was looking for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in Suicide Squad Take 2, I just thought I'd laugh more is what I'm saying. Which leads me to the R rating, I'm no prude, (and as I stated before, Guardians PG-13, both much funnier), but given the excess freedoms allowed in an R rated film, Gunn kinda went all-out on the gross-out and sacrificed the humor. The story itself, again, it wasn't genius nor was it horrendous. It needed some tweaking & fine tuning and the climax tip-toed (I'd even say crossed) the ""this is borderline stupidity, I mean c'mon"" line. I guess I'd say just don't think about it to much, but you shouldn't have to, even with a film like Suicide Squad. But I will say for a 2 hr 12 min runtime, it def holds your attention, and the few jaw-drop worthy scenes, make the watch worthwhile. In improvement over its predecessor, as a whole you ask?, sure, I'll go along with that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Slowly each scene by scene the main characters grows on the screen.Many characters we love to see more excitely on the screen gets killed off soon as they are introduced without any obvious purpose.Comedic aspects of the film totally failed. The picture moves along with dark humour and later does drag a little at parts. There are few heart touching moments and emotions which were unnecessary. The movie is filled with funny one liner dialogues which never takes too seriously. We can see more blood and violence at the fight scenes throughout the movie. The plot itself was not too genric and fell flat at most times. And also considering the subplot of Luna was both unwanted and bizzare. The use of music in film was impressive and quite astonish at moments.This movie backgrounds as a new superhero unsettling genre rather than a suicide squad film. Comparing to the first part,this film is better in CGI and Action sequences. Other than it is nothing prominent than some unfocused illogical concepts.

Also all characters can die, and at the first 5 minutes of firl we can see first deaths. It has a lot special humour and jokes by mr. Gunn. Secondly, the cast is great. I think, it's the best film for Margo Robbie ar Harley Queen. Idris Elba and John Cena are stars of film. Also it has a lot of cameo of Gunn's friends. Thirdly, the visual effects are awesome, it has a lot blood, brains, and etc. Fourthly, the music is amazing as always.So, it's great superhero movie!P. S. King Shark is my love.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

However, if you've actually taken the time to read a review on imdb for 'The Suicide Squad' then perhaps you still retain some belief in the notions of value - you traditionalist fool.Perhaps you picked up on the nod towards 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living' with the presence of an anthropomorphic shark who questions the morality of its own existence or the character who spews out multi-coloured dots as a form of psychological conflict with his own mother?And, if you've got this far, perhaps I can indulge myself by reminiscing on my youth, when, as an 8-year-old in the late '70s I chose to extend my love of comics to making my own creations, inventing 50 or so superheroes and villains, one of which was a shark-man or man-shark imaginatively called sharkman, I think. I never quite worked out the intricacies of how a shark would operate on land or what his powers might be, but hey - it's a shark - it's cool right?People get ripped in half, stabbed multiple times, their heads explode but at its core this is a film promoting family values, trust, tolerance and the validity of purpose amidst the abyss. Except when it isn't - which is most of the very long run time.Oh, and there's a weasel in the film.

Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) blackmails Bloodsport (Idris Elba) onto the team. Along with Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), and Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the group is tasked with infiltrating the island state of Corto Maltese after a military coup to take out an alien starfish.This is a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt. It makes it hard to build a continuing narrative for the franchise. This is a great stand-alone movie although the franchise is a different question.","35 out of 98 found this helpful.

Well worth watching, Note: 9.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

The second act drags horribly and could have been edited down. The third act is about as generic as you'll find among comic book/heavy sci-fi action movies. But I guess it's about the execution, which was pretty solid.The ""Squad"" ends up being a pared-down version of the 2016 original, so there are fewer characters to keep track of, but even with that, only a couple get anything to really do or build on. Basically, if you're coming for an innovative plot or character development, this isn't your movie. Just have some laughs and maybe make yourself a snack about an hour in.There was also a political element to the ending, which ended up being some clumsy critique of US neocolonialism (I think?). It's best to ignore that given the film's treatment of the locals in of Costa Malta as punchlines, one-dimensional villains, cannon fodder, or other NPC archetypes. But I guess Hollywood has to have its contradictions.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Not as entertaining as Deadpool, but surely not as dull and depressing as the old Suicide Squad.I'm not from the US, so I have no idea about the source material, and I'm neither a Marvel nor DC fan, so there won't be any biased nagging or admiration.I found The Suicide Squad just a little overpraised cause I think that it deserves a solid 7/10.As stated in the title, the best stuff in the film is Harley Quinn's scenes and overall Robbie's performance. I'd still credit other actors, but they weren't given that many scenes to shine. Surprisingly enough, even John Cena, whose acting skills in F9 were questionable, could perform, so I think F9 failure was the director's fault.Some of the situational humor was cool. 99% of the verbal jokes didn't land for me, probably because I'm not young enough or I wasn't watching it under the influence.Overall, great production, good use of an R rating (blood and gore), some memorable music tracks, nice action. The humor, as I've said, was 50 (situational)/50 (actual jokes).I can surely recommend it, especially if you've seen the old one, to compare the two. I also think that Gunn could've produced a great Harley Quinn film, especially after the trash fire known as Birds of Prey.P. S. I'm sorry, David Ayer, but from now on, this Suicide Squad will be known by everyone as ""the good one.""","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was fun, hilarious, crazy, wacky, unapologetically violent, unapologetically raunchy, and surprisingly heartwarming.Despite the director's questionable views on certain things, he did an amazing job. Just like with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2"", he managed to make unknown and seemingly silly looking characters have more depth. He has this incredible ability to make silly and quirky-concept type characters and anthropomorphic characters genuine when it comes to humor and heart.Everyone in the cast did an excellent job. The direction was great. The storyline was solid. The action was unapologetically wild, gruesome, and badass. The visual effects was amazing.However, I did have a few issues with some parts of the story and the characters. I wish that they would've gone more in depth with some of the characters and have a few more moments to breathe a bit.Still, I like that this film embraces the absurdity and insanity of the situation while still having moments of characters reflecting on whether what they're doing is right.I may be rushing a bit but I hope that they make a sequel to this film. I'd like to see more of these characters and what other crazy adventures they go on.8/10.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Joyride!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7203677/?ref_=tt_urv","AhmedSpielberg99","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65630430/?ref_=tt_urv","7 August 2021","Even though it sits somewhere between a sequel and a remake of Ayer's abysmal movie, it's safe to say James Gunn makes no bones here about erasing it from existence. We see people ripped in half, charred, eaten alive, or having their brains blown out, and the titular supervillains included! Needless to say, and regardless of some visceral moments that feel a bit gratuitous, The Suicide Squad earned its rating regarding the violence. Unfortunately, making it rated-R has done it no favours in terms of comedy. For about 20 to 30 minutes in, the humour basically stems from crass and irreverent jokes abound, or watching the members squabbling every now and then as a reminder their mission is bound to fail aborning, and none managed to elicit the faintest chuckles from me. I'm afraid that James Gunn's comedic schtick shows signs of wear and tear here. Like, he's still trotting out that undercutting of an emotional or romantic scene with a comedic or a violent one. That worked to some extent in both volumes of his Guardians but here it seems feigned for it lacks the needed build-up. Sebastian, the waving rat, is a cool wee stroke of comedic genius, though.When the action kicks in, things get astronomically better from that point onwards. Three scenes standout for me in particular. One has Peacemaker (John Cena) and Bloodsport (Idris Elba) - both have similar superpowers - pitting against each other by going on a killing spree. The showdown was a delight to watch, and features excellent, smooth use of rack focus too. In fact, the way the entire sequence is shot is pretty gripping from its beginning, with a tracking shot culminating in one that feels like straight out of a third-person shooter video game. Another scene shows Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie reprising her role, though taking a back seat to the previously mentioned members) fighting guards and beating them to death. It's pleasingly brutal, and, along with another action scene in the last third, features a floral and prismatic aesthetic singular to the character that works very well on both occasions, mirroring the manic pixie maniac she is and never feeling out of place. The third one is an unsparing hand-to-hand combat that ends in a conclusion I didn't see coming, which is one of the few times the movie managed to bring off its ""no one is safe"" approach in a surprising and satisfying result.Aside from Peacemaker and Bloodsport, the rest of the newcomers are a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, we got Ratcatcher 2: a Portuguese girl who can communicate with and controls an army of rats using a certain device. Such a compelling character, and Daniela Melchior who plays it did a fantastic job, notably in a scene that required her to lash out about her past and her father, the original Ratcatcher. Plus, the decision to retain her meekness and endearingness characteristic of her throughout is an excellent one, given similar characters are usually upended over the course of the movie to negate any sense of helplessness one might attach to them. Well, innocence doesn't equal naivety or weakness, and I'm glad someone finally seems to acknowledge that in a superhero (or, for that matter, supervillain) movie. One the other hand, I found King Shark unbearable for the most part. He's a feeble near-facsimile of Groot, only naming everything he sees or comes across instead of repeating his name. Even worse, occasionally it appears there are attempts at making him a new Drax, being dumb and blunt with his interactions. By the end of the movie I was happily surprised at finding myself clearly have been developing connections with each and every character without even knowing. Gunn really has a knack for imbuing his group of misfits of nuances that draw them together almost imperceptibly while also giving each one considerable depth, with a banger of a payoff on the emotional level. We also have a nice score and a soundtrack full of needle drops that are perfectly implemented in the way they accompany their scenes.As far as any qualms I have other than the comedy, I found the time-jumping structure really irritating. Sometimes, it interrupts the momentum and gives way to sub-plots of neither purpose nor interest to me. Other times, it just comes out of left field for the sake of it, and the same can be said about the on-screen text which I'm sure it was intended as a grace note on the scene-to-scene transitions, but it rather comes off as gimmicky and made the film feel patchy at times. Moreover, as admittedly silly as the movie is, the villain being a kaiju-like starfish controlling minds via little starfish facehuggers is something I found a bit hard to swallow, but I'll let that slide since there's a political background surrounding the villainy side, although that one is actually quite perfunctory as well in its exploration. All in all, whilst it left much to be desired as for the humour one expects from the man behind Guardians of the Galaxy films, The Suicide Squad is the gory fun ride I was urgently waiting for to scrub the 2016's one from my memory.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The characters for the most part were decent and everyone gave an adequate performance for the most part. The movie didn't take itself too seriously and was actually pretty funny, which is refreshing in a superhero movie that isn't grounded in reality. Another thing is that it definitely was not afraid to show gore with some really gruesome scenes which made for some pretty awesome death scenes.

Not because I disliked it, but because I really wanted to love it and it never quite got me up there. I enjoyed it, certainly, but for reasons I'll go into, not as much as I'd hoped too.Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) expendable task force are again called in, this time to destroy the scientific research of The Thinker (Peter Capaldi), undertaken on the Island nation of Corto Maltese. Led again by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the team includes Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) and Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian). Though the squad meet heavy resistance, the real issue may come from the fact that not all members of the squad have had the same briefing, and that other agendas come into play.I liked it a lot better than the first one, is probably a good place to start. Made at a different time in Warner Brother's overall plan for what to do with the DC licenses, James Gunn was given creative freedom to make the film that he wanted to make. And I truly believe that this is that, the violence and gore that he learned on the Troma films, mixed with the song choices and the wacky characters. It's a lot more fun, and comedic, but crucially a lot more consistent that David Ayer's film.With the comedy and the visual effects there's much to enjoy, but as I said in my initial paragraph, I never quite got to the stage where I truly loved the film, rather than just liked it. I think the problem is probably the story itself. Rather than a complete plot, it's more like a series of loosely connected scenes, some of which are fun, some of which are less so. It's pretty laggy in the middle, lacking perhaps an action scene in there. Really, more should have been made of the convincing of ""The Thinker"" to be convinced to participate. The ending is pretty strong though, once the bombs have gone off.I'd watch another one, should DC decide to go back to this well again but, again, whilst I thought this was good, the great ""Suicide Squad"" movie remains elusive.","4 out of 23 found this helpful.

There are some logical errors here and there and sometimes the story takes a back seat but I excuse it a little bit because the information and jokes they present more than make up for the slow pacing most of the time. All of the characters are interesting, even the ones that only show up for 5-10 minutes. They may not get a ton of development but their interactions with other characters is great and their dialogue is snappy and funny. The characters that get a lot of development and time on screen are all great. While there are definitely characters I like more than others, I really liked all of them with Harley Quinn, King Shark, Polka Dot Man, and Ratcatcher 2 being standouts. My only minor nitpick is that I do wish Peter Capaldi's Thinker was in the movie more but that's mostly because I adore Capaldi. All of the performances are great even from John Cena which I was kinda surprised about. The humor hits pretty hard a majority of the time. I found myself laughing out loud at points because the film knows how to use its comedy properly. The use of gore is incredibly over the top and I think it makes the film better. It helps it stand out from other hard R superhero gore fest films like Joker and Deadpool because of Gunn's directorial style. The soundtrack here works a million times better than the original film. It works with the scenes and adds to the comedy and tone. The visual effects are pretty great most of the time with some awkward moments here and there and the cinematography was surprisingly great. You could definitely tear apart this movies flaws in terms of story but it doesn't bother me that much. This film is too much fun to hate. I would definitely recommend checking this out as soon as you can.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The main reason for that is the ridiculous campiness of DC characters. That's why all the recent DC movies just can't compare to the MCU in my opinion. That said, this Suicide Squad is the first attempt from DC to fully embrace the ridiculousness of their material and it almost works. If they had gone the extra mile to make it full satire it could have been excellent. As it stands, it is not the worst of DC, but still only mildly entertaining.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie manages to blend action, humour, comic-book spirit, irreverence and emotions all in one big fun experience ! Kudos to WB for getting James Gunn and letting him do a movie that is unlike any other ever seen.I am a massive DC fan, and when the first Suicide Squad was planned I was really expecting something more violent and anarchist than the regular superhero movie. Unfortunately, it didn't happen. But with this one, WB seem to have learn from their mistake and they let a talented and iconoclast director do this one of a kind movie that makes Deadpool look like a soft PG-13 movie next to it.The characters are fun, badass, emotional. It has a lot to do with their actors, who seemed to have had a blast while making this movie. The humour and the pace are on point everytime, the look of the film can best be described as a pop war movie, this is both gritty and fun to watch !Please go see this movie in a theater, not only for the bigger screen but also for the experience of sharing unexpected laughs with an audience, which is the best feeling to have in a movie theater !","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Welcome Return to Form for the Superhero Genre","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7264312/?ref_=tt_urv","unkommon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17071763/?ref_=tt_urv","24 August 2021","Suicide Squad (2016) was a dismal showing, which honestly worked better as a comedy, but encapsulated everything wrong with the genre at the time: shallow popcorn flicks focused on action and gore. The real issue with it was that it tried to present itself as something deeper than a shallow popcorn flick focused on action and gore.What is The Suicide Squad (2021) if not a shallow popcorn flick focused on action and gore? Not much, but it didn't take itself over-seriously, it didn't try to be more than what it presented itself as: a (somewhat) feel-good, action-heavy popcorn flick. It suffered no rebuke and is all the better for it.Since The Dark Knight (2008), superhero films have been playing a balancing act between grit, drama, comedy, and action; the latest few Marvel installments are a perfect distillation of that. Infinity War (2018) and Endgame (2019) were canonically overproduced distillations of a miasma of emotional dogwhistles offering very little in the way of legitimate substance, and, of course, they took themselves way too seriously. The most substantive aspects of The Suicide Squad were the action and the humor. The action was about as tasteful as a Superhero movie can provide - Superhero action in live action films is often spectacle over aesthetic: tawdry displays of CG explosions offering the audience no real emotional or intellectual emoluments; spectacle for the sake of spectacle. The Suicide Squad didn't suffer that pittance and the action sequences were immensely gratifying (following the stylistic blueprint laid out by 300 (2006)). Likewise, the humor put forth in The Suicide Squad was largely tasteful in the face of a rise in edgy humor and toilet humor (Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018) are great examples within the Superhero genre), in fact almost all of the jokes landed and relied mainly on self-relevance.What we, the audience, were ultimately left with was a largely unserious, gut-busting, action-heavy popcorn flick, which is as Superhero films should be, lest they fully commit themselves to the stylistic (as, I imagine, The Batman (2022) will, much like The Dark Knight and Batman Begins (2005) did).As I see it, there are only 2 modes a Superhero movie should earnestly operate: the mode of deep grit and societal statement (a la Watchmen (comics)), or the mode of unabashed entertainment. Blurring those lines leads to shallow, hokey, and outright tropey spectacle-heavy self-parodies. In this sense, Endgame and The Dark Knight Rises (2012) are some of the least accomplished Superhero movies within the genre, while movies like Iron Man (2008), The Dark Knight, The Avengers (2012), Black Panther 2018), and now The Suicide Squad are some of the more accomplished movies within the genre.All-in-all, The Suicide Squad was a revelatory return to form for a genre that as been diluted and disillusioned by the tropes that have been markers for success (surface-level emotional depth, over the top spectacular action, irrelevant tie-ins to modern societal happenings, and shallow characters who exist merely plot devices necessary for said action). It was a very welcomed shallow popcorn flick focused on action and gore. In a sense it took everything that makes Superhero movies stale and unexciting and breathed into them fresh life, it really did itself justice by shamelessly diving headfirst into the pit of tropes and came ahead a stronger piece for of it.7/10, better than most of late, but still a typical Superohero movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The cast were amazing (even though some had very small roles). The writing was amazing. The song choices were sublime. An all round great cinema experience.The violence fits this movie so well. The comedy is done well. The action scenes are *chefs kiss*.I'd say the only thing I can fault in is the villain, Don't get me wrong it was an amazing villain but it was definitely nerfed compared to the comic version.One thing that annoys me is the fact that people who only follow the MCU have come over and have rated this lowly without even watching the movie. As someone who enjoys both Marvel and DC, This movie is definitely an enjoyable experience and is miles better than the 2016 Suicide Squad. This film deserves a lot higher reviews.Hats off to you Mr James Gunn.","14 out of 34 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A surprisingly heartfelt take on the suicide squad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7193603/?ref_=tt_urv","connorjim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur135235628/?ref_=tt_urv","3 August 2021","After seeing the suicide squad I can confidently say that this is my favourite DCEU film to date. I can not truly say it is the BEST DCEU film because it is so different from many other comic book movies and consequently it is difficult to compare against the varying visual, tonal and thematically different movies in the DCEU at present but nonetheless it is my personal favourite. James Gunn was not exaggerating when he said WB gave him license to do whatever he wanted. As a comic book fan Gunn's reverence for the medium as well his ability to present these wacky characters in a believable and grounded way had me giddy with excitement.Visually the film is STUNNING, please go see this on the biggest screen available, knowing that whenever possible Gunn shot this film practically really added to the experience and compared to many current day comic book movies (I love Marvel as much as the next person) the authenticity is felt in every frame. The Panama location is a gorgeous and unique setting that provides a beautiful backdrop to many of the action set pieces and the choice to anchor the film in the tone of a gritty 1970s war movie is an inspired one, the tropical jungle location really reminded me of saving private Ryan. Again i can't overstate how good this film looks, the colour grading is as good as 2019's The Joker which alleviates the flat washed out aesthetic of other DCEU films and sets it apart from Marvel's visually identifiable style. This is without a doubt James Gunns vision for The Suicide Squad and I for one couldn't be happier with how it turned out.Is this James Gunn's best movie ? In my opinion no, but it is his best movie since guardians of the galaxy. That film felt like lightning in a bottle and it's not that the suicide squad falls flat, on the contrary, it's simply that a near perfect film like the first guardians is very rare but The Suicide Squad, amongst other Comic Book fare of recent years, offers a unique experience. That's what this film felt like, an EXPERIENCE, not in the sense that it is monumentally life changing but in the sense that this film is clearly meant to be watched on the big screen and it is clearly in every way a James Gunn film. I mentioned authenticity before but it is absolutely true in the case of this film. It doesn't feel manufactured to meet the needs of WB execs like the 2016 suicide squad and as a result Gunn is able to communicate to the audience a consistent, bold and confident vision that certainly took me on an emotional journey I wasn't expecting. There is a tenderness to the movie and many of its characters which surprised me and elevated the film immensely.Is the film violent? You bet it is ! But the violence isn't overly gratuitous and is very much congruent with the tone of the film, it is called the suicide squad after all. YES the movie's tagline is absolutely true, DONT GET TOO ATTACHED, which when bearing in mind really ups the stakes in this film and heightens the tension, something sorely missing from films like Black Widow. As such the movie keeps you on your feet with shocking moments and creative risks that don't feel cheap and are certainly earned.Lastly I'm going to talk about pace. The film to me felt very fast paced. While there is certainly a lot of action there are really only 3 large action set pieces in the film, one of which is absolutely brilliant involving Harley. As such I felt the action was used sparingly and there wasn't an over reliance on it, instead the frenetically clever editing, snappy dialogue and compelling characters keep the pace moving at a consistently entertaining rate, I was not bored once. Again, the editing and the way the film is cut together is very cool and visually engaging, similar to aspects of Birds of Prey, only done better here. I mentioned compelling characters and this was something I was worried about going in. With a huge roster of suicide squad members I assumed only a few would get developed and much like the maligned 2016 suicide squad the film would suffer for it. Needless to say my concerns were alleviated pretty quickly (I can't really elaborate on this point without spoiling things, James Gunn you madman !) but you definitely know who you are supposed to care about and who should be treated as expendable canon fodder, only it's sad because those same canon fodder are portrayed by such excellent acting talent ! Harley is the best we have ever seen her and Margot Robbie as always does an incredible job, John Cena's chemistry with Idris Elba really worked for me, Idris himself had a few really good emotional scenes with Viola Davis who was mesmerising in this role IMO, and his daughter but otherwise was just a serviceable lead, Polka Dot Man was endearing and will not doubt be a fan favourite and King Shark is the DC's answer to Groot, every time he's on screen you are guaranteed to at least crack a grin.But if you had told me my favourite character in The Suicide Squad would be Ratchatcher 2 I would have laughed at you. I should have reserved judgement because her character is great and without any spoilers some of hers scenes are very emotional. In fact her character epitomises the theme of this movie which I'll let you figure out on your own when you watch the film, it truly made me tear up just a little.Side Note the third act is absolutely brilliant. That is all.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

Some gore and explosions here and there. Then put a charismatic protagonist to the mix (elba), as well as a wrestler, a character that can only speak a few words and some attractive females and toss some elements from the DC Extended Universe into the mix. Does this sound familiar to you?Well and then, there you go.Don't get me wrong.The movie itself is entertaining but there is nothing outstanding about it and it feels too close to Gunn's Guardians series although Suicide Squad is set in a completely different universe and franchise.Just turn off your brain and try to enjoy the 2h ride...","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Nevertheless, with a well put together cast, the film does an effective job in delivering an ample film. Each character is wacky enough to portray a silly product.

Without spoilers and with rather a direct cut to the chase I must say - James Gunn delivered, along with the humorous, yet dedicated cast and crew.With an R rating, viewers can expect action sequences with unfiltered gore - more like flaunted, actually. Don't bother keeping track of the f-bombs either. For a movie with this type of source material and potential, the execution and balance of explicit material was executed nearly to perfection; Although, in my humble opinion, some liberties were taken to an extreme in a few instances at least. Nonetheless, The Suicide Squad is definitely a must-watch for DC fans and superhero fans in general that are of the appropriate age and mindset.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Everything that happens is patently ridiculous, but at the same time, coherent with the self-aware atmosphere of the film. More than telling a story, it's all about triggering the interaction between characters and connecting the highest possible number of iconic scenes.However, while the visuals, direction, and editing are constantly exuberant and inventive, many verbal jokes fell flat. The themes and characters are also too dangerously close to Gunn's works with Marvel. Same outcasts with a golden heart, same structure of the team, same cinematography, etc. The only significant differences are the uncontrolled use of gore and the fact that almost no character is immune to collateral damages. With its own personality, ""The Suicide Squad"" could actually become the better, more mature alternative to the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but for now, Gunn is still playing it safe, sticking to an already proven successful formula.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It ia weird, twisted, nasty, bloody, gory, and so so funny. The film opens with fantastic fake out that came from the Deadpool playbook, and it genuinely surprised me. It cleverly introduces a host of new characters, reboots the series, and emphasizes how dangerous it is to be a part of the Suicide Squad. It also reminds you how badass and ruthless Viola Davis's Amanda Waller is, as well as how badass and deranged is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. The latter gets her own side adventure, which gives her the opportunity to have her own short fim within the film, and Robbie proves all over again why Harley Quinn is one of the best DC characters of recent memory.The core of the newcomers squad members consists of a mish-mash of anti-heroes led by a suave Idris Elba as Bloodsport. He is the reluctant leader of the bunch, mirrored by a squad member with similar skills (Peacemaker played by John Cena) who is a spoof of the All-American G. I. Joe type. Ratcather 2, Polka-dot Man, and King Shark round up the Suicide Squad, which is newly branded as ""Task Force X"" (because Suicide Squad is apparently bad for morale), and you could not ask for weirder, more haphazardly assembled yet wonderful team than this one. The mission they are coerced into doing is to destroy Jötunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory in the South American island nation of Corto Maltese. From their craziness ensues in the bloodiest, most visually creative and playful way. The squad's main mission is put on hold at first to rescue Colonel Flag (returning player Joel Kinnaman), which leads to another mission to rescue captured Harley Quinn, and both rescue missions, we found out, are elaborate jokes by writer/director's James Gunn that have hilarious punchlines. The film keeps reinventing itself and changing gear from one moment to another, which made the 2hr+ runtime zips away without a dull moment.I came to this film fearing that there is too much high praise heaped at it, and that it could not possibly live up to the hype, only to be pleasantly surprised of how much I genuinely loved it. The Suicide Squad is cinematic escapism in the most wonderful way possible, and I can't wait to rewatch it again and again.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

There's a lot to respect here as Warner Brothers seem to slowly be learning their lesson and letting filmmakers do what they were hired to do. Apart from just adding the ""the"" in the title, Gunn takes a celebratory stance towards the craziness of this concept where supervillains are tasked with performing missions for the U. S. government in return for not having their heads blown off.Gunn still shoots a low percentage with the jokes, many of which are retreaded several times to lesser effect. And the whole thing dissolves into a CGI mess in the third act. Still, this DC property was much more memorable than what Marvel was able to offer.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Random emotional dialogue doesn't actually build a connection. The story is odd at best and convoluted at worst. The tone is all over the place, and the movie is dotted with wtf moments. Like when Harley Quinn jumps 10ft in the air onto a rooftop. It's not important, it shouldn't be a big deal, but it leaves you saying ""wtf was that?"" and pulls you right out of the scene. If you want to see a James Gunn movie about a rag tag group of misfits and antiheroes, see the far far far superior Guardians of the Galaxy.

Officially they are Task Force X; unofficially they are The Suicide Squad. Their mission will be to go to the fictional South American island nation of Corto Maltese and destroy an experimental facility. It was considered acceptable when run by the previous US-friendly regime but following a coup is considered a menace to the world.One team, containing Harley Quinn, is led by Col Rick Flag, the other by super-assassin Bloodsport. Things don't get off to a good start as the first team is ambushed and Harley is captured. Bloodsport's squad has a better time but things still aren't easy. They will have to face an army before they get to their target and once there they will face a disturbing monster.I didn't dislike the original 'Suicide Squad'; really enjoyed 'Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)' and I'm glad to say I really enjoyed this too. The plot is basically 'The Dirty Dozen' with superpowers... the threat even has Nazi origins. The film delivers plenty of exciting action, much of it fairly violent, as well as a good number of laughs. The characters are fun and have a good variety of powers; some pretty cool others delightfully silly. It soon becomes obvious that not everybody will be returning from the mission; this adds a good sense of jeopardy to proceedings. The cast is impressive; most obviously Margot Robbie, as Harley, who steals just about every scene she is in and Idris Elba who is solid as the more serious Bloodsport. It must be said that the monster faced at the end is ridiculous; I thought enjoyably so but can understand others thinking it is just too silly. Overall I enjoyed this film; certainly much more than the more po-faced superhero movies that seem so ubiquitous these days. I'd certainly recommend it.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Taking this into account, and having seen the 2016 Ayer's version which left me disappointed, this movie did the exact right thing to revive some amount of hope for superhero movies in general.And in my eyes it all came down to warner throwing some money at James Gunn and letting him lose. You really feel that this movie crosses some lines you wouldnt expect such a ""big"" movie to cross. And this is good! This makes it such a ride. Its some fresh air, finally.Although I have to add that this movie isnt for everyone. This movie doesnt reinvent the wheel regarding superheroes. This movie is gory, has a stupid high death count and has some jokes in it some can laugh about and some cant.Also this movie isnt flawless either. Some script decisions are seen from a mile away and some characters are pretty bland and one-dimensional (John Cenas character for example). I probably wouldve enjoyed more exposition at the beginning and less of the action right at the start. Also, the emotional scene at the end with the rat-woman and her father doesnt really clicked with me right inbetween that funny and nasty gore.Its a movie where you kinda already know what you're getting beforehand. And youre getting 132 minutes of pure entertainment. But in 5 years it will be not an important film anymore i'm pretty sure.Also, how good was john cena acting? Thats probably the thing I was most amazed by.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I went in because of my love for the 80s John Ostrander Suicide Squad comics, Gail Simone's Secret Six and the Kot Suicide Squad run. Those 3 actors really were incredible charming in their roles. If we get a sequel I wish to see more Waller, espionage and politics, though. Ostrander's run felt like Bourne Identity at times. King Shark is superior to Groot, Rocket and Drax IMHO. Sly did a great job with a character who is not as ridiculous as he should be. Maybe its about Gunn's writing... all the characters felt like they were more interesting than you'd expect and had satisfying arcs. The best DC movie since 2008's Dark Knight. Toning down the violence might be an idea... really surprising with how much they got away with.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

James Gunn's direction was good but not great.... He was having much freedom in this one as it's rated R unlike Marvel's guardians of the galaxy and I would say he could have done much better.....Climax was also too weak for me......

James Gunn manages to create a roster of one-off, stupid villains into deep, interesting and varied characters. Peacemaker and Bloodsport seem very similar at the start but he adapts them to being extremely contrasting. Each character feels like they have a purpose and reason to be in the film. The pacing is some of the best paces for a film I have seen. Every joke lands throughout the film and I think the comedy is brilliant. The cast is incredible, every actor plays their role perfectly and I wouldn't see many others playing their characters. Daniel Melchior is the stand out who pulls of a brilliant representation of Ratcatcher.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's hard to sit through this and I would have turned it off if not for Margot Robbie being in it. This movie is just plain bad. The first suicide squad movie lacked charm but again it had Margot Robbie so I stomached it. This is just a truly bad super hero comedy. DC wonders why it's movies don't do as well it's because they're movies are terrible. Hire some actual comedic writers to help with the script. It's like bad joke after bad joke after bad joke.I'm short some words here so I'll just say if it wasn't for Margot Robbie no one would have watched this film and since they replaced her the new Joker films good luck getting me to watch them.

On top of this weirdness the trailer (at least for someone not intimately familiar with the periphery of DC comics) made it look like they were unimaginatively replacing a Will Smith sharp shooter character with an Idris Elba sharpshooter character and a cannibalistic humanoid crocodile with a cannibalistic humanoid shark which even further seemed to telegraph a film more feckless than the first.And then (whether because of the perceptions these marketing decision induced or covid or both or whatever) it was a box office bomb which further convinced me that it would be even more forgettable than its predecessor.So I only finally watched in 2023 and to my delight found out it was a comic book superhero gem of a movie!If ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Deadpool"" are 10/10s for there respective sub-sub-genres then the first 2/3s of this movie is the ""Deadpool"" of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" with the majority of every scene, frame and line being hilarious or carnage or both while having a good dose heart that doesn't only adds without getting in the way or weighing the movie down.The last 1/3 retains a lot of its humor while getting predictably more serious but also more dark and tragic with a fair rendition ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier""'s play of what patriotism truly means.My only critique would be that the dark and tragic go a little bit too far and therefore required a transition that would hard to make smooth enough to keep the movie from feeling a little disjointed.But this also makes the movie unexpectedly impactful and work better as a one-off and if you ignore the throw away post-credit scene it is a perfect stand-alone movie.So pretend box office smash ""Suicide Squad"" never existed and watch ""The Suicide Squad"" the next time you need an R rated super hero comedy that holds together. It's on Netflix Now!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

In fact, I actually liked it when it came out. But my opinion is not the consensus. In fact, I was surprised they were bothering with a sequel at all. But I was excited to hear that James Gunn was going to direct it. And thank god it was him.James Gunn does the impossible. Step 1) makes a standalone sequel to the original if much maligned Suicide Squad. Step 2) Make it good. Step 3) But also make it one of the most gloriously sadistic and insane superhero movies ever.Like the first Suicide Squad, the movie's set-up is basically The Dirty Dozen except with DC-list supervillains so disposable that not even the Justice League would bother fighting them. Yet James Gunn finds a way to make even the weirdest and silliest superpowers a formidable threat in Suicide Squad 2.A pretty girl can summon an army of rats. A frail nerdy man can launch deadly polka dots from his own body. There is a half-man half shark monster eating people and tearing them limb from limb. And of course Harley Quinn played to perfection by Margot Robbie. There are various other DC villains who make appearances but don't expect them to last that long.A running gag in the movie is how little value is placed on any form of sentient life at all in this universe. Especially birds. What James Gunn does that is clever and the extra mile compared to other 'men on a mission' movies is this. This becomes a central theme in the script and even a motivation for a surprise boss villain.The huge ensemble cast all sell their part. As mentioned before, Margot Robbie is probably at her best yet as the unpredictable Harley Quinn. Idris Elba shows true leading man chops as the roguish mercenary Bloodsport. John Cena is appropriately obnoxious as the jingoistic Peacemaker. A welcome improvement is Joel Kinnamen as the idealistic if unprepared Rick Flagg. Daniela Melchior is endearing as the empathetic if eccentric thief known as Ratcatcher.Viola Davis reprises her role as the government spook Amanda Waller. Her steely perfomance cements Amanda Waller as one of superhero cinema's most easily love-to-hate antagonists. Doctor Who alumni Peter Capaldi is having a lot of fun as the evil scientist known as the Thinker. Although I did hope he was more of a major foe, his role is really just to update the characters on the situation.The way that James Gunn directs the action scenes is outstanding. It improves the frenetic energy and imagination Gunn already displayed with the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. And just a reminder about the R rating that this is James Gunn unleashed. This movie is perhaps the most graphic comic book movie since Sin City. A lazy comparison would be to put it next to the Deadpool movies. But Suicide Squad 2 is even more mean-spirited and violent with its action and the black comedy.And while it is fun seeing these characters act so mean to each other, that's not all there is. The movie actually does have a heart as hard edged as it gets most of the time. Between the carnage that unfolds and the brutal sense of humor that James Gunn brings to the movie, there are moments that are actually touching.Suicide Squad 2 is a reminder that sometimes Warner Brothers just needs to takes chances with its DC characters and trusts the filmmaker. They can have a genuine crowd-pleasing thrill ride on their hands.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The Suicide Squad (2021) seems to be the perfect outlet for James Gunn to spread his wings and create a universe that respects what came before yet strays so far away from its predecessor, Suicide Squad (2016). This movie succeeds in almost every aspect it sets out to accomplish and it manages to course correct the trainwreck that was Suicide Squad (2016) by keeping what worked (Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller) and bringing in a whole new set of weird and creative characters. On paper this movie should not work with characters like Nanaue/King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), Polka-Dot Man (Da-vid Dastmalchian) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) just to name a few, but James Gunn has once again done what he did with Guardians of the Galaxy and taken these incredibly weird, some of them non-human and generally unknown characters and given them heart, humanity and a very clear character arc, which to me is the very biggest strength of the movie. It should also be mentioned that this might be one of the funniest and most entertaining movies I have seen in the cinema, period.Plot -Without getting into spoilers, I can say that I found the plot almost irrelevant to the enjoyment of the movie, as it just serves as a tool to showcase this amazing ensemble cast and their characters individual story arcs, which I will get into below. If I had to give some criticism to the movie it would probably be the simplicity of the plot and the way that the Harley Quinn story felt very separate to the rest of the film. But then again it can be argued that even though the events in the film takes place over short period and the story doesn't seem to go anywhere before the last 20-30 minutes, there is creative use of flashbacks and most importantly the screen time is used to showcase this group of complex characters coming together and evolving with each individual getting their own time in the spotlight. I also have to comment on the villain story where we were given 2 sets of villains one of them took up most of the movie on the villain side and I found their story a bit too ""one note"" and their motivation seemed to be the classic ""world domination"" that we have seen a thousand times before. I did however like the way their story concluded as I found it refreshing. Without getting into spoiler territory I can say that the second villain was way more fleshed out and had a very satisfying story arc.Characters -It seems as though James Gunn wanted to challenge himself in taking one overly ""comic-book"" character after the next with the intention of giving them a carefully thought-out background and setting them in a situation where they would have to face their demons and grow. I can literally highlight every single character from this movie and talk in depth about how impressed I was with the way they were brought to life. But if I had to highlight a few that impressed me the most, it would definitely be characters like Ratcatcher 2, whom I even forgot was in the movie, as she actually functioned as the heart of the movie and was the central character in almost every major story moment or scene. The way James Gunn gave her a heartfelt and truly inspiring backstory to the way she ends up in the movie is truly amazing. There are also characters like King Shark whom I thought would only be there to serve as a deliverer of punchlines and r-rated action scenes and yet they managed to make him one of the movies most endearing characters and it makes you feel sorry for this mass-murdering human-like shark creature...amazing. But then again in 2014 James Gunn made me cry (spoilers for Guardians of the Galaxy) over the sacrifice of a humanoid tree, so it shouldn't surprise me.Conclusion -I don't think I would change a single frame of this movie and it definitely finds itself on my top 10 favorite comic book movies ever. I'm going to give it an 8,5/10. If only the secondary villains were more fleshed out, it would probably have been higher and Harley Quinn's story arc did sometimes feel like a totally different movie, though one that admittedly entertained me. I am truly excited to see the next James Gunn project with Guardians of the Galaxy: Holiday Special and 3. I also hope to see more R-rated stuff from him in the future.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's an improvement over the first one, but the whole premise is never going to amount to anything more, unless you care for these characters, and frankly both movies missed that point a lot.A lot of it is maybe down to really phoned in performances from lead actors, but the points where they made it so the characters had backgrounds and you were supposed to fill something for them just didn't work at all. I don't know, still can't decide between if that was a parody, or just really rushed script.In cinemas it should be a fun ride, or watching at home with your buds and a few beers, but don't expect anything more.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Loved the chemistry between Idris Elba and John Cena. Cena is really trying to establish himself as an actor and his efforts bear much better fruit here, than in F9 Saga. Margot is GORGEOUS than ever, and really shines on her own, more so than her ""solo"" film. Goes to show that an actor is only as good as the script that they get.Great watch for a fun weekend.

There are good moments in this movie like the competition between Idris Elba's Bloodsport and John Cena's Peacemaker but any humor or heart is short lived in this tonal tornado.So many DC characters die in this movie for no reason eliminating their potential to be in future DC films. A lot of the humor feels forced and cringey and Margot Robbie's NY/Gotham accent is hit or miss. There's a lot of Boston in her accent this time around.If you like over the top gore and enjoyed GoTG you'll probably like this movie. I think Gunn will do well with the Peacemaker series but this film was just too many weird ideas tossed into a blender and thrown into audiences faces. With one core character and more focus I think Gunn & Cena will fair much better than this movie did.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I reckon some may have issues with his work - and that is fine. We all have different tastes. Him going comedy (though very dark and very violent and so many other things that certain people may call inappropriate) - is quite different from what Zac Snyder and DC stood for mostly. But succesful DC movies (at least at the box office) had quite a lot of fun included too - like Shazam to name another.But this is not that - we also have the previous Suicide Squad ... which while not really referred to, is in this too. Because you have some of the former members here. But of course a lot of new people too. The characters are as crazy as they can be - and the movie is as bloody as it is allowed too - it also has some nudity in it. The US has the R rating for movies like this ... UK and Germany went for the 15 and 16 rating respectively ... which some may find a bit low. That will depend on your sensibilities ... just be aware that there is a lot of gore, blood and other ""mature"" things depicted.The movie is not taking any prisoners (almost in a literal sense) and you never know who is going to bite the dust/bullet ... maybe even a member that you like a lot ... not to mention that morals are not really an issue for most members to say the least. Stick for an extra scene after the credits ... it does set up a future project (maybe it's already in the past when you read this)","24 out of 71 found this helpful.

You are gonna risk the entire mission for a mental defective dressed as a court jester?Bloodsport: This coming from a guy that wears a toilet seat on his head?""Astounding Visuals, Ravishing Gore, Some Charming Characters, and oodles of Quirky Humour; that's how I would like to recapitulate my personal impression. Doubters were mulling over with Skepticism when the Studio (WB) announced this sequel a couple of years back. Primarily because they were worried about whether James Gunn was the pertinent choice to take over this endeavor. As it turns out, Warner Bros. Did make a good call after all!This is an indisputable improvement over the previous outing. For instance, greater consistency in Writing, considerably more effective management of the characters; especially for such a large group of unusual personalities. On top of that; excellent work on Humour or for that matter, the Dialogues; which are exceptionally well-put. The constant back-and-forth between Peacemaker & Bloodsport was something I was pleased to witness.Regarding its Artistic Supervision or to simply put the overall look & feel of it; I am happy to report that 'The Suicide Squad' has been nothing but a feast for the eyes. Even though this was well expected of Mr. Gunn since his earlier works (Guardians of the Galaxy) speak so highly of his competencies as a visionary Director who can handle such large-scale stuff quite effortlessly!Now when it comes to characterization; again James Gunn has this unique trait for which he likes to present ample opportunities to every major lead so that those characters can get their very own moments to shine. As can be seen here, thus; Idris Elba, Margot Robbie, John Cena, Daniela Melchior; everybody got equal chances to showcase their Power and Abilities and so they did.However, I still refrain from calling this a flawless execution; as I found its Non-linear narration to be a bit uneventful at times. Besides, the stakes never felt high enough. Part of the reason is the vague portrayal of our Antagonists or in other words; an alleged lack of a proper one. I don't know why but the final confrontation against Starro appears to be heavily rushed as if the writers were in some sort of hurry. I have to say, the final fight was far from anything satisfactory.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It seems that this movie struggled with the genre it belonged to and the issues with David Ayer's version were actually exacerbated in this. I do think it was very well shot and it was creative, however, I think the writing was a let down. The humour did not work in this film, the jokes fell flat and they did not have the intended effect which is why it feels like a film struck between two genres. It would be best described as an action comedy, however, considering the comedic aspect of the film failed, what we were left with was a mediocre action film. What made Guardians successful was the ability to combine the humour and the action in an organic way but it seems that James Gunn failed in this movie to do that.The characters were written quite well and they were likeable which was one aspect that I enjoyed and they had their own identity which shined through. The characters were not forgettable like in 2016 and it did make the film bearable. The plot itself was quite generic and it felt that nothing was at stake. While this is perhaps the intent, it did not make the audience care much for what was going on.I do think the subplot of Luna was both bizzare and unnecessary. It added nothing of value, neither in the story nor character development. Perhaps it did add a bit for Harley but it felt very out of place.The background of a corrupt south American regime did seem too heavy and it felt like it was shoehorned in by the US government to reinforce how being against the US government is evil and those who oppose the US foreign policy are malicious people with ulterior motives.Once all these elements are combined, it really is quite an incoherent film. The humour and action do not fit together organically, the jokes fall flat, the idea of a corrupt regime did not fit well with the genre, it was like combining two different films, nothing felt at stake, and the way the villain was defeated felt childish and odd.It's mediocre in my opinion. Not a lot more than that.","290 out of 651 found this helpful.

Sincerely crafted and affectionately told, The Suicide Squad is a big explosion of heart, warmth & unabashed lunacy that takes its bonkers premise & idiosyncratic squad, and simply runs with it.Written & directed by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy), his distinct approach, different tone & complete structural overhaul does take some time to get accustomed to, plus the first act feels all over the place but once the main plot kicks into action, everything starts aligning into order and the ride becomes more breezy & enjoyable. Gunn doesn't hold back here at all and lets loose his singular vision and no matter how ludicrous the characters seem, he's able to bestow them with a heart & personality that strikes a chord with viewers.The film radiates nothing but pure unadulterated joy with its ridiculous set pieces, outlandish action, eccentric characters, and their dynamic & interplay. Its attempts at humour are more a hit than miss and its emotional beats brim with an authenticity that shines through. Margot Robbie stands out with ease as Harley Quinn, John Cena surprises all with a brilliant input as Peacemaker, Daniela Melchior's lazy rendition of Ratcatcher 2 leaves its own mark, and King Shark is the soul of this band of misfits. The violence in store is gleefully over-the-top and it's glorious to watch.Overall, The Suicide Squad not only erases the awful memory of its eyesore of a predecessor but is also the finest film in the DCEU by far. A riotous, rapturous & rambunctious delight that presents James Gunn at the top of his game & firing on all cylinders, the film comes stamped with his signature wit & endless creativity all over its frames and despite the light, colourful & vibrant treatment, this latest entry undoubtedly belongs to the DC family. A wild, entertaining & immensely satisfying blockbuster fare that's livelier, funnier & better than everything DCEU to date, James Gunn's latest is an absolute blast.","3 out of 25 found this helpful.

It could be my expectations were too high or my mood, but it felt underwhelming.The action was decent and chemistry was top notch. I have to say this is the best Harley i've seen. She is a tad bit toned down and has more layers, if that makes sense. Bloodsport, polk-a-dot man, King Shark, and Rick Flag were all pretty cool that had nice moments.I just thought it was a bit long, like the pacing was a bit off. Also, the humour was a tad bit overboard. It felt like there was a new joke every minute. Some hit the mark, but a fair amount didn't.I will most likely be watching this again soon now that I know what to expect. I can see this moving up to an 8, but not much more than that.

Idris Elba and John Cena were great (especially when interacting with each other) and Margot Robbie was as entertaining as usual. In fact, the entire Suicide Squad were entertaining characters, at least after given some time to shine.Unfortunately, the movie is a bit dull when it doesn't focus on the aforementioned aspects. As per usual, the story is basically a vehicle to deliver action set pieces and jokes, so it offers little in and of itself. Almost every significant character outside of the Suicide Squad is uninteresting, and there's not a particularly interesting villain.The first half or so of the movie really falls pretty flat. The start of movie is
far less interesting than I'd want from something trying to convince you to stick with it for 2 hours (with only the beach scene being particularly good), Elba and Cena feel like they don't get enough dialogue (even if they likely have the most), and Robbie plays a relatively minor role.Had the movie just been a series of high-octane action scenes filled with graphic violence followed by comedic downtime scenes, it probably could have reached an 8/10, but there was far too much uninteresting downtime with little-to-no humour to help, and it took half the movie for it to really find its footing.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

While it's a vast improvement over the first film, this sequel (yes, it is a sequel) indulges in its R rating in the spirit of maximizing all the fun and the nasty but falls short of delivering deeper emotional resonance like the first Guardians of the Galaxy.James Gunn puts a lot of goodies in The Suicide Squad and it is an assault on the senses. At times, it feels like watching Gunn bashing his action figures together. To think how much money was spent making a perverse violent comedy off of C-list comic book characters is astounding. The film is quite niche.Everyone is having a blast. The cast is all reveling in the central gag that any character could die at any moment. The throwaway one-off nature sets the actors free to be as outrageous as they want with their characters. There's no pressure of holding back cause they need to carry the character across a multi-picture franchise.Idris Elba's Bloodsport, whose character and backstory are glaringly similar to Will Smith's Deadshot from the first film, is a charismatic lead and makes a great straight man to all the other crazier characters. Elba shares a hilarious macho rivalry with John Cena's Peacemaker, a murderous version of Captain America. It's the perfect part for Cena as it combines an action hero element and straight-faced comedy.Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and understands the part inside out. In a sequence devoted to developing Harley, Robbie shows Harley's consciousness of her madness in true scenery chewing fashion. If someone is 100% insane, they're home-free. But being aware of that insanity implies that there is trauma lurking underneath. It's too bad Harley hasn't been consistently developed over three films. I still deeply crave a Joker and Harley Quinn solo movie.The standouts were the lesser-known characters: Ratcatcher 2, Polka Dot Man, and King Shark. Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 is quite charming as the team's empath and the heart of the team. I hope to see her in other films. David Dastmalchian's Polka Dot Man, a failed experimental subject with mommy issues, was tragically funny. King Shark, a dim-witted man-eating shark voiced by Sylvester Stallone, was endearing, adorable, and steals every scene.There's a lot of humor in various tones. It's ironic how Gunn was temporarily canceled for his offensive tweets and yet it is the same twisted humor (albeit toned down and refined) that people are raving at now. Gunn designs entire setpieces as jokes and these gags were laugh-out-loud funny. The verbal banter between the team started funny but as the movie went on, most of the bickering didn't land and felt dragging.By the third act, I was lost wondering about what the film's theme was and it just didn't all gather together for me. The character elements were all in place but they worked better as individual pieces than as the sum of its parts. I wanted to feel more for these characters.With both Suicide Squad films, I just don't fully buy the central conceit of these supervillains becoming a family over the course of one mission together. Yes, they're criminals doing a dangerous mission to cut down sentence time. But, what does accomplishing the mission ultimately mean?The movie did feel long as I tired out from sensory overload watching it on an IMAX screen. I look forward to rewatching it on a smaller screen.Despite the warm critical reception, it is unfortunate to see The Suicide Squad perform poorly at the box office. I can see how people disconnected with the Suicide Squad property and this sequel certainly deserves better and in some ways, I wish this was the first Suicide Squad film in 2016.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Bloodsport (Idris Alba): ""We find out any information you've given us is false, you die!""
Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie): ""We find out you have personalized license plates, you die!""Woven into the above quote is the heart of the ingenious superhero satire, The Suicide Squad. The adventure is a relentlessly action-oriented and bloody superhero/supervillain mashup with an equal measure of droll humor like ""personalized plates."" This Keystone-Cops band of doomed mercenaries is working to overthrow the dictatorship of a small South American island, Carto Maltese.The first act, reminiscent of the comic-book derived Suicide Squad but with more bite, is non-stop joking in the spirit of Deadpool, possibly wittier. The usual introduction of the talented but eccentric band is rife with guffaw jokes and satire.Sylvester Stallone stands out as the mumbling King Shark, who eats humans, as apt a metaphor for invading armies as you could want. Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) carries the physical weight of a loathed herd of rats and the metaphoric importance of what an invading army is thought to be. The wildly dangerous Weasel (Sean Gunn) reminds us that a Groot-type will often show up in this genre but maybe more terrifying and right from hell.While the second act drags as in most superhero movies, the third, with the struggle to overtake a malignant tower housing a monster alien starfish, is chockful of jokes again and just as importantly the themes of a vulnerable population and rise of the meek. With the action at peak, writer/director James Gunn still lards the story with wit.The Suicide Squad, be it a sequel or a remake (arguable for either descriptor), is a smart takeoff on the genre for those tired of the more serious Marvel series.

Suicide Squad was an awful movie that bought a soundtrack Oscar. Could adding 'The' really turn around such a train wreck?Answer: Kinda?'The' is a better movie, no question about it. There's more interest in these characters all around, from what they do to who they are. The styling works here much more than it did in the first Squad flick, the bright colors and over the top antics make this feel much more fun than the dower and bleak nonsense of the first. It's still off though and I think the editing team needed to be reigned in a bit because they go really over the top on some of the title cards and hyperstylizing.It's a perfect background movie though. There's enough crazy here that anytime you glance at the screen there's likely something interesting going on. I just don't think the product, as a whole, has much substance to it but what it lacks in substance it counters with flash. There's a definite sense of fun here that gives it a marked leg up on it's predecessor.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Comically Cinematic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7199781/?ref_=tt_urv","Cineanalyst","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1888886/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2021","Not only an inevitably vast improvement upon the wretched 2016 ""Suicide Squad,"" this definite article, ""The Suicide Squad,"" is also one of the more aesthetically like a comic book of the many comic-book movies I've seen and that our culture has clearly become enamored with, although not as reflexively so as, say, the also ultraviolent ""Kick-Ass"" (2010), or going to the visual lengths of Ang Lee's underappreciated ""Hulk"" (2003). That makes sense in a way, as writer-director James Gunn is a veteran of the genre--having already made two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies (2014 and 2017) for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is working on a third, in addition to other superhero flicks such as ""Super"" (2010) and ""Brightburn"" (2019).Although I think his oeuvre has been one of mixed results, few have arguably had more influence on the direction of the genre than him. The MCU was significantly redirected by the self-aware humor, as well as the pop tunes, of the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" I think ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) is an especially evident example of this, playing as it does much like a third ""Guardians"" installment. DC's Extended Universe was affected, too, in their clumsy way of imitation (""Shazam!"" (2019) in particular, and, by way of the ever-more self-referential Marvel property ""Deadpool"" (2016), ""Birds of Prey"" (2020)). Here, thanks to Disney's knee-jerk firing and before their rehiring of Gunn, DC got the real deal. Perhaps, it may also become a variation of a template for future such movies.It's still consistently light and set to rock 'n roll or otherwise pleasant melodies, but we also get some different, more dynamic movement from those RED digital cameras, which is quite congruent with the comic-book look. Nothing too exceptional, but better than others. In addition to bright colors and anthropomorphic sharks, weasels and rats and lethal polka-dots, that look includes the style of the titles, which often are blended in with the scenery, as in the introductory ""Warner Bros. Presents"" being made of the blood splatter from a character's head exploding. In one of the subjective sequences, not only are Harley Quinn's cable-supported fight moves more cartoonish, but, like those filters for people's narcissistic phone videos of themselves farting hearts, smiley faces and the like, Quinn imagines flowers replacing discarded bullet cartridges and the blood and guts erupting from her victims' mutilated bodies. It's also appropriately rated R, which, of course, such a movie should be if we're supposed to accept anti-hero villains as superheroes as in any way subversive--so we see blood, there's foul language, and, perhaps a first for such a high-profile one of these, brief nudity.All of this is welcome. The awareness of the camera is established from the start, with the shot revolving from a puddle reflection--setting the visual tone for the rest of the picture. There are also some especially good moving-camera shots later, such as revolving around Quinn shooting guns in that red dress, a fight seen through a helmet reflection, or during the climactic tower collapse and kaiju battle. As with a comic-book drawing, the CGI-enhanced digital mobility may even allow the ""camera"" to go inside for a view of a heart being stabbed. The entire opening sequence utterly tops, including by some hilarious false leads, the awful introduction of characters in the first ""Suicide Squad."" It's pretty funny to see a rather more realistic outcome of what would happen to such a rag-tag team when confronted with an actual army. Not quite ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), let alone ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), this bunch. Indeed, some of the biggest laughs here come from the squad's incompetence.Perhaps, the only thing that doesn't especially work here is the dissonance of the banana republic, American imperialism political plot beside the picture's otherwise light tone. Crazy, secret experiments and an alien starfish kaiju plot straight out of ""Rick and Morty"" by way of 20th-century sci-fi pulp such as Robert Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"" fits, but I'm not sure about geopolitical satire. It's not because I'm against the message, or that it matters whether or not I or you are for or against it. Perhaps, it would work if the rest of the picture were also a satire on comic books, but it's not that. The closest it comes is John Cena's Peacemaker character, so devoted to peace that he's willing to kill as many as he needs to for it. There's still the blockbuster-franchise reverence for itself with the rest of it, comical though it may be, that one wouldn't find with, say, the puppets in ""Team America: World Police"" (2004), which therefore could convincingly make political commentary.Somewhat more effective methinks is the bit of reflexivity by having Viola Davis's character and her covert-government team both directing and spectating the suicide squad via video and audio surveillance. Superheroes as the movie-within-the-movie. This, too, though, is reminiscent of ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2011), which itself was rather derivative of ""The Truman Show"" (1998). In this one, however, that comic-book supes movie inside another movie also ends up fighting over another film, which as with most movies these days, is contained on a hard drive. A film within a film within another film and all digital.Besides Gunn, ""The Suicide Squad"" also benefits from recruiting another MCU veteran in Idris Elba, who far outdoes Will Smith in the Will Smith part of squad leader who shoots good. His quarrelling with Cena's costumed crusader with a similar set of skills is an amusing running gag. Wisely, this sequel excises almost everything from the first movie except for its sole silver lining, the always-fantastic Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Although she's arguably absent from too much of it, it's nice that a good, albeit still flawed, movie was finally built around or to accompany her character.","2 out of 19 found this helpful.

Whether viewed as a remake, a spinoff, or a standalone sequel it's handled well in Gunn's assured hands who gleefully takes advantage of the 'R' rating and delivers a colorful, profane, laugh-out loud funny, and cartoonishly violent little feature that is likely to please fans of the source material. **½","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This sequel is directed and written by Guardians of the Galaxy and Slither director James Gunn.In the film, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles another group of super-villains for a dangerous mission in exchange for a reduced sentence. This time, the team is led by assassin Bloodsport (Idris Elba), who must lead the Squad through the jungles of a remote island filled with enemy soldiers.The first Suicide Squad movie was put together in a rushed and chaotic way and later reworked by the movie studio, ending up with a messy movie. With this sequel, they've given director James Gunn more freedom to make the film his own way. For example, James has chosen to fill the Squad of this film with the more unknown and unloved villains from the DC series. He tries to build up most of the characters in the film well, but even though they have been given a good backstory in the film, as a viewer you are not sure who will survive the film. He also provides good entertainment and tension, because your favorite character can suddenly die in the film. He often does this in a brutal and bloody way.James Gunn has also chosen to use practical effects as much as possible in order to use as little CGI as possible. This makes the action scenes of the film more realistic. Where Gunn does use visual effects, things like CGI characters still seem credible in the film thanks to an eye for detail.The acting is also well done by the film cast. Despite the size of the cast, every actor gets a chance to come forward with his role. James Gunn also wrote the script in such a way that you get to see strange combinations of characters together, but he still knows how to bring them together. You have the alpha males Bloodsprot and Peacemaker (John Cena) who both try to lead the Squad in their own way. Then there's the innocent Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) who tries to befriend the CGI character King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone) so they can better work together as a Squad to complete their mission.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) puts together two teams of Task Force X to infiltrate the South American country of Corte Maltese, locate the facility of Joutenheim to find and destroy all traces & evidence of a weapon known as project starfish. This Film doesn't not beat around the bush you are jumped in to the scenario with villains already been selected and sent off on the mission. James Gunn takes advantage of having full control on this film and doesn't hold back on the subtlety and restrictions. The films mixture of dark humor and satire mix with comedic comicbook tone is both entertaining and shocking. This scenario feels believable to how The suicide squad would act in the field and how they are seen as just mere assets. These being supervillains they have no morals ethics the same as a hero. Some would clearly lie, stab you in the back for their own benefit or stick by your side. This movies action it's brutal and all the same it feels appropriate these people have no problem whatsoever in killing whoever stands in their way of completing the task. The story to general audience might sound ridiculous, to comic book fans it's more of how you can actually see the squad being utilized. The movie soundtrack has good songs and unlike the first movie, where they just felt like they were trying to mimic guardians of the galaxy. Here they don't seem as tacked on and out of place it actually accompanies more with the tone of the scenes given. The pacing is done to swap back between the two teams adds to of the mission. It feels as though there's something going on the whole time. With plenty fun moments and the humor given with time to expand on who these people and why you should actually have a reason to care about them and not want them dead. However with 14 villains 15 if you count Starro in this movie you know all of them aren't going to get the same amount of screen time. It's going to make some people upset some of the Choices,but as advertise don't get to attach which you will but you will be surprised. Some that they do choose to focus on more are written very well though. Such as Bloodsport (Idris Elba) who out of the gate you can see that his character's very similar to Will Smith's Deadshot the similarities are pretty there. He's has this reluctance to join the squad,but has a daughter that's his motivation to go. The suit at first glance looks just like a deadshot, but he does have his own personality and style that is different that you see he's his own character. Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has gradually over the course of all these films We've seen Harley's character change to the point that she's not entirely selfish and out for herself anymore, but it does reminds us despite Harley's lovable charm she's still crazy. Margot as harley is great but it's not like previous films where she the one holding everything together. Some of the other villains are really interesting, the chemistry between the squad has actual depth. King Shark doesn't have friends and ratcatcher 2 who is more of the heart of the team she understands him and the dialogue between her and the other's motherly to the point you question how she ended up in Belle Reve. Bloodsport and peacemaker both have this militaristic persona with both of them pushing each other and trying to out stage the other. Amanda Waller is just brutal& vindictive in this film and even managed to make Rick flag a likable guy. You're able to take these more c&d list characters like polkadot man, captain boomerang,peacemaker,blackguard or Comic staples like Starro. Characters that most would never of heard of or even imagine them in a movie and make them entertaining. Overall The suicide squad is a great film offers tons of fun and entertainment with its humor and characters it a film highly recommended for DC fans. Just don't make any mistake of thinking that you know how this film is going to play out with these character's everybody is up for grabs here.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Suicide Squad is the most weirdest movie that can happen in a superhero universe. The film is a different ride when it comes to CBM's which is nothing more than a bizarre violent death filled ride which displays James Gunn's wicked ideas on screen.The Suicide Squad felt like the weirdest movie of the year the first time. Second time it felt extremely different..if you observe closely the movie has its own character depths,heart and is enjoyable when it comes to a new take. The acting performances of the major cast is praiseworthy especially John Cena's Peacemaker and Margot Robbie's gorgeous and crazy Harley Quinn stands above all. Danielle Melchoir's Ratcatcher is cute and feels like the heart of the movie while Sylvester's King Shark provides the emotional moments which contribute to the light hearted part of the movie. Cinematography,adult content,violence, frames and BGM is another praiseworthy factor of the movie. Action sequences are scattered here and there still used only when necessary. Personal favourite moments were too much to mention still One on One fight, Camp Fight, Harley Quinn's solo fight and final act all elevate the movie to new levels. VFX/CGI at most times where unidentifiable especially King Shark, Weasel and Starro and their minor details is beyond words. Artistical chapter division is the biggest factor to watch out in the whole movie followed by the bizarre surprise goosebumps worth comic book level third act which brings James Gunn's wild mind to the screen. Last but not the least the evident politics used in the movie and the wild post credits adds to its long range of pros.Coming to cons,Major alienation moment of the movie was the opening b grade island sequence and milton joke which felt absolutely weird. Personally, Viola Davis's Amanda Waller felt over at times and felt like a miscast this time. Final act's rushed death felt pushed and too generic.In the end,James Gunn delivers an absolute R rated versatile ride which is a win for both Gunn and WB when it succeeds in becoming one of the better CBM entertainer of the year.Rating:69%","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Suicide Squad DON RIGHT!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7207663/?ref_=tt_urv","myignisrules","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33094274/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2021","Talk about a complete 180! How do you go from the a generic, problem riddled movie with some likeable but ultimately wasted characters, to a story that's equal parts unpredictable, funny, surprisingly heartfelt and darkly comedic with the kind of over the top violence you'll never see coming? Why you hire James freakin' Gunn of course!I don't know what I was expecting when I sat down to watch DC's The Suicide Squad (2021) but it certainly wasn't this and I mean that in the BEST way possible. Gunn's near perfect blending of the more fantastical elements you would find in the pages of any comic book and the realistic (almost insanely brutal at that) depiction of violence and madness come together to make a comic book adaptation the likes of which no one has ever seen before. The closest thing I could compare it too is the television series The Boys and even then, this is not that.Gunn and his team also make the smart choice of choosing to highlight characters that most everyone would be unfamiliar with. This way we start with a clean slate and an open mind. With the exception of a few returning faces like Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman) and of course Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), we're invited to join an entirely new squad of D-listers on their impossible mission. This time around we also have main players Ratcatcher II (Daniela Melchior) Peacemaker (John Cena) Bloodsport (Idris Elba) Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian) and Sylvester Stallone, yes you read that right as the cutest murderer ever brought to screen King Shark and when I tell you you're gonna fall in love with each and everyone of these people, I am not exaggerating.I don't want to waste time comparing this movie to the one that came before, but I just have to mention how absolutely bonkers it is James Gunn made the time to give us one-on-one moments with each and every single one of these squad members without bringing the pacing or the energy in this movie to a halt. I teared up over Polka Dot Man and that's a sentence I never thought I would ever write.It goes without saying the actors here brought their A-game and more to their roles with the aforementioned Polka Dot played by Dastmalchian bringing both laughs and real emotion to his part. Equally so was Melchior in her role as Ratcatcher, excuse me Ratcatcher II. A very important distinction since the one and only Taika Waititi plays the role of her father, the man she takes her name from and the player who also made me choke up a bit with his/their tragic story. I would be remiss in my review if I didn't stop to talk about Robbie absolutely slaying it as Harley Quinn. She has some of the coolest, most memorably stand out moments in this movie with her monologue on why she did that thing she did (no spoilers) showing us a side of Harley that has never effectively been brought to the screen before. And can we talk about her action sequence? Are you kidding me?!! This is one of those moments I mentioned where Gunn uses his genius to blend the comic world with the real one. It gave us a ""look"" into the way HQ's mind works as she blocks out the truly horrific things she's doing in a way only Harley can.John Cena as Peacemaker was intense and I honestly didn't expect such great things from him. His role was the one that made me think most of Garth Ennis' series The Boys and I genuinely look forward to seeing more from this character. Last but never ever the least, let's talk about the cutest thing in the room. No I don't mean Sebastian the rat, (although, yes, he's a cutie in his own right) No my friends I wanna talk about King freakin' Shark! Gunn and Vin Diesel made Groot the character everyone wanted to take home with them and now the same can be said about Stallone's King of the Ocean, or in this case, a possible Demi-god named Nanaue. The choice to play him as a child-like creature, with the appetite of a great white was brilliant and there was never a scene where Shark with his inquisitive nature and his need to have more ""nom-noms"" didn't steal the show. I can't wait to get my hands on a plushy version of this guy!With one memorable action sequence after another, Gunn keeps audiences on their toes and made sure The Suicide Squad lived up to their name. There was more than one moment where I was shocked by which character died next and I loved every minute of it. From that opening scene that felt like a replay of D-Day to the final act of our last remaining anti-heroes going up against the unthinkable and unstoppable (by the way I'm so glad I avoided the trailers and articles as I honestly didn't know who the villain was supposed to be) every one of these scenes out did the next and I was never left wanting. And can we talk about that soundtrack? Such a HUGE difference from Ayer's choice to just stick every single iconic song in his movie, whether it worked in the scene or not. Here Gunn once again shows his love for the obscure but fitting songs, the way he did with Guardians of the Galaxy. I have a couple of friends who are gonna be loving themselves with this soundtrack and its scores.So are there any negatives? Well it's always hard to pin these down after just one viewing when you're all hopped up on adrenaline and excitement, but if anything comes to mine for me it would be the first act. It took me a minute to adjust to the tone of this new story and it felt a bit jarring as things settled into a rhythm. But that might just be me as I wasn't expecting a movie such as this to have such a wonderfully weird tone. I also wished we got more Amanda Waller. Viola Davis is as elite an actress as they come and she was one of only two things I enjoyed in the first movie so I was hoping for more time with The Wall. Although to be fair, what I got was everything you would expect from this character (for those who know her well) and once again Davis proves there's no person more terrifying than the woman with her hand on the literal red button.Last but not least was Idris Elba's Bloodsport. Easy now folks, put down the pitchforks and torches, I'm not saying I didn't like this character. What's not to like?! That has to be one of the coolest looking suits I've ever seen and the way it works was all kinds of awesome. Idris also delivers on some powerful moments in this movie especially when we're talking about the more emotional stuff. I just felt like compared to the rest of them, Bloodsport got a bit lost in the background. Maybe it's because he sometimes feels like you're seeing Deadshot in another form or maybe because with so many memorable characters to choose from, Bloodsport just falls a bit lower on the totem pole for me. The villains (with the exception of the big guy himself) didn't leave any impression, as well as the freedom fighters who sadly were only in this movie as scene stoppers and cannon fodder. Poor Alice Braga. Will this woman ever find a role in a comic book adaptation that isn't forgettable?Again, this is just my personal nitpicks and as of right this second, I can't think of any reason not to call James Gunn's The Suicide Squad a home run of comic book movie making. I could go on and on about this but then I would be writing a novel and not a review, so I'll just say I loved the tone, the music, the action, the characters, the editing, the pacing, the visuals (OH MY GOD, THE VISUALS!) and of all the comic book movies out there, this one in my opinion will be one of the most rewatched in times to come.Good luck to future Directors of this series who has to take up the baton and run with it. You're gonna need it!","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

Likable characters: #Ratcatcher2 #PolkaDotMan #BloodSport #RickFlag #KingShark Average: #HarleyQuinn #Peacemaker
There are few things that I particularly didn't like or cared about. Especially Harley Quinn's portrayal. This is my least favorite for sure. Missed the SS HQ vibes. So many boring scenes here and there. HQ romantic scenes were unnecessary and stupid. If Zack directed that sequence, there would have been a huge backlash from critics and DC gatekeepers. Same vibes when Diana slept with a stranger who looks like Steve in WW84. Weird and unnecessary. Now the importance of #ReleaseTheAyerCut is even bigger. Can't wait to see the original Suicide Squad soon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film feels longer than it's runtime and I'm not totally convinced by the plot and the editing. In fact, I think both of these issues are connected. The main plot is really straightforward and basic and we have, until half of the film, 3 storylines in parallel, which is too much, especially in a film with so many strong characters. Sometimes when we move to one place to the other, it loses it's focus and this has an effect on the tone and even on the pace.I still think that when it works, this is almost perfect, but I also feel that could have done better in the way it tells what it wants to say.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is not a huge deal with this movie, because is an idiotic movie with nothing to offer other than laughs and gore. As a fan of the ""Saw"" saga, you aren't amusing me with fantasy violence where bodies explode and we rarely see any real suffering. It's graphic, but it's not really that violent (except for Harley for like... 10 seconds).Then the jokes. I didn't laugh once. There is nothing to do here. I'm guessing the actors just didn't land the jokes for my taste, because I laughed alot with Pratt and Bautista and Cooper in the Guardians movies.And then the ""weirdness"". I just didn't care for it. Enjoy it you all, I guess? I'm not sure the director admitting it's going to make a dumb movie saves it from having to actually deliver a coherent story, a well paced story (instead of wandering in an Island) and good characters and/or villains. This movie has none of that... because it doesn't want to (it's pretty obvious)... which is pretty insane. But who cares because...

It's fun, features a killer cast, a killer soundtrack, and a script that kills (literally) being both hilarious and gruesome.Similar to the emotional feel of Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad creates a lovable band of a-holes that Gunn gleefully plays with your expectations, and revels in the anarchic narrative he has created.All the cast are great fun to watch on screen with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn getting the big stand out action sequence. The less you know going in the better (be mindful of the tagline ""Don't get too attached""). David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man and Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, are exceptional, not only bringing pathos to the proceedings, but also being the instigators of some outlandish surreal moments.The best of the DC films, this demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible and rewards audiences with unhinged carnage, big laughs and real emotional depth. An indie cult classic masquerading as a summer blockbuster, which features the best cinematic shark since ""Bruce"".The best fun you'll have in your local cinema emporium this year.

Soon enough, things go wrong, very wrong. But then we learn that another Suicide Squad team is getting onto the island. What the heck is going on here? We then go to ""3 days earlier"" as Bloodsport is cleaning the prison's floor. At this point we are 10 min. Into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the long-delayed follow-up to the original Suicide Squad film in 2016. Don't call it a sequel, though, as much (but not all) of the original cast isn't returning. It's more like a reboot, as if regretting how not very good (ok, worse than that) the 2016 film ultimately turned out. A reboot already? Yup, already. This one is written and directed by James ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" Gunn. One thing is clear: once the decision was made that the 2021 reboot was going to get an R rating, Gunn decided to make it as hard an R rating as possible. None of that matters of course, as long as the story line works well and the characters are fully developed. Alas, that is where this movie falls way short. There is no character development whatsoever, as if it is assumed that the viewer already knows these characters (some viewers may some of these characters, but surely not all viewers and not all characters). As for the actual story line, it's hard to say anything about it without spoiling so I won't. For me (and I realize this is a subjective view), it all made for scatterbrained viewing, and in the end this movie didn't do anything for me, sorry.""The Suicide Squad"" opened wide in theaters this weekend but also was available for streaming on HBO Max, where I caught it. The initial box office reports are not very kind, and make this the lowest opening weekend gross ever in the DCEU. Of course, things are not helped by the rapidly surging and highly infectious Delta coronavirus variant (why, oh why, do TENS OF MILLIONS refuse to get vaccinated is beyond me). If you are a fan of the DCEU or the 2016 Suicide Squad or simply a Margot Robbie fan, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","110 out of 237 found this helpful.

This film doesn't take the time to set up things that would make you care or connect with the characters outside of cheap shots in order to pull emotional strings.Those that don't get this treatment are likely (comedy) Cannon fodder and thus don't require you to actually care about these in any way shape or form making any form of redeeming qualities just another set-up for a cheap laugh.Obviously this is quite a challenge since we're dealing with actual super-villians that have done horrible things, even though they all draw the line at a point clearly intended to point out who the actual bad guys in this film are.When done correctly this makes glorious cinema questioning the moral ramifications of the actions of everyone involved and where (If there is any) Is the line.If only they've let Harley have a good discussion with Waller regarding the ethics of what they're doing, HQ is a trained psychiatrist so must've dabbled in Ethics at some point whereas Wallers ruthless utilitarianism could make for wonderful dialogue.Sadly this was an hamfisted attempt at asking such questions and it falls flat on it's face regarding that.There are some things which feel like painting by the numbers, sure I like Harley Quinn as much as the next person and the film shows very clearly why you should run for the hills if you were to pick a fight with her.Do we need this with 2 movies of her own and her own animatied series? I don't think so and she's been tacked on as a seat-filler due to her fanbase, which is choice I can understand but it becomes a bit stale.Do I hope for more Suicide Squad films? Sure but I would very much like these to not act like a jump-off point for shows or whatnot and be self-contained films taking the meta-human action up to 11 leaving the hard questions up to the (Animated)Shows/Webisodes or whatnot.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

James Gunn once again shakes up the superhero formula with a slick style.The first 10-15 minutes tells you exactly what the movie is going to be.I just can't believe we got something like this. It's 2 hours and 12 minutes long, but it's always on the move. It's bonkers from start till finish, and I enjoyed every minute of it. This is probably one of the best shot movies in the DCU. The soundtrack is great as well and used effectively. The action scenes were insane and made the overall experience one of the most fun I had at the cinema in a long time.Did I mention the movie is very gory? It's cartoonish violence, or what people call ""adult superhero movie"", so it's not for kiddies or for the faint of heart. You would probably guess that not everybody on the team is going to make it to the end credits, so deaths are to be expected, but how certain characters ""bite the dust"" are so unexpectedly gruesome and brutal, it took me by surprise each time. The marketing for the movie was right, don't get too attached. As I said before, James Gunn had complete creative control over the movie, and he doesn't hold back on what he wrote and show on screen. But then again, it's a movie, it's not real, the actors who die on screen are fine in real life...I think.All the cast members have equal amount of time to shine, and you like these super villains this time around, as each character had wonderful chemistry with each other. John Cena plays Peacemaker, an extreme patriot who will do the most horrific things for liberty. John Cena excels in the deadpan line delivery for comedic effect, but surprisingly enough, worked well in the serious moments.Margot Robbie once again nails the role of the chaotic but gleeful Harley Quinn. While the character isn't front and centre this time around, more of a side character, but whenever the character is on screen, it's instantly memorable.Idris Elba plays Bloodsport and it's by far Elba's best work in a while. Charismatic and a strong leading presence.Polka Dot Man, played by character actor David Dastmalchian, a socially awkward, weird, and lame sounding character that has some serious mummy issues, which has a funny running visual gag throughout. However, because of Gunn's writing and Dastmalchian's performance, the character is more than a joke, but a unique character to watch.Ratcatcher 2, played wonderfully by Daniela Melchior, who brought so much warmth and heart to the film. I loved how they tied in her tragic backstory into the finale, as it honestly made me cry. And let's not forget the king himself, King Shark, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. He stole every scene he's in, because he's so adorable and has such kind eyes, but when he's hungry, he can be a killing machine.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A few years ago he made a tree with a catchphrase and a choleric raccoon the stars of a superhero universe. And again he manages the feat of making me grow fond of characters called King Shark, Ratcatcher 2 and Polka-Dot-Man. Even if they, like all the characters, don't achieve the depth I would have liked, they seem more sympathetic and human than all those who went on mission in David Ayer's version. But that can be developed in a sequel. Light-footed, completely over-the-top fun with promising characters.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

His signature style is noticeable almost instantaneously as well as a lack of any kind of studio intervention (I guess they learned after ZS's Justice League).This flick is violent but entertainingly violent. The violence is not there to shock but to amuse. It is incredibly cartoon-like. This flick is dark but still never up to a point that it has to be taken seriously. It is bloated but never bloated that it feels overstuffed. Gunn managed to pull of just the right amount of dosing of everything he wanted and what he audience requested.Even though the movie has a stunning idea and serves as much as a sequel as a reboot, and certain narrative decisions will not be everyone's cup of tea, The Suicide Squad aims to be as ludicrous , entertaining and flamboyant as possible. And in that department it actually succeeds.The star cast is phenomenal and all praise has to go to Elba (even though it is painfully visible that the role was written for Smith and Deadshot), Cena, Dastmalchian and Melchior for bringing the heart and soul of this movie to life. Other members, most notably the old squad are decent in their respective roles but Robie steals the scenes again without any remorse whatsoever. Kinnaman was much more likable and entertaining as Flag but the departure from his original portrayal was a bit too distant and should/could have had more connections with the original version.On the other hand, the narrative is all over the place. It is incoherent, crazy, jumps from one segment to the next, sometimes is even hard to follow, and the editing was sometimes incredibly rough. But all of this, interestingly, didn't harm the movie as it contributed to the overall lunacy that this movie actually is. Could a bit more cohesive story and less twists provide a much more stable and coherent narrative? Yes. Was it recommendable? Yes. Would it have made a better movie? We don't know. Unfortunately, the movie should not be watched as a single story-line with a cohesive narrative, but should be approached as a theme-park roller-coaster that should be admired for it's really stylish and visual attractiveness. Henceforth, if you are looking for a simple and straightforward story, avoid this as much as you can.Musically speaking, this was a complete and utter disappointment. There are interesting catchy tunes but none of them are pushed to their limits nor are they developed enough. There are no main tunes to be found nor character themes, which is a shame. Also, the lack of the original Ayer suicide squad theme is just criminal.The Suicide Squad clearly was Gunn's project with no restrictions from anyone anywhere and it actually functions as a decent and entertaining movie. The cast was solid and the entertainment value is high. However, it lacks the one segment that makes DC movies important and that is the primary question of what makes us human. It is an interesting addition to the DCEU but overall is not something that should be heralded as a masterpiece. Its good, better than the Ayer flick, but not even near the ranks of Aquaman, ZS's Justice League or Wonder Woman.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But ( much like FOX) I heard rumors DC will not be making a sequel. I truly wish the heads of these companies would stop alienating the fans and making every worst possible decision to make money. Look what happened to Deadpool. A short bit of test footage leaks and Bam the movie is green lit. While filming they have no faith in it so they cut the budget so now the crew scrambles to rewrite and Bam they finish filming a go on to make a $700 billion successful movie that the fans love.DC please please please stop trying to do everything possible to kill your company and learn to trust James Gunn and Zack Snyder!!!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

So John Cena knew this was a huge role for him & he really excels ).Peacemaker TV show is 18 rated rightly as is just for adults to enjoy.Obviously Suicide Squad the movie went for the 15 rating which may be why the film wasn't able to be as good as it could have been, as to get all those 15 to 17 year olds to be able to watch cuts must have been made which may be why the script was a bit hit & miss at times.As a money making exercise having it 15 rated makes financial sense in the short term, but a 18 rated film with a more coherent script with the chains took off I think long term would have been a better watch.Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn great as always so is another real positive in the DC universe, as hopefully she will continue to be in the upcoming reboot films as appropriate for both Margot & Harley Quinn.As obviously if there is a much younger Harley Quinn character then another actress would then have to do the part ( for a teenager Harley etc, but Margot Robbie should play the part if she can cover the age of character so let us hope in any DC universe reboot Margot Robbie is in it. Even if she has to play a different character or be in her own series ).Idris Elba ( played Bloodsport ) & his performance was OK however I was a bit disappointed with some of his scenes I think he could have done better, as maybe if he had his own 18 rated TV show he would be able to do a lot better ( as those 15 rated chains, restrict actors a lot ).Viola Davis ( playing Amanda Waller ) is a very good actress but I felt the script was not very logical with her character which took away from the story, as her character motivations just did not make logical sense but with a better script they could have improved the overall story. So hope Viola Davis carries on playing Amanda Waller in future films as possible ( but let us hope future scripts make much more sense ).The rest of the cast do a good job & overall the script is a 7 out of 10 which ultimately is why this superhero film is just a 7 out of 10 movie.However Peacemaker ( 18 rated TV series ) is a 9 out of 10 show so I am grateful James Gunn did Direct this & produced a great TV show afterwards ( as who knew John Cena would be so great in the series ).One good thing about this film is once you get past the inconsistencies in the script & the lack of logical character motivations ( for some of the time as often it does make sense ) the film is actually very funny & is a good entertaining watch. So don 't go in expecting it to be as good as Guardians of the Galaxy, as it is not. However it is still worth a watch & hopefully with more time & planning James Gunn will ensure that the future DC reboots coming up will be more GOTG overall quality to enjoy which means making sure the scripts make sense all the time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

For me, it was jarringly and unpleasantly offkey almost throughout.Good CGI, good fight scenes, good cast, good cinematography, good crisp script and editing, etc. Etc. And still almost unbearably offkey to the point that watching it for me felt (mostly) like being trapped in some kind of after-death, empathy-absent, emotionally-void purgatory. A human-relatable baseline entryway into most if not all of the characters and action sequences was so weak or lacking that the movie's irreverence lost for me the human element of emotional and/or intellectual transgressiveness.Then came the final sequence and I started to see an artistic vision beyond stylized violence. These anti-heroes are insane, alien, warped emotionally and very violent so, yeah, I'd be worried if I could relate deeply with any of them. But the forces/system trying to control and exploit them (and everyone else?) are at least as insane, alien, warped emotionally and violent. So when the crazy gifted anti-heroes fight the crazy controlling forces/system to a temporary truce, well that was kind of cathartic in a way.These anti-heroes and this movie ultimately challenged standard widely-held orthodoxies/sensibilities in a way worthy of truly transgressive art. I respect that this movie held its ground and tone even when it knowingly would offend many status quo sensibilities. I can still appreciate art committed to a vision/theme/tone even when it is not always in line with my preferences.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This will become one of those rare examples as it's without a doubt better than 'Suicide Squad'. It has clear direction unlike the first one, which just seemed all over the place and visually dark. This was vibrant and loads of fun. One of the biggest differences is of course the rating. With this type of movie it's just better being rated R. The over the top gore and expletive language just seems more suiting.Everyone from Margot Robbie to John Cena seemed to have upped their game in the acting department. Cena and King Shark were hilarious. And the movie was filled with 'Guardians of the Galaxy' esque humor as one would expect from James Gunn. Daniela Melchior is a welcomed new comer to Hollywood, and provided just the right amount of emotion to the ludicrous shenanigans from all the other characters.With many hits and misses from the DC extended universe, this was definitely a hit. It's a bit of a mixed bag and a gamble when going to watch a DC movie, but 'The Suicide Squad' pays off.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The opening is hilarious, and there is plenty of comedic dialogue and timing through the rest of the movie. Language and gore are not spared, which I appreciated as being realistic (not counting gunfire being avoided).After these elements, the story falls flat because it becomes disjointed.

It was unpredictable and certainly delivered on the endeavour to raise the stakes of the genre, shamelessly killing off a plethora of characters in true James Gunn fashion. The film expertly switches between various tones to create a truly cohesive and full story, juggling heartfelt character moments and thrilling action, graphic violence and intelligent humour with ease and tact, overall producing a special experience for DC fans old and new and truly setting itself apart from the vast roster of copy and paste superhero movies. The cast of the film is vast in number with every member as talented and enjoyable to watch as the last. Notable standouts for me were Peter Capaldi as the joyously evil mastermind, ""The Thinker"" and of course, Sylvester Stallone as the voice of the simple, lovable, yet feral beast, ""King Shark."" As well as this, the returning cast from the 2016 Suicide Squad felt new and invigorated with Gunn's writing style, yet still retained some connective tissue to past films. This allowed the film to build upon pre-existing lore, enriching the wider DCEU as a whole, whilst simultaneously providing a purely unique and self contained story for the audience to become completely immersed in, without worry of how things tie into other projects. One final thing i feel i must comment on is the design of the film. From each character's attire seemingly ripped directly from the pages of DC comics, to the unapologetically colourful and outlandish ""Starro the Conqueror,"" The Suicide Squad felt like a love letter to DC nerds everywhere, willing to engulf its main cast in the wacky regalia of their comic counterparts, where many other films of the genre would typically shy away in favour of tactical jumpsuits and modernised armour. As a big DC fan myself, i found a lot to enjoy in this film and hope to see more comic adapted properties daring to be as bold as this one. In simpler terms, I loved every second of The Suicide Squad.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I watched a thousand movies stoned in my younger days but given I haven't in 15 years I can only suppose that it might just be awesome in that state of mind.

It could have been great. But the gore leaves you empty and makes all its whimsy fall short of laughter.Visually the film could have been magical. But for every disneyesque cartoon flower spilling out where blood should be, for every over exposed walk into the sunset, for every bad**s John Wick moment, there are at least 2 heads graphically split open or exploded, 3 bodies torn apart or splattered, several F words, and about ten or twenty civilian casualties ruthlessly gunned down by automatic fire or collapsing buildings.Given the option to rewatch this or the original I'd watch the original. At least I can watch all of that movie without disgust. Heck, I'd probably even watch Birds of Prey again first and that movie sucked.Aside from all the gore, what was left of the film is rather bipolar and disconnected. It doesn't flow great, and seems a bit of a chore to get the full story to unfold ( I guess that's why there are so many liberties taken with visual effects to keep it from being a total snooze.)In the end there is a great story there... but it's really only about a half hours worth of film.Characters are pretty good considering they are almost all filler. But the lead, played by Idris Elba evolves pretty interestingly and gives you a little bit of a good feeling in all the discombobulation. And Harley Quinn is a good support without being too much (except for one scene where her bad**sery is given a little too much liberty, but it works.)Over the top is what you should expect here, and that includes everything from villains to heros to gore. The campiness is that of a bad horror film against a backdrop of scene after scene of the most gruesome moments from Amazon's The Boys & a few Disneyesque moments to soften the impact.In some ways it's better than the first and in others it isn't even close. As far as continuity it's closer to Birds of Prey than its namesake predecessor, but story wise it fits more with the original.Great performances all around. Crap dialogue. Gore dominates over anything nice in this film. Resolve is as usual bittersweet.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The roles of the Suicide Squad members werent deep personalities as this is not what this movie was going for. So every actor did what they had to do and performed their roles solidly.The scenes and shot composition was very enjoyable especially for an action movie. Cuts were deliberate and not just put in there, it was easy to follow the action which was very much needed as some scenes took up large areas in which they took place. Memorable action scenes include some nice one-rs and a very stylistic scene with Harley. Also the action scenes were just generally fun to watch, things were happening and they had interesting high-points in it. Also the comedic shots pretty much always landed and didnt feel forced. Notable aswell were the scene transitions which were a nice way of keeping with the comedic tone of the movie.The dialogue was good enough and actually had some good jokes but some was just serviceable to move the story forward which is to be expected.The true fun of the movie is that all the action and gore has interesting ideas that I hadnt seen before. As a general fan of gore in movies and especially in superhero movies the use of it in this movie was deliberate enough with it to not just use it for the purpose of using it.Music and sound were nothing special. But it was serviceable. Some sounds were a bit too loud during action scenes.The Story is very fun and doesnt take itself too seriously which is a nice change of pace for DC Superhero movies. All story beats are fun to follow and dont drag the movie down. The climax scene is very fun and something I hadnt seen before in this way which made it feel fresh. Overall a very deliberately fun movie with good and purposeful ideas but it is not a villain story. The characters are still all lawful personalities that decide to do good with the difference that they did bad things before. This doesnt take away from the movie though but its not something the movie should pride itself with.Still very enjoyable but I'd still be interested in a real villain movie from DC.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I would have liked to have seen and known more (but not by reading) about several characters, and as in precious few other movies I'd like to see more of their respective actors' work.

(You know the one: Drop the article from its title.) Perhaps this sentiment is grounded in that movie's novelty and the distinct impression that all who participated in that full well knew this. That's not quite the case with this iteration, of which a spectacular example involves one Harley Quinn, which is a shame, for Margot Robbie can do anything she sets her sights on. In contrast Daniela Melchior's character sleepily steals every scene she is in.It's worth the view but feel entitled to set the bar higher.P. S. I commend its location shooting in Panama, a beautiful place if you strive to know it better.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

He really has made DC interesting again with this one, the writing in this is fantastic and all the actors are doing such a good job and clearly are enjoying themselves. The comedy is second to none, this film is hilarious and all of the characters work so well together. Some scenes are literally just all the characters taking the mick out of each other and it's so funny. The special effects are amazing in this and some scenes genuinely are beautiful and with the amazing sound track it just makes for a great viewing.

So yes Deadshot should've definitely been in this movie & it would've been better for it. I also much preferred the Awesome Enchantress as the main villain in the other version rather than the huge alien starfish & the Thinker but what i did prefer here was all the Awesome blood & guts action that was missing from the first film. I so wish we got to see Deadshot blasting bad guys to gory bits. Of course here though it's Idris Elba's savage Assassin ""Bloodsport"" that steals the show or atleast in my opinion anyway. Imagine Bloodsport & Deadshot teamed up!!!The Suicide Squad was a mix of Stallone's The Expendables films & The Dirty Dozen & David Ayer's Suicide Squad & it was a ferocious & funny blast of entertainment. This Suicide Squad was way funnier than the first & i liked the new team especially Peacemaker (John Cena) who is hilarious & extremely deadly at the same time & Idris Elba's dangerous Assassin Bloodsport. Also Stallone's King Shark was great fun & Margot Robbie was excellent again as the wild Harley Quinn (A role she's perfected now) & it was nice to have tough soldier Rick Flag back again played by Joel Kinnaman. There's a nice excepting friendship between Harley & Flag because of what they went through together in the first film. The first film definitely did happen & this is definitely a sequel so i wish Deadshot was mentioned & Killer Croc. Joel Kinnaman was excellent as Rick Flag & has a fantastic fight with Peacemaker. The action is fantastically violent as it should be with blood everywhere & that was missing from the first film but what this one was missing was a big heart at it's centre. Ratcatcher 2 is a good character & is the emotional aspect of the movie but it was Deadshot that grounded everything in the first film with Smith's incredible performance & the team in the first had a real family vibe by the end that i loved.James Gunn's The Suicide Squad is Awesome bloody fun (The Weasel was hilarious lol) but David Ayer's Suicide Squad had more heart, a much better villain (Enchantress), Will Smith as Deadshot & a better looking movie. Both great in their own ways but Ayer's is the better movie in my opinion. Deadshot made Suicide Squad.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Great performances all around. And the dialogue and banter is simply wonderful. Yes, it's idiotic, often absurd, but that's the point. This really gave us that off the wall lunacy that you would expect from a bunch of messed up villains trying to play at being heroes. There are some wonderful moments that are gut bustingly funny, as well as some honest touching moments.The action scenes in this one are great. Vast improvement from the blurry, cut filled, jumbled mess they did before. The action is intense and gory and over the top. It feels like a superhero... or villain... movie should do.The special effects are also top notch. But with the budget going into this movie, that's to be expected.All in all, a must watch for any DC fan, or just anyone who loves intense action movies with a lot of great dialogue and quips.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first thing that I can immediately point out is that it's obviously nothing like the regular, PG-13 films marketed towards kids and people attracted to Henry Cavill.""The Suicide Squad"" is reliant on an excessive amount of blood and guts, which is not for those who are squeamish. But, if you're able to get through the nasty stuff, the story that unfolds over an acceptable 2-hour runtime is worth the watch.James Gunn's direction and screenplay are undeniably the best to exist in the DC Cinematic Universe to date. His lively, creative vision for the film is exciting to see, and it's exactly what this franchise needed. The problem with the original ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Justice League"" films is that they felt so underwhelmingly arid. The superstars were shiny but the final result was as dull as Jared Leto's Joker. Gunn takes every aspect to the next level in this film; from the comedy to the characters, as well as the overall ambience. He establishes a solid connection between us and the ensemble cast, ensuring that we understand their stories or at least have an idea of who they are and who they will be.John Cena's performance as Peacemaker surprised me greatly; I've never seen him portray such a captivating role! Every minute that he's on screen, he manages to be outstanding alongside a star-studded cast. Whether it's in a humorous bit or a serious scene, Cena validates his role as one of the best he's ever done. Sylvester Stallone's Nanaue (a.k.a. King Shark) is also a colossal highlight, with his hilarious moments making you wish that YOU were his friend. Ultimately, the main set of actors, including Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, Viola Davis, David Dastmalchian & Daniela Melchior, are truly fantastic moreover. The strength that this cast encompasses is dangerously flawless, and you cannot deny it one bit.And one more thing-- the cinematography. Ooh, and the score! Henry Braham captures each scene thrillingly, giving us some of the most beautiful shots in the DCEU. And John Murphy's score elevates the action scenes perfectly, providing the best amount of suspense and surprise. The soundtrack for the film is very fitting too, featuring classic songs in certain scenes that take the mood beyond our eyes and into our ears.It was surely expected that the main-man James Gunn would do an excellent job with this movie, considering his work in the MCU with the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" trilogy. Though, one thing that was unexpected that we should've seen coming... was the true saviors of the story: the rats. We can always rely on super soldiers and trained assassins, but in reality, rats are the REAL superheroes.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I don't particularly care for those, but they (and this) is stellar compared to what the first one was.As with every single one of these DCEU (or whatever it is now) movies, it's way too long. This one could have the last 30 minutes lopped off and it would have been a more satisfying experience than the obligatory final CGI battle/cut-scene.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

In addition to the film being heavily butchered in the editing process, it ended up being one of the most divisive installments in the already controversial franchise to the point of being labeled as the poor man's Guardians of the Galaxy. However, five years following its release, the writer/director of the aforementioned Marvel flick James Gunn was brought onboard to helm a standalone followup, with old and new characters coming in. So, how did this one favor out in the end?Now, the basic premise Suicide Squad is that a secret government agency allows imprisoned super villains to take down potential threats in exchange for reduced sentences. Where the first film focused on a ragtag team of super villains taking down a powerful witch to save the world, this followup focuses on convicts from before and now being set out to destroy evidence of the giant alien starfish Starro. While pretty standard for a superhero action flick, James Gunn and the crew clearly took a lot of inspiration from the comics to deliver a balance between hardcore bloody shoot-em up action and sardonic banter used for comedy, complete with some nice violent slapstick for the touches on top. Even though the first Suicide Squad film tried to balance serious action with goofy comedy, it ended up losing its appeal by taking itself too seriously for its own good, whereas this flick has the right balance in knowing when to mess around and when to raise the stakes. Like the better R rated superhero flicks, this flick is a showcase of properly indulging in sprightly, self-aware comic fun for an older audience.In addition to all of the popcorny fun the film has to offer, the cast bring a lot to their performances. It is easy to tell how actors play their roles in superhero movies nowadays whenever the flick calls for a more serious tone, but thankfully, even the likes of Idris Elba, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman and Peter Capaldi knew how to ham their roles up enough without losing the believability of how much pain is within their characters. Returning from the first film the most is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and at this point, she has completely embodied the psychiatrist turned crazed criminal. Whenever she gets herself involved in specific situations such as life threatening stakes or battles with the squad, she just goes all out in embracing the lunacy displayed on screen. Adding on to that, Sylvester Stallone brought quite a charming nature to King Shark, even if the character does feel a bit too similar to Groot and the Iron Giant. Beyond that, the entire cast clearly fit their roles to a perfect extent, and there's no telling what else could be in store for these characters in future installments.However, in spite of all the wonderful qualities the film has to offer, the one factor that could really make or break one's expectations of the movie itself is whether or not it works as a standalone sequel. Granted, the first film didn't do the best job at introducing its characters to a mass audience out of rushed pacing, but you are still left with this unorthodox team of super villains who aren't all that familiar outside of the more popular DC heroes and baddies. On one hand, the story is pretty routine to follow, but on the other hand, you could end up getting lost in all the different plot points regarding the villain's complex motivation and how each character has to work around one another, especially when one of the teammates, Ratcatcher 2, uses rats to the best of her advantage. Then again, anyone familiar with what made Guardians of the Galaxy work will definitely find it all here, what with the killer soundtrack, sardonic humor, bizarrely creative VFX and oddball characters running amok. So maybe if it won't appeal to everyone, it might bring in the familiar superhero crowd in more ways than one.Is this followup to Suicide Squad going to win everyone over? It's certainly debatable. While it may alienate fans of the previous darker installments in the DCEU, it may give newcomers a chance to really feel thrilled by the more playful direction DC is heading in nowadays. Now that the film is playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max simultaneously, I'd say it's worth checking out at least once to get a good first impression. It's funny how the first film was seen as DC trying to cash in on Guardians of the Galaxy, so if they were to do a superior sequel, why not bring in the man who started that success in the first place?","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Funny, interesting plot developments, cool characters, high quality, and done with loads of style. Reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy and the first Deadpool.And then it kind of petered out and become a pretty standard action movie. It kept the visual and most of the acting quality (miles ahead of the recent Justice League movies), some of the wit and a tiny bit of the style, but there was no more plot or character development and the 'end boss' was a childlike attempt at either humour or style or both.I liked the first Suicide Squad, as a really solid, fun, and often funny action movie. By comparison, the first half of this one was still so much better; and the second half of this one was marginally worse, but in roughly the same league.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are funny dark humour, surprising plot twists and very nice geopolitcal stuff (unexpectedly anchored in a consistent understanding of world history). Action and special effects are good as they are supposed to be, but the script is also by far much better than what DC and Marvel have been providing in their very profitable productions. Harley Quinn is nice once more, I liked the Ratcatcher 2 a lot, and Idris Elba is very consistent, much more interesting than Will Smith in the previous film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie was definitely energetic , fun and a nice improvment for DC overall.The visuals are great and there are a lot of really nice effects and gore effects that really make this movie stand out and that is why I am glad this movie is R rated.Idris Elba and King Shark were a standout for me . I think Elba was a perfect casting choice.Harley Quinn was also a nice improvment from Birds of Pray.With all those positive things being said there are a lot of things that in my opinion could have been done much better.In my opinion , not a single character in this movie was really relatable.I kind of liked Idris Elba and Rick Flag but honestly I still think Will Smith as Deadshot was way better and his relationship with his daughter was much better done in that movie in comparison with Elbas character.The second thing that I hated was how this movie plays in the first hour. The whole first hour plays like a comedy. Just joke after a joke and some of them were honestly not funny at all.After an hour I really enjoyed more impactful action and unexpected twists that really made this movie a unique experience in my opinion.Overall I rated this movie 7/10 just because it was fun , visuals were great and plot was interesting enough not to bore me but in all honesty it will be forgettable in about a week. The only thing that will stay with me is great kill effects and King Shark.PlatinumanYT 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That's not the case in this one. Almost every one getting real screen time gets a character. Even Savant who's barely there gets his character - think about the opening scene with a bouncing ball. Even King Shark, who's mainly CGI, gets a character (and kudos to Sylvester Stallone) and more than just getting a character - they're all getting a human character without getting cheesy (almost) so we get to like them, we get to care and the actors get a real feast. They all get something to sink their teeth in, and they do.Viola Davis is still short of real background - she does get a character, obviously, but if you don't know the comics you know nothing about her but the callous bureaucrat you see on screen. It's a deliberate decision, to leave her as the one without a soul, the ultimate pawn master. James Gunn also made a conscious decision about blurring the lines between good and bad. Which, in fact is necessary when our heroes are all villains, but think about his heroes in GotG and you'll realize James Gunn likes them a bit morally ambiguous. This way their humanity comes shining all the brighter when they let it show.Bottom line - everybody has said it already - it's violent, it's fun and it makes its point as straightforwardly as possible. If you don't mind the quantities of blood - this might be exactly for you.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Does not disappoint!!!!Ok, just finished watching this. Like I predicted, James Gunn made an incredible movie here. Unlike any superhero movie made so far (imo). (There is a LOT of language however,,, they really milked the R rating with the language. I wish they hadn't. It wasn't needed. I can understand some, I'm definitely guilty of it,, but it was too much.)I can't say much without giving something away, so I'll keep it brief. Waller sends the team to Corto Maltese to infiltrate this secret lab called Jotenheim. Corto Maltese has recently been taken over by a new tyrant president (sounds kinda familiar) with a big military force backing him. Will the team be able to complete their mission?The cast is incredible!! There are a few returning faces from the 1st movie (I really liked the first movie btw,, I didn't say it was perfect,, but I liked it a lot)- Col. Flag / Capt. Boomerang / Harley Quinn, and of course Amanda Waller. Otherwise,, it's all new people!!! Bloodsport / Savant / BlackGuard / Mongal / Javelin / T. D. K / King Shark / Polka Dot Man / Ratcatcher 2 / Peacemaker, and Weasel!! What a team! (I really love Ratcatcher 2 and King Shark. Also, Bloodsport is kinda awesome.

Dragging especially around between 60-70% of the movie what is pity because it is unnecessary use of resources without contribution to the movie

However after watching this,I believe that this movie has more heart than any dc movie released in the past 10 years. The character development is fantastic. Gunn has given every major character a lot of emotional depth and has redeemed characters like Rick Flag who i didn't care for in the 1st movie. This movie made me feel sad for minor dc characters I never knew about. The major character deaths in this movie was more sad than superman's death in bvs. Even with limited screen time each character shines in the movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

'The Suicide Squad' did its best to bring together mostly obscure anti-superheroes from the DC Comics universe, but aside from a few semi-bonafide stars like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, it overall was a letdown.Sure, John Cena and Idris Elba are two fairly bankable actors, and the return of no-nonsense Team X agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) was nice to see. But no number of throwaway cameos from the likes of Nathan Fillion and Jai Courtney to Pete Davidson could save this campy gorefest from itself.It's hard to tell what kind of film 'Suicide' is, but it's easy to understand it's basically a mockery of itself and full of irony. There are few actual comedic parts in here, even though the dialogue is written in a way that builds in one-liners intended to yield laughs. 'Suicide' is downright stupid, from the main villain they must take on to the sloppy reliance on CGI around virtually every corner.'The Suicide Squad' was supposed to restart this misfire of a franchise, but it likely will spell the beginning of the end for it.","16 out of 28 found this helpful.

Bright and brash, this is a comic book film in its truest form, action and comedy brilliantly rolled into one.Gunn is able to replicate the energy he created in Guardians of the Galaxy for Marvel, giving DC a plot full of heart, darkness and laughs. A simple but intriguing premise; incarcerated supervillains are offered the opportunity to shorten their prison sentence through deadly Black Ops missions led by the government. The eclectic bunch of misfits proceed to carry out their mission with few morals to hold them back.The Suicide Squad benefits by leaning into the wacky nature akin to many of the characters, unlike the previous iteration which forced a serious atmosphere. Ridiculous characters and creatures justifies a fun approach, and this is the only way to bring a villain as bizarre as Starro to the screen.That is not to suggest that it is purely jokes and something appropriate for a younger audience. It can be incredibly gruesome at times and there is no concern over the gore being overtly apparent. That itself looks great and supports a visually brilliant film with fantastic props and costuming. Some excellent design choices are made, particularly with King Shark.Its greatest attribute, however, is the casting. Robbie reprises a perfect Harley Quinn, joined by Cena's fantastically funny Peacemaker and Elba as a charismatic lead. Introducing a great performance from Melchior and an array of wider cast members, the action shares the spotlight with the dialogue in surely one of DC's most fun films to date.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first Suicide Squad was absolute garbage.James Gunn took the worst DC movie and transformed it into arguably one of the best.The characters are all memorable and funny, they all have excelent chemistry. The acting is pretty good and the writing is actually impressive. Even the throwaway characters were funny.Ratcatcher was a pivotal part of the plot and I personally enjoyed her very much, due to the fact that I live in Portugal, in the same city where she came from. It's nice to see my ""small"" country in Hollywood. Speaking of that, Daniela Melchior steals every scene she's in, whether it's with Idris Elba or John Cena. Way to go girl! Hope she makes it big on the other side of the Atlantic.This is a brutal but great movie, with thrilling action sequences and a straight forward plot that doesn't put you to sleep. I enjoyed this movie very much, more than I expected really, so I give it a 8 out of 10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

They don't hold back on all the gore, and I appreciate it.One or two nitpicks I have are how the protagonists' side becomes so upset when it comes to kids dying. This film is definitely not for kids, maybe for some families but they didn't need to depict their sympathies too much.The other problem is that I couldn't root for anyone in this movie. I didn't really cared if anyone died, and while that didn't hinder the overall enjoyment, it decreases the possibility of rewatching the film again.A solid 9 out of 10 stars.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have never watched the first one and was almost dragged to the cinema to watch it. I am so happy i didn't bail.

Played by Nathan Fillion, Javelin, played by Flula Borg, Mongal, played by Mayling Ng, Weasel, played by Sean Gunn, and Savant, memorably played by Gunn regular Michael Rooker, they have been sent by her on a dangerous mission to the South American Island of Corto Maltese to certain death against massively armed enemy forces, at the same time another group has landed on an opposite location, allowing the first group to be a distraction. This group is the real Suicide Squad which is led by the charismatic Bloodsport, exceptionally played by Idris Elba, the blindly patriotic muscle-bound killer Peacemaker, impressively played by John Cena, the insecure Polka-Dot Man with the serious mother complex, superbly played by David Dastmaichian, and the hulking Nanaue/King Shark who loves to eat his enemies, a wonderfully realized CGI character who is terrifically voiced by Sylvester Stallone. When this group is joined by the survivors of the first group, Flag and Quinn they set off on their primary mission to destroy a heavily defended secret tower prison in the heart of the island where a super powerful alien creature named Starro is being housed. This gore-filled, dark humor genre gem has amazing mayhem and jaw-dropping action sequences. It is one of the best DC films ever made thanks to Gunn's meticulously brilliant direction, stunning visual effects, and exquisite cinematography by Henry Braham. One of the year's best films.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

A completely fun, R-rated, stupid, psychotic heist film. Not one character was unlikeable or useless in the film. Great casting and acting from everyone. Yes, that includes John Cena, who is as confoundingly charismatic as ever. Don't care what anyone says. And what an absurd scenario, putting all these obscure and occasionally laughable villains against such a galactic powerhouse of a villain. Just ridiculous, and amazing.James Gunn excels at writing flawed yet lovable/admirable characters. Guardians of the Galaxy, Super, and now this. This man can WRITE! This movie definitely shows the potential that DC's future holds. Keep em coming. Suicide Squad 2021 and the Snyder Cut both exemplify that the corporate bigwigs need to stay out of the writing room, and let superhero fans write movies for superhero fans. It really produces some of the best work. Go see this movie, you will be wholly entertained. It's awesome.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I can't complain about any comic accuracy in the movie because Gunn knows what he does right and picks C/D-list characters that no one ever cared much about this way he can tackle and make completely his own, which I respect. Hopefully Guardians 3 is better and he can have his own trilogy.","186 out of 427 found this helpful.

This go around is a second attempt that yields vastly better results and a film with heart and soul, even if it's not for the squeamish. Fair warning: You will be grossed out at certain points. If you can swallow hard, you'll find a way to enjoy this film notwithstanding. It takes the earlier film's original concept and reinvents it as a geopolitical power struggle with a solidly isolationist point of view. It's a superhero film that morphs into a bristling indictment of America's foreign policy missteps.Two groups of notorious criminal mercenaries are deployed by the government (some of them as a return engagement) to invade a small South American island and knock off a U. S. enemy whose potential influence in world affairs poses a threat to U. S. standing. The events that follow are full of twists and ugly, at times nauseating, revelations. It's actually a trip watching this knowing next to nothing about the plot. But fair warning, have a plastic bag close by. This is not for the kiddies. The ending is uplifting but also disgusting enough that it subtracts from its greatness.It's a ferocious, multi-layered and at times hilarious adventure and one that ends up being a depiction of how arrogant America as a superpower can become in taking advantage of its imperial and technological superiority. That's high-minded filmmaking where you'd least expect it. Amid the squalid surroundings and blood-spattered corpses, there's a battle-hardened sense of idealism at the center. In that regard, the film easily exceeds expectations and delivers in a big way. Recommended to those who like an off-the-wall cinematic experience and a film that you have to respect, warts and all.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I kept coming back for more with this movie with it's gore, humor, fantastic music choice, and characters. Trust me if you wanted to see more action and limbs being removed in the DCEU you will not be disappointed with this movie. You want a good laugh? This movie makes the humor feel natural between each of the characters and for me it definitely doesn't seem forced, I've laughed at the same jokes every time I've watched this movie.2016 Suicide Squad was a chopped up mess and this time around in 2021 this movie redeemed that. The pacing, transitions, and character development feel right on the bullseye.This is what DCEU, especially suicide squad should be. James Gunn did a fantastic job with the direction of the movie. It takes turns that you might not expect and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what's going to happen next. Are you gonna laugh, cry, gasp, gag, who knows?I really loved this movie and will more than likely watch it a lot more throughout this year waiting for the next movies and tv shows yet to be released. Going down as one of my favorites. I believe this would've been a box office hit if it weren't for Covid-19 and the release on HBO Max.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A Fantastic Film That Lives Up To The Hype","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7674379/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2021","At the beginning of the year The Suicide Squad was my most anticipated film of 2021 and last night I finally got the chance to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of super villains bought together to take down a new intergalactic threat.Main Character
Idris Elba is given the chance to be a lead character here as Bloodsport and he is fantastic. His comedic timing is actually very good, and he has plenty of heartfelt moments and is really effective as a character. There is an argument that his character is incredibly similar to Deadshot from the previous film but I feel Elba manages to add enough to make this character his own.Supporting Characters
This film has one of the biggest casts ever put on film but some play larger roles then others and without spoiling things I will talk about them. John Cena makes his debut as Peacemaker and he was a real highlight of the film for me, his character is so interesting and Cena manages to use his natural charisma to make this a memorable character showing that given the right material he can deliver. Margot Robbie is back as Harley Quinn and what is there to say, she was literally born to play this role and brings the character to life so well. There are some things involving her character I wasn't a huge fan of but there is no denying how great Robbie is in the role. The real breakout star for the film though is Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, she bring so much heart and emotion to the role and considering that she is one of the least known comic book characters ever, she really resonates with the audience and I think we will see much more from this actress in the future. Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis are back as Rick Flag and Amanda Waller from the previous Suicide Squad film and they are much improved here. Flag is actually an interesting and well realised character and Waller is the intimidating boss that she really should be. We also have our big CGI character in King Shark voiced by Sylvester Stallone and he is so cool to watch in action and there is also some heart towards this guy and he will probably be one that people will talk about coming out of the film.Story
The story is decent, the chemistry between the team is so much better then the previous film and the unique and distinctive personalities of each squad member does shine and provide a great experience. The task that they are given is fun enough but it is these characters and the outrageous circumstances that they are put in that rise it above. However, this film does have some story issues, mainly what they do with Harley Quinn in the first and mostly second act, she is on her own and it feels a bit out of place and a slower placed part of the film. Also there is some side plot involving a corrupt government and resistance that doesn't really do much for the film and feels like another not important element of the plot.Script
The script is really good, it has that James Gunn directed wicked humour. With the more mature script it allows way more creative freedom and the majority of the characters are pretty funny. Some of the jokes feel a bit repetitive but I can't deny that I laughed pretty consistently throughout the film. The drama also works, I ended up caring about this group of bad guys and I think the film does an effective job of giving you reasons to care.Style
The style of the film has some really great and entertaining action sequences. This film has the violence and gore that is appropriate for a film called The Suicide Squad. The characters get there own big set pieces and the action is probably the best part of this really well paced out film.Overall
Overall, The Suicide Squad is a fantastic film that finally delivers a film worthy of the licence.

It has memorable characters who develop throughout the movie. It has over the top action that can always be remembered and it's visuals are absolutely striking. I'm a 16 year old who dreams to be a filmmaker and I really connected with this movie. Of course it's not for everyone yet if you don't mind gore and language I don't get why some people didn't like it. James Gunn keeps producing one good comic book movie after another like Super, Guardians 1 and 2 now this. Also what stands out to me in a good movie is the soundtrack. In all the big budget movies these days they just pick the most popular song they can and put it in a scene it only half works in. Yet Gunn chose his own music and it completely worked. I love this movie so much and I rarely rewatch stuff but I can watch this again and again. HIGH RECOMMEND.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Easily the best DC film (admittedly not a high bar), it's huge, it's silly, it's irreverent, it's what big screens are for, with surprises from start to finish.

(+) the characters are so stupily adorable, almost all of them!(+) this results if you put great characters and actors (just like the first movie)together and just completely ignore every aspect of the the 2016 film and simply do a modern funny Comic movie which doesnt takes itself so serious(+) King Shark(-) u dont really get an emtional connection to most of them, because you already know what happens to many of those guys
(-) a lot of people will hate me for this...but I think Harley Quinn is not necessary for this movie, I love Margot Robbie. But even after the first film I didnt really understand the whole hype. I would rather had more screentime for polka-dot-man and ratcatcher. DC just completely sucks the juice out of Margot Robbies way of Harley Quinn...they shouldnt!DC is so much more than that. And I think with this movie they came a lot closer to the MCU. Overall is TSS 2 wayyy better than the first one, a 180 degree change.

This is the exact opposite of Suicide Squad 2016. A reflection, so to speak.Because that movie was one of the worst movies ever made.James Gun is certainly a clever writer with some hard hitting wit and sense of wicked fun, that's almost impossible to mistake, the movie actually manages to become the Suicide Squad cinematic event we all deserved, all those years ago.Yet, I didn't even realize it was R-rated until someones face exploded in a gory close up. This movie really gets in your face, but in a good way.There are tons of nice and exquisitely cheesy, but wholesomely heartfelt character moments, that give every last one of Suicide Squaders an opportunity to shine. And shine they do!This is a horrifically fun movie with some great subversion. Expect the unexpected and enjoy the hell out of The Suicide Squad!But it's not for the squeamish.

And holy crap does it make the previous Suicide Squad look like crap! Yes I've said crap 3 times Lmao but THIS is his BEST film and honestly the BEST DC movie thus far!Think of Guardians of the Galaxy, but bigger, better, stronger and on crack lol! Every single character in this film is enjoyable to watch from the very start to finish. Even the main antagonists are enjoyable. Gunn got the perfect cast of Michael Rooker, Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Sylvester Stallone and more! Couldn't be a better cast, but I will say this, Idris Elba steals the show in this one in my opinion and it shows! Everyone else is phenomenal too, but seeing Elba's performance in this film kinda blew me away. I think it's his best acting performance I've seen in a movie. He's good in a lot of other things, but he shows so much emotions in this. There was a prison scene in this where he just knocks it out of the park, but of course I'm not gonna spoil it. Didn't know the main focus would be on him, but you really feel for his character, his fears, his struggles, etc. You also get to know everybody else's stories and you care enough for them as well! And the Shark and the Weasel LOL funniest and best characters in this! From going on crazy adventures, to being in due or die situations, badass gory executions and emotional conflicts throughout the film with these characters,
Gunn has established it extremely well to where you cannot be bored with this film.If not for the R rating, it probably wouldn't have been as fun, but the gore/blood in this is INTENSE! Be prepared! I was surprised how much gore I saw before my eyes and it's way more than the New Mortal Kombat! Visually stunning effects of the weapons, the scenery, the powers and abilities, the fight choreography, the random text in scenes, the cinematography, the soundtrack, just HATS OFF to the whole entire team on everything to make this masterpiece a FUN ride for the screen for the DC fans and regular audiences. This is the BEST film of the year so far and I think it may be my favorite of the whole 2021 year probably.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Took a daring risk with James Gunn, resulting in one of the best superhero movies in recent memory.Unfortunately, the film suffered commercially due to its release timing and simultaneous availability on streaming and in theaters. One downside is that the portrayal of Daniel Melchior's character's Portuguese origin is undermined by the fact that she and her father converse in English, an oversight by Warner Bros.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters were done with such taste and the story was excellent. It's awesome to see the good side of the bad guys. Going back to Gunns vision from between scenes and the little animations to the choreography and fight scenes are just well calculated. I experienced something from this action movie I haven't in any other action movie I've ever seen. IMO the best action movie I have ever seen in my life. What a brilliant imagination and concept from a true artist! Well down.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Proper rated-R content with extremely gory, bloody action sequences, which are impressively shot and choreographed through long takes, exceptional stunt work, and surprisingly outstanding VFX.With the help of a witty soundtrack, James Gunn brings his dark humor to an expectedly hilarious level, though not all jokes land in a still generic screenplay filled with the usual cliches and formulaic developments. Nevertheless, the phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout.Each squad member receives decent screentime to share their emotionally compelling backstories, transforming a superhero movie into a character-driven story instead of just a team of superpowered nobodies beating up a random CGI monster.Gunn just can't seem to miss.""Rating: B+","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

Not really a huge fan of Gunn to start as I always felt the first Gaurdians is his only decent movie. I won't go into too much detail for spoilers. But generally, the flaws were definitely in the directing and writing. Some really talented actors were wasted here by Gunn's overall bad cinematography and lackluster writing. Most of the jokes fell flat and some were just plain creepy s.i.c (Harley Quinn)... The villain(s), plot, and subplot were all incredibly boring and forgettable. About the only good thing in the film is the chemistry between some of the actors.(notably Idris Elba and John Cena). I had quite a few laughs but on the whole it wasn't enough to justify this an enjoyable experience. If this movie is better than Suicide Squad, it's only just so. Another miss for the DCEU.","13 out of 22 found this helpful.

Enormously. Was it violent? Yes. Did it use humour to lighten the mood? Yes. Does it show John Cena in tighty whities? YES. Was any of it out of place? Definitely not. We're talking about comic book antagonists who are forced to partake in life threatening missions to shave years off their sentences and who are completely expendable. Will they have the same moral issues as Tony Stark or Peter Parker? Heck no! Not sure what some people expected, but clearly they were waiting to see some WGA award nominated masterpiece and Michael Rooker in a white wig delivering an Oscar worthy performance.This is buttered popcorn certified entertainment for adults. It's a 100x better than its predecessor. It's built up as well as it could be with a cast of dozens. And it delivers on its promise: a superpowered version of a 70's war movie. James Gunn went all out on this one and made it as absurd as could be, but somehow managed to give the movie heart and enough character background to actually care for these people. Not gonna spoil any of it, but if you're into dark humour, R-rated violence, walking sharks with a dad bod, rats and comic books: go see this. You're welcome.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is funny, action-packed, relentless and unpredictable. So much better than 2016, and really most other movies these days. You gotta know what you're going to be watching going in though, as I think most--if not all--of the bad reviewers had no idea what Suicide Squad is supposed to be at all. Some seem to think this was supposed to be a drama, some thought it was supposed to be The Avengers lite, some thought it should've been a plodding, deep character study of write-off, z-grade villains from lost issues of forgotten DC books that no one cares about. One guy, I'm pretty sure, watched the 2016 movie and thought it was this one because he mentions long interludes of nothing. There's no way that guy watched the same movie I did, but could definitely be describing 2016's SS. These people then rate the movie based on what only they wish it was, even though their wish is theirs alone. Anyway, while some people are clearly watching the wrong movie, if you enjoy fun AND know how to let yourself have it, then get up on this. It's awesome and EXACTLY what Suicide Squad is supposed to be.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The rivalry between John Cena and Idris Elba had me laughing, as well as the one and only Sylvester Stallone playing King Shark which was just hysterical. Plus, Harley Quinn had some awesome moments as well and this movie didn't need any Easter eggs, cameos, or references to be good by itself. James Gunn proves once again (alongside the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise) that he can handle unique characters that play off of each other well, along with great CGI!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

DC should give up now on superhero movies genre. They can never ever match Marvels super hero line ups and stories no matter how much hard they try. This piece ""The Suicide Squad' in particular tries so hard but fails at everything. Pathetic storyline, poor acting & casting, humour at it worst and above all nonsensical direction.

I also am not a lifelong comic fanboy. I would be classified as a novice fan at best. And as much as I did enjoy the rawness and grit of Snyder's contributions, Gunn seems to get what DC comics were all about in my opinion. While Marvel comics always seemed the more gritty and dramatic contribution to me, DC always had more of a comedic undertone. I really believe that if DC embraces this it will be their ticket. This and Doom Patrol are clearly in the same cinematic universe. I don't know if Snyder is a fan of that masterpiece or not, but this film and that show fit together like a grilled nanner and peanut butter samich with bacon. It shouldn't work in theory but is totally epic in execution. Hopefully the success of both projects will influence DC's future.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had a very good time with this movie. It is fun. This film is far from perfect, yet it just works. There is something very satisfying in watching this film. Not only because of the story, the characters, action scenes etc... but also in the way all these elements are put (smartly) together.The movie does nothing extraordinary; it is in essence similar to the previous Suicide Squad. Similar plot, similar themes. But, the mere fact that there is someone behind the helm, with a clear voice and an unobstructed vision, feels like a lost art. The film is very reminiscent of Guardians of the galaxy but with a bit more of an edge. Although Guardians was very irreverent already, it feels that this movie goes even further. Takes an even bigger risk and is bolder. On the other hand, it is reusing a lot of superhero tropes and device that simply are effective. Nonetheless it is great. There is a hundred ways I could describe how this movie is superior to most of the superhero movies we are subjected to again and again. I'll just mention the moment with the bullet sizes, there is an early setup and later there is payoff. It feels like it is something we've never seen in this genre.This film is refreshing, it is fun, and it is original. You could nit-pick some things, like the weakness of the action scenes, or the blandness of the setting. (a lot of it reminded me of The Expendables). But that is so minor compared to the joy this film displays. You can feel that the film has been made with love and care, but still with a self-deprecating distance that allows it to not make the mistakes these type of films fall in. The film is sincere and heartfelt, yet at the same time it knows how tongue-in-cheek some of it can be.This film had no right to be as good as it is. It is a remake/sequel of a film everyone hated or made fun of, its creative voice had been arguably been fired and disgraced, never to work in movies again. Even the star-studded cast looked like a recipe for disaster à la Cats. And lo and behold: the concept when executed cleverly, and without dismissing the earlier film no less, is compelling and engaging. James Gunn it turns out is the only one in Hollywood to get the superhero genre, to understand its grammar. After the success of Guardians, everyone started cramming pop-songs in their movies. Gunn once again shows the world; it turns out, the needle drops need to be relevant to the stuff on screen. Who knew? The acting and the characters developed start as generic and boring as possible, yet they build into something unique and memorable. I loved Bloodsport, I related to Harley, I understood Polka Dot.I can't recall the last time I was so delighted by a comic book superhero film. There was Logan, which was a bit more melancholic, the first Deadpool movie which was more nihilistic, or Shazaam. But none of those really hit the spot the way this film does.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

James Gunn certainly delivered.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7214391/?ref_=tt_urv","Spartan_1_1_7","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8202613/?ref_=tt_urv","10 August 2021","Well, there is no competition about which version is the better one. Sure, the execs at WB are still to blame for a lot of what happened with David Ayer's version as well as the DCEU, in general. Their incessant pestering and moronic need for control ruined a lot. This time, James Gunn got to do what he wanted and the result is a solid comic-book flick.Using his experience from Guardians of the Galaxy while also having to ""redo"" this property, Gunn doesn't waste much time and jumps into the Squad and keeps it focused on them. Tight writing combined with charismatic and, in general, great performances from virtually everyone gives nuggets of development, small or large, throughout the runtime. You get attached to the characters rather quickly and small moments here and there build upon it in a smooth flow. I can't name one character from the Squad that I didn't like and it was genuinely tense when things got hairy between them.Then you have the violence and gore in well-directed colourful action sequences with top-notch CGI for the most part (King Shark looked awesome), which was glorious and just FUN to watch. I'm so glad this was Rated-R and Gunn used that to its full effect. It also aided in the humour that worked well with its dark undertones for the most part. Sometimes it did kinda fell flat on its face but those occurrences were spread out. The soundtrack was pretty good overall with some tracks elevating the scenes/moments superbly.The plot itself, while most of it being standard affair, the end goal of it, though, was interesting. Although the final act is where I would say the movie faltered a bit with some stuff giving a feeling of being rushed, at the same time, having that Kauji up in this story was a great decision and made for one hell of a finale as well as having this mystery that kept you hooked early on.Having all these wacky characters and making you care for them is no easy task and it just goes to show how much a good writer and director matters. Hell, this is THE BEST Margot Robbie's Harley Quin has been in any of her appearances.Overall, it's the best comic book/superhero movie I've seen in a while and is one of the best from DCEU. And compared to what Marvel has been putting out recently, this easily stomps on all of it. I'd definitely recommend it regardless of if you liked the previous Suicide Squad or not or haven't even watched it. It's just a bloody good time, proper escapism. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10.P. S That Rat quote around the end hits so well, one of my favourite scenes from the movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had a very bad feeling about ""The Suicide Squad"" when I watched the trailer, later confirmed once I got out of the theatre.The plot is bland and the characters are unbalanced. Too much focus is given to Bloodsport, Harley Quinn and Ratcatcher 2. The rest of the squad has really marginal roles. When you have talents such as David Dastmalchian, and you give them such small screen time, it is a real waste. At least the first movie did not have this issue. John Cena is okay as Peacemaker, but he could do a better job. Rick Flag, in the previous chapter, was essential to keep the team together. Here his part is significantly reduced. Honestly, the movie would be the same even without him. I have appreciated King Shark, that gave a hint of goofy comedy, and managed to release a bit of tension. Overall a downgrade, on the characterization side. A real pity, with more effort they could have done something unique and remake this movie properly.There are some creative visual effects and the CGI is wonderful. There is a lot of gore, violence and blood. I am happy that DC is showing some explicit images. This is exactly what I expect from a Suicide Squad movie. I am tired of this censored joke that Marvel is building up. James Gunn nailed photography and cinematography. On the technical side I don't have any remarks, for sure it is way better than its predecessor.The fact that this is a popcorn movie, does not justify releasing a film that has a flat storyline, dumping completely any form of character or plot depth. I am not expecting a meaningful movie, but I wish to see more logic, not just a bunch of action scenes. Probably this is what most of the fans want to watch, but does not cut it for me. The flick wants to be comedic, and at the beginning there are some scenes that are genuinely funny, but most of the jokes later on are very forced and not funny at all. If you are a fan of the DC universe, give it a try. It is still an enjoyable and entertaining watch, especially if you are with friends. However, this could have been way much better.","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

The storyline follows a ""suicide mission"" on an island that needs to be executed and those who would execute the mission faces impossible odds. They need to infiltrate a base and destroy it. The base houses aliens set on world domination and has thousands of troops protecting it. Based on the odds and those selected for the mission, what could go wrong? This movie is directed by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and stars Margot Robbie (Wolf of Wall Street), Idris Elba (The Losers), Michael Rooker (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer), John Cena (12 Rounds), Viola Davis (The Help) and Pete Davidson (The King of Staten Island). The storyline for this is very straightforward and the action scenes are appropriately over the top. The dialogue is funny and pretty clever and the film starts off very good. I really enjoyed the introduction of the characters as they are rolled out and the mission begins...and then the movie entirely falls apart. The focus on one character at a time as they executed their action scenes was terrible. It just become blatantly bad. I'm not sure if it was an artistic attempt or DC Universe sabotage by Gunn. The initial villain was very good and the movie should have probably stopped there; unfortunately, they decided one more super villain was needed, and it was an abomination. Overall there were aspects of this film that were entertaining and this film had some potential, but trying to be too stylish and creative sunk the ship of this having any hope of being good. The first one was much better than this. I would score this a 3/10.","87 out of 191 found this helpful.

This is a movie that knows how to be artistic and entertaining at the same time. I'm not a fan of the superhero genre, and I usually watch them for the simple entertainment factor, but they often fail even at that. This movie is not that case.Entertaining and well designed. It offers constant non-stop action and at the same time keeps us encapsulated thanks to a good character development that manages to maintain a precise balance between being funny and serious. It's not a super dramatic end of the world movie, but it's an intense scenario that offers excellent variety and a story that, while not super original, is well executed.Probably the most unexpected thing for me was the choice of unexpected artistic shots. Like excellent psychedelic scenes that play with the visual effects or camera transitions that break the 4th wall for a moment. Add to that a good selection of indie-rock music and we have a colorful movie, full of personality and hilarious.Even if you're not a fan of the superhero genre, this movie treats it both satirically and seriously, combining just the right elements to deliver something entertaining. In that case it reminds me of Thor Ragnarok, but of course, with much, much, much more violence.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is not just super hero movie, but also a little bit drama with psychoanalysis assumption of theory inside it. For example how they are connected to each other with a same vision and mission, how is the appearance new comer King Shark can change the way of group thinking, and the dramatic scene of Harley Quinn with her new lover, are compacted one to another to be a great plot to be smoothly watched. Several times I can laugh. I never read about comic book of Suicide Squad, if this had been written, but I assume that this movie can describe what the author wants to see on the big screen.

Consider them the DC version of The Guardians of the Galaxy. Who directs those wonderful films? Why, it's James Gunn of course! A sweet knack for blending fun and humor into Badass. I had low expectations for this movie going in. They'd just introduced The Suicide Squad a few years prior and tried to make them a B-Team Justice League. Adding in a new Joker played by Leto. It sucked. So much, that I've still never even seen it again. So much that when they now took another stab at it, they didn't even bring back (former) A-Lister Will Smith lol. Embrace the weird a la Guardians! And they did. This movie is super sweet! This movie is so fun and cool, you don't even care that barely any of the characters have any name recognition. Nor do you care they're fighting a Star Fish hahaha. It's just great. They embraced what they shoulda been all along and now they've got a wealth of spin-off series and movies sure to please down the pipeline.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And if Warner Brothers put trust in the creative vision of their directors more often, they would get more raving reviews. (Un)surprisingly, letting them step out of the box means they get original pieces of art like this. But this is definitely a start. I cannot wait to tell EVERYONE to watch this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But, way better. Hell, even a better soundtrack than the ""original.""I think new-to-DC James Gunn KNEW this soft reboot of 2016's Suicide Squad would be predictable as all hell, and just ran with it. There were virtually no twists not foretold long before they happened and the character's arcs easy to forecast. But, that's okay. Gunn's filmmaking style and storytelling approach, in conjunction with a cast with extreme chemistry was refreshing.The Suicide Squad's back, sorta, and this time they're out to squash an alien. That's it. That's their mission. Of course, with a title like this, it ain't gonna be easy.I loved Margot Robbie again - still the best thing in the original theatrical cut, original extended cut and Birds of Prey. I miss her when she's gone and her scene-stealing when on, welcomed. Luckily, however, we also got the enormously charismatic Idris Elba, a FAR superior Bloodsport than Will Smith could've dreamt of. And I even loved the hilarious Land Shark, Polka Man, the cute driver, Milton and the ""Oh, Rats"" Girl. I actually didn't have a problem with any of the characters here. Or their acting.Being a Gunn movie, it's well written and shot, naturally. But, while I loved how Hard-R this was (there was a penis shot,) and I'm no prude whatsoever, I found the use of the F-word...excessive. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem, but every time they used it, probably 30-35 times, it felt like they were purposely putting it in to make this a Deadpoolesque Adult Comic Book Movie. Basically, a ton of the time, it was unnecessary and actually dragged down Gunn's typically smart dialogue.Second half's WAY better than the first, but once the movie kicked in, I was completely on board and loved it. Plus, again, that music - really kicked ass here. THIS is how you use music in a Suicide Squad movie.***Final Thoughts: Okay, Time to Update my Best-to-Worst DCEU list:1 Man of Steel

Gunn manages to take some lesser known DC villains and craft an entertaining story around them, similarly to what he did for Guardians back in 2014, talking of Guardians I feel it's important to compare the two films.I found Guardians much funnier and more emotional than The Suicide Squad and I think this is due to their being to many characters introduced in one movie. There are tons of villains and ""heroes"" being thrown around meaning there is less time to form a connection with any of the characters, I also think that while the music in Suicide Squad is good it's no match for the music in Guardians, lastly I think the CGI in Guardians was better, I don't know if there were time constraints or budgetary reasons but neither King Shark or Weasel looked as good as Rocket did in Guardians which was released 7 years ago.While all this may come off as negative The Suicide Squad was still great, my last criticism though would be the villain, without giving any spoilers the villains in this film are like the characters, numerous and ever changing and similar again to Guardians and Ronan we never get a good feel of what the villains are about, all I remember about them was that one was sexy, one was a General and one was big.These grievances may sound like a lot but on the whole the film was fun and kept my attention throughout and I am nit-picking here, give the film a try and make up your own mind but I would say that this feels like a fresh new take on a genre that is quickly becoming tired, a breath of fresh air after the disappointment that was Black Widow, if DC keeps this up with The Batman they may even have a chance and defeating Marvel.","10 out of 29 found this helpful.

They're not expected to return, and they definitely won't if they stray from the mission, or disobey direct orders, and have their implanted explosives detonated.It's the kind of ridiculous, contrived concept that we don't expect to work outside of a comic book. Not even in an adaptation. And yet, it does, incredibly well. You'll be surprised by how much you care about some of the members. Others are deliciously despicable, and we hate their guts. The level of interpersonal conflict is fun, and yet you can believe that someone would intentionally put all these people together. The action is tremendously enjoyable. No two characters are overly similar, no one disappears into the background, everyone does at least one major memorable thing, and like in Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn(Robbie, continuing to prove she's the perfect choice, she completely understands what makes Harleen tick) is given great scenes, dialogue, depth.James Gunn brings all of his strengths to this. He handles the ensemble cast without getting bogged down in their introductions: instead, he uses an impactful, if short one for each, giving them something quick yet defining to do early after we meet them, and, of course, utilising, without abusing, the useful narrative shortcut of exposition. This is emotional, if not as much as the two Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The use of music fits and is effective, not on the nose boring choices that play only very briefly, and are followed up maybe a minute later with another cue. While I have to admit that this is the first R-rated picture of his that I watched, I would definitely say that he should get to do more of these in the future. It still doesn't feel like he's awkwardly constrained when he works with a PG-13, but he really knows how to use the freedom here. We do get ridiculous amounts of violence(and swearing. It is thankfully nearly completely devoid of gratuitous sexuality and nudity, that would only distract. Of course I wouldn't be against it if it served a purpose; there is no time in this when that would have been the case, though) that is expected from this kind of thing, yes, meanwhile, We also get some legitimately powerful, disturbing material. Of course not every film has to ""have something to say""; however, it can be extremely gratifying when we see one that does(and does it well), and this is one of those instances.I recommend this to anyone who finds the trailers appealing. They give you an excellent idea of what to expect. 8/10.","17 out of 56 found this helpful.

It is not possible to satisfy every DC fan (same apply for marvel fans). This movie is certainly in the top 3 DCEU movies in my opinion. And to be honest In my list it will come on TOP in the DCEU movies list. Its characters and actors are strong points. Story too, is well written. No doubt far better than the previous Suicide squad movie. Casting looks perfect for me and actors/actress has done their job very well. Peace maker whose ways for making peace are very violent, Bloodsport who is a bad guy but somewhere good is in him. Our beloved Harley Quinn is also there to annoy or better say entertain us and the best thing in this movie is King Shark. Polka dot man and ratcatcher you just name all characters are written very well, dialogs are good and memorable. Little bit of backstory/introduction is also given for all main characters, except Harley as we have already seen her backstory in previous DCEU movies. So non comicbook fans will also not be confused. Not just superhero fans, casual watchers can also enjoy this movie who don't know much about DC. And I loved the Humor/Dark humor. Action is worth watching. Not to mention it is R rated movie and there are lots of violent, gory, cursing scenes. It is only suitable for mature audience.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Out in theatres and streaming on HBO Max. It's the standalone sequel to the 2016 Suicide Squad film, which was rated PG (huge mistake) and pretty average.Written & directed by James Gunn, The Suicide Squad is rated R and so bad ass. A huge upgrade from the first. It's relentlessly violent, not quite hilarious but at times very funny and even a little emotional. I didn't see that last one coming.An amazing cast. Is there a better actor than Idris Elba, who is Bloodsport. Margot Robbie, once again as Harley Quinn and my god was she viciously beautiful. Simply deadly. The biggest surprise was John Cena, who is Peacemaker. Now mind you I just watched Fast 9 yesterday and I didn't like him at all in that (all due respect of course). Here, Cena steals the show. He was full of good jokes and so likeable. Hats off my friend. You killed it!Daniela Melchior is sleepy Ratcatcher 2, probably my favourite character who is surely taking a nap as I write this. Although other characters lacked development, which reduces my score a little, we get quite a bit of backstory on her & her friend who is always by her side, Sebastian the rat. I don't know who I love more, Sebastian or Splinter from Ninja Turtles.Although I did find that every character got plenty of screen time, Joel Kinnaman as Colonel Rick Flag probably had the least, leaving him feeling dull and boring. Sylvester Stallone is King Shark whom I loved, David Dastmalchian is Polka-Dot Man who is creepy yet a friend you can trust and Viola Davis is Amanda Waller, director of the Task Force X program.I really enjoyed most of what this film offered us. The cast, the music, the action, heck, even ""Project Starfish"" was pretty cool. The visual effects/CGI were amazing, especially considering how much of it was used. There's a lot of destruction here.They're labelled as super-villains but you'll be calling them superheroes in no time. 2 extra scenes. Awesome movie totally worth the price of admission.Who was your favourite character?8.4/10.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A nice surprise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7207927/?ref_=tt_urv","AscendeSuperius","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur119213216/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2021","Truth be told, I came in with zero expectations. While the movie on the surface seemed a little like gory slapstick comedy with a touch of the ghostbusters remake, it was the little things that really brought it to a whole new level. Every character had a place in the film. And surprisingly, Harley Quinn wasn't my favourite this time! Instead, it is Nanaue the King Shark. His character takes that of a man baby of sorts which really just wrapped the whole thing up nicely leaving your heart warm and fuzzy inside. The polka dot man did not disappoint. While his mommy issues character arc is nothing we haven't seen before, it is a well executed one and it simply works.While I know I have not touched on the elephant in the room, well, starfish really, in this film, it felt more like a backdrop to know the characters better rather than the meat of the story really.And so I say, give it a try. It's a whole lot better than the original (which was great, but average great), and not your run of the mill action movie. And for me, the fact that it threaded into feel good territory just sweetens the deal.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

You fail to follow my orders in any way, and I detonate the explosive device in the base of your skull.""Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. The Suicide Squad is a remake/reboot of the disastrous 2016 Suicide Squad, and it's significantly better! At this point, I don't care too much about the DCEU and saw this on a whim. My only hopes included James Gunn, Margot Robbie, and a killer soundtrack. All met or exceeded my expectations and more. James Gunn is such a great director and he puts every inch of style into this. It radiates with humor, action, and heart. And that's one thing I absolutely didn't expect going in. At least one scene was actually pretty emotional. Working at the theater, I find myself going in to do a theater check just to watch that one scene. What they got right is something to care about. With the first, we were with characters who we knew were most likely going to be killed off soon, and therefore left with the rest that had no character development besides Harley Quinn. We may have a good amount of characters killed off in this (and most in comedic ways), but the ones we're left with have enough character to them.I'll skip out on the returning actors since we all know how well they fit their roles, though I will say Viola Davis went all out as Amanda. Idris Elba gives a stern and comedic portrayal of Bloodsport. He grounds the team with the right amount of seriousness and motivation. Sylvester Stallone is hilarious as King Shark. David Dastmalchian steals the scenes as Polka-Dot Man. His character has deep issues and they showcase it in such a fun and interesting way. But by far my favorite character and actor actually came from Daniela Melchior. I didn't know who she was, I didn't know about her character, I knew nothing. She was fantastic as Ratcatcher 2 and I loved her enthusiasm throughout. As far as story goes, it's silly and not meant to be taken too seriously. When you find out what they're actually facing, and it is shown in at least one of the trailers, it might make or break it for you. I, for one, found it wildly entertaining and a fun third act. The over 2 hour runtime has thrown some people off, but it flies by so quick. It might be because I wanted to see more, and I'm fairly certain we're getting more after how successful this was. There's just so much excitement within this. From the story to the characters to even something as simple as the score, which is pretty good, it's hard to find something not to like. This is one of, if not the most fun movies I've seen in theaters all year. HBOMax thankfully has it for us to watch for free, but it's a movie that I want to see in theaters again. If you haven't seen The Suicide Squad, I'd highly recommend it. It's extremely violent, vulgar, and an absolutely blast. Probably the funniest movie we've seen and will get all year (shoutout to Weasel for the hilarious moments every time on screen).","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

There is absolutely no emotional connection to any of the characters. It has some creative exposition here and there to give some backstory, but it's disjointed and detached, and never goes anywhere. Gunn employs creative title cards, but they make no sense visually. There are attempts to show simultaneous events in subsequent sequences, but there's never any ""I wonder how we'll end up where we left off"" moment.The movie is wickedly violent, and there's lots of expectation subversion, but ultimately none of it means anything or has any effect on the story that follows. Ultimately it felt like a collection of scenes that were written to be humorous and unexpected, and they were, but they forgot to link those scenes into a meaningful whole. What's left is a chaotic mess.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

I can see people thinking this one is far too weird and bizarre . But for me that what makes this film so brilliant ; raw-- politically incorrect -- uber violent. The shock factor alone sold me from the very beginning. Absolutely an eccentric ride envisioned by writer-director James Gunn's singularly skewed vision, The Suicide Squad marks a funny, fast-paced rebound that plays to the source material's violent, anarchic strengths.Welcome to hell--a.k.a. Belle Reve, the prison with the highest mortality rate in the US of A. Where the worst Super-Villains are kept and where they will do anything to get out--even join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X. Today's do-or-die assignment? Assemble a collection of cons, including Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2, Savant, King Shark, Blackguard, Javelin and everyone's favorite psycho, Harley Quinn. Then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. Trekking through a jungle teeming with militant adversaries and guerrilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave...and Amanda Waller's government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement. And as always, one wrong move and they're dead (whether at the hands of their opponents, a teammate, or Waller herself). If anyone's laying down bets, the smart money is against them--all of them.'The Suicide Squad' represents the very best that DC films can be, taking the kind of risks that you wouldn't see in a Marvel property.Its has dark wit ultra violence and refusing to apologize for it . Those who dig its bat-s h i t crazy tone will have a lot of fun watching this crazy, chaotic -- and unexpectedly good -- flick.","10 out of 30 found this helpful.

Now I personally didn't actually mind the first suicide squad (which I know will not please some reading), but this one is so much better. It's just fun and incredibly entertaining.I'm not gonna talk about the DC universe, or compare to the first. I'm just gonna rattle of my thoughts on this film only.So the characters were all so unique and loveable in different ways. Really made you root for every single one of them. They all had good depth to them as well, rather than kind of just throwing everyone in and leaving them to it.The action scenes were also really cool and fun. Yes there is a solid amount of gore in this one, but it was done in a much less serious tone to something like Saw.I thought the pace of the film really holds up as well. Never felt bored at any stage and there didn't seem to be any real stoppages.I thought the cinematography and certain camera shots were so cool and different to what you normally see in films.Now, some people I've seen complain that it's ""too silly"". I don't agree in all honesty. I think a couple of the jokes were slightly forced out (mainly in the first 20 mins or so). But the tone of the film really levels out and there's some really humorous parts that genuinely made me laugh out loud.I don't really have much negatives to be honest. I would have liked to have seen more from the ""villains"". The character The Thinker you see for a single scene before the final parts. Just give us more on him, who is he? Etc.But yeah, it's a really fun film that I'd recommend to anyone debating it. It's entertaining, colourful and exactly how you'd expect a James Gunn film to be.

It is extremely funny, and the action is also really well handled, especially (sorry for my bad writing lol) at the end. The stakes at the end are suprisingly pretty high.Idris Elba and Margot Robbie crushed it, as usual.I can say this with confidence: This is my favorite DCEU film.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

But I saw that there was a lot of positive reviews for this one and more importantly, it was directed by the amazing James Gunn, and I said I'm 100% gonna watch.And oh my goodness, I got absolutely blown away from start to finish. I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in months. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I am not afraid to say it and I don't care what some pretentious people think.The cast and characters were so good and so funny and so unique. The visuals and especially the gore is absolutely awesome. I'm so happy this is an R rated movie, it makes it 10x better. And the humor is really funny in this film. I never was a fan of Harley Quinn but I liked her in this one, she has beautiful scenes in the movie. And oh man I absolutely adored John Cena, he needs to be in every movie I don't care lol. The man's charisma is off the roof.I really don't have anything negative to say, mostly small insignificant nitpicks, as the case with all movies really.James Gunn makes fantastic movies, and in my opinion I really would love to see him make every single other DC movie from now on.WB made the right choice by making James Gunn do whatever he wants with this one. I'm really happy that a DC movie is actually really good for a change. I mean the only Marvel movies better than this one were Infinity War and Endgame, and I'm a huge Marvel stan. I'm really looking forward to seeing The Suicide Squad 2 if it's coming out. And future DC movies too if this is how WB are making their movies.I don't want to spoil anything, all I'm gonna say is this movie is a 10/10, absolutely amazing, fun, beautiful, brilliant. If you're reading reviews before watching this movie, I highly recommend you watch it.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Gunn is a master at films like this. There is a near perfect blend of comedy, action and heart. The writing is pretty great and everyone plays their part extremely well with each having their own character building moments that help you grow to care about the characters. Polkadot man in particular stood out to me and was way cooler than he had any right to be. The main ""villain"" was pretty great too although he didn't have a huge part because it was more about the characters that you'll grow to love.

While for many, including myself there's alot of very small details that are easily missed due to all the great cinematography. So to really understand how amazing it is you may have to watch it multiple times in order to appreciate just how great this movie is. Well I'm not a person who likes metaphors in movies this has a very straightforward concept of setting the tone early on that everyone is expendable which is why they are called The suicide Squad to begin with.If after watching the opening scene you immediately assume after that nearly everyone is most likely going to die by the credits that is the way it was intended. Yet, as the movie progresses you cant help but not feel sad when one the characters does die but yet when compared to the opening squad there is no connection at all, which is done purposely in order to make you appreciate the later characters that much more.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie is just a hell of a lot of FUN. Fun action scenes, fun humour, fun special effects. I had a smile on my face through most of it. Bloodsport is a cool guy, Harley Quinn is wonderful in this, and Ratcatcher is an interesting addition. The cinematography is well done, the music fits perfectly, and the story is fine, but ultimately serves mostly as an excuse for a fun freaking time (though my curiosity has been piqued by the somewhat open ending...). If you're looking for a silly, gory, and not-suitable-for-children anti-hero action flick, then look no further. I had an absolute blast, and honestly can't wait to watch this again in a year or so.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I also think that the movie being rated R made a huge difference compared to the 2016 Suicide squad being PG-13. These types of movies are made to be rated R. Also the soundtrack was really good!

What we get is Suicide Squad the musical that bores us with predictability, MTV action and the complete and utter pointlessness of hiring quality actors like Idris Elba, Peter Capaldi etc. When the director has no intent of utilizing their abilities.The story is not worth mentioning since it's only function is to serve as a backdrop for the directors ""creativity"" (aka Joss Whedon level comedy and assaults on the senses through ""action"").That said, the movie is competently made from a technical standpoint and delivers a few chuckles here and there. Although those chuckles might be difficult to pick up on among all the cringe.In conclusion I give the movie a score of 4/10, but the sheer audacity of bringing back cinemas queen of stupidity: Amanda Waller, forces me to give the movie another point for a total of 5/10 - another forgettable comic book movie.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Anyone who preferred Ayers version and rates this a 1 star I think you missed what makes this so special. This film has a lot of heart and at the center of it is our core cast of characters. They're all flawed and interesting in their own ways and I find that really special. They aren't perfect do-gooders but they are heroes. And they can feel pain. My biggest issue was King Shark seemed to be invincible.If you preferred the last film, sure everyone has their personal taste but don't be mad that people are enjoying this film more. The characters are more realised and the action is far more fun and entertaining. It has style and that's much more than I can say for 2016's mess of a film.

"5","/10","Gunn without Structure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7254984/?ref_=tt_urv","davidmvining","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110212703/?ref_=tt_urv","21 August 2021","I think it's pretty obvious that James Gunn doesn't agree with me about ensemble movies, not that he thinks they're easy, but that we differ on how good ones are constructed. I feel that ensemble movies are hard because you have to create a variety of different characters all swirling around one thing, and that their journeys need to interrelate on some level beyond the mechanics of plot to help reinforce the central point of the film. Gunn sees ensemble pieces differently. He seems to see them as large canvases for him to fill in with whatever his imagination deems amusing at the time with little regard to structure. There's definitely entertainment to be had with Gunn's approach, but I ultimately find it a frustrating kind of entertainment that's fun in spurts but ultimately feels like its constantly stopping and going instead of being handled by an artist who understands exactly where the narrative train needs to end up.Gunn's haphazard approach to structure often works against him, but I feel like his opening to The Suicide Squad actually works fairly well. We are introduced to Task Force X, a team of half a dozen criminals with super abilities sent to the small Caribbean nation of Corto Maltese. Led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), they land on the beach in the middle of the night and immediately get wiped out by the local army leaving only Flag and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) alive. This is told through the eyes of Michael Rooker's Savant, brought into the mission and our very quick introductory eyes into the rules of the world, including the pressure that Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) brings to convincing these prisoners to go on her missions for her, and ultimately how she deals with people who refuse her orders (heads go boom). All of this mission, though, was a mere distraction for the actual force with the actual mission, though, and the way the film jumps from the distraction to the real team and then back in time three days to see how the real team was formed is an amusing misdirect that I feel like is a fun way to begin the film, especially when you consider the gore that Gunn loves to wallow in, being able to put it all on full display with this R-rated DC comic book movie.The real team is led by Idris Elba's Bloodsport, an assassin who can't miss, followed by John Cena's Peacemaker, David Dastmalchian's Polka-Dot Man, Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 (her father was the original), and Sylvester Stallone as the walking shark Nanaue. These five have the mission of finding Jotunheim, a secret installation, home to Project Starfish, and destroy it after the country of Corto Maltese has fallen to a military coup. This cast of colorful characters gets moments throughout the film to highlight their unique personalities, and there's interest to be had here. If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be Polka-Dot Man, subjected to alien experiments by his mother that gave him an extra-terrestrial virus that manifests in the form of circular, primary-colored discs that he must expel in one way or another twice a day. The problem is that his back story comes at the most random time where all progress in the story unnaturally comes to a stop for him to tell his tale.And that's the sort of thing that happens to all of them except the characters that we already know, Flag and Quinn. In between, there are definitely amusing bits like the competition between Bloodsport and Peacemaker as they walk into an enemy camp, brutally murdering enemy combatants along the way to the central tent, trying to one-up the other with Bloodsport realizing, in comedic fashion, that Peacemaker had the better time of it than him. But, instead of moving on with the story, the effort to capture the scientist in charge of Project Starfish to get them inside, we have to catch up with Quinn who has been captured by the military and brought to the president because he had fallen in love with her. Again, this isn't necessarily bad stuff, but it's the story grinding to a halt completely to tell what essentially amounts to a nearly unrelated short film.I will say this, I think this is the first time that Harley Quinn feels right. I don't have a lot of history with her, having only watched The Animated Series a bit as a kid and never reading her in the comics, but moreso than in the original Suicide Squad and definitely more than in Birds of Prey, Quinn feels like an interesting character as she kills the president because she got a bad feeling about him, and she made a promise to herself to do the right thing the next time she got a bad feeling about a man she was involved with by murdering him. When she breaks out of captivity on her own, it's the absolute best use of her from an action sequence standpoint so far. Gunn knows to give her lots of guns and plenty of environmental tools to make her sequence where she kills several dozen soldiers feel believable, and the effect of taking it somewhat subjective by having flowers explode everywhere as the sequence crescendos is actually quite nice to see. My problem is that this sequence feels like it could have been pretty much cut completely and we wouldn't have missed anything particularly important to the actual story at hand.The actual story, if you were going to dig through the morass of different threads, seems to be about American efforts to push off its dirty work onto third-world countries, and it doesn't really manifest until something like 90 minutes into the 130-minute-long movie. America hired Corto Maltese to study a space starfish that expelled smaller version of itself that attached to the faces of people and starts controlling them, turning them into extensions of itself. The rest of the film is this huge battle to take it out, using everyone's special abilities to attack Starro in a weird version of the ending of The Avengers (I would be surprised if Gunn wasn't consciously mirroring the MCU team up movie), and it's nice to look at.That being said, though, it ends up feeling like a purely technical exercise because it's just the latest in a series of events. It doesn't feel like the culmination of a story. The whole 90 minutes that preceded it was a random collection of moments of people, connected only by the barest of mechanical plot strings. There's nothing thematic undergirding the earlier moments that brings them together with the larger plot in the form of the giant Starfish that attacks the city, so I end up looking at this finale as mere spectacle and nothing else. It's pretty in the Gunn twisted kind of way, but I end up feeling like it's really empty.I know this film is getting pretty universal praise, and I sort of get it. It's thinly entertaining, but it doesn't really gel overall. It's the best the DCEU has been since Shazam!, though.","21 out of 40 found this helpful.

I showed this movie to my girlfriend and she really loved it.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action is good, the story though admittedly pretty goofy is still a fun and very well told tale of expendable inmates that embark on a suicide mission to be rewarded with a reduced sentence. The highlight for me is the characters. This movie boast a colorful and likeable cast of characters, some notable ones are the needlessly brutal but hilarious Peacemaker, the unapologetically kind Ratcatcher, and the endlessly loveable but underused King Shark. Everyone knows that the original Suicide Squad was a soiled diaper piece of trash film, with boring characters and ridiculously awful writing, but this movie proves to be the exact opposite. The writing was great, the character development was phenomenal, and the action was awesome and well shot and was pretty graphic as well. This movie is awesome and is a must watch for people hoping for an actually good film from DC. If James Gunn's ""DCU"" projects are like this, then I see a bright future for DC fans.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was not looking forward to this movie after the first film. But after hearing James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) was directing it I was intrigued. There's so many ways this movie is better than the first. It's comical, you end up caring for the characters, the film progression and development flows great, it's just all around a great movie.Also, no one can make animal characters like Gunn either (I.e Groot and Rocket the Raccoon). They always seem to steal the show in every scene they're in. King Shark is that character in this film. Every scene he's in is amazing.Overall, great film. Don't let the first one prevent you from seeing this one - 9/10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Characters are fleshed out better, the story is much more cohesive and there is gore that definately was missing from the previous film. James Gunn has a vision and he executes it damn near flawlessly.Idris Elba did a much better job than Will Smith as the leading character and this is coming from someone who isn't that much of an Elba fan. You tend to fall in love with all of the characters as they all have their own motives for what they do. I feel like Harley didn't get as much shine in this one as she's had a solo movie and the first suicide squad practically revolved around her.My only gripes are that, there are a few scenes of animal violence that could have been left out as they were unnecessary. My gf who is an animal lover was thankfully out of the room during that time or else she would have stopped watching right then and there. I also would have preferred the ""smart intellectual"" version of King Shark from the Harley Quinn animated show. I think he could have been an even bigger icon and had much funnier and witty conversations with his crew rather than being only able to utter a few words at a time.All in all, I highly recommend this movie if your looking for a good popcorn action filled time. Much better than the first and everyone involved from cast to behind the scenes did an amazing job.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And I am not a fan of superhero movies. Last one I watched was Deadpool 2. I did not find that movie very engaging because of the overflowing meta-humour, matter of preference.The strength of this movie is in its balance of visual comedy and action. Which was also prevalent in the director's previous movies. Such as guardians of the galaxy vol 2.Pros:Throughout the film I had plenty of laughs and there were an abundance of funny scenes. More than your typical superhero movie.The action scenes were very engaging and eye-popping.The characters in the suicide squad were extremely unusual but it magically works to its benefit. The actors who were playing them were excellent. My actor MVP in this movie is Idris Elba.Cons:Some comedic scenes tend to be quite bizarre and may not work for all the viewers.As in any other superhero movie, there is plenty of action and an ensemble of ""unique"" characters. However, I fear that this movie is yet another one in the long list of superhero movies that is going to be forgotten. Therefore, I would definitely recommend you watch this in the cinema.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

He steals the show and I hope to see him in future DC properties. There are tons of surprises and everything is filmed with James Gunn's unique style. The humor lands for the most part as well.As far as critiques, I think the third act is pretty long and could've probably been edited down. Also, Harley's fight scenes, while impressive to watch, seemed a bit crazy given what her character's skills are supposed to be.I'm honestly just ecstatic to actually see Starro in a live action film. Definitely something I never thought would happen.

Other than that, it was absolutely phenomenal, the acting was great, especially for John Cena who isn't traditionally an actor. All the character's actions and motivations are clear and i like how Waller gets some comeuppance. I like most of the Harley Quinn scenes in this more than in the original Suicide Squad, which was somehow rushed and slow at the same time. I like how fresh Peacemaker is, as a hero who will do whatever it takes to make peace unquestionably. I noticed how this movie is a little divisive, but i emplore y'all to take it less seriously, this isn't Shawshank, but i think its a fun movie to watch and is pretty satirical (ex. Reoccurring javelin, reoccurring bird with Savant) it may be a little coincidental at times, but it's usually acknowledged in an entertaining way (ex. Harley with the ornamental revolver)","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Gunn refuses not to have the most fun possible when making movies, & that fun 100% transfers to the audience, consistently surprising us at every turn. Full of ultra-violence, hilarious performances, unique needle drops, ultra-violence, & loads of juxtaposed silliness, TSS is a psychedelic superhero masterpiece.","10 out of 31 found this helpful.

The Suicide Squad has EVERYTHING the first lacked: actual synergy between the main cast, in-character actions dictating the story instead of braindead logic 'uniting' villains who wouldn't trust each other with sandwiches; basically The Suicide Squad is what Suicide Squad tried to be but failed to realise. This one's story was a blast, the humour was fantastic as was the action and James Gunn's direction trumps David Ayer's film by EVERY millisecond.It's beautiful how much better this film is to 2016's flop: King Shark, Peacemaker, Bloodsport and Harley Quinn are easily the stars of the show here; the characters actually feel like double-crossing yet well-defined people instead of the superficial out-of-character superheroes of the first movie. Basically The Suicide Squad does its damnedest to apologise for 2016's film in EVERY way imaginable and it succeeds in spades.The Suicide Squad is the film we deserved the first time around, but thank Christ there's a good film in the DCEU again.This films gets somewhere between a 9-10/10; haven't really decided on the final scoring yet.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

The DCEU has finally made their first genuinely GREAT movie! (I haven't seen Zack Snyder's Justice League yet). This is what we've been waiting for from the DCEU. I had high hopes coming into this considering all the praise it was getting, and I was not disappointed at all. This film is the most James Gunn thing I think I've ever seen. It does NOT hold back at ALL in terms of sheer absurdity and impossibly chaotic moments, which is just amazing. It is very reminiscent of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, but it wouldn't be a James Gunn flick if it wasn't. It's super funny, lively, and knows how stupid it is, which is why it works. I mean, this has to be one of the most absurd concepts/story scripts ever written. And we love it. It also has some truly great flashback/backstory moments for some of the characters (one in particular) that really give a sense of humanism to them. Not to mention some beautiful shots/cinematography throughout and some great performances that add to the supreme vibe of the movie. The first Suicide Squad movie has none of this, and remains one of my least favorite movies. I don't understand how THIS movie manages to just be so much better and less cringe than the first, just goes to show that when treated with care, ANY film can truly be great. This is the REAL Suicide Squad!","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

(which isn't a surprise since it was The Guardians of the Galaxy's James Gunn directing from the beginning...)But here's what's more interesting: this could be a formula DC uses to carve their new niche: one that blends the camp, pop and humor of Marvel movies, but also leans into the graphic violence that a lot of comic book fans (who are largely in the 18 - 34 crowd) will likely enjoy, but will never get from the combined Disney + MCU machine.If DC keeps up this angle, they just might breathe new life into their Franchises.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Fun and Funny Re-imagining/Reboot by Gunn and Crew but Expectations Were Too High","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7230511/?ref_=tt_urv","CANpatbuck3664","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tt_urv","14 August 2021","Superhero movies are starting to evolve, its a crucial and necessary step to stretching the longevity of the genre. The Suicide Squad changes gears from the Ayer version (which was a disappointing yet mixed bag of a movie that I still enjoyed) and the 2021 entry is more of a war movie with action/comedy elements. I wouldn't categorize it as an epic but nothing felt out of place or inauthentic in this portrayal of this universe. There's enough time paid to the people of Corto Maltese (and their plight) to set up stakes and the creative team is successful in dropping you in along with the squad with the understanding that lives are hanging in the balance (both with the residents of the island and the squad themselves). You're rooting for both the squad and the people to prevail despite long odds and more than a few enemy troops between them and the former Nazi science compound that needs to be shut down.It's interesting that James Gunn's involvement has become a big reason to go see The Suicide Squad and in my opinion, its deserved. The Guardians of the Galaxy movies are hugely popular for a reason and he's been instrumental in their success as both the writer and the director. A notable change is the R rating and there's more than enough blood and guts to go around in this film. This is a staple of Gunn's pre-Marvel work and despite the fact it may limit the audience, it fits the tone he's going for here. It also adds to the laughs (if you enjoy that sort of thing), I had to chuckle at King Shark ripping someone in half or someone melting from being peppered with colourful polka dots.Warner Bros. Seemed to listen to the fans in regards to the casting, they kept the members of the cast that everyone liked from the first movie and discarded the rest. Margot Robbie returning as Harley Quinn is the headliner and she continues to be fantastic as this character. She gets Harley's humour, her edginess and violent nature as a character and she's quite the performer when it comes to the stunts. As long as she's portraying this character, I'll be happy to go watch in the theatre. My next favourite was David Dastmalchian as the Polka-Dot Man. The gags with his character made me laugh consistently and his deadpan and reserved energy worked for me. Joel Kinnaman was given more to do as Rick Flag but he also elevated what was on the page and I liked him more in this version. I also liked Viola Davis more as Amanda Waller, she's a great actress but she's given more free reign and she comes off as more nasty and menacing. John Cena continues to be hilarious, Taskmaster and Bloodsport trading insults and trying to one-up each other were highlights for sure. I also liked Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, she's the heart of the movie and while some scenes with her border on being too sentimental, she was always a welcome presence. I'm a big fan of Idris Elba but while he was good, I thought they could have done a better job of differentiating his character from Deadshot (played by Will Smith). They had the exact same energy and I feel like they could have given Elba more room to do his own thing with the character.The other required element of the tentpole superhero movie is some killer action. The Suicide Squad went a different direction with the kind of villain and flunkies that villain used but I think the action and the stunts got the job done. Harley's escape from the detention cell was the standout for me but I did like the liberation of the camp as well. The action was good, I wouldn't describe the set pieces as uninteresting or unsuccessful but minus the brutal violence (which I didn't mind and added some tension), there wasn't anything earthshaking and that's fine (having seen most of the superhero movies, I may just be a little desensitized).The 2021 version of The Suicide Squad is the better movie on almost every level. Its funnier, the characters are more memorable and the R-rated moments help give the movie stakes. The cast is great with both the returning members lighting it up on screen again and the new additions bringing the fire. Gunn's love of gore and the weirder aspects of our villainous team also make for a more distinctive movie that's going to age better. But this is a case where all the critical praise and the hype just put my expectations a little too high. Its a great movie, but it never hit that ""blew me away"" level I anticipated it would. I still enjoyed it enough to give it an 8.5/10 but I'm rounding down because its more solid to me as a opposed to truly amazing. I'd love to see another movie with this creative team and this cast though, if you're interested and feel comfortable going to see it in the theatre, I think its absolutely worth it.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I would reccomend The suicide squad to any DC fan and casual fans.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

No time consuming and useless dialogs. Movie proves that Suicide Squad called that way for a reason. It definitely has a different vibe from any other DC movie previously done, but now I can't imagine The Suicide Squad movie to be done in another way. Thank you James Gunn and the whole crew behind the film for an amazing product! Will definitely watch again and recommend you all to do the same if you want a good comedy and action.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Plot, truthfully rather thin and generic, may be silly fantasy but then again most comic books are. The Suicide Squad is an example. James Gunn goes wild with the violence and profanity but doesn't forget that anti superheroes could be vulnerable and you end up empathizing with them. The Don't Get Attached warning from Gunn holds true as members of the Squad gets picked off in gory fashion. It is a bloodbath. Top rated performances from Daniela Melchoir, David Dastmalchian. Margot Robbie is at her prime as Harley Quinn and she's a riot! Idris Elba holds his own as Bloodsport. His character and John Cena's Peacemaker's banter may seem jock-like but it works. Viola Davis smashes it as the ruthless Amanda Waller. The only niggle is Peter Capaldi's The Thinker was underused. All in all The Suicide Squad is a fun popcorn flick that doesn't really take itself too seriously so don't take the film seriously. Just enjoy the ride.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Just as another batch of witless guards were ingulfed by a flamethrower, their comrades still pounding the beat obliviously.This is silly and fast paced and rammed full of jokes.So rammed in fact that a lot won't land for everyone.But this film should give everyone a few chuckles by brute force alone.There is kind of a story, I guess. But that doesn't really matter here. The characters are quirky and fun and have just enough back story to keep it interesting without slowing things down.I don't follow DC so I don't know if the characters follow cannon etc but I was only here to watch some stuff blow up whilst people wisecrack anyway.This is very, very violent.It is like a live action, old-school, Tom & Jerry Cartoon.People get stabbed in the eyes, set on fire, limbs blown off

He just gets the sub-genre so well. His own spin that he puts on these movies- that mostly feature less-known comic-book characters- is so comedic and filled-to-the-brim with mad action, that you can't help but connect deeply with these characters that unless you were a die-hard comic reader, you'd have never met or perhaps even heard of, before. Credit to Mr. James Gunn, and credit to Warner Bros for realising that a Suicide Squad movie needs to be unhinged, and props to them for finally understanding that in order to get that, you need to give the director full control- sorry David Ayer!Idris Elba's ruthless mercenary 'Bloodsport' leads this band of mad bad-guys, with Joel Kinnaman's returning 'Rick Flag' and the fan favourite 'Harley Quinn' (played brilliantly by Margot Robbie) act as his second-in-commands. However, the two characters that shine best for me were John Cena's 'Peacemaker'- a violence-obsessed hitman always looking to one-up Elba, and David Dastmalchian's 'Polka Dot Man', who is a quirky, quiet supervillain who longs to be a superhero but is tragically plagued by his traumatic past (involving none other than his own mother).Despite the cliche plot and underdeveloped villains, The Suicide Squad builds to an awesome third act that is actually the best that the DCEU has produced yet! What stops it from toppling 'Man of Steel' as the best DC extended universe movie is the slightly less impressive score and, obviously, a villain that is nowhere near as memorable as Michael Shannon's excellent turn as Zod.Still, a damn fine movie. An excellent one- by comic-book movie standards.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The suicide squad: ridiculous, gory, funny and entertaining. 80%","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7324109/?ref_=tt_urv","dfle3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4025773/?ref_=tt_urv","9 September 2021","Looking back at my review of ""Suicide squad"", I see that all the negative criticisms that I had about the original are now positives in the later film with nearly the same name: this time the characters are engaging; this time it doesn't matter if you have no idea who these characters are; this time I laughed more than once. I laughed numerous times; this time the soundtrack wasn't used to substitute for the film's inability to offer up anything engaging or entertaining. The early use of Johnny Cash's song ""Folsom Prison blues"" was relevant. It reminded me of how dark his lyrics were, when he sang: ""I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die"". Wow! That surely sets up the characters we are about to see!; lastly, I think that this film actually has some repeat viewing value, given enough time between sittings.Now, the plot. Does anyone really care about this for Hollywood comic book related multiplex offerings? If you insist, a team of supervillains is assembled in a notorious gaol in order to undertake a black op of a suicidal nature (hence the film's title) which, if successful, would see the surviving supervillains get a discount on their gaol sentence. Of course, the supervillains need an incentive to cooperate with the authorities running the covert US government operations. The black op will be centred in a fictional island off of South America and science fantasy elements will feature.Idris Elba's supervillain character of ""Bloodsport"" is engaging, as far as what motivates him to join the suicide squad. There's a great scene where he meets his daughter for the first time in a long time. Margot Robbie's character of ""Harley Quinn"" is no doubt considered by the studio to be the pivotal figure of this franchise but I must say that I found John Cena's turn as ""Peacemaker"" much more enjoyable, especially early on, where he contributed more than his fair share to the comedy quotient of this film. Later on, Harley Quinn's narrative arc did become more satisfying but not being a consumer of the comics or cartoons, I can't say that she held a lot of cultural cachet for me (I really have to mention Chloë Grace Moretz' wonderfully brilliant turn as Hit-Girl in the comic book related film ""Kick-Ass""). As an Australian, I was surprised to be actually amused by some dialogue from Jai Courtney's ""Captain Kangaroo"". I can't remember having that thought for the first film. It wasn't exactly champagne comedy from him but at least it was passable.This revamped Suicide Squad seems to have been written by actual, professional screenwriters who know how to construct a good popcorn movie although, I have to say, with the amount of blood and gore in this film, I'm not sure if everybody would be glad to have chosen to be eating something whilst watching this film. In Australia, this film has an MA 15+ rating, so it has blood and gore but unlike a horror movie, there's not a lot of detail on the gore, if that's any recommendation. Given my comments about the first film in this franchise, I would hazard a guess that that first film was written by the studio's marketing department, with input from the accounting department. A rubbish script, in other words.Another aspect to the comedy is how some of the characters say things that the audience is no doubt thinking, like how ridiculous a character's superpower is. Since I'm not familiar with the comics or cartoons which inspired this film franchise, I can't say whether all the characters here have featured elsewhere. But gee, David Dastmalchian's ""Polka-Dot Man"" is a ridiculous concept for a character. Sylvester Stallone's ""King Shark"" isn't much better. There is some fun to be had with these characters though. Perhaps this kind of treatment of the material is because of the impossibility of taking it seriously? That's why this film treats it subject matter so ironically, perhaps. Maybe it's just me though. Watching The Dark Knight trilogy, I came to realise that Batman is actually a boring character and I just wanted to see Heath Ledger's Joker dominate proceedings in the second instalment. Speaking of The Joker, he isn't in this film. That's not something that bothered me at all either. In any case, the characters in ""The suicide squad"" to give one the impression of this is like watching children play pretend and coming with some cheap, home-made ideas for comic book characters, hence the risibility of it all.On the subject of ironic treatment of material, this film eschews film clichés like text on the screen indicating place or proceedings. Instead, elements of the picture will form this information, to interesting effect at times. If that's not the kind of thing that you find clever, at least you might appreciate the frequent use of callbacks as far as character proceedings go. In other words, a scene will recall something which happened earlier with a particular character.Lastly, I should note that the film does critique America's real involvement in that part of the world, as far as supporting brutal regimes go (or least it can't but help remind us of this). There's actually a funny moment in this film where a revelation is made after you see the suicide squad kill a lot of people on their mission. They pretty much embody, at that moment, America's foreign policy strategy and outcomes in the real world. Perhaps that outlook is common in this fictional world? Could you describe that critique of US foreign policy as 'woke'? If this film was directed by Jordan Peele, an African American, would it be considered woke? I ask that because I've noticed that Peele's soft reboot of ""Candyman"", entitled...""Candyman"", has been review bombed on this site for being ""woke"". Reviewers here are actually using that word. This speaks to who has the 'right' to critique America.Stay for the post-credits. It might entice viewers to watch a sequel to this.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Let's just say it wasn't very good, From the awkward writing and character's dialog to the very dumb and weirdly convoluted storyline.. There's a 10 thousand years old witch that wants to destroy the world, Let's send a boomerang guy, A crazy clown lady and Will Smith to stop it, Yeah.. It was pretty dumb, Even for a Suicide Squad movie and the PG-13 rating didn't help it either..Birds of Prey wasn't as bad as Suicide Squad but still, It was pretty bland too with so many bland and underdeveloped characters and a predictable storyline about some little girl and a diamond with a good but (again) unfortunately underdeveloped villain..All hope is lost.. Nobody interested is a new Suicide Squad movie and it looks like It's the end of an era, Until.. 2021 A new Suicide Squad movie is coming out with an R rating okay okay, With a whole new cast of characters with some returning from the first one okay this is getting interesting, DIRECTED BY JAMES GUNN.. TAKE ALL MY MONEY, So you're telling me that the guy who made GOTG and Super and wrote the two cinematic masterpieces that are Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is working on this film, I am hooked and Gunn thankfully didn't disappoint!The Suicide Squad is one of most fun comic book movies I've ever seen in a long time, This movie is everything I wanted the first Suicide Squad movie to be and more, Where do I even start with this one, This movie got James Gunn written all over it, From the amazingly hilarious intro to the end of the movie, The movie never made me feel bored or uninterested, The action scenes are so cool and creative and felt very alive, The story is still pretty dumb but It's dumb fun unlike the first one..And the characters.. Oh my lord the characters, Where do I even start with these guys, First of all Idris Elba did a great job playing Bloodsport, He's so awesome and charismatic as the lead and he's way better than Will Smith, Not to say that Will did a bad job in the first movie or anything, It was the director's fault more then anything really, but Bloodsport and his interactions with the other characters are PRICELESS, Let's just say that the scene with him and John Cena's character Peacemaker in the forest was so creative and fun, I had to stop the movie because I was laughing so hard, It's that good, Polka-Dot Man was aldo very funny and endearing, King Shark is so wholesome and hilarious, I seriously love everything about him.This movie as a whole is just great fun, It's exactly what a Suicide Squad movie should be, A bunch of stupid criminals go on a quest to fight a big bad evil monster guy and I loved how different and distinct every character's weapons and abilities are, Makes every character feels more unique and special and I really loved how surprisingly emotional the movie was, Like seriously, I didn't expect to actually.. care about these characters, Like some scenes I actually found myself on the edge of my seat because of how tense I was watching it and let me tell you this movie is BRUTAL.. Like brutal BRUTAL, You see the R rating and this movie takes full advantage of it, The kills and deaths are very creative and bloody, It's actually very amusing.My only problem with this movie was how they handled Amanda Waller's character, I felt like she was very one-dimensional and predictable and that's weird because this movie is everything but predictable but other than that, The movie was awesome, You don't even need watch anything before it, Even though It's technically a sequel this movie is really It's own thing, Really shows how good this movie is!A crazy, hilarious and fun movie with surprisingly heartwarming moments, This movie is the REAL Suicide Squad movie, and you can thank James Gunn for that, Go watch it, You won't regret it!","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Has been pushing out DC films to try and keep up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In all that time, theres was probably one good movie made in the original Wonder Woman. The rest of the films were tough to watch with horrible character development and even worse plot lines. Once Warner notcied that their DC universe was tanking, they needed to find a new strategy. So what did they do? They hired a successful Marvel director!With that being said, James Gunn delivers an excellent take on this anti-hero group and gives us a violent, emotional, and entertaining film that will be called the best DC film so far. The one aspect that really stood out to me was the character development. We are introduced to several new characters that all have great meaning and depth in this story. Gunn wrote these characters perfectly, giving each of them a unique background with the weirdest super powers one could think of. I came out of this film hoping we will get to see more from a few of them!In closing, I think Warner Bros. Has finally come to their senses and allowed a DC movie to be made with freedom and true creativity. This allowed Gunn to use the genius he showed us in Guardians of the Galaxy and apply it to an R-rated title that really delivers. In no way was this movie perfect, but I actually had a lot of fun watching a DC movie, and I could never say that before today.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Everyone knew that at very least James Gunn would provide a fun thrill ride, no matter the quality. Having seen The Suicide Squad earlier today, I can safely say that description does the film a disservice. That's not to say it's not fun and thoroughly entertaining, but it is also filled with heart, passion and excellent characters. Many have compared this to Guardians of the Galaxy, which I believe is inaccurate as this film has far more of an emotional crux than that one (as much as I love Gunn's former contributions to Marvel). Also, there are some rather tragic, nasty moments in this film that mean the R rating is not just due to the bloody violence (although it is one of the splatteriest splatterfests I have ever seen on the big screen), and can also handle mature themes that couldn't be done in a film aimed at a younger demographic. Everything clicks into place perfectly and you'll go through an emotional journey with these bizarre characters. A triumph and must watch for not just comic book fans, but also fans of well shot, well written, epically realised adventure films.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

By the time our team was assembled, I realized something: this is an ugly movie. The character design, sets, camera work, sound editing, and CGI are all poorly done.When it comes to the actual ""conflict"", there are too many plot holes to count. The entirety of the conflict hinges on one McGuffin after another. By the half way point, the directors realized that having emotional attachment to characters might be a good thing, but it's too little too late. Each time a character gave their sob story, I'm awaiting some dumb throw away gag to take me out of the moment.Thankfully, I got the good sense to leave 30 minutes before the end when I realized I don't care what happens to anyone.Don't repeat my mistake.

There's no scene for us to be bored and check the time. It had thrilling moments, terrific actions, blood baths and was hilarious.I loved every character but the man who stole the frames which he was in was King Shark.The trash talks and battle between peacemaker and bloodsport was exciting. Harley Quinn got what she deserved. Margot Robbie proved again she's the expert playing as HarleyI expected actions from the civilians conquered by the Starro. Because of that Starro felt like a not properly used threat . We know they'll somehow defeat the giant but felt shallow.The CGI was amazing (colourful like marvel movies :-P) so do the cinematography and scores, with perfect execution by James Gunn

Each character gets a chance to shine and the balance between the cast is good.There's a lot to pick apart if you want to, and I wasn't on board 100% of the time, but when it really clicked it clicked hard, and I ended up thinking this was really good. Easily my favourite movie in the DCEU so far, if it counts as a DCEU movie (disclaimer: I also haven't seen them all).","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

James Gunn was the perfect choice to direct this. Really fresh and entertaining with great and weird characters, great performances, great comedy, and really good action set pieces. James Gunn is completely unhinged, and you can definietely see that here. He takes this bonkers plot and characters and uses it as an advantage for his impeccable sense of humor, but he also uses it for some genuinely heartfelt moments. The actors have really great chemistry with one another. The banter between Bloodsport and Peacemaker on who is cooler was really hilarious. The film is very self aware, it doesn't take its plot seriously, but what it does take seriously, are its characters. You care about this team, you want them to accomplish this mission, and that is very important. This is my kind of superhero film. My only issue is that some of the jokes don't land, but that's kind of it, only one minor flaw that didn't take away any enjoyment I was having while watching the film. This is an extremely entertaining film that has explosive violent action, well written characters and heartfelt moments. And no, I'm not gonna compare it to the first one, unless and until they release the Ayer Cut.I still think Guardians of the Galaxy (Vol. 1) is a bit better.Oh, and also, Sylvester Stallone is fricking awesome as King Shark.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

After nearly 3 hours of digesting I am still processing just how chaotic this film was. It's not perfect, I'll say that. A perfect comic book film is hard to achieve. A perfect film of any genre is nearly impossible to achieve, which is why we only get one once every decade that becomes a house hold name, but that doesn't mean I don't think this film has the potential to become one.From the jump James Gunn waits no time getting into the thick of it. The opening introduction and beach shoot out are like the first drop of a roller coaster, start off big to get the riders heart racing and grab their full attention for the ride ahead. The rest of the story is non linear, which I love, so building up a pivotal ending to a scene only to then jump back in time and include outside stories that brought the characters to this disastrous fight scene or possible final moments, when done right, is brilliant. Very few people can do this correctly, Quentin Tarantino being one of if not the best at it. Not only was the way James Gunn leaves you at the edge of your seat for 5-15ish minutes, only to scale the full weight of what's about to happen, well done, but it hasn't really been seen in super hero films as much as it is here. Non linear story telling is very much lost in this genre, for the right reasons, but in comic books it's done very so often. The film is also, if you haven't read already, pretty graphic for a comic book film, not Deadpool graphic, like Amazon Primes 'The Boys' graphic, but with a better budget for more realistic blood and gore. It also shows the egotistical dim witted side of super heroes/villains that you don't really see in these films. Some of these characters have pretty deep storylines that although aren't finished are shown very gracefully and only a few times seemed a bit eccentric, one character in particular, but that never took me out of the film. Like I said this film isn't perfect, but the things James Gunn was attempting to do differently here he knocked out of the park. These characters were brilliantly played and told, but don't get too attached to them.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

NEAT. This was worth that bonus perk.James Gunn CLEARLY likes comics, and it shows in this movie and showed in Guardians of the Galaxy; none of the characters were insulting (outside of Harley, we'll get to her), and Gunn, nails it with the weird side character; The Weasel. And it seems DC/WB/AT&T allowed him to make at least ONE superhero character up, TDK and he's great for how worthless and awful he is.The movie is great, well paced, and timed. I've watched it 5 times now, also the soundtrack is pretty strong, but to be expected from James Gunn.Harley Quinn, what a botched character in both versions of this attempt to bring this group to the screen. Now, I'm not a comic reader, watched the cartoons as a kid, where she made her appearance. MY understanding is she was a REALLY skilled psychologist, who knew how to use her sexuality to manipulate criminals to help them, extract info out of them, etc. Was tasked with trying to rehab The Joker, he broke her, she became infatuated, etc. THOUGH, even as a sidekick, she still retained her intelligence and used it at times, even appearing as her Doctor form in the series. Yes the Joker Serum did some damage but not enough to make her an idiot like in this movie. The jokes for her are terrible. Rat Catcher 2, at least, is a well written character. There is ONE scene in this movie that harkened back to the GOOD Harley Quinn. When the dictator is trying to woo her. Then ultimately fails to.Also, no female nudity in this film that I can think of, some male nudity, weirdly enough, but not female. HUH. It's gory but earned. Never gratuitous. I didn't realise the Shark was played by stalone, didn't really know the cast, so when I watched it the second time, with that fact, it was easier to see that. But Gunn kind of pulls a Groot (which is a fitting comparison, two lumbering maybe special-needs characters), where ther is an effect on the voice that masks it.The characters were good, the action was great, amazingly controlled-chaotic camera work. LIKE, IT MADE SENSE, the camera movements. It wasn't like a ""Taken"" film. The camera moved with the characters in a fluid way. Seriously, those people were amazing. So many great shots.Only major issue I had with this film, was addressed in the ending. There is always that one character on the team that is so GROSSLY OP-ed in these films that could literally end the film, in this case, (about) an hour in. When that person's power was explained, that was my first thought, then they close proving my point in the end battle. It's not Polka Dot Man, though it did seem like those dots can literally tear through anything. SO maybe. At least with the end battle; they kind of explain away why his Dots don't do what they should do, due to an extremely fast regenerative ability.90% of the humor works, but again, for whatever reason, they gave all the worst gags and jokes to Margo. It's like DC actively hates that character. She was literally one of my favorite characters from the Animated Series.In conclusion, this marks the 2nd REALLY GOOD DC movie, the first one being Shazam. THIS, again, is a great lesson in, LET THE DIRECTOR MAKE HIS MOVIE, and STUDIO STAY OUT OF THE WAY. Wonder Woman 1 was okay. And I'm not sitting through 4 hours of Justice League. Normally, I'm a marvel fanboy. And while slightly ""MARVEL"" formula-lite, it doesn't come off as trying to APE marvel. They're having fun, and that's what people want, FUN superhero movies, put on the stupid costumes that would be impractical in the real world. Make they silly and colorful like Polka Dot Man's outfit. This was a nice happy median between modern superhero movies and comics classic.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

When The Suicide Squad got announced with James Gunn as writer and director, I regained faith and I'm so happy to say he didn't disappoint.The Suicide Squad follows a group of imprisoned convicts that join to create a task force and are dropped off at the island of Corto Maltese to complete a mission.With The Suicide Squad, James Gunn has made one of the best and most memorable comic book films in recent memory. Having the film be R rated opened up a lot of doors for Gunn and he used the rating as well as the creative freedom Warner Bros gave him to his advantage. He introduced me to characters I've never even heard of and managed to make them so much fun to watch. What was missing in the 2016 film was character depth and the bond between the squad. Gunn includes many funny moments that kept the camaraderie of the team going. There were also a handful of emotional moments from characters I didn't expect which leads into one of the film's biggest strengths: its unpredictability. Whilst Gunn's method of telling of the story doesn't break boundaries, he includes various surprises involving these characters that I honestly didn't see coming. Whether it's for shock value or merely a set-up for a joke, The Suicide Squad has moments that genuinely took me by surprise and kept me entertained.This is very much a James Gunn film. His style, which we've gotten accustomed to since Guardians of the Galaxy, is what increased the entertainment value for me. This film is filled with jokes all the way through. Albeit some of them fell flat but I was laughing my way through most of them. Gunn knows where to place a joke so that it doesn't take away from the more touching moments. I'm happy that Gunn didn't hold back on the violence either. The violence is very gory and over-the-top and the way it's all shot and edited is very well done. What really impressed me were the visual effects. Especially during the choatic third act, the CGI was immaculate and its consistency made this a very immersive experience. It's crazy how a film like Black Widow, a movie with a larger budget, has scenes that look much more fake than the ones in The Suicide Squad. An irritating aspect of the 2016 film was its soundtrack. Whilst being filled with fantastic songs, the songs themselves didn't fit with what was going on. However, Gunn chooses music that feels much more appropriate and compliment the scenes well.The performances were also fantastic and seemed much better than the ones in the 2016 film. I loved Rick Flag and Amanda Waller much more here with Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis giving strong performances. Idris Elba's Bloodsport is reminiscent of Will Smith'a Deadshot but Elba does a better job and is given more to work with. Margot Robbie is great as usual as Harley Quinn. John Cena suited the role of Peacemaker well and had some great moments. For me, the standouts were Sylvester Stallone as King Shark, David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man and Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2. I wasn't familiar with their characters but they were a lot of fun to watch and stood out to me.The Suicide Squad surprised me in ways I didn't expect. It's certainly not perfect as some jokes didn't work and I wish the villains got more depth. Nonetheless, James Gunn definitely delivered and I hope Warner Bros see this and give more directors freedom when it comes to these kinds of films.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Margo robbie as harley quinn is absolutely the best portrayal of the character, idris elba is awesome, and john cena was made for peacemaker role! Other characters are fine, except for ""the thinker"" really disappointed me! There are a lot of surprises in the movie, don't get spoiled , just watch it as soon as possible and enjoy!

I went into this neutral and came out a fan. What one would see as a straight forward plot but with a few elaborate twists along the way. Mostly though, the action was fantastic, the characters were likeable and the comedy was on point. The movie never drags and the way the story plays back and forth from past to present was a nice touch. Also, all the characters get a decent amount of screen time and there are enough small reveals about each one that lets the audience know where they stand among one another.

Well I'm in the latter category to be honest .I wasn't a big fan of the first ""Suicide Squad"" movie but I thought it was entertaining at least, and i loved the psychotic Harley Quinn, so I was hoping for more of the same but maybe a better storyline , but this one is just so ridiculous ! The actual characters are nowhere near as good as the previous ones , even Harley Quinn has been toned down a lot, She's no longer the psychopath she was in the other movie, she's a numb version of her former self, which is a big shame .And John Cena's outfit is just sad btw .. end of . The story just doesn't go anywhere, its pointless and boring in very big patches throughout the film and I was tempted to switch it off . It would have got less than 4 stars from me if Margot Robbie and Idris Elba weren't in it, they keep this movie afloat... Just !","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

John Cena as an actor is very bad and look very silly trough the all movie. Idris Alba is more convenient as a leadership of the new Suicide Squad . I found the movie pretty boring all along and didnt give me any reason to give my interest to it . I enjoyed some jokes that they made sometimes and the action scenes are pretty well made but its just spectacular nothing meaningfull or we didnt already seen before . The only thing that keep me watched this movie is to know how it will end and what will happened to Harley Quinn and the others members of the Squad . The visual Effects are still pretty well made but the story is pretty classic and dont give the same interest as the first one who were a little bit more interesting (characters past , reason to have empathy or reason to their behavior). I Didnt really enjoyed it and the most disgusting at all scene is when a guy is shot when he has no pant on him and we can clearly see his dick , so pretty graphic sometimes , just be aware about what you are watching .","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

We want grit, great acting, and some plot twists along with just pure, ""OMG LOL I'm having fun with this"" moments and this movie is all over that. Yes it's rated R... yes it's got some violent scenes which are creatively toned down, and yah VERY adult themes... WHICH IT SHOULD, it's a Suicide Squad movie...That said, this movie is just pure fun. You're invested in the characters.... not gonna lie, it felt like an Avengers movie WITHOUT actually introducing the characters one by one. But it had an edge and style to it that was SO much better than the Avengers.Great movie, 10/10. I'll easily be rewatching this in the future which is more I can say about anything Disney has released in the last decade.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Yes! I had so much fun with this movie. The first scene it self was pure gold. It's bloody, gory and wildly entertaining. The first act was excellent. The second act however was weak.Although the second act was weak, let's talk about the great stuff first. First of all, it's funny interesting, the colours look beautiful, gorgeous cinematography with great shots. The acting is excellent, like everybody is great in this movie. There are a bunch of unexpected scenes and moments. The action looks epic. The spectacle is epic. The first and third act is the best. The songs though are fun but sometimes underused. Still, great soundtrack. James Gunn is excellent in crafting a heartfelt delightful violent story. There are moments that have a ton of heart. And some very interesting time transitions instead of lazy texts on the screen.Well, there are a few negatives here. Such as the thinker, which is a underdeveloped character. Even though starro is great, but still a less intriguing character. Most of the stuff that Harley Quinn does in the second act is well a little forgettable to be honest.Despite a few problems the movie is a blood, action packed, fast paced superhero movie with heartfelt characters.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

However I couldn't rate the previous movie higher than a 6 I believe. It was disappointing to the say the least. This film on the other hand felt like a real suicide squad comic put directly into real life film. It didn't feel rushed or undercooked. It was dare I say, as perfect as it could have been made given the choices they made.I could have done with perhaps another villain, I hated the Enchantress from the previous film. I like a more grounded suicide squad story to be told and for the villain to be more grounded like The Joker or Death-stroke or even Lex Luther. Nevertheless that's my only grip with the movie. Everything else was beautifully shot and is a step in the right direction for DC.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The characters and the filming locations were so good. Of course, casting was good too. The storyline somehow was the same as the first one (just the squad having a battle with a new villian). However, this time the movie was way more intense and unexpectedly very bloody (especially, some kills were ""Mortal Kombat"" inspired). In my opinion, one of the top scenes of the movie was ""Harley's escape scene from the bad guys"", it was EPIC. The plot twist was nice. Anyway, I don't think that movie is better than the original, because both movies are awesome. Also, even though the movie's duration was 2 hours and 10 minutes, I didn't get bored at all, because it was extremely intense, that it didn't let you to rest at all.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's a big improvement from the first movie which was trying too hard to be edgy and dark (an overall big problem with DCEU, but not relevant to this review). THE Suicide Squad embraces the colourful, goofiness of comics beautifully with vibrant colours and silly, but entertaining characters. James Gunn went for a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe with a dysfunctional group of strangers becoming a team, just with more violence. There's ALOT of over the top gore that is done amazingly. The CGI in this movie is fantastic, despite the typically low budget for a film of this calibre. It shows what you can do with a great team and a clear vision.Can't wait to see what James Gunn does next.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The cast is great as well. Loved all of the characters in this team but there is not one, not two, but 5 standouts here, including John Cena as Peacemaker, Sylvester Stallone as King Shark and of course, the heart of the movie herself: the lovely and amazing Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2/Cleo Cazo, so much of the team's emotional and great character moments come from her and I can't wait to see what else Daniela does next because I love her and not
to mention, Sebastian was adorable. I do want to see more of Ratcatcher 2 in the future. Also, Viola Davis, Steve Agee and Jennifer Holland were amazing.

In superhero films based on comic books, we like to see more development of characters, twists and most importantly the storyline. Gunn's vision about the movie is just mind blowing there are few scenes to prove this(like 8 mins earlier, harley escapes the palace, rain scene etc.) . In this film there is always a comic book vibe that paces the film. In this 2hr 12 min movie we see development of characters like Bloodsport,King Shark,Polka dot man and there was always a reference given in the movie that how things are going (no comparison but in Endgame we see Hulk with no character development and just a line about how the transformation of him to professor Hulk took place , boring scenes in the time travel part, weak storyline and you can't say that the movie is excellent for just 3-4 scenes it should be overall a good movie) The characters of THE SUICIDE SQUAD were interesting like Peacemaker,King Shark, Polka Dot Man, Bloodsport, Harley Quinn, Colonel Flag which kept us engaged throughout the film. The film is full of blood, violence ,language and awesome music. So overall an excellent comic book movie which is meant to be experienced in cinema.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie is definitely somehting else. Not brilliant, but close...The good: great human like characters, I can sympathize with. However bizar these fantasy action characters are, this director AND writer managed to make them REAL. So nice. And the acting by Margot Robbie and Idris Elba is terrific. And let's not forget the many good supporting actors. A joy to watch!More good: this story has got a great build up and is well balanced, everything the original wasnt.IF you did not enjoy the first Suicide Squad (I didnt either), this sequel is miles ahead, WAY BETTER.There are some subtle tongue in cheek jokes, but not too many. Just the right amount. There is some fabulous action, but not so much I get bored by it. Just the right amount. There is some lighthearted drama as well. This movie is simply quite well balanced. Chapeau.Really beautiful photography, I mean the likes I dont see often. Really impressive. Great seventies soundtrack, with lots of classics that are to die for. These are the kind of technical details that I really appreciate!The story: Idris Elba is a dangerous criminal pressured to go on a dangerous mission. If he doesnt succeed his imprisoned daughter will get killed. Will he succeed in his mission? And the ever charming and wonderfully versatile Margot Robbie is there to help him out!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

You can subscribe for free hereGuardians of the Galaxy's James Gunn, who has written and directed The Suicide Squad, has injected the film with his particular brand of zip and energy. The DC Extended Universe's tenth film is violent and funny in equal measure. After superhero films became these brobdingnagian money spinners that everyone worshipped, the time was ripe to take them down a couple of pegs. There have been films and shows with an irreverent take on the meta-humans who walk among us. Gunn riffs off that sentiment with The Suicide Squad, which he has rightly described as ""its own thing"".A coup in the small South American island nation of Corto Maltese results in Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) sending two Task Force X teams (that is Suicide Squad's proper name). Team A led by Rick Flag, (Joel Kinnaman) is betrayed and all members except for Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) are killed in a variety of gory, grotesque ways. Flag is captured by rebel soldiers. While all manner of mayhem is happening to Team A, Team B led by Bloodsport (Idris Elba), is able to sneak into the island.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think it's because they want to rush too much. And they started to make Superman vs Batman movie without enough single hero movies before. It should be like a comic movie that has a few main characters first and then make the team movie.But this one is a very good commercial and entertainment film. Most people will love it even if they don't know anyone except the joker girl. This movie is much better than the first one and the Harley Quinn movie. I think it's also better than the Wonder Woman movie, the Wonder Woman movie looks more for the lower age audiences. After all, this is a R rated movie.The director of this movie is also the director of Guardians of the Galaxy. There are various people in this movie, but even if you don't recognize any of them, the movie is still pretty good. If you look at it this way, the movie shows the director's personal style in full.I don't know if the high-level Warner people intervene this movie or not. I enjoyed watching it very well, I suggest you to watch it! As soon as possible!","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

Unlike the last Suicide Squad(2016) film, this film holds nothing back, not a film kids will like.The cast seem to play off each other perfectly, I love the witty banter between Idris Elba who plays Bloodsport, and John Cena who plays Peacemaker. Not to mention Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, although it's not focused on her too much, but when it does she really does shine. Viola Davis is also great again as Amanda Waller. Plays well as an action film and black comedy, this is a DC movie for adults, not for the whole family.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

This time, I approached it with a more open mind, and while I didn't hate it the whole time, I still ended up hating it by the end. This is definitely a James Gunn movie. It's like Warner Bros handed him the project and said, ""Here you go, have fun,"" and he did. It's the R-rated comic book movie he's likely always dreamt of making. It's packed full of dark humor and weirdness. The problem is, you've got to be able to stomach it to be able to enjoy it. It's excessively gory and gross, and it gets old after awhile. I found it distasteful, and also uninteresting.The ""humorous"" dialogue is often crude and cringey. It was constantly bringing on the humor, but I wasn't laughing. It's all so silly.Much like David Ayer's Suicide Squad, it gets worse as the action picks up in the latter half of the movie. Starro is such a dumb villain. I felt like I was watching a twisted live-action SpongeBob horror comedy. It looks like something out of the mind of a 12 year-old boy who grew up watching too many violent movies. I just wanted it to hurry up and be over. James Gunn is going to need to rein in that wild sense of humor of his as he leads the DCU into the future.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

It will never be as neatly put together as marvel however DCs films are getting better.Suicide squad and Batman v superman to name a few are colourless, humourless, pretty much bland pieces of film and thank goodness for the suicide squad to prove that I'm not crazy.They aren't dark because they have no colour and no humour. They are just plain boring and dull.The suicide squad has shown that a film so colourful and funny can be darker than all of them. James Gunn has made a masterful job. The suicide squad is fantastically directed, the shots are incredible, the colours are amazing. This film has all the elements, humour, emotion, action and gore. It's got pretty much all you could want in a film.I have seen this film 3 times now, there are very few minor errors but nothing that can take away from your experience at all.Apart from that this film is incredible and I will 100% buy it when it comes out! The characters are deeply lovable, I mean this film makes you care for a rat and a shark, let that sink in...Masterful work, far better than the last thing that had suicide squad in its name! At this point in time in august 2021 it is my favourite film of the year so far and better than most films I have ever seen. Highly recommend! Go see it, phenomenal film!""If I die 'cause I gambled on love, it will be a worthy death.""","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"8","/10","An Unbelievable Improvement. From the worst to possibly one of the best superhero films ever made.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7262607/?ref_=tt_urv","ryanpersaud-59415","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65683941/?ref_=tt_urv","23 August 2021","The Good: Why do we like superhero stories? Is it the characters - the archetypes that give us comfort and help us make sense of right or wrong? Is it the imagination, the zany weird world that is created and the endless possibilities? Is the violence? The style? The layers of history that is perfect fodder for parody, deconstruction, and examination? The iconic visuals? Trick question: it's all of the above and guess what, The Suicide Squad captures all of this.The best way to talk about the filmmaking aspect of 2021 SS is to contrast it with 2016 SS. Whereas that film was ugly, poorly edited, confusing, poorly paced and packed with throwaway characters and plots, this one is literally the complete opposite. It's bursting with colour and style, it has a non-linear storyline edited and arranged with such precision, it seems like an ""easy"" thing to do. You know exactly where characters are and what they're doing. You get to understand them gradually throughout the film as it goes from fast paced and high octane to slowing down appropriately. Every character has a point and purpose; they all get great moments and you grow to love them by the end of it.Like with comic books in general, the characters MAKE this movie. Harley Quinn, Rick Flag and Amanda Waller (from the original) are VASTLY improved here; not much has really changed about them, they just have sensical motivations and act how they're supposed to, with enough time devoted to them to understand. But it's the new characters who really shine here. Ratcatcher, Polka Dot Man, King Shark, Peacemaker...all played to perfection by their respective actors, are funny, irreverent, interesting and so, so surprising. Even the most minor members of the Squad (Weasel, forever!) are so interesting and layered. Gunn is a really smart filmmaker, and if it's not the writing, it's the subtle visual or audio aspects to the characters that imbue them with a sense of personality. He's literally one of the best filmmakers out there making ensemble pieces and getting great, memorable performances from his actors.I haven't even gotten to the writing. This movie manages to balance the bizarre, the dark, the meta, the serious and the funny to perfect effect. I just love this film's tone and how the script seems to be hitting the right beats and the exact right time. This movie manages to explore comic book movie tropes, make d**k jokes and seriously critique the ruthlessness of American foreign policy towards the Third World all at the same time (disturbingly relevant in relation to the ongoing situation in Afghanistan) and never skips a beat. There is almost no poor choice made here, in writing, performance or filmmaking. Honestly, it's one of the best superhero movies in recent memory.The Bad: The movie does drag a little bit in the middle and there are some questionable decisions made here, particularly with the ""villains."" There are at least 4 (possibly 5) antagonists in this movie, and only two (Waller - whom Viola Davis absolutely NAILS and Starro - whom is a big scary monster that you actually kind of feel bad for) are really fleshed out. I felt Capaldi was a little wasted here.I also just don't find Harley Quinn very funny. Her lines always feel awkward and forced. But thankfully, there isn't much of that.(I know this is meant to be the ""negative"" section, but Viola Davis' Amanda Waller might legitimately be one of the most terrifying villains in comic book film history, and it's precisely because you know there are tons of people like her in real life. )The Ugly: The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly hard on superhero films: they're expensive, really on massive box office hauls to recoup production costs and hence, reliant on theatres, which have understandably been...difficult to operate these past 18 months or so, to say the least. But what I hope for is with less of an emphasis of big budgets and billion dollar returns (as studios seem more interested in having good content for streaming), we can get more weird, out there movies like this. Let's hope THE Suicide Squad is a sign of things to come. I finally feel like with Aquaman, Joker and now this, DC-on-film finally has an identity and honestly, it's far more exciting than Marvel right now.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

To be honest it seems that James Gunn was on some really good weed when he wrote and directed this film. There is stuff in that movie that you hardly ever see in a mainstream movie.. story wise and visual wise. And thats good. Also to give Suicide Squad finally the necessary R-Rating treatment was the right move. The film was equally entertaining but also a kind of revolution of itself.Acting wise it was solid. Margot Robbie is always great in the role of Harley Quinn and there is no change here. She really makes that character her own like hardly any other actor in the past of a superhero franchise. Idris Elba was solid and I really liked John Cena and Joel Kinneman. Also Daniela Melchoir was outstanding. Viola Davis was sadly a bit on the edge of overacting here but still its Viola Davis, she can't do no wrong. Also bunch of great virtual characters , starting with King Shark of course, hilariously voiced by Sylvester Stallone and Sebastian the rat.Signature for James Gunn is also the fantastic soundtrack and that is no difference here.As mentioned above, sometimes he really over does it... but in a way that is acceptable.. because the film is that crazy and out of this world.Definitely a step forward for DC.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Knowing how Warner Bros have interfered with previous directors visions and story telling, to try and copy marvel, i had serious doubts about this film. The trailers did interest me, hence why i wanted to book tickets to see it. Well...this film does not disappoint.I enjoyed this film from beginning to end. A fantastic mixture of both. Humour, Violence and Emotion. James Gunn has written a heartfelt and epic story, including some of the weirdest and most peculiar characters from the DC Comics. Each one has their own story arc, their best moments, and are just damn right awesome! Again, Jame Gunn uses such a wide range of music choice to suit each scene, each one working perfectly. The cinematography is most of the scenes were visually stunning to watch on the big screen, and the costume designs were fantastic! Astounding visual and practical effects used throughout the film made you feel part of the story.In conclusion, James Gunn has managed to use the most bland and uninteresting comic characters, and create a masterpiece. A film that lives up to its R rating and hype. Would highly recommend seeing this.","5 out of 17 found this helpful.

Solid script, but at times, the film's tone is off. This is because the moments that are supposed to be serious and/or heartfelt are underdeveloped. Solid editing. One less ""cool"" slow motion shot would've been better. Also, again with the location font telling us where we are. When is that going to stop? It's like filmmakers think that the audience is too stupid to follow the story without them. 7/10.On screen: The actors and actresses did all they could do with that undeveloped script and that was pretty good. They were believable for the most part. If the serious/heartfelt scenes were developed better, then the acting could've been better. Cinematography is good enough. 6.5/ 10.Content/Impact: I really don't like Amanda Waller as a character at all in any of the DC mediums. Her character is a reinforcement of the sapphire Black Woman stereotype, more currently dubbed Angry Black woman. She's forceful, angry, stubborn, and malicious. Also, they don't give any backstory to this character which creates this belief that she's born a ""ABW."" This portrayal is problematic because it dehumanizes black women by teaching the viewers that this is all black women are, the Angry Black Woman. Also, I wasn't feeling the scene with other black man in prison (Bloodshot played by Iris Elba) screaming curse words to his daughter (Tyla played by Storm Reid) through the prison glass. Terrible reinforcing stereotypical imagery. 1/10.Overall: Decent movie would've been better without reinforcing stereotypes. 4.8/10.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Though tremendously hit-and-miss and generally hard to like (especially the first hour), The Suicide Squad is still genuinely funny and (almost) fun at points, and that is what has been most missing from that studio all this time.The biggest problem really is that it tries to mix a Guardians Of The Galaxy type humour with the callous gore and cynicism of ""The Boys"" and then expects just doing that will be enough to make us invest in the story and want to see what happens next. It doesn't, and the comedic violence very, very quickly just becomes predictable, repetitive, depressing and... deadening. There's no gravity to any of the characters or events: almost every moment which might mean something or cause us to care about someone is depth-charged by a dumb joke, which more often than not isn't even funny. And there is not a single likeable or relatable human being onscreen the whole 2 hours and 12 minutes. It doesn't matter who lives or dies.The Harley Quinn character is noticeably more annoying than before, though Idris Elba isn't too bad, and the shark guy and the cute rats are okay. I guess I liked the quirkiness of the Polkadot Man and his visions of his dead mother.But when I tell you my favourite part of the whole film, and the only bit that actually made me laugh, is Elba's daughter screaming ""IT DOES OTHER THINGS TOO!"" while arguing with him about an Apple watch, you might start to get a picture of how slim the pickings are.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Some of the characters from the previous film such as Amanda Waller and Rick Flag are much better in this one and all of the new characters are also given room to breath and develop.This film is also very emotional at times and contains some very heavy themes about government corruption and experimentation. This film is also very brutal with people getting ripped in half, shot in the face and decapitated all of which are followed with explosions of blood.All in all this is a fantastic experience and if you are looking for something good to watch in the cinema this is definitely worth your time. (8/10)","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

I read one comment about this movie that I believe sums it up perfectly: this seems to have been made by a movie student fresh out of college with a huge budget to spend.I have no clue why this movie has such high praise, this feels like a teenager flick, a failed attempt at comedy with some gore and violence, they brought some good actors to give it some credibility, a small political statement so that it doesn't look so bad and the end result is this...
The story is laughable and the plot is over used, the comedy is based on over the top violence, maybe it works for some people, personally it feels boring and unnecessary, they try so hard to make the kid jokes work I felt constant cringe with the actors delivering it..Zero connection with any of the characters, it seems like the movie was made with absolutely no care for the story, it's just a dumb storyline that heavily relies on the jokes and the violence you are basically watching a freak show, what's the point of making it a ""super hero"" story, this is pretty much a Scary Movie type of thing.It feels like they tried to make a mix of Guardians of the Galaxy with Deadpool and it just failed, simple as that - I am surprised with why the A list actors agreed to this, how James Gunn messed this up so bad after such a good previous work on Marvel and why the high scores? DC needs to get a grip, their movies are so inconsistent..","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A breath of fresh air for the superhero genre","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7258840/?ref_=tt_urv","JoelAlexanderr","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94233651/?ref_=tt_urv","22 August 2021","When Suicide Squad (2016) was released, the whole world, including me, was eagerly anticipating what looked like a manic and colorful adventure with a stellar cast. So when it ended up being an absolute dumpster fire, it was only natural that Warner Bros. Would try to make another one. However, this time director/writer James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) is at the helm, which may be why THE SUICIDE SQUAD is everything fans could have possibly wanted and more. It not only provides the R-rated pandemonium that the first film failed to deliver upon, but it also has a devilishly hilarious sense of humor and a beating heart that invests viewers in every single character.From the very first action scene, Gunn lets fans know that the movie is entirely different from every other superhero movie. I won't give anything away, but the tone Gunn sets for this film is one of over-the-top violence, dark and borderline-offensive humor, and grand risk-taking from a story perspective. From there, the incredible cast takes us into a high-stakes (and highly unethical) adventure involving international espionage, broken hearts and aliens. Not one member of this incredible ensemble falls short, unlike the last Suicide Squad where Will Smith and Margot Robbie were the only good performances. Idris Elba is given the leading superhero role he's always deserved, and he predictably crushes it. Same with John Cena, who plays off of Elba in a manner that I could have watched for days. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is the best she has ever been in the role, managing to be funnier than ever before while maintaining the unhinged charm of the last two films. However, the real breakout performance to me was Deniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, a character who is the heart and soul of this film and has the most emotionally affecting scenes in the film.Not one plot point felt out of place to me for the entire runtime. Perhaps this is partially because the entire point of the story is the mania and madness, but I credit it to Gunn's amazing screenplay, which builds the story in a fresh, yet familiar fashion. The final fight scene is one of my personal favorites in any superhero movie due to the jaw-dropping visual effects and the high-stakes tension Gunn maintains throughout. There are times where it felt like a Godzilla movie on shrooms, and I couldn't have had any more fun watching it.THE SUICIDE SQUAD is the unhinged superhero saga fans were craving in 2016, and now that we finally have it, I couldn't be more satisfied. Other than a couple jokes that won't be for everyone, the film never misfires on any aspect of the movie that is integral to its success, which is rare to see in big-budget superhero filmmaking. THE SUICIDE SQUAD is a breath of fresh air, and I would take a ride into this world many more times with Gunn at the steering wheel.A.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

DC have gone all Guardians of the Galaxy and that's a really good thing .Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese.This has Gunn's stamp all over it . It has a banging soundtrack, superb action and most enjoyably of all , it's bloody funny!The story , as I find in a lot of superhero films ( Anti hero's in this case ) is mostly irrelevant .It's all about the dialogue and characters and they have got most of them just right .Never afraid to bump of a big character makes it unpredictable and exciting as well.As in the first film , I thought the enemy wasn't worthy of the film . This starfish baddie was even more lame than the witch of the original but that really didn't seem to matter because the film is so much fun .Looking at the ratings for Suicide Squad and The Suicide Squad , they are massively disproportionate because both are 4 out of 5 films for me although if I had a gun to my head to pick which I though was the best I'd say the latter - Just .","8 out of 34 found this helpful.

Yan (my rating: 1/10). Robbie returns for this sequel/reboot of The Suicide Squad, but this time she's in the more capable hands of director James Gunn, who has a proven track record with big budget, special effects laden blockbusters. Quinn is still a rather annoying character, but Gunn's film has so much else going for it that it's relatively easy to ignore her grating voice and mannerisms.Gunn began his movie career writing for Troma, penning such classics as Tromeo and Juliet (1996) and Terror Firmer (1999), and made his feature film directorial debut with gory sci-fi horror Slither (2006), and I can't help but feel that schlock horror is much closer to his heart than his family-friendly Guardians of the Galaxy films. Also written by Gunn, The Suicide Squad is certainly a whole lot of twisted fun, loaded with characters of dubious morality, bad taste humour and the type of graphic violence that would easily have earned the film an R-rating a decade or three ago (or seen it edited of all of its nasty stuff in good old Blighty-Gawd bless the BBFC). As a die-hard horror fan with an appreciation of the absurd, this adventure for the Suicide Squad is just how I like my comic book movies: dark, demented, and very gory.Robbie aside, the cast is excellent, with Idris Elba as Bloodsport, leading a crazy squad of anti-heroes on a seemingly impossible mission to destroy a scientific research building on the island of Corto Maltese, home to Project Starfish, a gigantic alien called Starro the Conquerer that can generate tiny duplicates that latch onto other sentient beings, thereby allowing the creature to control their minds. Joining Bloodsport are assassin Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), and King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), all of whom have their own particular and peculiar skills. Harley Quinn joins the 'squad' later on, a survivor of an earlier mission of which she is one of the few survivors (the others being heroic Colonel Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman, and my favourite character, a bug-eyed, child-killing creature called Weasel, presumed drowned but seen recovering and scampering away at the very end of the film).Other familiar faces joining in the fun are Gunn regular Michael Rooker as Savant (one of the not-so-lucky members of the first assault), the 'Twelfth Doctor' Peter Capaldi as scientist Thinker, Viola David as ruthless Suicide Squad controller Amanda Waller (also returning from Ayer's messy original), Firefly's Nathan Fillion as T. D. K (I won't spoil things by revealing what that stands for), Jai Courtney as Boomerang, and Taika Waititi as Ratcatcher 2's father, Ratcatcher.With such a stellar cast, and an A-list director at the helm, it's clear that no expense has been spared to ensure that The Suicide Squad isn't a flop this time around, and this is also evident in the superb digital special effects, of which there are plenty. I'm not the biggest fan of CGI, which can be the ruin of many a movie, but when it is of this calibre, it's fine by me - the film looks great throughout, whether it be chaos and destruction on a massive scale, more artistic flourishes (Harley Quinn on a killing spree surrounded by cascading flower petals and animated birds), or King Shark tearing a victim limb from limb.I had such a good time with The Suicide Squad I don't even mind that Harley Quinn wasn't one of the many characters to die a gruesome death, and I look forward to further sequels and spin-offs (Peacemaker is already slated for his own movie), just so long as Gunn is in control. But can we have a bit more of Weasel next time, please?7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.","13 out of 65 found this helpful.

It was just ok though and would probably rate around a 5/10. The sequel was everything the 1st one should have been.James Gunn was the perfect person to get to make a good Suicide Squad movie. Also loved seeing and hearing Task Force X. From the start it got you laughing which I expected with Gunn behind it. Loved the GOTG movies so I had high hopes for this movie and it didn't disappoint. Even the lesser known characters like Ratcatcher where perfectly done. This was the best Harley Quinn we have seen on screen. King Shark was a lot of fun and also perfectly done. Bloodsport was excellent but I'm a fan of Idris Elba and on and on.The action was good and the movie didn't take much time getting into it at all. Storywise it's what you should expect with your typical comicbook type movie. Making it rated R was also necessary and glad they didn't cave. Something like Suicide Squad needs to be rated R as there will be blood and gore.I really want a sequel and hope they can get James Gunn back to do one. Will be watching it again this weekend. Overall watching this movie just expect good laughs, lots of action and a cast that really gels together making the movie that much better. Its a true popcorn flick and shouldn't be missed.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

He's proven himself with the Guardians of the Galaxy, and he has proven himself with this one, that he is excellent director for this genre. From the opening shot to the final scene movie offers thrill excitement, stakes, emotion. Cast is amazing. Cgi is great. Effects are amazing. Acting is great. Music is awesome . Action scenes and pacing are great. Gore is top notch. Oh my God the gore. It is fricking amazing. Finally not a pg-13 movie. Cinematography is great. Everything in this movie is awesome. Viola Davis is once again amazing as Amanda Waller, even better in this one than in previous one. Margot Robbie is once again brilliant as Harley Quinn. I would like to also give props to Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher. She is amazing. She felt like a huge huge kind soul of the movie. Idris Elba as Bloodsport as well. This movie works far better than the last. You root for them. You constantly feeling range of emotions through this movie where the last one fail to do so.This is what you get when you hire right director and writers for the job.Alongside with the Zack Snyder's Justice League it is one of the BEST DC movies so far.Now i only hope that in the future we get more of movies like this.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The action sequence, direction, camera angles, boy am I pleased I decided to watch this! The screen isn't pitch black throughout, there's jolly good music and murder at the same moment and a very very strong cast. The movie is proof that the criticism on The Suicide Squad (2016) was marvelously handled.Idris Elba (Bloodsport), Viola Davis (Amanda Waller), and Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) are wonderful, I'm even proud of John Cena (Peacemaker) and Daniela Melchoir (Ratcatcher 2). Oh and Peter Davidson plays himself, well almost. The jokes are great, the timing is better and it is violent. None of that PG-13 crap we've been getting served so much. There are so many surprise elements, it's difficult to predict what will happen and that's the best part. And I loved seeing so many characters, they deserved their screen time.I just have a minor complaint, why didn't Weasel get good CGI? Or was it meant to not match the comics?This is the DC I want to see, this is the DC I will mark my calendar and countdown to watch.

The original ""Suicide Squad"" from 2016 was a botched and lacklustre affair, getting just 5/10 from me. James Gunn's semi-reboot is hyper-violent, overlong, totally ludicrous but a whole bunch of fun.Positives:
Negatives:
Summary Thoughts on ""The Suicide Squad"": I'd mentally set myself up to really hate this one. But the opposite turned out to be true. As a comedy it made me laugh like a drain at times, and although some of the violence went somewhat over the top for me, I thought it to be a fine summer popcorn blockbuster (but very much for adults).(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

I was pleasantly surprised though after checking the film out. The Ayer version felt more like just a squad, than a suicide squad. Gunn changes that here.James Gunns films (minus Guardians) have always had some gore as an ingredient and it is definitely heightened in this movie and i am all for it.The opening scene is one of the best ive seen without giving too much away. It has humour, gore and just acts as a great premise for the movie.Its a slight shame we dont see some of the old crew from SS around but a few of the team come back. Margot Robbies Harley Quinn again is fantastic. Some of her action sequences are great and she is always funny but the whole squad has their funny moments. One person i liked a whole lot more this time was Rick Flagg - you could see the tone shift change with this character from the previous movie.The new additions are great - Cena and Elba have a fun and comptetative relationship, and PolkaDotMan and Ratcatcher 2 are also fantastic.The villain in the movie is maybe a bit bizarre and silly but i had such a blast anyway, i just had to embrace it. The only other minor flaw perhaps is that is goes on for maybe 15 minutes too long.Overall, a fun, gory rollercoaster ride. Hopefully theres a new SS film to queue up for soon.8/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But all the other characters were great too, and i loved Harley Quinn in this one, they managed to make me really care for her, and she has one of the best action scenes i've ever seen in a comic book movie.

Some of the convicts are not so willing to go. Robert Dubois, better known as Bloodsport, is not willing to go until Waller threatens to send his 16-year old daughter to Belle Reve instead of juvy. He teams up with a manshark, a woman with the ability to control rats, a man who will kill to keep peace and a man in a polka dot suit. Together, they journey through the island to stop the experiment while running into Rick Flag and Harley Quinn.James Gunn's The Suicide Squad was easily my most anticipated film of the year. He was behind my two favorite comic book movies of all time and I wanted to see how this version of the film would portray the villainous squad. I was pumped for the movie... and yet, I did not want to get too excited for it. There have been a few movies recently that really disappointed me and I did not want to overhype my excitement for this film until I saw it. Does it live up to the hype or is it another disappointing entry for the DCEU?One thing I want to point out is that The Suicide Squad is among the most graphic and gory films I have ever seen, even moreso than Mortal Kombat. This movie is filled to the brim with blood and gore. Guts are spilled and nearly every death is shown in graphic detail. Seriously, this movie is not for younger kids or for the faint of heart. This does not mean do not watch this movie, but just know you are getting into a bit of a gorefest here.With all that said, how is The Suicide Squad? It is a bloody good time! At first, I was not sure how to feel about the movie, but by the time the squad entered the bar, the story won me over. The best part about this version of Suicide Squad is that these villains act like villains. They were in Belle Reve for a reason. One scene has them slaughter a whole village over a misunderstanding. These guys are bad guys and they show it. I noticed that the tone is both more comedic, yet darker at the same time. While it is more colorful and there are several funny moments, it does not get in the way of serious or intense moments except for one particular scene in the climax. Otherwise, it focuses on the consequences of villainy especially with Peacemaker, science experimentation and growth. Rick Flag and Harley Quinn are both much better people here than in the first Suicide Squad film. The opening scene is rather shocking and sad. If you were a fan of Captain Boomerang, you may not be happy here.The squad in this film has a much better dynamic and as individual characters, they all shine. I was worried that Bloodsport was going to be the same character as Deadshot, but they are quite opposite. Bloodsport is much more stoic, he wants to be away from his daughter and he is more affable towards the squad, particularly with Ratcatcher 2 and Rick Flag. As a result, he was a much more compelling character and it felt like he grew throughout the journey. It also helps that Idris Elba brings another killer performance. Among the new characters, John Cena as Peacemaker surprised me. It seemed like he was going to be a hammy comic relief, but he was a surprisingly dark character and he played it well. He gave an effective performance for a peace-loving maniac who has conflicted feelings about his actions. I love King Shark for being a hilarious and heartwarming comic relief. He is my favorite character here. Polka Dot Man has an awesome power and a tragic backstory around it. Ratcatcher is a thoroughly likable person who I am not sure should be with such dangerous villains. What makes this squad work is that each character has hidden depths to them to make them fleshed out so when the action begins, we root for their safety. It helps that each performance is terrific for every character with John Cena, Daniela Menchior and Idris Elba being the standouts. Even Sylvester Stallone was great with his comedic timing.As for the older characters, Amanda Waller returns and she is much more ruthless and cunning here. Viola Davis steals any scene she is in with her eerie presence, but she does get one comedic scene. I loved Davis as Waller and I was overjoyed when I found out when she came back. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is great as usual. She displays more standards here, but she has a sense of playfulness and maturity. My favorite scene with her is offering to go back in the predicament she was in so her team could still rescue her. That is Harley Quinn's personality. Even Rick Flag is much more likable. He feels more human and conflicted with his alignment. He is also much more of a team player this time around. It helps that Joel Kinnaman's performance is a lot better here. He emotes better and he generally has more fun with the role and the tone of the film. The villains are not the best, but Starro is a better antagonist than The Enchantress could ever be. It has a sad backstory and one of the coolest character designs in the DCEU. A Kaiju-sized starfish with nightmarish powers is definitely cooler than a villain who seeks world domination and creates a beam in the sky. His defeat is as graphic as it is gruesome. All in all, most of the characters are great in this movie. A huge step up from the first film.Visually, the movie looks stunning. It has such a cool style that reminds me of something that Quentin Tarantino and Adam Wingard would co-direct. It is so gleefully violent in its style, yet it is so colorful in nearly every shot. There is a lot of red in the mix as it shows how much bloodshed is here. The cinematography is impressive. One fight scene was shot on the reflection of Peacemaker's helmet and it looks incredible. Even the first shot of the movie is a solid looking reflection shot. Some of the lighting during the nighttime scenes could have been better though. It was hard to see the characters at times. The action scenes are over-the-top and spectacularly gory. They are inventive and messy while utilizing the powers and skills of the squad to the max. One scene taking place near the top of a building had me on the edge of my seat. Those are the kind of scenes I love to see on the big screen. The sets and costumes are great, and the special effects for King Shark make him look real. I also want to say that I love the story transitions. They were clever and inventive especially Operation Harley and Jotunheim. The soundtrack is good and it is better utilized here than it is in the first film's soundtrack, but it is not the strong point of the film.The Suicide Squad is bloody awesome. It got me attached to characters I never even heard of until this movie. It fully utilizes the premise of a villainous squad while showing how gory a comic book movie could get. Most of all, it has a lot of heart. It is definitely a win for the DCEU and I highly recommend it if you don't mind the gore. Just make sure you watch it safely whether it be in theaters or at home on HBO Max.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The MCU has always been infamously known for playing it safe with their successful movie-making formula. And it's worked. The majority of their films are entertaining but we now live in a world where superhero movies are the kingpin of Hollywood which results in new releases feeling stale and recycled.With movies like these, studio interference, which is behind-the-scenes, is ironically very public. Or, at least, very noticeable in the final product. Justice League's theatrical cut was notoriously known for being way different from the directors original vision (ie. Snyder Cut). Hell, take some time to look into the original Suicide Squad and how Warner Bros gave David Ayer, the director, the same low-blow they gave Snyder.Now here lies James Gunn's The Suicide Squad.This sequel is simply a colorful bloodbath of a film that feels like something Quentin Tarantino would've directed if someone had locked him in a comic book store for a couple weeks.The concept of pulling D-List comic book characters and forming a connection with them and the audience in just 2 hours is something that should be praised just on its own. This isn't Gunn's first rodeo (ie. Guardians of the Galaxy) and he only improves on it in The Suicide Squad.And Gunn takes advantage of using lesser-known characters and makes them dispensable which keeps viewers attentive and on the edge of their seat throughout.Take any frame of this movie and slap it in a comic book and it'll blend right in. One of favorite parts of this movie were the integrated chapter headings inside the film which is just another tipping of the hat to comic book enthusiasts.Gunn has no shame with the brutality that bleeds throughout this film which I can see scaring some audience members away. And that's a reoccurring theme throughout this film:This film doesn't hesitate to make a name for itself. It's bloody, comedic, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Which is important in an era where superhero films are oversaturated. As said before, cookie-cutter doesn't cut it anymore and Gunn fully understands this.In a nutshell, The Suicide Squad is simply a director having full creative freedom and making the most fun out of his 300-million dollar budget. And this time around: it worked. If you're looking for a sequel that complements the first installments tone, you're going to be severely disappointed.Continuity should be able to take a dip for the sake of keeping things fresh every once and awhile, and that was a big controversy with this movie for some. This didn't bother me for a second, because in the end, we all just want to be entertained.I can totally see The Suicide Squad being the pioneer for the next generation of superhero films. James Gunn and Warner Brothers have found the antidote to the superhero fatigue.It's artistic freedom.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Director James Gunn pulls off a dark, witty, action packed superhero movie to please fans of the comic books and gives the DC universe a much needed hit after the disappointment of the first attempt of bringing these characters to life with Suicide Squad (2016).Having scored success for Marvel with Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) Gunn was an obvious choice to do justice to this ensemble piece. It's imaginative, creative, bold and fun and Gunn doesn't hold back on anything, seemingly given free rein to give fans what they want. There's plenty of crazy stuff going on with killing sprees, blood letting, violence and dark humour to please adult audiences.Margot Robbie shines as Harley Quinn as does all of the cast, and despite all the action, gory moments and thrills, it's also got plenty of heart and Gunn makes these superheroes three dimensional to make us care about them and their plight.It's a summer blockbuster that really delivers and his choice of music are at times inspired, surprisingly effective and not what you'd expect.

Haven't had this much of a ride with a movie before. Love its approach to characters and its combination of violence and humor. Gunn also fixes the flawed character introductions in the first Suicide Squad, by dropping us into a bunch of characters in tons of action, then flipping the switch to another group of smaller characters. Another thing is how Gunn takes these goofy characters (Polka-Dot Man) and take them seriously to an extent. I'm also glad Elba owns his role as Bloodsport, proving he is a versatile actor. Another thing is the camerawork in this film. It utilizes a slow and light shaky cam while also panning. You need to see it to know what I'm talking about, but the escape scene with Harley Quinn is a beautiful example. The Suicide Squad sets the stage on what a modern age blockbuster can be.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Gunn takes a lot of risks but the payoff is fantastic if you just sit back and enjoy instead of wishing for it to be something you've seen a million times.

I was not dissapointed.First off, this movie is hilarious. I'm not the kind of guy to laugh watching a movie, the most a film gets out of me is usually a chuckle. This movie made me laugh several times. The scene where all the characters met on the plane was great, the banter in this movie is fantastic.This movie also had very high stakes. The only character I felt t had plot-armor was Harley Quinn, the others I had no idea about. This movie also has some really great emotional moments, and of course the scenes where the characters sit down and bond are fantastic. The characters (except Harley) all were great. The biggest surprise for me was Ratcatcher 2. She was kind of the emotional core of the movie. She is the nicest of the characters, and she bringed the team together.As I said in the beginning of the review, I'm more of a Marvel guy. The only DCEU movies I've seen are Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman. I did not see the first it one, nor did I see Birds of Prey. This may have made me enjoy the movie more, perhaps less. This leads on to my next point. I didn't find Harley all that interesting or funny. This is the first time I've seen this character, and I do not see why everybody likes her so much. Margot Robbie does a great job, but that accent is really annoying in my opinion, it gets old really fast. Her subplot was really boring and it drags down the movie.TLDR: This movie is awesome, Harley is not. 9/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The characters in the film are so goddamn Great. My favourites being King Shark - a man eating beast who was such an adorable character.Peacemaker - I love John Cena
Ratcatcher 2 - I was pleasantly surprised by her character
Polka Dot Man - IMO the best character of the film.The Gore in the film is amazingly horrifying, thank god James Gunn made it a priority for the film to be a 15/R because the film was bloody, gruesome and just fun. The shot of King Shark ripping a poor soul into half looked absolutely phenomenal. There were some other scenes which also looked great but were horrifying to look at like some of the people who had been experimented on at Jotunheim.The humour was a mix bag for me as it really was a case of it being a hit or miss. The hit being the banter between the team was great mainly because they had good chemistry with each other. Though some of the jokes were quite awkward and some really took away from a scenes poignancy - can't add much to that without getting majorly spoilery so I'll leave it there.It wouldn't be a James Gunn film without a banging soundtrack - Johnny cash is 🔥.I can't wait for the Peacemaker series because the film left me wanting to see how they go from here.8/10.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

Can't believe I just wrote that.I'm glad others are enjoying it but I absolutely did not enjoy the movie.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

His hero's journey in this film was one worth taking. While he's a standout, the entire cast is fantastic-including John Cena. As a fan of John Cena, I've been very critical of his previous works; but, this was his foot in the door to big Hollywood roles. He did well.The humor was excellent, for the most part. As expected, you're going to hear a few forced jokes, but the corny Marvel level of humor is successfully avoided. Some scenes absolutely had me in stitches without a word being spoken-and that's rare..I'm going to watch this film twice in the same day. I don't recall the last time I did that. It must have been a Christopher Nolan film, and those are meant for re-watching. This film, however, was pure entertainment with heart.A great watch you will enjoy, if you like R-rated fantasy/superhero/sci-fi films.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

This film is a soft reboot from 2016's 'Suicide Squad' with only a few cast members reprising their roles after that movies poor reception from fans.This films cast is absolutely immense. It is mainly made up of frequent James Gunn collaborators and friends: Michael Rooker ('Savant'), Nathan Fillion ('T. D. K.'), Sean Gunn ('Weasel') and Steve Agee ('John Economos' and the on-set 'King Shark'). Also, they have some huge names in the main cast, Idris Elba as 'Bloodsport', Margot Robbie as 'Harley Quinn' and John Cena as 'Peacemaker'. However, the standouts are Daniela Melchior as 'Ratcatcher 2' and David Dastmalchian as 'Polka-Dot Man'. They're the heart of the film and their very personal performances bring a different aspect to the movie. The two of them encompass the emotion and the core themes of the story.The pacing feels very deliberate. Gunn almost splits this up into chapters with title cards materialising out of thin air to more closely relate this to the comic books that the story is loosely based off. Gunn always knows how to choose and implement fantastic licensed music and this time around is no exception, it links effortlessly into the plot and is clear that the songs chosen were written into the script from the start. Along with the licensed songs, there is some beautiful original music and scores from composer John Murphy. The best is the song titled 'Ratism' which is a moving piece that echoes the key message that Gunn is trying to emulate with this film.The script is very character centric, which is perfect in a story that has such a huge ensemble cast. The writing makes you care about absolutely everyone, which is impressive when most of the lineup are nobody's from DC Comics that were near enough unknowns before this films release. Also, I don't think I have ever seen a comic book movie that looks this beautiful. The visuals are absolutely stunning and Gunn pays so much attention to detail that I don't think a normal filmmaker would pay.James Gunn was given full creative control with the studio having very little input in the final piece and it shows in the difference of quality between this film and it's predecessor. For instance, people actually die in this film, which may not sound like a good thing but for a film that is called 'The Suicide Squad' you would hope that people do actually kick the bucket at some point, sometimes in emotional ways but mainly in a funny and comedic fashion. That does relate to the 'R' rating (UK-15) that is attached to this picture as quite a few of the deaths and kills are incredibly gory which definitely adds to the style of this film. It is such a relief that this movie is able to make fun of itself and doesn't take itself to seriously which has been the downfall of other DCEU instalments. Some of the kills in particular display the cartoonish and over the top tone that perfectly mirrors the source material.Overall, I love this film. It is clear that this is a real passion project for James Gunn and he takes huge amounts of pride in his work whilst making this movie. I can't wait for the spin-off 'Peacemaker' show that is coming in early 2022 and I hope we get to see more origin stories for some of the characters in this film.9.5/10.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Also Harley's side plot felt mis-placed from the rest.To be honest the whole film feels mis-placed. Tonally all over the place, one moment all comedy, then sudden all sentimentality. In a heartbeat. And as for plot - the story. Total rubbish. The less said about the Starfish and the rats, the better.Despite these big flaws, it does have some good scenes, always slick direction, and decent performances.

Curious to see how DC unfolds particularly after the WW84 debacle.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's a middle of the road film. It's no guardians of the galaxy, and it's definitely not a traditional DC film. It lacks the authenticity of what I've come to expect from the DCU, which makes you believe in world of real people fill with super powered beings. Definitely some political leanings in it and irrelevant story telling that lacked impact for the viewer. I'm only emotionally attached to Harley Quinn and Flag, because of the previous suicide squad, which I think is a slightly better movie in a different way. Damn, the degradation of movies sucks.

It is hilarious. It is gritty, emotional, clever, well paced, visually stunning. More than anything though, it is just so fun.Gunn managed to take bizarre and obscure characters like Ratcatcher 2 and Polkadot Man and somehow make them more engaging and interesting than the big hitters in the DCEU like Batman and Superman. All of the new characters were brilliant, with Gunn very happy to poke fun at how ridiculous some of them are. The tone is so tongue in cheek and is exactly what is needed to handle the eclectic character list.As well as introducing so many new characters, Gunn also improved on existing ones. Margot Robbie gave her best performance as Harley Quinn with the character in fine form, and Rick Flag was vastly improved from Ayer's film.The plot, just like the characters, is ludicrous, over the top, and just so fun. It is impossible not to have an absolute blast watching this. You can tell that the studio just let Gunn have absolute creative license and it paid off massively.Believe the hype because The Suicide Squad is an absolute treat.Bravo James Gunn, take a bow.","5 out of 21 found this helpful.

It's a non-stop ultra-violent superhero action film filled with great actors bringing these dark characters to life, tons of gore, lots of fun and dark humor, amazing cinematography, realistic CGI and special effects with a badass soundtrack. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker and David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man are some of the best characters and the highlights of this movie. Also Sylvester Stallone's King Shark, Michael Rooker's Savant, Nathan Fillion's TDK and Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 are awesome. Overall great performances from the entire cast and hats off to James Gunn for making the best R-Rated DC movie in my opinion. Love this movie so much and it's a hundred times better than the first one. Really hope to see another sequel and it definitely has to be made by the one and only James Gunn!!!","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

There is nothing that this movie takes seriously and that absolutely includes the viewer. I did not like it one bit. The entire film looked like a parody of itself but without the comedy. It took nothing seriously yet failed to produce any laughs. This whole mess would have been better served as an animated feature as the actors simply couldn't make sense of it and therefore this viewer couldn't either.Ignore this quasi-parody and instead go for the full on animated effort that is the Harley Quinn cartoon series. At least the writers there can tell a joke and no actors are harmed in the production.It gets a 4 because Margot Robbie is a great Harley. It's such a shame that dross like this is the best they can utilise her in. Such a great character yet not one worthwhile film.

Some kind of THE suicide squad?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7749919/?ref_=tt_urv","Pjtaylor-96-138044","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tt_urv","12 January 2022","'The Suicide Squad (2021)' is technically a sequel to the abysmal 'Suicide Squad (2016)', in the sense that it takes place within the same world, is set after its events and features a few of its characters. In practice, though, there is actually very little connecting the two films, as this outing doesn't even (directly) reference its plot and it acts as a totally stand-alone experience. Plus, the difference in quality between the two is absolutely night and day. Basically, I'm saying that disliking 'Suicide Squad (2016)' (as most people do) has no bearing on whether or not you'll enjoy 'The Suicide Squad (2021)' (annoyingly similar title aside). The film focuses on Task Force X, a group of mostly C-list (and very expendable) villains who have been recruited to engage in black ops missions in exchange for a reduction in their prison sentences. The squad is tasked with infiltrating a South American island to recover or destroy a dangerous weapon known only as Project Starfish. The plot is relatively straightforward, essentially presented as a single mission. At the same time, the plotting itself is actually somewhat messy, as the movie moves between the various characters it has split up and now needs to reunite. This isn't a huge issue, but it is noticeable. As is the flick's preoccupation with subversion, which occasionally undercuts its emotional beats and often isn't as surprising as it seems to think it is. The movie's style is also so eclectic that it can occasionally feel a tiny bit incohesive. In general, though, the piece is remarkably good. It's a fun, irreverent and technically impressive affair that makes excellent use of large-scale sets and goes to insane lengths to ground its action in practical effects. The action sequences truly are incredible. They're pacy, propulsive and pretty darn brutal (the movie really earns its R-rating). They're also just really enjoyable, their clean choreography complimenting their no-holds-barred nature and their overarching practicality making even their most ridiculous moments seem tangible. Though the flick sometimes struggles to strike a balance between its dark humour and its desire to actually have an emotional impact, it generally emerges as an engaging and somewhat affecting experience. A couple of its plentiful deaths actually have an impact, and it does a good job in developing its core characters just enough so that you genuinely care about them by the time the movie reaches its conclusion. The actors also help with this, imbuing their characters with a proper vitality and depth. Each main character gets their time to shine and, as such, there isn't a clear highlight. Ratcatcher 2, King Shark, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Polka-Dot Man, Harley Quinn and even Rick Flagg (an incredibly boring character in concept) are all as empathetic and enjoyable as one another. Some of the other characters feel like throwaway gags but the core group is given just enough attention to seem like a rounded set of varied individuals. It's difficult to express just how good this film is when compared to its predecessor. It's incredibly accomplished from a technical point of view. It's also written really well, even if some of it falls a little flat and comes close to feeling 'edgy' for the sake of it. The film is exciting, energetic and enjoyable. Even when it isn't funny (which it often is), it's always fun. It also has proper stakes and a fair amount of nuance, including an underlayer of tragedy and anti-imperialism that runs throughout. It's easily the best thing in the DCEU; for once, that isn't a backhanded compliment. It's pretty great. 8/10.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

It looks great throughout and the tonal shifts are well managed, but I didn't like the episodic and non-linear approach to storytelling and the large number of leading characters meant the focus wasn't as tight as it could have been. It also never really stood out, being a bit too similar to other recent films in the genre.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

DC needs to do right by the fans for once and give Zack Snyder back control of the universe.Overall an utter mess and painful watch from start to finish. For the second most expensive R rated movie ever you'd expect more than what we got, a giant starfish villain...WB your fans deserve so much better.This is hands down the WORST DC movie...ever. Chris Nolan and Zack Snyder we need you back to fix this horrid mess the DCEU has become.","38 out of 88 found this helpful.

The Suicide Squad breaks tropes and conventional plot pacing and has a lot of fun doing it with a movie that feels so true to the comics but yet like such a new addition to the superhero scene. I loved it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was just such a great movie with several unexpected moments. And the way that dc let James Gunn be James Gunn and go all out with everything was what made it a really great movie. This movie also got me to change from marvel to dc. Marvel was just getting repetitive and even though black widow showed that they were still capable of making movies that where actually good it also showed that there fan base has changed. When I watched this movie I realized that dc has always been multiple steps ahead of marvel and they always will be. I hope that they will let James Gunn make a sequel.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I felt the Suicide Squad had a lot of potential as a concept for a movie (Definitely a fan of the comics). Supervillians who ""save"" the earth has a lot of avenues and stories to explore.James Gunn wholeheartedly made this sequel better than the first, as a sequel or quasi-reboot. The characters stand out & the humor (the humor is organic and doesn't feel corny like some Marvel movies, I'm looking at you The Marvels ) & violence is turned up to 10. Ratcatcher 2 seems to be the heart & soul of the movie as she is more emotional & compassionate than a standard ""villian"". There are many great shots and noteworthy scenes. Truly enjoyable. I wish this didn't come out during covid to see how it really could've done in the box office. I really hope there is a third one, just to explore more of the characters and see how well they interact. Definitely recommend it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

His comedic writing is amazing and it shines in this R rated film. He's able to get very dark comedic value out of everything and it's very entertainingActing is great especially Margot Robbie and Idris Elba. I have always loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and she showed why she's the perfect person to play this character.Villain was very generic and wasn't interesting. They spent a lot of time on the squad which is great but they sacrificed the villain development.Overall the film is great. It really captures the perfect tone for this type of movie and gives some amazing characters. Although the villain needed some work James Gunn still created a entertaining DC instalment.8.5/10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The comedy in this film was more slapstick than actually comedic and witty. I like some slapstick but you have to have substance behind it to make it work.

Will Smith couldn't make the reunion so English actor Idris Elba (the man who should be Bond) is in a similar role as ""Blood Sport"" with the coolest Superhero costume.I know at my age I shouldn't be so into this world of Heroes and Villains, but it's what I grew up with as a 60's baby...70's made me.Back to my review...
Walking Dead's"" Michael Rooker
as ""Savant"" proves you should never mess with birds...and while we're at it what's with his hair.He looks like Edgar Winters love child.Viola Davis is back as ""Amanda Waller"".""Rick Flagg"" fans won't be dissatisfied either.Wrestler turned actor John Cena is hilarious as ""Peacemaker"" representing the American Dream.Be prepared to witness gory carnage and a very high body toll.If you are looking for escapism this roller coaster ride will satisfy that thirst.""The Suicide Squad"" treads happy middle ground between both the Marvel and DC Universes with its mix of dark as dark chocolate humour and blood letting.Not recommended for children.Don't leave till the lights come on or you'll miss the Easter Egg.This movie is why I go to the cinema!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had basically wrote off any further films, and never planned to watch a sequel. However, after seeing the high rating, and reading some reviews, I decided to give this a chance. It's actually really entertaining.There is alot of humor in this film. That is one of the highpoints. It's actually funny, and most jokes land. The shark character is one of the funniest. Harlyquin is also funny, as well as Peacemaker. The rat girl is funny too.The action is off the charts. There is great action sequences in this, and great CGI. Along with the action is the gore. It is surprisingly gory.I strongly recommend this, and that is coming from someone who hated the first film.Anyways, this is my 300th attempt to review this. They keep getting rejected. Let's hop this one makes it through, as I have about 20 other rejected reviews to also attempt to upload. My original reviews were more detailed.

If you view it as a dc universe film that'll contribute to future films then I don't think you'll like it much because this movie felt like it didn't take itself as seriously. I absolutely loved Harley Quinn in this movie, her actions scenes were so good, it had me on the edge of my seat. I was sitting there impressed and in awe, Harley truly felt like herself here. The outfit and the hair was a good upgrade, I love that the crew didn't need to save her. Bloodsport was alright, I liked that he had a conflicted relationship with his daughter. It's not something I see in many hero films. I LOVED ratcatcher, her character was really sweet and a bit naive. I wasn't annoyed with her character at all and I loved the backstory this character had. The character John Cena played was interesting, at times his jokes fell flat but I loved the twist that happened to his character at the end, it was really good. Lastly, I liked that rick flag wasn't just a love interest in this movie. He had an actual personality and I really liked it. He became this really interesting character and I like it.King shark is an adorable gem I love him, that's it. The villain was a bit underwhelming, I loved the big fight at the end but the villain wasn't all that interesting. I just wasn't feeling the conflict.Overview: If you're looking for an action, comedy with some funny jokes and some and jokes, I recommend. This movie may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it entertainment wise.

None and I repeat none of the characters had a complete arc; only suggestions of a journey in the past which some carried baggage from. It suffers from what I call cinema episodia introduced by the MCU where none of the films complete the story within the duration of a feature film often leaving the audience with cliffhangers or implications of a possible future where the real conclusion will take place. I miss the days when one film told a complete story within its timeline.","32 out of 74 found this helpful.

I loved every single character presented to us, from the classic Harley Quinn to the new and strange Ratcatcher. The film improves on the mistakes of the previous iteration and presents us with a piece of cinema that conveys heart, acceptance and love.To reiterate, while I understand the violence and gore may not be for everybody, it's a stellar portrayal of misfits who are in desperate need of a purpose.

It's what the first Suicide Squad should have been (would have been had Will Smith not demanded the rewrite making everything revolve around him). And that made this movie a lot of fun. And the fact it took the most ridiculous villian (and heroes) and just had a good time trying to make it serious (at the same time as not trying to make it serious at all), made this funny and entertaining and a ride where you never knew what was coming next.That being said, I did have issues. They did regurgitate some of the plot from the first film (the dad who is a bad guy but chooses to be part of the SS to make his daughter see him as a hero) and other such things. I felt like either they did that as a joke or they didn't realize they were doing the same thing again.Luckily, the whole ""same thing"" again changed really soon and it became a ride where I was laughing aloud in shock. The competition between Bloodsport and Peacemaker had me dying the whole movie. I usually can see things coming in movies but this movie I never had a clue.Oh, and John Cena in undies? Trust me.

If you like ""Guardians"" you'll love this movie, except for me I think this movie is better in many aspects.Firstly this movie feels more grounded and relatable. This movie definitely has less green screens and CGI. Most of the scenes in this movie were shot in actual real locations and all the scenes in the movie look gorgeous! Despite all the violent and bloody action sequences, this movie actually has more emotion than you'd expect. James Gunn has the ability to turn bizarre comical characters that we've never even heard of into some real-life people that we all can relate to and therefore it makes this whole movie more realistic, grounded and emotional. You really feel for the characters in this movie although they are all villains and the chemistry between all these characters is the best part of the film. You'd feel like everyone in the squad serves a purpose, they are not just being thrown in there to make up numbers. I loved every character in the movie.The story, acting, cinematography etc are on point in this movie. I guess the only thing some people probably would feel uncomfortable about is the intense graphic content. Some people might feel a little offended by certain R-rated scenes in the movie. This movie really doesn't hold back. There's violence, nudity, dark humor, literally every R-rated thing you could think of is in this movie. You might find that a little uncomfortable but I absolutely loved it. It makes this movie so hilarious. I laughed a lot in this movie, so absolutely no problem with that.This movie is definitely worth watching on the biggest and the best movie system you could get. I'll can't wait to watch it on Blu-ray again! Support this movie :)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, the plot is very simple, pumped up to epic length with large-scale effects and decorations, as well as distracting side loads. Every moment of this too-long film is chaos, filled with sharp humor and graphic gloom. Even the quieter episodes are shot in ominous tones with a strong sense of hidden intensity.

Compared to the first version, the lesson has been understood and that is why we are left with this very good cinema product.The director of Guardians of the Galaxy surprises us on certain points in this opus, but we still feel his cinema. The latter ends up with an excellent soundtrack, very aesthetic and understandable action scenes and an extremely present color scheme. Indeed, in this feature film, we do not take the lead. The script is just plausible enough while being very crazy, but be careful, because it is also very raw. The special effects are really believable and the gore is present in this film with almost horrific and bloody scenes. Humor is a real quality of the film and we like to follow the crazy adventures of this suicide squad.The actors all play well and it's nice to see Margot Robbie keep her role as Harley Quinn while giving her a real character here. Her character is funny and pops off the screen just like John Cena as an uncompromising Peacemaker, who is more than correct and believable in his role as an anti-hero. His character makes it possible to make a relatively subtle criticism of the hypocritical role of the United States in the experiments, which do not respect the Geneva Convention, carried out in third countries in order to be able to clear themselves easily of any participation. Obviously, the film's concept of taking villains or anti-heroes and making them the protagonists leads to a questioning of good and evil that is as interesting and well executed compared to its very schoolboy predecessor in the field. It should be remembered that all members of the suicide squad are bloodthirsty killers even if they are presented in a favorable light.This film brings the DC Universe back to life in complete overhaul. It even allows, let's not be afraid to say it, to put back a little competition compared to Marvel films. What we can remember from this film is that it is wild, funny, well paced with iconic shots and a quality soundtrack. In conclusion, it was a nice experience that I will not hesitate to renew for fun and that I recommend to cinema and superhero film lovers. 8/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The two projects launched in 2020 had been failures, however horrible they may not be. However, James Gunn entered this universe and managed to deliver us the best film in the DCEU. Unlike 2016's Suicide Squad, this one manages to develop the characters' relationship in a way that works very well, using some expository dialogues that make a lot of sense with the characters' situation. Nothing involving their development feels forced and each time they split into different cores works well too. The comedy is very good, although at times James Gunn gets lost in some jokes, especially with Harley Quinn. It's a magical film, with beautiful CGI and enchanting photography, it oozes the director's stamp.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The musical score is a perfect fit, as expected from Gunn with his track record with Guardians of the Galaxy.As the title states, the R rating isn't just for show. There's gore, and lots of it, though not always for the sake of it - it's woven into dark comedic action-packed scenes where your mouth will alternate between ""haha"" and ""ohhh (painful)"". Definitely worth watching with no kids about.The non-perfect score, from me at least, is because you do kind of need to watch the other DC movies with Harley Quinn (eg Birds of Prey) to get the most of her character. Her antics and almost overshadow the other members of the team which is already made up of strong characters in their own right.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

James Gunn delivers DC movies with a bright and colorful feel, unlike other DC films. The film gives a bright approach with its comedy, does not show anything sad, silly, funny and strange. All combined by Gunn well. Very powerful characters with amazing stunts. A simple mission but passed with a ridiculous tragedy. Presents some unpopular comic characters and is combined with popular characters. As well as Bloodsport who is the main concern because of the shooting action with his sophisticated equipment, King Shark who looks funny with adorable words, the strange power of Polkadot-Man who is colorful but deadly, Peacemaker who appears loyal and patriotism, Ratcather II who becomes an important figure at the end of the film and of course the Diva, Harley Quinn. The beginning of the film gives a group of other villains who are also members of Task Force X. However, they were presented quickly without showing their true strengths so it became unfortunate and futile. Amanda Waller became a different character from David Ayer's version. In this film, for me Amanda Waller doesn't give a side of assertiveness as a leader. Instead, he has a role that is like acting recklessly, rashly and selfishly.James Gunn's The Suicide Squad certainly has far differences from David Ayer's version. The film has a bright tone, full of satirical comedy, full of harsh and bolder phrases. Good story premise. With a different story plot from other DC movies. Featuring less well-known supervillains and becoming one to get a large portion outside of the DC superhero character story. A good, well-constructed conflict. All characters have equal portions, are balanced and have personal conflicts that become one unit in the story of this film. This film became an entertaining film besides Shazam. It was highly recommended to get a sequel, after news circulated that Peacemaker got the solo series.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Suicide Squad succeeds on doing so. As the title says The Suicide Squad, the movies does very well on how it would work as a group of supervillains. They abandon a specific mission, they die. And they must take order to save the world. But the story has proven how it can really make up for last time. It was gory, more intense and even has funny moments. In this film, this isn't mainly about Harley Quinn. It's actually about the entire team of superheroes. And thanks to a great execution, the action scenes are exciting and interesting to watch. There also has a lot of surprises the movie can offer. The visuals are greatly edited. And even the characters are enjoyable. It has listened to the criticism and gave them development. Feel let down by the 2016 film? This film will definitely make up for that and would contain a lot of things the last time it could've have. I would recommend giving this a watch. This is not only better than the 2016 film, but also one of my favorite DC Extended Universe films next to Wonder Woman and Shazam.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Peacemaker (John Cena) & a host of other crazy convicts from Belle Reve prison, are tasked with an almost impossible mission on the dangerous island of Corto Maltese. Writer/director James Gunn has given us a funny, shocking, action-packed & overall entertaining movie. This film surpasses its 2016 predecessor by leaps & bounds. This Suicide Squad is a mind-blowing film. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are impeccable. And each character is unforgettable. Everyone from Margot Robbie to John Cena seemed to have upped their game in the acting department. Margot Robbie does a spectacular job as Harley Quinn & the supporting cast does a great job, too. With over the top action & plenty of gore & destruction, the film never fails to entertain, sometimes falling short on its jokes, humor is still in high regards & will keep you from leaving you're seat, along with its edge of the seat suprises. I was actually very surprised at how much I loved it! This Suicide Squad is a must watch for DC Extended Universe & James Gunn fans.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Every lead characters were well written and we might even feels strangely emotional to these bottom barrel villains. The movie also gives me a Game of thrones vibe since non of the characters were safe and their death is not something the way you have expected.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn as usual was perfect and charming and filled with a lot of fun and surprises. Idris Elba and John Cena as rival assassins were hilarious and bad ass at the same time. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag did a great jod. Sylvester Stallone as King Shark aka Nanaue was an absolute delight. Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2 and David Dastmalchian as PolkaDot man managed to showcase the depth of their characters very well.Overall The Suicide Squad is a fun filled gory and crazy adventure that is bloody entertaining and worth every minute.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Using swear words instead of dialogue isn't clever or funny. Dragging out every scene like it's a GCSE art project isn't entertaining. Filling your cliches with cliches is something people on day 1 of film writing school do. Putting as many characters as you can into every scene so everyone gets completely lost and you don't care about anyone or what's happening is exactly what was wrong with all the Transformers movies.James Gunn, the writer and director, needs to grow up. He's meant to be an adult man. Why would an adult man think anyone is entertained by gratuitous blood, violence, gore and completely unecessary nudity? Tropic Thunder parodied this kind of movie (using Jack Black as the actor who only stars in movies filled with fart jokes). People who loved this film would also have loved the first Deadpool movie for all the same reasons.Wonder Woman 1984 was terrible. Batman Vs Superman was terrible. Justice League (whichever version) was terrible. This was actually worse.As for the scene where the shark thing stomps around in an aquarium (Which for some reason is inside an alien research lab) and makes friends with some fish - my IQ actually fell out of my head.It's put me off going to the cinema ever again.

James Gunn had his hand all over this film, stylizing it like Guardians of the Galaxy, DeadPool, and Birds of Prey, but also having it's own unique personality. Right off the bat, this was a gorgeous film to look at. There were so many great shots, with some top notch editing. I'm not too sure if this is a sequel, or a straight up remake to the 2016 version, but James Gunn improved every single aspect! This feels like The Suicide Squad, done right, utilizing it's R rating to the fullest! Knowingly, Gunn incorporates a lot of good risks and stakes in his films, he cranked that aspect up to eleven, giving this film some serious spine, while also involving some good tones throughout. The plot itself was rather simple, but the way the story was told, was what gave this film the separation from the bunch. With a runtime of over two hours, this film kept me engaged the whole time, moving at such a brisk pace, while the story evolves with every scene.With this being a beautifully made film, the characters is what took it to another level. Although these are legitimately bottom of the barrel heroes (being one of my few issues I have with the film), James Gunn brought every single one of them to life, giving them each, great character moments, and decent development across the board. They all had their own personalities, and likabilities to them. You can tell everyone on set was having a good time, because every piece of dialogue felt genuine. The script was super witty, and ridiculously funny, but the characters are what sold each scene - There was nobody who overshadowed anyone. The one take away from having a surplus of likable characters, its hard to balance everyone, and make them equally important and worth caring about.The action was another high point to this film, having so much gore and grit! With a film like this, you can expect somewhat of a body count, but James Gunn wanted to show off his gritty style, and everyone became an option for death. Gunn added so many casualties to this film, but keeping things at a certain level, so it didn't look like Night of the Living Dead. With a James Gunn film, you can expect a great soundtrack, and the soundtrack and score here was phenomenal! It enhanced every single sequence, really sucking you into what's going on. The few take aways I have with the action; granted it was probably one of the most entertaining part of the film, but there were parts that felt a little too over the top, while some over the CGI came over a tad hammy.Overall, The Suicide Squad is a smash hit!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Bad idea! Gunn is in full rampage mode here and absolutely nothing works. At all. The action is noisy and tiresome, the plot is non existant, and the characters are utterly boring. Worst of all; the humor falls flat 90% of the time, being way to juvenile - which doesn't really match the excessive and gory violence throughout. There is a hint of satire buried in the mix, but it is lost in the stupid, kliché ridden plot. I was bored throughout the entire movie, and actually enjoyed David Ayers version much more.

The worst of those was easily 2016's Suicide Squad, a movie that seemed to do nothing right.But more recently, DC has begun to figure out how to click with audiences with modest hits like Shazam and Aquaman. And it looks like 2021's The Suicide Squad (despite its status as a sequel, its confusing title, and its release of HBO Max) followed in their footsteps. The result is easily the best DC Universe movie so far.Director James Gunn gets a ton of credit for picking through everything that didn't work about the previous Suicide Squad movie, while pulling what does work from comics and animated Suicide Squad movies (Assault on Arkham and Hell To Pay). This movie is less of a gritty, angsty thriller, instead leaning hard into offbeat humor and cartoonish, gratuitous violence. It's a decision that pays huge dividends; I never thought I'd laugh so hard, so many times, at gruesome dismemberment.The movie has the same premise as the previous film: a group of captured supervillains undertake a super-secret mission for the government in exchange for time off their sentences. It's a setup that's rife with opportunity for clashes between big personalities, a promise that the movie delivers on in spades.Gunn sheds almost the entire cast of the first film to create an entirely new team of supervillains forced to do the government's dirty work. The only returning faces are Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, the breakout character of this universe, as well as Rick Flagg and Amanda Waller, who serve as the straight men to the wacky ensemble.In the lead role, Idris Elba's Bloodsport replaces Will Smith's Deadshot, and the movie is infinitely better for it. The linchpin of the movie is exploring how, even as a contract killer, Bloodsport is still capable of empathy. Elba perfectly rides the line between scumbag and nice guy. Through his foil, John Cena's Peacemaker, we see a nearly identical character (""He does everything I do!"") but without a conscience to guide him.Alongside them, the movie digs deep for the most obscure, most ridiculous DC characters possible. Rounding out the roster is Polka-Dot Man, Ratcatcher II, and King Shark (the bipedal talking shark voiced by Sylvester Stallone). There's even a nod to Arm-Fall-Off Boy, easily the silliest comic character ever made. Dropping these characters into an R-rated live-action setting heightens the absurdity and humor even further. But in addition to that, every single notable character has a fully fleshed out personality and character arc (well, except King Shark). Against all odds, the script makes you care about these C-list characters, more than I ever cared about Batman in the newest Justice League.Gone are the muted colors and nighttime scenes of Zack Snyder's DC. This is one of the most colorful and vibrant blockbusters in recent memory. Here, superpowered people gore soldiers on sunny beaches with confetti and polka dots. It's a refreshing change of pace, and I wish more movies would try it.It's easy to criticize this movie as dumb, gratuitous, and/or pure spectacle. Those criticisms wouldn't be unfounded - this won't be winning Best Picture at the Oscars anytime soon. But I would never accuse James Gunn and the other who made this movie of being careless or unthoughtful. They picked out what was good and what wasn't out of previous DC movies with surgical precision. And with that, Gunn injected the script with his trademark goofy tone that feels right at home alongside his other films like Guardians of the Galaxy. This might be a movie that features multiple gunshots to the groin, but every choice it makes is intentional, helping to steer the DCEU in a bold new direction.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was fun, entertaining, bizarre, wacky, funny, over the top bloody as well as touching and sweet at the end. Here is what happens when there is a right writer and director at the wheel. Its not that i don't like David Ayer - i liked many of his films, but 2016 version sucked - in my opinion.Overall, i won't spoil anything, just going to say that ""The Suicide Squad"" (2021) is a real fun entertainment. Biggest kudos to writer director
James Gunn for making this movie, it was a real blast.And at the end of the day there was King Shark, who absolutely stole every scene for me. Here is a character which was perfectly voiced by Sly himself, that despite eating human heads was charming and sweet in every scene. You can't ask more from a popcorn movie.","5 out of 24 found this helpful.

The Suicide Squad felt like a love letter to DC nerds everywhere, willing to engulf its main cast in the wacky regalia of their comic counterparts, where many other films of the genre would typically shy away in favour of tactical jumpsuits.Talking about the performance, my darling Harley Quinn's character is portrayed once again by the Margot Robbie and she is always so freaking awesome. It seems as if she was born to play the character of Harley Quinn. Idris Elba, as Bloodsport is good. John Cena as Peacemaker is so dumb good and his chemistry with Bloodsport is extremely entertaining to watch. Daniela Melchior, as Ratcatcher is so cute to watch. The rest of the character are also very good.The background music, cinematography, action choreography, editing are of world class. The story of the movie is horribly beautiful just like the mind of James Gunn. This movie breaks the rule of plot armour and is a perfect standalone movie.This trash poetry of James Gunn, shows its R rating violence in a stylish and comedic way to justify the title of the movie The Suicide Squad.You may be wondering whether this is a remake of, or a sequel to, David Ayer's 2016 Suicide Squad. It's a reasonable question. But one which new writer-director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) answers by effectively saying: 'Don't worry about all that. Let's just have some fun.'

Why make her so dumb and all? Why? I hated it and it was awkward to watch. Then we have rick flag and peacemaker. Those were actually good and i liked them besides the fact that i didnt care for the movie anymore. The relationship between bloodsport and ratcatcher was nice to see.

Guardians of the Galaxy
DeadpoolDisclaimer: this film features some brutal violence, a ton of offensive jokes, foul language, and a dangerous amount of fun. Keep away from children and Christians.A hell of a comeback after the appallingly bad part one. This ""continuation"" of the first, 2016 ""Suicide Squad"" is in no way similar to it's ugly predecessor, except for a couple of reappearing characters like Harley Quinn. Part two was written and directed by James Gunn, the incomparable (despite his stupid tweets), crazy fun writer-director of both Guardians of the Galaxy films. This was the best person they could have ever possible chosen for the creation of such a movie: in short, this is just the most outrageously crazy and fun film I've watched probably since Deadpool 2 three years ago. Described by Gunn himself, the film is ""a 1970s war movie action comedy"" and is filled with uncensored, unlimited and unburdened creativity. You can just feel how first Gunn and then the whole crew were having a blast creating this hilarious gem with it's absurd, Drax-Starlord style dialogues and crazy, dumb (in a good way) action scenes. The pacing is simply perfect for such a movie, the introduction is shortened into oblivion to like 5 minutes; and we instantly get the action we came to see. The film also features cool little cameos in the faces of Sylvester Stallone (voicing King Shark), Pete Davidson, Josh Brolin, Mahershala Ali (I think?) and Taika Waititi. For a DC/Marvel movie this honestly could have been a 9/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sooooo much better than the 1st Suicide Squad. CGI was used exactly as it should be...for ridiculous, over the top gore and mayhem and so Sly Stallone can be King Shark. As insane as it sounds, I loved the realism and humanity in this movie. The cast was all fantastic. Each character was given some great lines and moments to shine, and they all delivered perfectly. Not one wasted moment or scene. Well done!!After reading some of the other comments, I need to add a few things. I saw as many people complaining that nothing was explained, as I saw people complaining everything was too spoon-fed. How can it possibly be both? Clearly a bunch simply can't get past themselves to enjoy what's in front of them. I read people complaining the humor was forced and ""didn't land"", except that it wasn't and absolutely did. If you can't laugh at Stallone as King Shark saying ""nom nom"" when looking at an alien to eat....you have no sense of humor.In conclusion I'll just say this....before watching this movie (and you absolutely should)...take a deep breath, clear your mind of all preconceptions and wtvr nonsense happens to be eating you at the time, and prepare to be entertained.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

What's also incredible is how many of them die, it doesn't even hold back on highly famous actors. The plot, is pretty standard...nothing new but certainly not bad in any way. I think the movie could have done better with comedy, it had its moments but many one liners were poorly timed which left the brutal gore to be the funny parts. Now, the gore is very fun to watch...disgusting but absolutely brilliantly done. The characters also have development unlike the last suicide squad, this means the audience has a connection with the characters and feel emotion when something bad happens. I think the beginning of the movie is the highest point of the movie, it sets the tone of the movie so expertly well and is simply amazing, from the pacing to the over the top action. The ending, while still good, was actually too light hearted for a movie about death. The soundtrack was also decent...I was expecting more music from the director of Guardians, but he held back a bit. Anyway DC heading in the right direction by hiring a marvel director :)","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Col. Flag (Joel Kinnaman) returns as their leader. This film goes far beyond the usual comic book level violence. People are eaten alive by King Shark (voice - Sylvester Stallone), heads crushed, enemies set on fire, boomerangs cut off brain pans. Harley carries out mass slaughter on an industrial scale and she also becomes the love interest of a Dictator whose island the Squad invades. But there is the human side to things, especially with Ratcatcher (Daniela Melchior) who controls rats, plays beauty to King Shark's beast and tries to help Bloodsport to overcome his rat-phobia, there is also a touching flashback to her creation story. Less humane is the way that her hordes of rats swarm over humans and eat them alive. Throw in a mad scientist experimenting on a giant Alien Starfish which spawns to create human zombies and you have another action vector. There are quite a few plot twists from early on in the film, to reveal any would be to spoil the fun. And fun there is along with adult level slaughter. Writer/Director James Gunn delivers a cracking good adventure which blurs the lines between good/evil meta-humans. 8.5/10.","4 out of 20 found this helpful.

First, Zack Snyder is the executive producer of this movie. Second, Snyder, Ayer and Gunn are good friends. Dawn of the Dead, was written by James Gunn himself. And third, James Gunn supports the Snyderverse. He himself said he wants to see the Ayer Cut. And this is Suicide Squad. It's always going to be a different team. So both can coexist. With all that said, let's move on to the actual review.The thing I like about James Gunn's movies is that he doesn't take anything seriously. This is the reason why we get to see many weird things happening which we won't normally see in any other director's movies. There are many such instances in this movie itself, most particularly in the beginning where TDK uses his detachable arms to slap the enemy soldiers. There are also King Shark, whom Gunn manages to make terrifying and cute at the same time, there's Harley Quinn of course, who imagines weird things and then acts accordingly, and there's Bloodsport who acts all tough but gets scared of a rat.The comic timing is what makes this movie so good. All the characters have something unique to offer, and all of them are making the scene more exciting. I really liked that part where Harley Quinn comes out of the building and sees everyone coming in to save her. There are also other scenes where I couldn't hold my laughter, like King Shark raising his arm and saying ""Hand!"" (for that matter all King Shark scenes were great). Many deaths come up unexpected, and the movie gives us enough reasons to care. So it's always a flinching moment whenever someone dies.My favourite character in this movie, which must have become obvious by now, is King Shark. Whenever he is on the scene we know something good is going to happen. Even when he is not doing anything he just stands there adorably. I also like Peacemaker. His dialogues are great, and every time he speaks it's something funny. Bloodshot also has some really great action scenes along with him. Ratcatcher II and Harley Quinn were also hilarious when needed. The team that comes in the start really sets the mood and I really hope they do something great with Weasel. He looked interesting.I have only read one Suicide Squad comic (Rebirth) and watched three movies (the 2016 one, this and Hell To Pay). So I won't call myself an expert on the franchise. But seeing how Kill the Justice League is also seeming to be in similar tone, I believe Suicide Squad is supposed to be this hilarious rollercoaster. And this movie absolutely stands by it. I'd really hope we get to see at least like, ten Suicide Squad movies and shows in this decade.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

This is one of the best blockbuster films probably since Avengers: Endgame. This feels exactly like a comic book exactly and I mean that as a positive. James Gunn nailed the action, there were times I found myself at the edge of my seat because of how amazing the action really was, weather it was the final battle or Harley Quinn and the best we have seen her. Margot Robbie absolutely kills it as Harley Quinn. The movies pacing flies by and doesn't spend too much time away from the action. The comedy is all great throughout and I was constantly laughing throughout this movie. Every character has that one moment to shine throughout as well weather it is that one joke or an emotional moment every has something about them. James Gunns writing here is so whitty that it feels so unique in a genre that realistically has been very overcrowded over recent years where there is a new film every couple of months. Honestly I think Margot Robbie is the perfect casting for Harley Quinn as well and personally I think it's time we put her in the top tier castings for comic book characters. The cast here is all amazing and you can see there passion for this project within there roles.Overall Thoughts- 'The Suicide Squad' is everything I wanted and more it is hilarious, entertaining and surprisingly emotional. Between all that the action is brutal and bloody and one of the most brutal films you will see for a while. James Gunn created a flat out creative and wacky experiences every character has its moments and honestly I cannot wait to watch this again. This film is perfect in every way. Overall I'm going to give 'The Suicide Squad' a 10/10.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

"9","/10","One of the most gloriously over-the-top movies of its kind that never stops being fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7219169/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","12 August 2021","""The Suicide Squad"" is a standalone sequel to the similarly titled 2016 DC Universe superhero film. Written and directed by James Gunn (Guardians Of The Galaxy Volumes 1 and 2), it is one of the most gloriously over-the-top movies of its kind that never stops being fun.In exchange for more lenient sentences, the villains Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Peacemaker (John Cena), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), and numerous other super powered prisoners agree to assemble into a team referred to as ""Task Force X"" (a.k.a. The ""Suicide Squad"") by commander Amanda Waller (Viola Davis). Their mission is to infiltrate the government compound of the small Latin American nation of Corto Maltese to acquire information regarding a top secret experiment known only as ""Project Starfish"". Once there, the team encounters various hardships they must overcome, including distrust among themselves and a looming threat that could end all life on Earth.To put it mildly, 2016 was a rocky year for the DC Universe. Both its films ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" and ""Suicide Squad"", despite their moderately successful box office returns, received a great deal of disdain from both critics and fans of the source material. The latter film in particular had the potential to break away from the stereotype of DC being all dark and depressing with its energetic ensemble cast of characters, but instead it squandered it all away in favour of rushing out a product simply to make a quick buck. Thankfully, in the hands of James Gunn, ""The Suicide Squad"" delivers an appropriate apology to everyone who hated its predecessor by addressing nearly all of its problems in the best ways possible.Now free from the confines of a PG-13 classification, this version flaunts its R-rating at every opportunity. The violence is frequent and brutal, characters often swear, and even the occasional graphic scene of nudity sneaks its way in there. In other words, it's exactly what the original should have been like. But that's not to say the entire film is just a gratuitous display of sensationalistic chaos, believe me, it still has a heart. In stark contrast to the first movie, there's a certain consistency to all of this madness. Unlike the 2016 film, which was a bizarre mess of tonal shifts and poor attempts at humour, this version manages to find harmony in all of these eccentric moments. For every comedic scene that didn't work, there were at least two others to make up for it later on. Likewise, whenever the film delved into dramatic territory, they all felt earned and weren't just shoehorned in there for the sake of it. To call this film better than the original would be a major cop out, as anyone with half a brain will be able to figure out right away what this one does right that the other did wrong.With a filmmaker as shamelessly entertaining as James Gunn at the helm, we should all know what to expect from a film like this. The man injects his trademark off-colour sense of humour into every frame, whether it's a not-so-subtle dig at US interventionism in Latin America or simply a person being eaten alive by a walking great white shark. He also paces the film rather quickly but never so much that the information is hard to absorb or isn't worth investing in. Additionally, Gunn has written a story that is more believable within the context of the current state of the DC Universe. As we have previously seen in 2020's ""Birds of Prey"", DC is more than capable of exploring R-rated themes without straying too far from what has already been established. Gunn successfully continues this formula and as a result has given us a film that can both stand on its own as an independent entry in DC's catalogue while also leaving certain aspects open should the higher ups at Warner Bros. Wish to expand upon anything else featured here.Best of all, in a film with such a large cast, its characters are well developed and their gimmicks aren't simply there for a throwaway gag. Each member of the squad justifies his or her reason for being here, no matter how insignificant. I really enjoyed the rivalry between Bloodsport and Peacemaker, who were both played wonderfully by Idris Elba and John Cena, respectively. Watching these two try to outdo the other resulted in one of the film's funniest scenes. I never would have picked Elba and Cena having such good comedic chemistry but thanks to James Gunn's solid writing and direction it all works out for them. Of course, Margot Robbie once again owns the role of Harley Quinn, in her third outing as the iconic DC villain. Harley has well and truly moved on from the Joker and holds her own slicing and dicing her way through anyone who tries to stop her. However, based on sheer absurdity, King Shark steals the show in almost every scene he is in. Whether it's Sylvester Stallone's amusing mumbling or his indecisiveness on who he should or shouldn't eat, this anthropomorphic shark with a beer gut was great fun to watch. Normally, a character like this would not have worked, but remember that James Gunn is the same man who made a talking raccoon and a talking tree work in the Guardians of the Galaxy films so a humanoid shark isn't that hard to comprehend.Though it wasn't exactly difficult to improve upon the original, this film does so in virtually every way imaginable. It just goes to show that in the hands of the right filmmaker, it is possible to redeem even the worst of the worst. The 2016 film may have been ""A"" Suicide Squad, but this one is rather appropriately ""THE"" Suicide Squad, meaning that it's the only one worth acknowledging. Reportedly, there is a spin-off series in development focusing on Peacemaker with John Cena reprising his role from the movie so I look forward to that. I hope there will also be a third film in this style in the not-to-distant future but until then, I am thankful to James Gunn for bringing us this one for the time being.I rate it 8.5/10.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A step up, for Suicide Squad and the whole of DC.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7201896/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2021","Keep this in mind everyone, lest you lose track: this isn't Suicide Squad. This is THE Suicide Squad. Why that name, you ask? Well, because it makes the previous Suicide Squad easier to forget, whereas this new production is, as the title promises, THE film adaptation of the DC line of comics. Oh, what a difference a definite article makes.First, they followed up on the hilarious pomposity of Batman v Superman with a film that was only made into a Marvel-aping action-comedy in post (plus one or two reshoots). Then, they hired Marvel regular Joss Whedon to make Justice League more uplifting and comical too late into production. Now, DC continues to be ""nothing like Marvel"" by having James Gunn, the brain behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy pictures, try his hand at a Suicide Squad movie where the tone and style were actually decided on when the camera started rolling.You may crack wise at how much more tolerable these movies become when DC and Warner Bros. Fully lean into the Marvelisms, but honestly, this one's something else! It's proof that Warner, on some level (certainly more than Marvel), get the idea that superhero films are at their most memorable when we let directors be themselves, hence this year gave us Zack Snyder's Justice League and now this.The Suicide Squad isn't perfect - nor is it as fascinatingly, unintentionally disturbing as Wonder Woman 1984 - but it is refreshingly ripe with personality. More than his Guardians movies, The Suicide Squad recalls Gunn's beginnings with Troma Entertainment, as he (rightfully) is no longer held back by a PG-13 rating.We do get Margot Robbie again, still a good pick for the clown queen of crime Harley Quinn (albeit much better written than in her debut), along with Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, and Viola Davis from the first flick, all of them more engaging than before. New to the cast are Idris Elba as the gloomy Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker (a jingoistic parody of Captain America), Sylvester Stallone as the null-witted King Shark, Daniela Melchior as the loveable and loving Ratcatcher, David Dastmalchian as the gloriously pathetic Polka-Dot Man, and Peter Capaldi as the devious Thinker.We also see such actors as Michael Rooker, Taika Waititi, Nathan Fillion, and Sean Gunn, the latter playing a character who somewhat resembles the noisome cat from Bloom County as mixed with Scrat (notably, many of these actors have been in MCU comedies). There's also Flula (of the similarly named YouTube channel) and a giant starfish who no doubt has an elaborate comic-book history.In true DCEU fashion, the idea of seeing all these comic-book baddies team up isn't too exciting on its own, since we haven't yet explored these characters in the same way we'd gotten to know the MCU iterations of Captain America, Thor, etc. Before seeing them join forces. (Time will tell if a similarly weak crossover will result from Warner Bros' Scoob movie, which was already a crossover between Scooby-Doo, Captain Caveman, Wacky Races, and Dino-mutt). Again, is this even the same Harley Quinn as the piece of meat we saw in the first film? Honestly, who cares? I'm just glad we have this one, and that she's now a part of a team that's actually enjoyable.In particular, I'm finding out more and more that John Cena can really act; frankly, everyone involved is doing a better job at generating chemistry here than in the 2016 film. These are some of Hollywood's biggest, fanciest names, yet they all seem at home in Gunn's B-movie call-back - some of the gore in this one, speaking of which, is worthy of his retro sci-fi piece Slither from 2006 (possibly also living up to his Super, which I'm yet to see).The film has a surprisingly grounded visual style that makes the fantastical elements seem more real, and thus more imposing - this is helped by the fact that everything else looks practical, hand-made, and sometimes cheap, especially the willfully shabby costumes of some of DC Comics' most embarrassing D-listers. But the parts that need to look expensive certainly do so, and the hand-held, often documentary-like camera work aids the immersion. There's the usual Hollywood action (plus the aforementioned, unbridled gore), yet we never lose sight of the characters or who's doing what. This is, in spite of its tiring climax, quite the refreshment.Last but not least, the dipsh-t fanboys aren't as annoying as they were back when critics panned the ""original"" SS and they all started bawling over the fact that people don't like it when films are sliced into tiny pieces that are thrown together at random with an equally random soundtrack, insipid lines, various edge-lord visuals, and such noobish editing flaws as black text on black backgrounds. You know, those things only Marvel shills hate?Wait, what was I talking about? Oh right, The Suicide Squad. It's fun, guys. Go see it.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

This is one of those movies you need to see on the big screen to get the most out of it, and a couple of friends as well.With Idris Elba leading a group of different characters with various powers and personality traits, the film keeps things interesting and fresh with many gags and dialogue sequences to bounce off on. Margot Robbie returns as Harley Quinn and she gets a good balance here of not being too annoying, and the villain has a good payoff by the end. No scene is wasted and the film strikes a perfect tone of goofy and seriousness.Not only that, it looks and sounds very good as well. The movie never drags, everything is explained well and the action sequences are gory fun and well executed. Soundtrack is used excellently and the special effects are great.

The movie is over two hours long, and in the ever shrinking span of paying attention it's important to keep that time period interesting. Gunn accomplishes this quite well, providing little down time in this action/adventure to keep your eyes focused on the chaos before you. When not drowning you in uber violent fight sequences, the movie is spending much of its time shoving jokes down your gullet keeping you entertained to avoid sleeping through this adventure. That pace cuts through what could have been a slog and gets thumbs up from yours truly.The Comedy At Times:
James Gunn loves making you laugh, and he tries very hard in this film to pull out a more mature approach than what Guardians did. The Suicide Squad is more of that darker comedy we got with Deadpool, censoring little and forcing you into awkward territory in ways that sometimes are perfect for inciting a laugh. King shark's limited knowledge and naivety is a large source of the laughs, alongside Cena's still awkward performances that fit decently well in his toilet crowned character. Banter by Harley also helps lighten things up, and Gunn's colorful vision does a nice job helping make her psychosis enjoyable without overdoing it too much. It's clever moments like this that were very entertaining for me to watch and one of the bigger strengths of the film.Some of the Character Usage/Acting:
When the dust finally settles, Gunn accomplishes using some of the Squad quite well in this adventure. Elba's Bloodsport and John Cena's Peacekeeper have a rivalry that is fun to watch and gets quite the presentation on the screen. Much like a DC book, the dark broodiness and edge of the DC was fun to watch, as their intensity bled out into the rest of the team. Harley once again steals the show with her antics, but unlike Birds of Prey gets grounded into manageable levels of fun that fits well with the theatrics of the film and other partygoers. Secondary characters get some decent screen time involvement, using their ridiculous titles as a fantastic joke fodder, while pulling out some surprises to mix it up. It's Ratcatcher II though played by Daniela Melchior who was my favorite, as she had a dynamic that was fun, a story that was deeper than most others, and some fun interactions with the cast that required good chemistry. Almost like a glue to keep this heated bunch together, Ratcatcher II was a very enjoyable character to watch and only needed some better action coordination to really make her complete for me.The Graphics/Visuals
Better than some of the computer work I've seen come out of the woodwork, DC invested some time and money to helping add more realistic sheen and grit to the details at hand. King Shark is a beast of fluid animation and uncomfortable stares of his eyes, while the dreaded Project Starfish has a blend of cartoony with real life that feels a nice hybrid of the worlds. Special effects are edited well to make the fights pop, and maintain the darker tones of the film including immersing you in the carnage at hand. I enjoyed the makeup and effects to further bring out the characters, including the costumes that once again feel like live versions of the costumes from the graphic novels I read.DISLIKES:The Plot is Okay:
Where Justice League's plots held lots of arcs coming together, Shazam had surprising deep character morals, and Man of Steel a deeper dive into the psyche of superman that was okay, The Suicide Squad's plot was much simpler than other installments. A little buddy dynamic chemistry is primary well point, otherwise it's a lot of mashed together simple plots for a grandiose mission with little details or surprise. Sure, a twist tries to shake things up, but in reality the story feels like a contained volume of a comic book that is begging for more time to tell the tale. What is probably the worst part of the story though, is how they seem to change their mind near the end and try to make this thing be a bigger part, again setting up the potential for the Suicide Squad universe to exist in the future. The ambiguity of the ending is only offset by trying to figure out where this thing fits in regards to the original given the poor recap of the first squad to save time. That sort of sloppy storytelling can be ignored to a point, but the bigger piece is still unanswered at this time.The Action is Okay:
I don't know why D. C. seems to struggle with coming up with quality actions scenes, but this movie sort of continues that trend that despite the promise we had. Outside of a few fights, most of the skirmishes are kind of senseless, rather dumb, and over before they built up steam. While I know that Gunn put a point to his decisions, but I'm honestly wishing they could add a little more traditional acting and fighting that films like Winter Soldier, Iron Man 1, and Avengers 1 achieved. Yet, this film is all about the darker side of action and comedy styles, so I guess I should not be surprised that the action took a turn the way it did.The Violence/Gore aspect:
I can handle the gore pretty well and fortunately not too much body horror/torture to drag things out. However, I warn those who hate excessive gore to steer clear of Gunn's work unchained. The Suicide Squad has no problem showing you the horrors of ""black ops missions"" and just how detrimental war can be on a body. Spit heads, burnt corpses, devoured frames and all the blood and viscera to go for it are on full display in this movie. While this goes with the carnal edge the Squad often has with it, I think it got a bit too excessive at times and the money could have been spent elsewhere on better fights, more time for storytelling, etc. While some of the blood was a perfect touch to death at hand, I think the ridiculous levels were a bit too much of the focus for this reviewer.Forced Humor:
Perhaps the other limitation of this movie is the fact that Gunn almost seemed to tried too hard to make us laugh for this film. For a while now super hero movies seem to struggle with filling time with lots of humor, shoe horning jokes in to get you laughing, or trying to be so dark and different that it comes out corny and quite the opposite effect. The Suicide Squad definitely felt that way for me and though it nailed the timing and punches perfectly, much of the darker humor was quite stiff either due to commercials or the volume we got. Again, his work in Guardians was smoother, more natural, and offset by other factors to give us a break, but this work... not even close to the balance he had, showing sometimes an R rating can remove too much of the boundaries for one to lose focus.The VERDICT:
The Suicide Squad was better than the first installment in this group, which for many is not going to be a surprise given how the bar was set. James Gunn shows his humor bone in a darker tone in this film, trying to merge action and comedy into an adventure that is up his unique style. He made a movie that moves well, with a pace and focus that was just about enjoying the volume and having fun in the absurd mission our colorful cast must complete. Some highlight moments blend the worlds perfectly together, and several of the characters show just what the first film could have been with the right direction helming the ship. However, the R rating almost removed too much of the filter for Gunn and that freedom sort of got in the way of the quality I have seen in the past. His ambiguous plot building and the politics complicating DC timelines makes the simplistic tale confusing to determine its place in the world. In addition the violence and gore got a little more focus than say some choreography and ingenuity that I think he could have had our group really pull off with the potential. Yet it's the forced humor and poor overall character usage that I think takes away from this movie, and trying too hard to get a laugh leaving me in cricket chirping stupor at how much he tried to make the jokes work.Overall, my scores for the film are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie overall: 7.0.","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

As is the case with The Suicide Squad.Everything was just so much better and more developed than the 2016 film(which I literally walked out of)
Margo Robbie steals the show yet again as the one and only Harley Quinn, but this time around she's much more mature, developed, and brutal. You really get to see what she's made of and how tough she really is.But Margo is not the only one adds to this films greatness, Idris Elba plays and excellent Bloodsport, adding a real sense of purpose and reality to the story. And who could forget John Cenas 'Peacemaker', what an awesome job he did of adding the dark comedy and unexpected shock and twist to the movie.And let's not forget the heart of the film, Daniela Melchior aka Ratcatcher 2. She really balances the team out, being what see as the real ""heart"" of the team. Her storyline adds a sense of dark reality and heartbreak that really grounds the movie.10 out of 10, deffinetly recommend.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Another surprise was Cena's performance as Peacemaker. TSS was a wild ride and I was impressed how Gunn made ALL characters shine.

The 2016 film is unwatchable, all the characters in the film are terrible, even Will Smith was hard to watch, all except for Margot Robbie as Harley, regardless it was unredeemable. This movie takes nothing from the other one, except for a few faces that had big roles, and makes it better in every conceivable way, the humor and graphic violence, the interaction between characters, just brilliant. John Cena is my favorite part of the movie as Peacemaker, excellently cast and he's freaking hilarious, I also loved Margot Robbie retuning as Harley, and Joel Kinnaman who was way more enjoyable this time around as Rick Flag, even Idris Elba as Bloodshot was awesome, And King Shark, he looked amazing. I loved every minute of it, one of the best DC movies ever.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film manages to mix action, jokes and occasional moments of warmth and emotion into a glorious romp.Okay, it is never going to feature in any person's top 5 films made but it sits high up in that list of films that you watch over and over again because they don't require a big emotional investment and they fit almost any mood (Bad Boys, The Mummy, Deadpool etc).James Gunn has produced a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours with a great cast, wonderfully over the top violence (so OTT that it's funny rather than gross) and a great visual style. The Lollipop Chainsaw inspired scene featuring Harley Quinn is one of the most wonderful scenes in many years. After the drab first attempt at putting Suicide Squad together on the big screen, this is a brilliant reprieve from another potential suicide mission to the multiplex.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It almost exclusively relies on gore and death for entertainment, and if that isn't your thing, there's nothing redeemable about this. The humor felt very 2012, and I didn't really laugh at all. Maybe a chuckle here or there. Also, the ""heart"" of the movie was so forced. Characters just randomly start talking about their backstory. I probably won't be rewatching.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Ever since James Gunn was announced to direct I had a feeling it was going to be good and it did deliver.My favorite part of the movie has to be the brilliant cast, a lot of big names and they all worked well together.Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn once again is my favorite character. Idris Elba played a leader and did good. John Cena delivered and I am excited to see the new Peacemaker series. Sylvester Stallone as King Shark has to be one of the highlights. Daniela Melchior was one of the people who made the movie so good. David Dastmalchian another gem had a really good performance.When are we getting a Ratcatcher 2 and King Shark movie/series? I loved the two of them together.Don't get too attached to any of the characters, some were gone too soon, others at the right time.Violent and funny, although some of the jokes felt forced and didn't land for me.Overall it is a good movie, enjoyable, fun, and one that balances a dark and light mood. Credit to the director, crew, and actors.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It also nailed something (or rather, many things) the original lacked, mainly being that it IS a suicide squad. It's a death mission and you genuinely fear that they won't make it out alive. The acting is so good and the characters (many being previously unknown to me) were lovable and funny. Unforeseen character dynamics form in the most rewarding way.

This movie turns out to be better than the first Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn .. I always had in mind that they showed Joker so many times in the Batman Live action movies, cause Batman has by far the best Rogue's Gallery compared to many other super-heroes, so where was Harley Quinn, that's what I thought, they should've shown her too? So when she showed up in the Suicide Squad I was surprised, and wow .. what a comically vibrant sensation it turned out to be . And the point that I was right about this . Is obviously her un-hindered appearance in all three consecutive movies . There's no movie without Harl, her funky style, funny accent, hilariously charming ways make her a fan-favorite .. Anyhow this movie is very comedic, pleases the audiences with humourous action which The Suicide Squad stands for . This time theres : Bloodsport , Rick Flag , Harley Quinn, Ratcatcher 2, Peacemaker, Polka Dot man 🤣 and Nanaeve , as the main team, cause the original team which which was sent on the mission dies in the start. And another stylish different thing about this movie is that it's r-rated .. which normally superhero movies aren't .

"10","/10","The Suicide Squad is hilarious and entertaining from start to finish, much to do with the script and direction from James Gunn but also its ensemble cast - My Ultimate Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7198828/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","5 August 2021","The Suicide Squad is the tenth film in the DCEU and was written and directed by James Gunn, if you enjoy and find his Guardians of the Galaxy movies good and funny then you will love this film. It shows how much he loves the characters and property, the R-Rating helps in a lot of ways. I found it utterly hilarious and kept laughing at the witty and well written dialogue, the actors execution of the dialogue is how the jokes work so well. It very much is a James Gunn film and I'm glad he got all the freedom from DC and Warner Brothers which was something David Ayer never got, but with that freedom James Gunn created something remarkable and unpredictable, a superhero movie that has everything to make it a classic.Viola Davis portrays the menacing Amanda Waller who runs the Task Force X program, she gives the Suicide Squad a task to destroy Jötunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory in the South American island nation of Corto Maltese that holds political prisoners and a site for secretive experiments, and the big villain Starro the Conqueror. The first group contains Colonel Rick Flag, Harley, Boomerang, T. D. K, Mongal, Javelin, Blackguard, Weasel and Savant. Whilst the second group contains Bloodsport, Nanaue/King Shark, Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man and Peacemaker. Thirteen inmates from Belle Reve penitentiary, all with different skill sets and powers which leads to some interesting, memorable and hilarious moments.The film stars an ensemble cast including Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Sylvester Stallone, Viola Davis, Daniela Melchior, Jai Courtney, David Dastmalchian, Peter Capaldi and Michael Rooker. It's quite a large ensemble cast but everyone gets their time to shine, some of course more than others. This film marks the third time Margot Robbie have played Harley Quinn and honestly I would lie if I would say she wasn't a highlight of this film like she was in the first Suicide Squad and then her own movie. But there are other characters here that manages to steal the spotlight and they are Idris Elba as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker, Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2 whom the director have said is the heart of the film and I agree with him (Cleo Cazo and her rat Sebastian), Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag was also another highlight and he is of course one of the very few returning characters from Suicide Squad (2016) I loved how much he have changed and it made him much more relatable and more entertaining to watch. The most entertaining character has to be King Shark, Sylvester Stallone nailed it. At first I wanted him to be serious but I'm down with this silly version, it worked in the animated Harley Quinn show and it worked even better here.John Murphy's musical score was simply brilliant and worked out with the tone of the film, he probably worked closely with James Gunn. The direction and script was fantastic, Gunn continues to amaze me with his terrific direction. He embraced the silliness and picked characters like Polka-Dot Man and an unfilmable villain like Starro the Conqueror and made him filmable. Starro the Conqueror was a perfect villain for the movie, but the real villains are the Suicide Squad members and the inner struggles they have, its engaging and interesting to see how these villains act and become friends with each other, some are just evil though. I wish we get Jarro sometime and a return of Starro, a man can wish. But he made it work and the screenplay which we got is truly amazing. I actually found the cinematography to be another aspect that I liked, the camera work and just visually, incredible and beautiful. Visual effects were spot on. The costumes deserves to be nominated for awards, great and comic accurate. It's just pleasing for the eyes and makes me smile with the huge level of detail they placed on this film. James Gunn has only love for the film and property.I hope James Gunn stays with DC for a sequel to The Suicide Squad and possibly another property. But right now we got the Peacemaker TV series to look forward to.","3 out of 18 found this helpful.

Firstly, its coming from james gunn who got to direct this film when he got temporarily fired by Disney for his past tweets. He was the perfect director to make suicide squad as the 2016 version tried to be gotg which failed.Also james gunn, gave interviews that he was given full freedom by the studios to make any kind of movie u like. And james gunn delivers it perfectly.The whole movie has james gunn flavor in it so hence we don't need to #releasethegunncut#. Its violent like some of his pre-mcu movies which I haven't seen, so it was new for me to see an r rated james gunn movie.There are lots of characters where most of them die in the beginning in which I felt Michael rooker's death very funny. My favorite character was ratcatcher 2 and king shark who are instantly likeable characters. Idris elba was badass as bloodsport but he reminded me a lot of deadshot as there are many similarities with him and deadshot. Both are expert in weapons and both have a daughter angle. Margot robbie was as usual fantastic as Harley quinn.The last act was nail biting as I was worried who will die and to my relief all my favorite characters survived in the end which made me feel good.On the whole, the suicide squad is funny, creepy, violent and emotional entertainer. This proves that how directors can perform if studios give them full freedom. #releasetheayercut#","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Stop listening to pansies who whine and complain about everything and focus on good scripts!! Movies should always contain some sense of controversy regardless but back to this movie. I love the fact that it's rated R I also love the fact that every single person in this movie nailed their roles. Even John Cena awesome performance on his part & of course the rest of the cast. Fire ending definitely leaves room for yet another sequel and with the improvement from the last Suicide Squad there's a great possibility they'll nail it again.

Considering the 'first' film that David Ayer made in 2016 was a big mess on many way, this iteration of The Suicide Squad was a welcome breath fresh of air.The biggest standout was the action. Yes it can be exaggerated, but the way the action was done was so entertaining and it reflected James Gunn's vision for how he wanted the film to look. The fact that almost all the action was very bloody highlights how much creative freed Gunn had.Chemistry between the characters was important here too. Idris Elba and John Cena's characters had a great relationship throughout. Margot Robbie shone as Harley Quinn and David Dastmalchian was surprisingly hilarious as Polka Dot man. (Yeah I don't know how that is either)The only hiccup for me was the writing, in certain stages, and most related to the humour. I thought some of the jokes didn't quite land, which are consistently strong in Gunn's Guardians films. But very minor negatives.A very enjoyable though, one I'd recommend without doubt. A second viewing will solidify my love for the film, a real breath of fresh weirdness.Quote - 'Nothing like a bloodbath to start the day' - PeacemakerRating - 4/5.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

This was for sure one of the most fun and entertaining movies that I sat through in the theater.First thing, this movie was hardcore rated R. Gores were everywhere and people getting brutally murdered and eaten. I love watching gore, and I was not disappointed at all. This was where my favorite two members of suicide squad shone. Harley, played wonderfully and wickedly by the beautiful Margot Robbie, had a great scene where she was just cruising and killing soldiers using guns and a javelin. Mr. Sharkman was awesome, and his best scene was when he ripped a soldier in half.Not only was the movie violent, it was hilarious. Most characters cracked clever and dirty jokes that had me laughing out loud. Their personalities and even struggles were also funny and used well. Even though not every jokes landed, they were still entertaining because all the members of the suicide squad had great chemistry with each other.The story itself was also a blast. Especially in the second half, it was crazy chaos and reek of awesomeness. Also, James Gunn put in some emotions to the characters. It's not the most important aspect of the story, but it was still pretty decent.My problem was that the first third was little bit slow and boring. But that was it, the rest after that picked up quickly and became a fun adventure.Overall, with great characters and spectacular actions, The Suicide Squad redeemed itself from its previous installment and it's a big win for DC. Definitely worth the hype. 9/10.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

The movie's trailers kind of give you an idea of what the movie entails - Dark humor, stylish action scenes, tons of gore and great background score and soundtrack. This is what i expect and this is exactly what i got l. Maybe a little more than what i expected.Here are some of the best aspects about this film - Visually stunning shots with amazing cgi (especially the cgi done on king shark and starro), Soundtrack used blends perfectly with the each and every scene, Great performances from each and every actor, The chemistry between the characters is dynamic and complement each other (unlike the first suicide squad film), Action sequences were quite thrilling as it provides a sense of danger to every character, The title cards in the movie are super creative and oddly satisfying to watch.Some of the under whelming aspects of the film - few of the characters were underused due to sudden and shocking deaths, the film paces slowly during its 2nd act (however the pace picks up during the 3rd act).To sum up, The Suicide Squad is a film that is a self aware of its ridiculousness. It is darkly comical and gory to glory. It is the most enjoyable DCEU film in my opinion. Don't expect this to be your usual DCEU movie because it's extremely different compared to other the projects under this universe. James Gunn has totally knocked it out of the park with this one.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is very little linkage to the first film apart from the title and 4 recurring characters. It pretty much starts anew, embarking on its own humor-infused adventure. Truely enjoyable, Gunn overhauled everything and made everything better. Idris Elba was surprisingly perfect for his role.

He has been behind The Guardians Of The Galaxy and not much else. The only similarity this film had with Guardians Of The Galaxy was the verity of the song choice. Otherwise, this film was completely different.The Suicide Squad is about a problem developing on the Corto Maltese. The new government is incredibly secretive. The only thing to get out is this certain project called ""Starfish."" The Suicide Squad is then sent to solve the problem lead by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) and followed by Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Peacemaker (John Cena), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchain), and many more. Also lead by from behind the scene by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis).I was pretty excited for this film. Right when it start, I had one of those this is really happening moments. I ever read many of the original Suicide Squad comics and watched the Dirty Dozen because James Gunn said it would be sort of like that. It ended feeling like both of those things. The Suicide Squad had the same feeling as The Dirty Dozen because you had no clue who was going to die and it had somewhat of a familiar setting, It felt like the comics because of how wacky some of the villains were. It also had Starro appear in the end which it is hard to not giggle a bit when he is trying to be menacing. This film just nailed the feel. Halfway through the movie, I was trying to figure out who would live and who would die but I really couldn't. I just came to the conclusion, maybe they all will. It is just a really unpredictable movie. The story also made you feel for many parts of the characters. They did have some randomly plugged backstories for some of the characters which one of them felt plugged but the rest felt natural and gave some much needed background to some characters. When it came to the end of the film, that really helped make the characters not feel as expendable as they have felt early on. James Gunn also used some of the characters from the first that were actually good characters. He also used that as background for some character too. Overall, the characters were fantastic.The action was some of the best I have seen in a superhero film in while. Marvel has just been making all of their action look like cartoon or some hand to hand combat that gets boring after a while. This film did all kinds of stuff, gun action, fist combat, and just had some fun scenes of just tearing through many villains. The action ended up feeling fun and stylized unlike some movie series like Fast And The Furious and Marvel films. Sometimes they used CGI blood which I have never been a fan off and sometimes it does end of looking pretty bad. The action is incredibly amazing though.The acting obviously had to be good so the characters would also feel attachable which they ended up feeling so that means the acting was also accomplished. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was obviously good as it has been in the last few movies. Some fo Jai Courtney and Joel Kinnaman. John Cena has started to become a way better actor since Playing With Fire. Idris Elba as Bloodsport was also a fantastic choice. He has honestly never been bad in a movie. Everybody else also did a pretty good job.The Suicide Squad is the movie I was looking. It was incredibly fun and also had some really fantastic characters even if one of their backstories felt plugged. I would recommend this film to anybody who has fun with action movies and wants to have a good time.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Super entertaining. I watched from start to finish on my own. Never really knew what was going to happen next. I love how bright and colourful the movie is...not trying to hide the effects and choreography in the dark.I never heard of this until it's release...did anyone else know about this movie?Any bad review doesn't know how to have a little fun every now and then. Sit back, relax and laugh at how crazy, wild and sometimes artistic the scenes can be (difficult to say because there is a lot of crude parts as well haha).I won't spoil anything.

There seems to be insufficient display of some members' powers, and the focus was a bit overladen on humor. What's wrong with that?

You don't even need to see the 2016 Suicide Squad to understand this one. This is less of a sequel and more of a do-over for me, and is what The Suicide Squad should be. This movie 100% EARNS its hard R rating. But if you're not a fan of dark comedy or gory movies, this is NOT the movie for you.It's full of twists and constantly surprised me. I never knew which characters were going to live or die.The movie is bloody and comical, and does a great job of taking all sorts of movie genres, like comedy, dark comedy, and action, and blending it all together successfully. All the jokes hit well for me, and all the characters are likeable and detailed. The movie shines a light on some villains I'm guessing would never get to see the light of day in normal DC movies. The movie gets me to care about every character. It's also well shot, well edited, and the acting is on point.Personally, I loved the positive light it shines on rats. As someone who owned 2 pet rats, the movie really tells how rats are not as awful as most people think.However, I think the pacing is a bit weird, with all the jumping back and forth on the timeline, and I feel like it constantly speeds up and slows down. The bad guys (not including Starro) seem a bit cliché.But all in all, the movie is comical and action filled, and doesn't take itself seriously, which is what makes it so fun. The movie is best when not taken seriously, and excels at being what a adapted comic book movie should be. I 100% recommend this movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If they can do sort of the opposite of what Marvel does, which is it specifically cater to a pg-13 audience and take less risks in the process, then they have a certain advantage over Marvel.It's not like I hate Marvel, I'm an MCU fan. But I admit they don't scratch that certain itch I have like how The Suicide Squad, Joker, and the upcoming Batman movie (hopefully) does.If DC continues this streak of more bold and unique films looking for a mature audience, that's a legitimate market, and Disney had a reason to be scared of that if DC pulls it off.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The humor was not executed well, the action was good, the main villain was cartoonish and the plot was unbelievably dumb. It seems like the script was written by a fifth grader who is the class clown of the school. Just bad! Idris Elba, Margot Robbie, and Daniela Melchior were the only good actors in the movie and it was only so much they can do with this ""cringe worthy"" script. The bond between Idris Elba's Bloodsport and Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 was the best part of the movie, and Margot Robbie was the only person that was funny. John Cena was just bad, he is a really poor actor, I'm not sure why he is getting so many roles, he should just stick to wrestling. Viola Davis who is usually a great actress was too over the top in this movie. I can see the effort made to make this movie fun, colorful, and outrageous, but it fails miserably. It appears a lot of people like this though, as for me, flush this one down the toilet, because it stinks.","14 out of 30 found this helpful.

It loves to invert tropes. Kills enemies uncerimoniously, heroes dont cut the red wire on time, last ditch efforts fail miserably, and heroics turn out to be blunders. The film is full of this, aaaalmost to the point where it's too much. Forgivable and still plenty enjoyable.2. the action was mostly ok, there are a few slipups of ""guy X is so OP that tension fails"" but otherwise it was ok, and, given the previous point of tropes failing fairly frequently, kept the action scenes interesting.3. high intensity direction and editing, but i didn't get a headache.4. absolutely excellent performances by John Cena (i *never* imagined i would say this), Idris Elba (weirdly, i again never imagined i would say this, given how he's a ""serious"" actor), and okaish performance by Margot Robbie, but at the same time a very interesting use of her character which isn't the same I AM SO HYPER thing they do everywhere else.5. pretty decent CGI
6. Loved the final boss
7. A story that makes sense told in a way that makes sense, with decent pacing
8. Holy **** i love polkadot manwhat wasn't so great
1. The music was hit and miss. Intrusive, and while some of it was good, some of it wasn't. Forgivable.2. runtime a bit too long
3. The ""real americans dont kill children"" bit was cringeyThere's a few real touches of genius here that i won't spoil, even knowing that they may go over your head, but regardless i'm sure that you will love this film. Maybe not as much as i have. Let's say, if you are unhappy with the blatant fanservice-way in which these marketing-department superheroes are being displayed in the last 20-odd years of superhero films, you will then appreciate more TSS because it secretly hates itself, and will let you konw at every opportunity.Oh i didn't like rat catcher girl one bit, but i can live with this one fault in an otherwise surprisingly great film.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

When they jumped times and places they actually told you in creative ways which is an issue with other movies. The fights were intense and very creative instead of doing the same stuff over and over again. I think it is safe to say Bloodsport was the main character of this film. As much as I like Harley I believe it was a good choice. Bloodsports character and his weapons were also imaginative and cool. All in all it's a good watch for adults (it definitely has the R rating for a reason.) There is also just enough humor sprinkled in to make it that much better.See DC you get what you pay for with writers and directors.

And Ms Robbie was more like a side note actor in the movie with small parts. For most of the movie I kept wondering where Harley Quinn was, and the script for her parts was extremely lacking in the humor we fell in love with in her 2016 movie which featured great dialog and a very funny Will Smith and Margot Robbie throughout the entire movie.

James Gunn, is a crazy writer and he's a crazy director and his latest The Suicide Squad, well, might be just as crazy as he is, filled to the brim with quick action and even quicker quips so quick that it might just be cathartic...and that's not a bad thing. Gunn changed Marvel with 2014s Guardians of the Galaxy when he turned a nonesense story into pure gold, and that same gold that envisioned him 7 years has been carefully sewn around this dynamite that blows up from a small fizzle, to a cascading chain reaction the kind that kind becomes the firework display around Big Ben every New Year. The Suicide Squad is silly, it's violent and is absolutely bonkers from start to finish, it's so good in fact that this may go down as the best DCEU film ever, but then that's not exactly difficult to do. Just like he did with Marvel, Gunn has done the same with DC, and we thank him for it.

S. government sending supervillains on suicide missions of ""national importance."" The movie is very funny, very dark, a bit gorier than I would have liked, and full of amazing action sequences. It's also got a little political commentary about U. S. intervention.The cast is terrific, most notably Margot Robbie, reprising her Harley Quinn role from an earlier ""Suicide Squad"" movie I never saw and the fabulous Birds of Prey. I really love her Harley, a psychopath with a heart of gold and killer reflexes who moves through the film like a chaos agent, fearless and improvident (if I ever watch the first, reputedly terrible Suicide Squad movie, it will be entirely due to Robbie).While the movie is crazy and hilarious, it also manages to put a little heart in, notably in the father/daughter vibe between Idris Elba and Daniela Melchior. Zach Snyder, who attempted and failed to create emotional resonance in Army of the Dead with a similar approach, should watch this movie over and over until he understands how to fit deep emotion and crazy action into a single film.This is a terrific movie, every bit as good as director James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy films, and you should definitely watch it.","3 out of 27 found this helpful.

With James Gunn on board and an R rating to boot though things were looking promising. After it was released to a very positive response I realised I had to go and do something I almost never do - watch a superhero (anti-superhero?) movie. And I'm glad I did. This movie is a lot of fun.I love that it doesn't take itself too seriously first of all. Similar to the other superhero series I enjoy 'Deadpool', when these films are more relaxed in their approach they become infinitely more enjoyable. 'Batman' is about the only one I can stomach being overly serious.The R rating gives this film so much more freedom. Some of the kills are absolutely brutal in this movie. Also the swearing, while not over-used, added that little bit of extra grit each time it was needed.The characters are so much fun in this movie. I was a little skeptical when I heard about a character whose power was to throw polka dots, but Gunn not only finds a way to make it work, but makes him brilliant and one of the best characters. Harley Quinn is the star though. This is the best use of her character yet. She is in her element and off the wall bonkers. Anything could happen when she's on screen and she is hilarious at the same time.Gunn is a director in full control of his project. He does things other directors wouldn't dare even consider, and he makes them work time after time. This film works on every level and I highly recommend checking it out. 9/10.","2 out of 15 found this helpful.

But they just don't fit together to make a good movie.A little bit of timeline trickery introduces you to various Suicide Squad members. It's fertile ground for jokes about how pathetic some DC superheroes are. And fertile ground for extreme bloody ""comic book"" violence.But you never get a chance to engage with the characters.Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is the focus of a lot of the visuals but she doesn't really fit in and is almost in a movie of her own. The rest of the squad are pretty one dimensional characters, relying on a couple of early ""joke"" scenes and their specific superhero skill to make them stand out (and for Idris Elba and John Cena, that skill is shooting lots and lots and lots of people in the face).And although there is a clear storyline, you never get the chance to engage with it - so much of it is skipped through quickly to get to the next set piece that you stop caring. As an example, Peter Capaldi plays the main ""villain"" but only has about 3 scenes.It's definitely going for the ""Deadpool"" mood. But it is no where near as good.Having said that, some of the jokes are funny and some of the visual set pieces are impressive, so it just about sustains interest until the end.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I went in with mediocre expectations and they were surpassed. This is a silly, fun, comic book movie but it also has a lot of heart. Family and found family is a strong theme throughout, as is the power and value of the downtrodden, the marginalized, and the underdog. It also has a surprisingly strong anti-imperialist bent to it, and while James Gunn isn't afraid to offend or push boundaries, he also delivers a cohesive message that makes it clear who the real ""supervillains"" are. For a movie with such a grim title and prequel, it is uplifting and has a satisfying ending.That being said, there is a LOT of gore. Like, gratuitous, cross-section-of-a-person's-head-getting-sliced off-like-a-coconut-in-the-first-ten-minutes gore. Be ready for blood and guts exploding all over the screen. For the most part, it works with the tone of the movie, but I did find that some of the deaths felt wasted-that is, they added neither emotion nor humor. One star off for death and gore that felt shoehorned in for the sake of it, but overall, a fun and vibrant romp with some genuinely funny moments!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

You wanted fun? This right here is fun. Crazy, violent, goofy fun. The ensemble cast is what makes this film. From small roles to large, and with varying degrees of comedic timing, they all bring something unique to the table. What's more is Gunn's wonderful sensibility to not take things too seriously throughout the film. Gunn is perhaps the best superhero genre director that's ever come along. Why? Because he gets the genre like nobody else. Comic books, by their very definition, don't exist in the real world. They are serialized, pulpy cartoons. Leave your brain at the door, and enjoy. When a scene calls for violence, Gunn goes for bloody broke. When a scene needs a laugh, he embraces the goof and takes the joke as far as he can. Unlike most comic book movies, most of which go through the exact same predictable motions, the Gunn films feel wild and free. Let's be honest, it's how all comic book movies should be. If all superhero movies were like The Suicide Squad, perhaps the Scorseses of the world would be less quick to dismiss and criticize. Or maybe they still would, but if that's the case, to heck with them.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Why would you want to watch a movie that is just a mix of cliches and overused Easter eggs?Never again!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

James gunn has a knack to take unknown characters and give them some humanity. The characters are funny, has their own moments and are essential to the story. King shark is the new groot. Loveable pyscho killer. (Recall how groot speared and kill all those ppl then smiled). Movie was entertaining throughout, ending was okay, casualty was high, effects were gruesomely hilarious at times. All in all it actually left me hoping there will be a sequel. #Ratcatcher2FTW.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

If anyone tells me they liked this movie, it is a clear sign that they are positive for Covid as they have lost all sense of taste. The script and direction of the movie is childish, immature, vapid, and completely lacking any intellect. For the most part the characters are dull, boring, and simply meatheads. Many of the scenes are predictable. The music doesn't make sense for the scenes they are in and are completely out of place. A couple funny lines do exist, but those are few and far between. Mostly the dialogue and banter is witless and humorless. I've liked DC movies as much as Marvel movies, so I don't write this to simply bash on a DC movie. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Let's stop with the Suicide Squad movies and never have James Gunn direct another DC movie. Zach Snyder's Justice League had great character development, a real story, and set up the DC universe for many potential sequels. It would be good to have a sequel for Justice league where they take on DarkSeid. I'm mentioning Justice League as those movies could incorporate the Harley Quinn character and the Bloodsport character from this Suicide Squad movie. I'm trying to understand why people are praising this movie. This movie is just mindless and offers nothing of substance. Do yourselves a favor and skip this movie.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie could've easily been another disaster but James Gunn brought so much to this movie. He made sure that this movie never felt long or boring. There is so much creativity in this movie that you can easily forget at times that this is a DC superhero movie. Aside from the directing being much better than the first movie is the acting in this movie. Everybody in this movie just connected really well with each other and felt like an actual team. The standouts for me were easily Daniela Melchior, who plays Ratcatcher 2, and David Dastmalchian, who plays Polka-Dot Man. Everybody in this movie brought their all with their respected roles but those two easily stood out for me especially Daniela Melchoir who people could easily relate to and feel for. I'm definitely going to shot out Jaws and Crisp Ratt who played Sebastian that sure they might've gotten CGI'd in postproduction still were amazing. Also, I know John Cena is supposed to be in this movie but I didn't see him. On the topic of CGI, I have to admit that the visual effects for this movie were honestly really good in this movie. I'm not saying I was expecting it to be bad but it honestly surprised me. I also got to say the cinematography in this movie was really beautiful. I also want to say the music in this movie was really well done and unlike with the 2016 movie fit with the scenes appropriately. The Suicide Squad movie is easily better than the 2016 version by a landslide and continues to prove how great of a director and writer James Gunn is.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm glad James Gunn wrote an almost excellent script here and The Suicide Squad is close to the best episode of The Boys.First, the first 90 minutes are amazing, full of twists and great Fx's, and gore. I really enjoyed the humor. On the other hand, last 30 minutes were extremely predictable including the ending.Second, characters and cast were amazing. I really enjoyed The Shark, Idris&Cena, but all of them were great actors. If I have to say something bad, some Harley scenes were ridiculous and predictable. Overacted.Last, the movie itself looks dark to me, even I watched the 4k version. On a few scenes I barely know what was happening.To sum up, The Suicide Squad is an amazing movie, goofy, unpredictable at times, and far better than it's precursor.

So, I truly enjoyed Iron Man, Captain America and the other Marvel Characters being brought to life so well with amazing special effects that truly brought Marvel to life.But I never got that thrill from DC comics (which I read as much as Marvel as a kid). There is an inherent problem with Superman, which is the basis of Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen. An immortal all powerful being would have a universe to play in...would Earth and it's petty humanity really be worth his time in the long run? And when you put that character into the hands of people who don't understand the comic world, but are just movie makers doing it for a buck... you get Superman's creation story and Lex Luthor over and over. You get the Joker and the Penguin over and over. There is no vision and no love for the characters, they simply pick the surface. This is what makes Man of Steel standout...a spin...He is an alien trying to fit in unnoticed. Snyder got the character. In the same way, Nolan went to Ra's al Ghul and Bane....realizing that following up the Joker with the Riddler and Penguin was just treading in shallow water.All of which brings me to 2016's Suicide Squad. Let's get Margot Robbie (the Hollywood It girl of that moment) and pair her with (everyone likes) Will Smith. But then...they made a movie with a story, graphics and monsters that seemed to come from Resident Evil. The entire effort seemed to be made by people who just didn't care. Marvel got GOTG to fly...time for us to go a little weird. But when Suicide Squad walked down a set street and shot up the goo-monsters I thought I was watching a movie made in 1985.Seeing they plucked Gunn to do a mulligan and that shanked tee shot...I was hesitant. Suicide Squad has a problem. The audience doesn't know or care about who these people(?) are. The concept is the Dirty Dozen. You're rotten bastards and we will give you a chance at redemption, only we are really sending you to die. Ha Ha.In GOTG, Gunn's first movie overcomes that problem...he introduces us to the characters and the entire purpose of the movie is to show us the shared events that turned them from strangers into a family that we rooted for. That remains the biggest flaw of this new movie. Although we've seen an origin story of Harley Quinn in previous DC movies, that can't be said about everyone else. It is somewhat compounded by the film's beginning misdirect...which assumes it is funny or clever to whack a load of crazed Squaders that we don't care about before revealing the true story line. It eats some time, has a few chuckles, but ultimately it has nothing to do with what is going on.So now, I'm finally with Dead Shot and a couple of others that I don't care about. The biggest drag down now becomes John Cena, who simply can not act. It is not easy to make one consider how well Dwayne Johnson and Dave Bautista actually deliver their lines, but Cena does it.So, I'm now 45 minutes into this movie, and the enemy is a bunch of stereotyped 3rd world Hispanic Oppressors guarding a Tower that is the target, and Harley Quinn is their prisoner. I'm sitting here not impressed, and not all that engaged. Gunn is obviously a step-up in special effects and cinematography but I don't know who this girl with the rats is, or care about the polka dot guy. Everything seems jokey and overly attempting to be clever. Idris Alba does the best he can, but I don't see anything special.But...then the 3rd act begins. Harley Quinn escapes captivity in a bloody, stylish choreographed escape that seems to be out of a page of Gunn's GOTG. And, from that point on, every thing I was waiting for happens. This movie morphs into one stunning visionary visual experience after another. The comedy starts landing, the characters become compelling, the action builds and builds, and the whole thing becomes a crazy beautiful explosion of colorful movie magic.When it was all over I shook my head and said...'That was awesome'. I enjoyed it, it delivered. I hope Gunn comes back to this one and makes a sequel.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

An anarchic, irreverent anti superhero movie that is, at times, too weird for its own good but is still a lot of fun and that couldn't take itself too seriously even if it wanted to...and it doesn't want to!Margot Robbie steals the show (well duh..) as the magnificent Harley Quinn and the sequence in which she breaks out of her incarceration and dispatches innumerable guards with ease and panache leaves you wondering why Birds Of Prey was such a mess.Best of the rest are Idris Elba as Bloodsport and a genuinely funny John Cena as The Peacemaker. It's violent - make that VIOLENT! - gratuitously so in places and I wasn't overwhelmed by Starro the extraterrestrial star fish (don't worry, it kinda makes sense when you see the movie). Like I said, sometimes it almost manages to out- weird itself. Thankfully, it just about holds itself together until the end. I enjoyed the experience of watching this glorious semi-mess of a movie and I think you might, too. Even if you don't, I promise that you won't forget it for a while...","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

James Gunn has fully drawn from this given freedom and completely turned the Suicide Squad franchise on its head. After the utterly failed predecessor, The Suicide Squad is a true comic book spectacle that comes with facets we've never seen before in a superhero movie. We are taken on this wild ride by twelve criminals who are supposed to save the world.Only three characters from the first film made it into the sequel. First and foremost is Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie. Known as one of the few bright spots of the first part, she plays a very big role here and probably gets the most screentime as an individual character. Because of Robbie's charisma and the irresistible craziness of Harley Quinn, it's mostly entertaining, though her story doesn't really work, especially in the middle of the film. For that, it seems too forced to give Harley her own storyline by any means. That this endeavor fails is due to the fact that the rest of the cast harmonizes fantastically among themselves. John Cena is tailor-made for the role of the Peacemaker, although I would have liked to see more action and character study from him. Others get enough of that. For example Idris Elba as the grumpy Bloodsport, who gains a lot of interest through Elba's usual coolness and intensity. His constant quarrel with the Peacemaker also provides a laugh or two, as well as probably the most exciting relationship in the film. The characters that leave the film as absolute audience favorites, however, are others. For one, the King Shark, who always seems a bit out of place throughout the film and is only directly involved in the action, but simply brings out hilarious and even unexpectedly sentimental moments. Furthermore, there is Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher, even if it has to be said with her that it is rather the sugar-sweet rats that inspire here and less the background story pushed in. Viola Davis is as always unsympathetically brilliant as the slightly evil string-puller behind the mission, Amanda Waller.It's guaranteed to say that you'll have great fun with The Suicide Squad. At least if you don't pay attention to logic holes or other realism stuff. Movies of this genre aren't suitable for that anyway, and this one certainly isn't. Because actually James Gunn has created a work that is all over the place for over two hours. Constant changes of location, infiltration of arbitrary stories and a main plot that completely breaks the simplicity of this film and can not be understood at all. The FSK16 of the film is almost a farce because of the numerous bloodthirsty scenes. The script does have its weaknesses, which is especially evident in the dialogues with completely unnecessary lines. Some side stories are simply not appealing. May not sound too positive now, but somehow this arbitrariness has its own charm. AND: Gunn clearly had fun with the production of The Suicide Squad. And so did I. And that's the main thing.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

James Gunn is written all over each scene throughout the film as he engages you with non stop violence and gore. Not to mention the heart felt scenes, Gunn is able to rip your heart out and crush it as he attaches you so well to the characters he's developed. I was on my edge of my seat the entire time as shivers ran down my spine viewing the gut wrenching horror of these deaths. I didn't know who would die next. BloodSport, Harley, Pokadot man and Ratcatcher II are absolute standouts in the film as they have such emotional and gravitational quirks. Each are different in their own stylistic ways. I was pleasantly surprised with John Cenas peace Maker. He is genuinely an underrated actor and I found he shines well in this film. As one of the most in your face films I've ever seen, this is possibly in my top five favourite films of all time. Even the soundtrack is impeccable, I can't wait to see it again. This is James Gunns best film. (In contention with the Dark Knight)","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

As far as superhero movies go this IS it.James Gunn was tossed aside by Disney and WB snatched him up in a blink. Geniuses and opportunistic and I applaud them for it. This is right up his alley. His style, the comic material are a match made in heaven.I laughed. I laughed. I actually wiped tears from my eyes. Then I laughed more. There isn't a minute... a single minute of this movie I was NOT ENTERTAINED. That's what a comic movie is supposed to be right? Suspend reality. Commit to nothing. Let your baser instincts roam free for a moment. In this, The Suicide Squad EXCELS.I love the soundtrack, the style, the colors, the one liners, the absurdity of this movie that knows its being beyond absurd. The short lifespan of 90% of all characters. It's perfect. This actually tops Deadpool 1/2 by a mile. It is also twenty leagues ahead of anything DC has done so far.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Disappointing. Margot Robbie saves Harley Quinn.in both the prior movies. But this one...DC realized why Deadpool and Joker did so well. Because the comic book kids are all grown up now and we don't want some cheesy Disney mush! This was fantastic. The cameos are epic wish they had more screen time (especially Nathan Fillion). Right off this is how a DC movie should be. Only reason a 9 instead of a 10 is they tried too hard to be quirky sometimes. Overall.. GREAT JOB DC!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was funny in his film & it was funny now. Things I enjoyed were the characters which had a little more depth this go round as far as their back story,the action,the gore all were on point,my favorite characters of the film hands down was KING SHARK & BLOODPSORT,story plot was pretty easy had some thing's that didn't click for me,but overall the film was put together much better & a good number of Easter eggs especially John Ostrander,some scenes pulled straight out the comics which surprise me,this film is most definitely rank up there as far as top DC films for me,with W.

A very brief post-credits to wait for. Yes the directing format certainly feels very different yet bridged to the first movie. And imo, I hope the next will be different feel again with someone else directing (that way each movie has a unique freshness based on the chosen squad team).","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Gunn makes it his own right off the bat, separating his movie from the previous suicide squad by introducing new characters, fast deaths, and fun chaos all within the first 20 minutes. Main characters get established later in time, some new, some old. The previous members are separated and used well during their screen time. New members get enough back story and are fleshed out well enough for you to care about. It's R rated fun and brings heart into the story when appropriate. Plus there's no real connection to the poorly established DCEU so you can go in not caring. It's a solid 8 and I hope it's the highest viewed DC movie and breaks HBO max so Warner can stop releasing garbage and embarrassing great source material/characters that are literally handed to them. 🤙","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I gave this movie a 10/10, not because it deserves a solid 10, but because of all the airhead reviews giving this a 1/10 and exclaiming that the original movie was superior.What I think it deserves? A solid 7.5. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this film. The plot was decent and the characters worked fairly synergistically with each other. I enjoyed the competitive dynamic between Edris and Cena. They really carried the film during the middle and end. Harley's character was charming as ever, but I felt it was all a little forced and out of character during the whole -intimate- scene.The climax from the assault on Jotunheim to the very end was easily the best and most memorable part of the production. Every character really shone through at this moment, especially Milton. Loved that guy.Honestly though, it wasn't a bad film and if you're interested in DC comics - I think it deserves your attention. That being said, if you're not interested in DC comics (or if you are and happen to be a crybaby starfish) recognize that this is a movie about murderous rampaging villains, that are given a second chance at life by doing what they do best: murderous rampage. I see a lot of negative comments/reviews out there about excessive gore and violence.""Oh, mY GaWd! IT wAs ToO bLoOdY. WhEn tHaT MAN EATING hUmaNoID ShArK MoNstEr bIt tHaT MaN's HeAd off!

And I went into it, expecting it to be a good movie.Sure, maybe WB screwed the pooch on that one, and the director really did have a cohesive vision with the original... but that's not what I watched. What I watched was an unapologetically awful turd of a film. Nothing about it felt like I was watching a movie about comic book villains.. characters that go toe-to-toe with some of the DC worlds strongest heroes. Honestly, there was more militant rambo combat action in the original than there was anything to do with the actual villains and their abilities... and the pacing.. god the pacing and editing was soo bad. Scenes jump from one pivotal moment to the next with NO buildup or understanding of how you got there.If you know literally anything about cinematography, writing and film then you understand how much of a shit show the original Suicide Squad was
The Suicide Squad however? Two bloody thumbs way, way up!.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The new government is antagonistic towards the US, threatening to reveal a top secret US project on the island. Another Suicide Squad is assembled, this time to infiltrate the island and destroy the project.To my surprise, I enjoyed the original Suicide Squad (2016) (and by the reviews I believe I was the only person in the world to feel that way about it!). I generally dislike superhero / comic book movies and that's probably why I enjoyed it. It was hardly a superhero movie - it had very little of all that superpower mumbo jumbo and nonsense - and, while still having some great action scenes, was quite funny and never really took itself too seriously. It was essentially a comedy-action film rather than a superhero / comic book film.Birds of Prey (2020), the sequel focusing on Harley Quinn, carried on largely in the same vein though wasn't quite as entertaining.After these I was expecting The Suicide Squad to be something similar: funny and avoiding the superhero bs, or at least playing it down. It tries to be funny but, unfortunately, insists on being superhero-heavy, to its detriment. We have lame nonsense like a half man-half shark, some dude who throws polka dots around, one villain who belongs in Hellraiser, another that belongs in an aquarium.There are some funny moments though with some great one-liners and generally sharp dialogue. It can be quite fun at times though this is often immediately followed by something that's just plain stupid and makes you think of watching something else instead. It's a roller-coaster ride in that respect.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is 100% a James Gunn film no doubt about it, and we won't have to worry about hearing anything about the film being taken away from him. This has his signature all over it from the humor, look and violence. I've never been afraid to admit that I'm a fan of the first film but this is better in every single way. I loved the mission/military film vibe of the film. The team lives up to their name this time around as many characters die and in gruesome ways. That was an issue I had with the first film, that despite the title I don't feel many died. Gunn being a better writer than David Ayer also helped with character development, as he actually made me care for majority of the cast, I felt a connection to also all. This is definitely a reboot, as besides Rick and Harley knowing each other, there's not much mention of the first. The soundtrack was fantastic and rivals the music in the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy""..
.Many people were skeptical to the R rating, and let me just say it's warranted. The freedom Gunn got with dialogue and the dialogue and rating was fantastic. Seeing King Shark rip people to shreds just makes me wish we would get a Rated R ""Venom"" film. Margot once again delivers as Harley, and I feel this her best performance in the character. She gets some great highlight moments. Idris Elba has finally gotten a comic book character that is worthy of his talents. He was fantastic as Bloodsport, and better than Will Smith, so I'm glad he replaced him. He has a great competitive rivalry with John Cena's Peacemaker than provided the film with some of its funniest scenes. Speaking about Cena, I love him in these type of roles. He is perfect in them as he has great comedic timing and plays a dick really well. I'm really excited for his HBO MAX series. I'm surprised by how fleshed out and how much I loved David Dastmalchian's Polka Dot Man and Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2. I didn't expect much from them and thought they would be corny but they ended up being my two favorite characters..
.Starro lives up to the hype. Coming from his Troma background, James Gunn was the perfect Director to bring him to the big screen. I'm also amazed at how great he looked, as the CGI on the character was flawless. The one issue I had with the film is that the secondary military villain, who was almost essentially the main villain for the first two acts sucked. He was a generic mission/war film villain. Overall, one of the best films of the year, don't see it on HBO Max, try seeing it in Dolby or IMAX as it deserves the big screen treatment.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It has over the top cartoonish gore, fun humour and lots of exciting action sequences which all together make this a great superhero film.This film is so close to having its finger tips on a 9 or a 10 but just falls at the finish line. The only issues I have with this film is some characters which die very quick and the flashbacks (which is understandable to happen when you let James Gun off his leash). Some of the hero's who are axed quick are played by some great names and given the opportunity would add to this already exceptional film. So it is a shame we dont get to see them explored and maybe what they could of offered. With the flashbacks it just seems odd and kills the pace of the film at times, and makes you think if this film was in order it would make no difference.However those two points are small in the grand scheme of things should not take away from the entertaining film; and by god is it an improvement over the first by a mile! I would happily recommend this film to any of my friends, and everyone I went with came out of this spectacle with similar feelings.P.

But that's not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being."" Though Scorsese's comments were levelled at Marvel, I think it is fair to assume his opinion would be the same of the DC films. If his opinion is not the same however, then somebody should show him ""The Suicide Squad.""Let me begin the body of this review with the best thing there is to say about the film: it is quite a lot of fun.When watching ""The Suicide Squad,"" one is treated to a film that is ripe with energy, full of creative visuals, unique combat and a playfulness that is difficult to avoid being charmed by. All in all, it is a well-helmed movie made my people who clearly knew what they were trying to do: entertain.The trouble with ""The Suicide Squad,"" however, happens to be the reverse side of the exact same coin: it is never much more than something good to look at.For 2 hours and 11 minutes (which is about 40 minutes longer then the film has any right to be,) ""The Suicide Squad,"" manages to offer up its myriad of gore, visual gags and quirks without ever offering up anything substantive. It is not only that it mistakes gratuity for originality (though it certainly does this often,) but it is that it fails to do what it should be best: provide compelling action.It is perhaps hackneyed to say that superhero films suffer from an inability to heighten the stakes in action sequences. Superman, for example, is so powerful that every combat in a Superman film is more or less predictable until there is kryptonite involved. Part of the promise with ""The Suicide Squad,"" however is that these are not supposed to be all-powerful heroes: these are oddball, underdog criminals whose express use is how disposable they are. Why then, does this film spend two hours and eleven minutes never providing an actual challenge to these characters? Why is there rarely a problem that cannot be solved with the flick of a wrist? How come every opportunity to raise the stakes as they relate to the actual goals of the protagonists in the film always sacrificed for the means of shoving in a cool-looking scene?I do not want to discount the fun that this movie has to offer. As I mentioned earlier, it really does have a palpable energy. Trouble is, by the end of the film, that energy is stretched thin to the point of fraying as the audience realizes that the film has nothing more to offer - it is a one-trick pony, with little to propound
but spectacle.The truth is, I don't think that there is anything wrong with theme parks. They can be a lot of fun. That said, two hours and eleven minutes is a long time to stay on the same ride.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The script, humor, the cast ensemble, music score, action, and James Gunns direction. This film does have more of a story and build up with characters unlike the first film.The plot is great. It has the suicide squad lead by Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman) and his team going on a dictator controlled island. Where they come across a secret lab which they will have to face against Starro the Conqueror.The film does have a huge cast ensemble. Some are there for brief cameo moments. James Gunn does build a huge list of characters which you should not get too attached when he kills characters off. Even some are unexpectedly.The film does have a lot of action sequences. It is better with the r rating which made it bloody and gory. The opening scene with the squad invading the beach and being attacked was brutal. Plus the new group of characters like Bloodshot (Idris Elba), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchoir), Peacemaker (John Cena) and Polka dot man (David Dastmalchian). These characters were surprisingly a fun addition. The original cast from the previous film was also great with Rick Flagg, Harley Quinn, and Captain Boomerang.Every character had a moment to shine. Idris Elba stole the spotlight as Bloodshot. Along with Margot Robbie and John Cena.The film is violent. Gory and a lot of fun. James Gunns script and direction was exciting and fun. The script had a lot of fun stupid humor. And action packed sequences. The visual effects were great. The music score by John Murphy is great. Added a new tone and theme.Overall, The Suicide Squad is one of the best Dc films and James Gunn delivered and unexpectedly made a better than expected film. It does feel like a Rambo war film with the squad facing against a rebellious Dictators army and fighting there way to a secret lab to come across something more sinister.There is a post credit scene at the very end that will hint towards whats next to come.","2 out of 27 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Suicide Squad, an engaging, gleefully over the top, completely bonkers action adventure that mostly hits the target.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7214183/?ref_=tt_urv","Abdulxoxo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur106279729/?ref_=tt_urv","10 August 2021","The film follows the Suicide Squad as they try to uncover a sinister experiment that has been brewing for the past many years in a South American island-nation. Together this bizarre mix of criminals must find a way to co-exist in order to save the world.The Suicide Squad does something astonishing from a film in this genre. This movie jumps straight into the action with no real need for a bloated explanation, as the 2016's suicide squad did most of the heavy lifting when it comes to establishing the set-up of bringing a group of villains. It has absolutely no problem killing off a large portion of its characters throughout the entire film in creatively gruesome and often unpredictable ways. The action scenes are fantastic. Not only is every action sequence splattered with chunky entrails, but the movie does a great job with presenting it with plenty of artistic shots (including one fight scene that you watch on the reflection of a helmet) as well as editing that often plays around with time in unique ways. The opening sequence kicks things off with an unexpected bang. Throughout the film you could tell a lot of time and money went into choreographing the action and utilising the visual effects really well. The level of violence is brilliant. If you enjoy blood and gore, you'll have a good time with 'The Suicide Squad'. The score/soundtrack, the costumes, the hair & makeup, as well as the production design also deserve a lot of praise.What makes this all the more entertaining is that we care about these characters. One of the major criticisms of the 2016 film was how little we were made to care for (or even remember) the supporting members. This time Gunn introduces us to our squad gradually, developing them throughout the movie, building up an emotional attachment to them by the final act. The cast also do a tremendous job in making these 'villains' likable protagonists. The charming insanity and sheer beauty of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, the charismatic machismo and amusing seriousness of John Cena's Peacemaker, the endearing attitude and sheer commitment of Idris Elba's Bloodsport, the expected badassery and oddly adorableness of Sylvester Stallone's King Shark, the always great and unhinged ferocity of Viola Davis's Amanda Waller, the delightful appeal and weirdly heartfelt core of Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2. There's plenty of actors with each having just as much fun with their roles as the audience is with the movie itself.If I were to criticise anything I would have to say There are a few scenes that are a bit unnecessary and end of slowing down the pace in the middle act. Some of the character motivations don't always make sense or are a little inconsistent. Also, not every joke lands though that's expected with almost any comedy. But it doesn't change the fact that The Suicide Squad is an exponential improvement over the first that's an outrageously violent, frequently hysterical, impressively stylish, and unapologetically bonkers comic book feature that stands as one of DC's very best films.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

The action, humour and general spectacle never stop with so many great characters and delightfully choreographed action set pieces. Alba is great in the lead with fine support from the rest of the cast but with special mention for Margot Robbie who shines as Harlequin for a third time and Peter Capaldi as The Thinker who knows what's in the tower and the secrets of why Davis wants everything destroyed. It is wildly OTT and gets even more so towards its spectacular climax, but if you can live with the bizarre ideas here, it's great fun.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

The main issue I had with the film is the tone at times. I get it's supposed to be a comedy, but at times it just felt a bit awkward when involving certain events that happened that I can't get into detail here. Besides that though- the film is very well done. It has a very bizarre sense of storytelling which is as entertaining as it is original- and Gunn's script allows for the characters to be fleshed out far more naturally than the last Suicide Squad film and with far more heart. The soundtrack is incredible as always, and the cinematography is absolutely stunning as well as the comic-accurate costumes throughout. It may be expected, but the CGI and VFX throughout the film are absolutely mesmerizing- and honestly some of the most realistic and fun usage of them on film in quite a long time. It's pretty clear when watching the film that this is Gunn's vision, and it's so exciting to be a part of. On the other side of things though, we have several great performances through our lead actors that are honestly some of the best the DCEU has had to offer. Idris Elba is great as Bloodsport, as well as John Cena as Peacemaker; as well as one of my personal favorites, David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man. Of course we also have the finamous Sylvester Stalone providing a hilarious voice performance as King Shark, but what stands out most among the performers is none other than actess Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn who just steals every scene she is a part of and accounts for some of the most elabroate shts in the film. In the end, The Suicide Squad is tonally flawed at times, but it is quite a blast, and I wouldn't mind catching it again sometime.My Rating: 8.4/10.","1 out of 14 found this helpful.

Their mission; eliminate the threat (& any evidence of the US's involvement) before the new military regime can act. Along the way, the carpet is constantly pulled out from under us as certain members of the squad are killed before the mission begins & others who on the surface are deemed to be too fringe (Dastmalchian's Polka Dot Man & Daniela Melchoir's Ratchcatcher II) step up to the plate & actually win over our hearts. W/a constant grin & a consistent stream of belted guffaws, I was entertained from frame one (the Warner Bros. Logo spelled out in blood across the ocean!). Let's hope the series will continue (Cena's Peacemaker will make an appearance in some future project) as future filmmakers will take Gunn's approach; take your cheese seriously...maybe.

The Suicide Squad is a 2021 James Gunn soft reboot of the original 2016 DCEU film Suicide Squad, while still working as a sequel to it. The 2016 film is garbage. It very comfortably competes for the title of the worst DCEU film. And it has some competition there.But when you put the man behind The Guardians of the Galaxy on the job. The man who went and though that sure, general masses and mainstream viewing audiences will like this talking raccoon and his tree friend in this ultra sleek science fiction superhero film. Sure, that will sell. And when you give that man an A grade budget and the complete freedom to do whatever he likes.Well then you get gold like this.I am absolutely positive The Suicide Squad was not shown to any kind of test audience. It was not written by a committee. The studio did not meddle with it. Why do I know this? Because it's absolutely bat guano unhinged. And it's so gleeful about it. There's violence aplenty, there's tasteless jokes, there's stuff you've only seen in your nightmares.And I love it for that! This is James Gunn simply having fun. Throwing stuff together that would normally make absolutely no sense whatsoever, but which he makes work through sheer bravado. It works because Gunn wills it to work. And somehow it does.I'm in some ways at a loss of words when it comes to this film. I never thought I would see something like this. Or at least with this kind of a budget. And it rose from the steaming ruins of Suicide Squad, of all things.Sometimes it's a wonderful time to be alive.","1 out of 15 found this helpful.

The movie has a lot of gore so if you can't handle blood then this is not the movie for you. The movie is really funny and it gives some lesser known villains some actual story and flushed out backstory that the comics couldn't have done. Unlike the first one this movie actually is able to give all their characters flushed out story's and character development. The movie has a engaging story and has some of the most brutal action scenes!Idris Elba takes on the role of Bloodsport. His character is basically Will Smiths replacement for this movie. Margot Robbie as always does a fantastic job playing Harley Quinn. John Cena plays the big dumb guy in this movie and is one of the funniest characters in the movie. Joel Kinnaman returns as Rick Flag from the first one and is actually more likeable and has maybe one of the best scenes in the movie. Daniela Melchior plays Ratcatcher and is one of the best characters as she has a pet Rat and has some of the most emotional scenes in the movie. David Dastmalchian plays Polka-Dot man and if your asking all he does is shoot polka-dots at people he was one of the best characters in the movie.And Sylvester Stallone voices King Shark and has to be the most lovable characters in the movie.Overall Dc has made a good movie and I hope they can give us some more good ones like this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Overall, a very fun watch that makes me have confidence in the direction DC is going with their movies as this film has creative story telling, great characters, and great action sequences, even though it was very formulaic and a very similar/close-copy to Guardians of the Galaxy (which makes sense given its from James Gunn).Very Good Direction, Very Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Margot Robbie, Very Good to Great from Idris Elba, Very Good from Joel Kinnaman, Very Good to Great from Sylvester Stallone (Voice Acting, a little biased though), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good to Good Story (though a bit formulaic by combining pieces from the original movie and Guardians of the Galaxy; also, while I liked that there were misdirections/twists, I felt there were a bit too many by the end), Very Good to Great Screenplay (Very Tarantino-Esque as it is serious but is filled with great comedic dialogue to break tension; really liked how they used CGI/effects as a part of the storytelling), Decent Score/Good Soundtrack (Though the mix with old and new songs kinda clashed at times for me), Good Cinematography, Incredible Editing, Incredible Visual Effects (really liked how they used CGI as a part of the storytelling; liked the visual gore style cause it showed a blend of both cartoony yet realistic), Great Production Design, Pacing was good to very good (a bit quick at the end but nothing terrible), Build to the climax was very good with the overall climax being very well executed (bit long though); runtime was ok but 10-15 minutes of the movie could have been cut (especially at the end), the major flaws of the movie were that it was extremely formulaic as the storytelling was basically a carbon-copy of Guardians of the Galaxy (with it having a comedic relief character non-human who speaks few words and a ex-pro wrestler being the tough guy) with the story of the original Suicide Squad and the gore of Invincible.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"1","/10","worst move I have ever seen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7205182/?ref_=tt_urv","moviereviewsimdb","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur135345963/?ref_=tt_urv","7 August 2021","I spent over an hour trying to think of a worse movie that I have seen and could not come up with one. That's shocking.This movie seems targeted towards young thoughtless minds. The jokes are low quality junior high (12-15 year olds) humor. At times you are sitting through a scene that can last a minute or even seven or eight minutes only for it to end on a joke that doesn't pay off. It's sacrificing story, character development, and entertainment for a build up to a ""joke"" that's not even funny. It leaves you confused and feeling like your time is being disrespected. The humor (or attempt at humor I should say) and gore definitely shows Gunn has not grown up from the tweets that landed him in hot water a few years ago. He's still exactly who he was then. Only now more celebrated for some reason. I'm also confused on how the first SS movie was criticized for killing off characters rather abruptly after introducing them but is praised for doing so in this movie. The movie relies so heavily on the R rating for ""shock"" value (including male nudity) that it wears itself out. It can only be shocking once or twice. After that is just becomes boring. It's just endless gory death after gory death. Whenever I see movies or franchises go this direction it tells me they are out of ideas and cannot make a smart thoughtful movie. It becomes dumbing everything that to try to appeal to the mindless that think a collection of vulgar jokes and violent deaths make a good edgy movie. I did find some decent acting from Melchior (Ratcatcher 2) and Dastmalchian (Polka-Dot Man) but just not enough to keep your interest. Elba does a good job and makes me want to see him in a real comedic role. Cena isn't funny and comes off as a robot (that might be the intent.) Robbie's Quinn is just as good as ever but gets lost in the movie.I know I must not be the target audience for this movie but if you're putting out a comic book movie in 2021 you're casting a giant net for an audience. DC might be giving up on trying to make their DC universe and going all in on vulgar jokes and gore. If this is the direction then they can forget merchandising or being anything other than a niche market at the box office.On a final note. This is my first review. This movie was so bad and disappointing that it made me want to sign up just to leave it a bad review. WORST MOVIE I have EVER seen.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was unpredictable and certainly delivered on the endeavour to raise the stakes of the genre, shamelessly killing off a plethora of characters in true James Gunn fashion. The film expertly switches between various tones to create a truly cohesive and full story, juggling heartfelt character moments and thrilling action, graphic violence and intelligent humour with ease and tact, overall producing a special experience for DC fans old and new and truly setting itself apart from the vast roster of copy and paste superhero movies. The cast of the film is vast in number with every member as talented and enjoyable to watch as the last. Notable standouts for me were Peter Capaldi as the joyously evil mastermind, ""The Thinker"" and of course, Sylvester Stallone as the voice of the simple, lovable, yet feral beast, ""King Shark."" As well as this, the returning cast from the 2016 Suicide Squad felt new and invigorated with Gunn's writing style, yet still retained some connective tissue to past films. This allowed the film to build upon pre-existing lore, enriching the wider DCEU as a whole, whilst simultaneously providing a purely unique and self contained story for the audience to become completely immersed in, without worry of how things tie into other projects. One final thing i feel i must comment on is the design of the film. From each character's attire seemingly ripped directly from the pages of DC comics, to the unapologetically colourful and outlandish ""Starro the Conqueror,"" The Suicide Squad felt like a love letter to DC nerds everywhere, willing to engulf its main cast in the wacky regalia of their comic counterparts, where many other films of the genre would typically shy away in favour of tactical jumpsuits and modernised armour. As a big DC fan myself, i found a lot to enjoy in this film and hope to see more comic adapted properties daring to be as bold as this one. In simpler terms, I loved every second of The Suicide Squad and can't wait to see it again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a fun and enjoyable movie, but had it been presented in the context of The Tick (i.e., a meaningful and properly artistic parody) it would have easily been worth rating 10 stars. This is the problem with DC as a whole. DC may have set the stage for all future comics, but it is also the reason why, even today, so many people cannot take comics seriously. No matter how hard they try, no matter how many talented people are on board, DC is just genuinely poor quality at its heart. Because any attempt to truly correct this would mean deviating from the source material in a way that would outrage true fans, and rightly so, yet any and all attempts to present the source material in a modern friendly way, as the MCU has, well, looks like this movie, it is sad evidence that the entire DC franchise just isn't up to par where the modern audience is concerned. As may be obvious, I am no fan of DC, however, I did genuinely enjoy this movie. That being said, this isn't really a compliment. Certain characters withstanding (e.g. Batman and Superman) there just really isn't much that can be done to make DC as successful as the MCU due directly to the fact that the source material is mostly from a time that cannot reconcile with today's standards of serious storytelling, as well as the fact that Warner Brothers seems utterly unable to really deliver on content even with modern friendly characters and stories. I want to be clear that this isn't meant to be a hateful review. I love the superhero genre and would LOVE to see DC take its proper place in modern storytelling, but...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The unit has to put their differences and egos aside in order to save themselves and the world.James Gunn was perfect choice to write and direct this version of the Squad. It had the feeling of reading a comic book; all of the time transitions, dialogue, over the top violence, and crazy set pieces. I was a little weary of the cast of characters they were putting in there but fell in love with The Peacemaker and King Shark, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. King Shark is sure to be a hit for years to come.You can tell a lot of practical effects were used throughout the runtime which I am a massive supporter of. The CGI that went along with it blended very well and all seemed to seamlessly fit together. I was also very high up on the score and song selection. It followed the pace of the film and fit the mood.I will admit the final act was a little much for me. It took away a lot of the grounded aspect of the film I was particularly fond of. One could argue more well known members of the team would have been more appealing but I think the film benefits from having a more obscure lineup. It felt like there was no clear antagonist, but each act had one and the team themselves acted as their own antagonist.This was a fun film that kept my attention. It far surpassed its predecessor and should be a good starting point for future Suicide Squad films. I am a DC fan but have not been high up on their films so this was a breathe of fresh air. It is one that I will watch multiple times and can't wait for more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Harley Quinn is great reminding me of her role in once upon a time in Hollywood. He's being considered for James Bond but way too old for that.

This movie has more action and better choreographed action
this movie has better flow and tells a better more cohesive story. They story advances much more smoothly.All the characters are perfectly cast and they are all great, even the smaller ones. Every character does a great job and the actors are perfect.What I love the most about this movie is how the cast has a lot of chemistry and how they compliment each other. They are a band of misfits but they end up working perfectly together.Harley is much more enjoyable here than in Birds of Prey. More funny.The story takes a dark turn about secrets the government has and i love that because it feels more real and applies more to our real world.It is not just a super hero movie. It becomes a conspiracy movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The team felt more expendable, we actually got to see characters on screen and be invested in them before they got killed, and with such a large cast it kept you guessing. Harley was vastly improved over the first, fixing her relationship with the joker, and toning down those terrible tattoos from the first. Being emotionally invested in such a throwaway character like polkadot man (yes I know he was in the old comics) was definitely one of the biggest and most plesent surprises. I love the commitment to keeping it weird, and violent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now this apparent remake only 5 years later is easily better in just about every aspect.The characters are given more of a chance as it features better characters. The comedy is much smoother and funnier, the action is not held back and is far more gorier and overall over the top (it's R rating helps it). The story is also more engaging.Idris Elba replacing Will Smith (although playing a different character) was an added addition. The finale involving the giant starfish was great all around as it engaged in both great action, comedic moments and overall stunning visuals. It is a shame this film was not a box office success (the covid-era release hurt it), otherwise we would receive a sequel. Or perhaps this film being one and done is for the best, as it would be tough to top this effort.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Did somebody say James Gunn tho??? NICELY DONE WARNER BROS. If you know a lil bit about the recent events that have taken place in Gunn's career, you'd know that Disney fired him over some homophobic tweets written over 10 years ago! I know, I know ridiculous right? Now, one's studio's exiled director is another studio's treasure!!! I knew after David Ayer's first Suicides Squad the franchise would need some renovations; only because the original films storyline was way too serious for the morbid/corky title to begin with. In past films Gunn has shown us that he can mesh genres very very well. Remember his first hit film SUPER??? I feel like Suicide Squad 2 will have the same vibe. A DARK COMEDY with an ACTION/ADVENTURE plot twist. Lastly, I'll bet that WB is going to take pride in letting Mr. Gunn out the squeaky clean, politically correct Mickey Mouse ass cage he's been locked up in since The Guardians of the Galaxy. So keep an eye out for subliminal's towards the Marvel franchise. P. S- it won't be Rated ""R"" for nothing! Love, Pray, Cinema.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So I booked the tickets to the cinema, and I have to say only one thing, this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps the best film of the DCEU, the music is something unforgettable, the action scenes are shot with care and you really notice the touch of Gunn. Not to mention the characterization of the characters which is much deeper compared to the first chapter, if I have to nitpick maybe King Shark is nice and cool but maybe in the flash tv series I liked it more but this is just an opinion personal. This film left me speechless mainly because it is a totally different style from other DC films. I absolutely recommend watching and I'm super curious about the Peacemaker TV series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I interpreted it as a Love Letter for DC Comic Book fans, This movie is nothing like any other Superhero film. It felt like a 2-hour long comic book made into live-action.The movie was surprisingly not as comedic as expected. But when it does try to be funny. It does it well.James Gunn did something that I have never seen a filmmaker be able to achieve, his ability to transition from emotions so quickly. You go from Feeling Disgusted, Then Laughing, Then Heartbroken, Then Happy all within 5 minutes, and it completely works. I have to admit, There was a scene that made me tear up towards the end and not because it was sad, It just hit a lot of strings and I think it will for a lot of people.I have to give credit to Warner Bros. They have the best CGI and Special Effects in the Industry. There were shots with King Shark that I could look at and actually think They could be real.There was not a single actor in this movie I thought didn't put on an Amazing performance,The actress for Rat Catcher 2: Daniela Melchior, Was easily my favorite character and Actress in the film, This was her first big role in a movie and I Guarantee her phone will be ringing from a lot of Studios after her amazing performance in this,The huge set pieces that they created for this movie astonished me. This movie has a lot of love and soul put into it.Also, John Murphy's Score was Incredible.However, I do have a few complaints,
Stop using Harley Quinn for Sex Appeal! There was a scene in this movie. That I could not stop thinking to myself. This completely Contradicted Everything Birds Of Prey set up! It was painful to watch and not in a good way. It was very poor taste.I have no issue with violence and gore in movies. But This was Ridiculous. Every character's death has to have been The most Violent and painful to watch death you have ever seen. It just was plain annoying. I have to say, This was the Most Violent Movie I have ever seen and it gets to a point where it just got unwatchable.Altogether this would be a very fun movie to see with a group of friends. I do suggest seeing this movie In Imax because of the amazing visuals. But It still could work at home. I had a lot of fun and know many others will.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Not without issue, but much better than the last attempt","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7203223/?ref_=tt_urv","thecanadian-23317","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68243339/?ref_=tt_urv","7 August 2021","The biggest issue with this movie is one that most ensemble movies face - there's just not enough time for each of the characters. Some get some good development (I liked Ratcatcher 2, for example), but others felt fairly lacking (like Polka Dot Man). And as much as I love Margot Robbie as Harley, Harley as a character felt kind of out of place in this movie. I feel like WB felt like they ""had"" to include her because she was basically the only good part about the 2016 Suicide Squad. And it's kind of complicated because her individual scenes are generally good, but she spends more time on her own ""adventure"" than with the rest of the Squad.Narrative issues aside though, I've basically got nothing bad to say about the movie. Gunn directed the hell out of this movie - it looks great, and his visual flair is all over it. The movie was generally funny without being cringey, and there were a few scenes that were surprisingly emotional. Acting was solid, special effects were good. I would 100% watch a sequel.The movie is definitely in the top 3 DC movies, but that's really not saying much. It has some narrative issues but it's very enjoyable and I'd highly recommend it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie should have surpassed $500 million and with a budget of £185 million you would certainly hope-so. Gunn has directed a spectacular piece of cinema with this film however did not get the acclaim. There are a number factors that contributed to lack of gross profit mainly covid. I personally believe it was down to it being an alleged reworks of the original suicide squad film, I myself was left confused and it took me a while to actually realize this was not the original film, the same titles within 5 years can cause major confusion. Eitherway I think this film is just amazing and I give it a big thumbs up. It's obvious where a huge budget of $185 million went. If your Marvel then you can get away with a $200 million budget because your guaranteed a very good return however warner and DC are just losing way too much money as of the run up to 2024. I must just add the streaming on HBO was the highest streaming in the summer of 2021 for this film. The lead actor being Idris Elba I would not class him as a $500 million profit box office sensation, although he is obviously very good. Saying that what black actor of modern time could pull in a huge box office hit?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's like that. James Gunn is exhausting. Does it surprise you he makes off-colored Tweets and expects you to be cool with it? Or get over it? You know what it is? It's predictable. Like, you can't have a character have a heartfelt moment without it being interrupted by cruelty. Oooooo...edgy. Worst of all, it's cynical and angry. I'm tired of it myself.This is a mean-spirited movie with unnecessary violence put under a high powered telescope so you can endure it as much as the talent does. This is sad lazy movie making at it's laziest level. Numb filling stupidity with jokes that seem tired when they were in the trailer. I understand what they were attempting to do but it is just one flaccid joke after another then add gruesome violence then a quip then more violence rinse repeat.Sorry Man...""Guardians..."" was dullsville derivative nostalgic nonsense made for wall to wall era music hipsters. This seems to paddle around aimlessly until it lands on bland. It has somehow turned that ""Deadpool"" ultraviolence into pastiche. And it was dated to begin with.

Gunn's reboot fits the purposed tone of the original, John Ostrander ""Suicide Squad"" comics. His revamp brings everything to the table that 2016's fun, but flawed ""Suicide Squad"" lacked while its new R rating allows for the film's notorious characters to be presented as the rowdy group of mercenaries under compulsion and blackmail that they were written to be. This time around, they're really not afraid of being ""the bad guys"" and nobody is truly safe. A perfect balance of dramatic comedy, adventure, and heroic fantasy, the film utilizes wall-to-wall action, gory violence, epic set pieces, impressive visual effects, and awesome stunts. Gunn wastes no time getting to the point and deploys his charismatic, cleverly engaging, all-star cast of Hollywood veterans and acclaimed newcomers in shockingly inventive ways. Gunn offsets his renowned vibrancy with DC Comics' traditional grim and calamitous style and let me say that it works FAR better than I expected. This is what modern hero pictures should aspire to be. If you're a fan of fun, extravagant Marvel movies and can also enjoy the darker, more realistic DC films, then this is the perfectly balanced comedic action film that you've been looking for. It's good fun AND good quality... 90%","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

James Guns absolutely kills it. It's a bloody, chaotic ride from the start. The story in this feels a lot more like the suicide squad, lot of casualties, death body counts and some brutal violence action scene. Now yes this is James Guns movie so the tone will be Guardians of The Galaxy style. The tone looks beautiful, full of great visuals and it feels fresh for an adult.Now there is 11 members in the squad James Guns knows how to balanced each character to take in the action. There is also some great character arc moments that are unforgettable. Speaking of it, let's don't forget Margot Robbie spotlight as Harley Quinn. She a lot funnier, unpredictable and takes the action very wellNow there is some weak point in this which is the villain. Now I didn't find it to be interesting but the more I watched it I did find it to be more interesting. For me I liked Amanda Waller as the villain a lot. She controls Task-Force X to do what she says now that looks evil. Ok there's not much to complain about this film.It's a win for James Guns. A chaotic hell of a ride, with some bloody violence action scene. There's no doubt at all this is one of the best DC extended universe film.Verdict: 9.2/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I kinda liked Suicide Squad (2016) though it was pretty bad, and I gave it a 7/10 score back in 2016... but this film is just so much worse. The previous film at least had 3 people who had super-powers, but this film literally only has 1 person with super-powers..... talk about scaling down. They made a super-hero movie, with just 1 super-hero lol. What on earth were they thinking?This film is supposed to be action mixed with comedy, yet I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire 120minutes runtime. That's exceptionally poor when you compare it to Suicide Squad (2016) that actually managed to get a couple of laughs out of me.I'd honestly rather prefer that they bring David Ayer back as director, instead of James Gunn, as it seems he just can't make a good film (except for the two GotG films). James is better of sticking to the Marvel universe because he doesn't have the 'darkness' in him to be able to cope with the DC Universe it seems.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's rated R. There is no superhero action movie with this much comedy and blood. And James Gunn managed to blend the comedy and gruesomeness perfectly. He also divided the movie into chapters for people to easily understand. They didn't waste time on introducing new characters because they were going to get axed out. And add the background music, and turn this peculiarity into masterpiece. It's one of the best DC films after a long time. The CGI was decent, the hiliarosity was not forced at all and maintained the character connection throughout the whole movie. However, from the understanding, there is little chance of a sequel from this movie with this mindset, which is a little disappointing. But this movie is great and I recommend everyone should watch it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After the receiving huge respect from DC Universe fans in form of Zack Snyder's brilliant version of Justice League, make way for James Gunn's new and improved The Suicide Squad over the disappointing Suicide Squad released in 2016.In The Suicide Squad , we see Viola Davis returns to her role as U. S. government official Amanda Waller pulling out the most dreaded and probably the most weirdest characters from the prison to make the deadliest anti-hero squad - Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Peacemaker (John Cena), Weasel (Sean Gunn), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), Javelin (Flula Borg), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Savant (Michael Rooker) and Sylvester Stallone as the voice of Nanaue / King Shark, for a top-notch secret mission to destroy the mysterious starfish project as they are dropped off in the island of Corto Maltese.James Gunn (who directed the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise for Marvel), makes The Suicide Squad more thrilling and exciting than the David Ayer's Suicide Squad released in 2016. While the few cast remains the same and few were killed off instantly as the first team of Task Force X gets duped by a sudden tip-off while the second team assemble with the first one later to get The Suicide Squad. The witty humor with one-liners is witnessed throughout the film which keeps you entertained with background soundtrack from Johnny Cash and Louis Prima. James Gunn manages to keep the energy even though somewhere in between the plot gets sidetrack (Harley Quinn escaping from the prison had larger-than-life action stunt) and 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. I also felt that makers could have done few scenes without showing killing of birds (even though it was visual but creates a wrong impression with the audience) but with astonishing climax where the battle between Starfish and The Suicide Squad will give you a thrilling ride. It was definitely a refreshing and unique super-hero flick with infused fun-elements making it an enjoyable fun ride. The introduction of each superhero with unique super power is hilarious, especially Sylvester Stallone's King Shark. The camera work is spectacular (check out for the fight scene between the The Peace-maker and Colonel Rick Flag in the reflection of a helmet).Screenplay is good along with funny dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the star cast.Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline and lovely performances. It is definitely an improvement over a 2016 version of Suicide Squad which deserves to be experienced, applauded and remembered. Go for it - 3.5/5.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

"9","/10","An R-Rated Blast from Start to Finish","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7214443/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","10 August 2021","The very fact that this film even exists just baffles me. When Suicide Squad hit theatres back in 2016, I really wasn't a fan. I enjoyed nearly all of the characters, but I felt they deserved a much better film. It was a jumbled mess and therefore tainted any need to rewatch it. Once Warner Bros. Decided to hire writer/director James Gunn, giving him the freedom to choose whichever property he wanted, I was shocked to see him choose The Suicide Squad. Serving as both a very loose sequel to the previous installment, while also being a reboot in itself, this is the best film based on DC Comics to come out in a while.If you haven't seen the original film, they do a good job getting you up to speed in the first act. The opening of the film lets you know that Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is still continuing her Suicide Squad projects, pulling people in and out of prison to do her dirty work. Within minutes of starting, the film ramps up by delivering a very surprising action sequence that really caught me off guard. From there, the film is both funny, emotional, and extremely entertaining from start to finish. This is easily one of the best examples I've ever seen from a major studio that fixes its old mistakes.Before I start gushing about how good this film truly is, I'll get a few very small negatives out of the way. As soon as the second act begins, the film definitely begins to feel its length a bit. I wasn't fully invested in the side story involving Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), but where that story ends up was worth it, so that complaint sort of fizzled itself out eventually. Still, the pacing in the second act could've been a little tighter. On top of that, even though this isn't a complaint of mine, people who ended up loving the previous film will probably not get too much enjoyment here if they're looking for something similar. I can see people thinking this one is far too weird and bizarre in comparison. Again, those aren't my thoughts, but more of a heads up.I could go on for a very long time about what to praise about The Suicide Squad, but I'll keep it brief. The shock factor alone sold me from the very beginning. There are surprises sprinkled throughout the entire film and I hardly saw any of them coming. The chemistry between Idris Elba (Bloodsport) and Daniela Melchior (Ratcatcher 2) was the beating heart of the film. Their presence made the film infinitely better than it already would have been. The climax of the movie feels absolutely bonkers but also earned. Even cast members like John Cena and Joel Kinneman deliver career-best performances here. In particular, I loved the evolution of Kinneman's Rick Flag from the first Suicide Squad.Overall, from the quirky dialogue to the pure fun that James Gunn brings to all of these films, I found my eyes glued to the screen. Nearly everything about this film felt like an improvement on the last. Again, I feel that a couple of scenes in act two could've been shorter or cut out, but I'm honestly scraping the bottom of the barrel to find things I didn't like. The Suicide Squad is a wacky, fun, and absolutely eccentric ride at the movies and I can't recommend it enough. I will say this though; take the words ""wacky"" and ""eccentric"" very seriously and then have another look at the trailer. If you don't think it's for you, that's because it's not. This movie embraces its R-rating and is simply a blast. If you know what type of film this is and are already interested, I'm pretty confident you'll love it as I did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A carefully handpicked team of supervillains are armed with the most powerful weapons and embark on a quest to complete a mission on the island of Corto Maltese.We see the idea of this film being the REAL 'Suicide Squad' rather than 2016's edition in the earliest moments of the film, where we see the built up, dramatic exaggeration and climatic anticipation of the provisional squad throwing themselves out of a plane to swim onto the island's shore, though with Gunn's clever camerawork, we see the opening credits split into the second group, featuring Pacemaker, Polka-Dot Man, Bloodsport, King Shark and the late-joiner, the infamous, Harley Quinn.Gunn's input is explicit, the graphic violence of heads exploding, guts flying across land and a shark impressively managing to swallow multiple humans slow, mix well with the clear comedy utilised in the characters actions and dialogue.In my opinion, it is almost as if Gunn and the crew within DC have opted for an approach that suggests Supervillains and Superhero's are naturally far-fetched, that seem to constantly avoid death and are always able to save the world, so why not make it funny, the movie is a comedy, there is a giant illiterate shark who eats people, an introverted villain who throws polka dots at enemies and a muscle-man dressed in bright, lustrous colours, we have license to laugh and be amazed by the thrill of the actions.It really is one of its kind!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The quality of jokes are so low.VFX - when harley battles, they use that annoying Flowery vfx in action scenes. That thing is so weird to watch.VILLIAN - the villian has very important role in superhero movies.

Are a DC (or Comic Book Movie) Fan, and will go see this no matter what.2). Are not of fan of the darker DCEU movies (as compared to the MCU films) and might have checked out the first SUICIDE SQUAD, but have no intention to watch this one.This review is for the folks in the 2nd camp - for THE SUICIDE SQUAD is a fun summer action flick with silliness, action, humor and HEART at it's core.Directed by James Gunn (GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY), THE SUICIDE SQUAD starts out like the first SUICIDE SQUAD film (and most of the DCEU films) - dark, gritty and intense - with a new pack of anti-heroes joining in on a fight that absolutely cements this team as THE SUICIDE SQUAD.After that, the film makes an interesting adjustment, actually giving the audience anti-heroes that you can root for with just enough of a balance between the dark grittiness that one has come to expect from a DCEU film with a bit more humane touch that really is the hallmark of the MCU.And, under the Direction of James Gunn, this film finds that balance very, very well.Gunn, of course, knows how to make these films - his balance of action and character moments is accurate, his action sequences are well plotted and choreographed (no need for ""shaky cam"" to hide the faults) and he populates this Suicide Squad with some memorable characters.Margot Robbie, of course, is in another stratosphere in her portrayal of Harley Quinn. This is the 3rd film that Robbie stars as Quinn and she has this part down pat. The problem with the other 2 films that she starred in as Quinn (2016's SUICIDE SQUAD and 2020's BIRDS OF PREY) is that she was SO GOOD in those films, that everyone else paled in comparison, but in this film, she has some strong actors/characters to play off of, and this benefits the movie.Starting with Idris Elba as Bloodsport the ""Leader"" of the Squad (in essence, replacing Will Smith) and this is a smart move for Elba has the commanding presence of a Leader with that sense of foreboding that he might not be such a good guy underneath - a quality that I just didn't buy from Smith in the first movie.Joining Elba as characters that were interesting and strong were RatCatcher 1 (Taiki Waititi - in an extended cameo) and RatCatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Savant (Michael Rooker), freedom fighter Sol Soria (Sonya Braga), Thinker (Peter Capaldi) and the ""Groot"" of this piece, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone).Oh...and special notice needs to be made of the character of Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian). Director Gunn has stated he wanted to find the dumbest villain in the DCEU and make him into one of the heroes of this piece. He found him in Polka Dot Man and is played with great pathos by Dastmalchian.Fairing less well is the great Viola Davis as the hard-nosed Amanda Waller who seems to be still acting in the gritty, dark style of the first SUICIDE SQUAD film, so misses out on some of the fun of this film as well as Joel Kinneman as Colonel Rick Flagg (the military leader of the group). I really wasn't invested in Flagg (or Kinneman's portrayal of Flagg) in the first film - and I am not in this one either. He just isn't at nearly the same level of performance as the others listed above.Also...a note about John Cena (and his character PeaceMaker). This is the 2nd 2021 Summer Blockbuster Action flick that I have seen Cena in (following his turn in F9) and in both these films I found his performance to be ""flat"". It just didn't fill the screen, nor does he have enough charisma (a la The Rock) to charm his way through. I was bored by him in this film (as well as in F9).But...this is a James Gunn film - and he doesn't spend much time with the characters/actors that don't really work, but rather, spends his camera time on the ones that do - and the over-the-top action sequences (and villain) that are filmed with a slight grin and a wink-in-the-eye.It's a much needed shot-in-the-arm for DCEU films, but - I'm afraid - it might be too little too late, as most folks have already tuned out the DCEU for being ""too dark"". Which is too bad, for this is the fun summer blockbuster film action and comic book fans have been looking for.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's a movie done with pleasure in a world where money is the main reason a film is made. This is not a cinematographic masterpiece or the best superhero movie ever made and it's not even trying to be. While the visuals are great, CGI is made properly and I loved every costume in the movie especially Bloodsport's, the plot is simple and it's really trying to focus on it's characters instead of the story. James Gunn's biggest achievement in the Suicide Squad I think it's giving every single character a bit of personality so that when you see someone on the screen you kind of expect a certain way for them to behave. You actually see Harley being a crazy human being, an aspect that I feel all the other movies she appeard in neglected transforming her in a children-loving woman in an universe where she killed Robin who was in fact a kid.I loved every action scene, (and the movie is full of it) especially the one in the middle of the movie. Gunn impliments humor during them in a way so they become even more fun and in theme with the film instead of distracting and taking you out of the it. Also the editing is WAY above the 2016 Suicide Squad.Now I have some problems with the movie and I must Say that most of them are just personal and many other s won't sense them as me.First, I feel like with so many villain characters Rick Flag was left outside and is super underutilised, him not even feeling as the leader anymore and just some side-character.Second, this movie has no real villain. The movie focuses so much on the team that forgets about the threat and when it appears it's so thin and absurd that for me it become a joke. A GIANT STAR and zombies.Verdict: The Suicide Squad lives to the hype and it is just what it promised. The movie is not for kids or sensitive people but for comic and DC fans8.7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No, it wasn't a masterpiece or anything, but the images presented to my eyes were not unappealing and I didn't think I'd wasted the couple of hours of my life I spent watching it. So, I was quite intrigued to hear how the second one (which is everything from a remake to a soft reboot) was so much better than the first.It is.No matter how good the first one was (my opinion, only) this one trumps it all round. The plot is basically the same, i.e. A load of (deliberately) B-list 'super-villains' are temporary released from incarceration in order to carry out a mission 'for the greater good.' It gets underway a lot quicker with us introduced to our new set of heroes (or 'anti-heroes' to be precise). Instead of Will Smith we have Idris Elba, but he's joined by fan-favourite Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Of course those to stalwarts are the general stars of the show, but the rest of the cast are on top of their game as they're sent on a mission to some fictional South American country to stop a giant monster from being unleashed on the world.The action and plot is nothing that you haven't seen before, but it's James Gunn's writing that makes this one worth a watch. We live in a world that's completely oversaturated with superhero films and the general Box Office performance is showing how apathetic the general public is to the previously tried and tested formula which the superhero genre offers. Most new superhero movies may be new in terms of the titular character/s, yet they offer little that hasn't been done before. I'm not saying that 'The Suicide Squad' is so different that you'll be amazed at what you're witnessing, but it's certainly worth a watch if you like your humour dark and you're prepared to suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours.In fact, the 'couple of hours' part is about the film's major drawback. Like many modern films it could probably do with being a little more trimmed here and there. It isn't the worst offender when it comes to outstaying its welcome, but I reckon if it lost ten to fifteen minutes here and there it would certainly be a tighter little number.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was unpredictable and certainly delivered on the endeavour to raise the stakes of the genre, shamelessly killing off a plethora of characters in true James Gunn fashion. The film expertly switches between various tones to create a truly cohesive and full story, juggling heartfelt character moments and thrilling action, graphic violence and intelligent humour with ease and tact, overall producing a special experience for DC fans old and new and truly setting itself apart from the vast roster of copy and paste superhero movies. The cast of the film is vast in number with every member as talented and enjoyable to watch as the last. Notable standouts for me were Peter Capaldi as the joyously evil mastermind, ""The Thinker"" and of course, Sylvester Stallone as the voice of the simple, lovable, yet feral beast, ""King Shark."" As well as this, the returning cast from the 2016 Suicide Squad felt new and invigorated with Gunn's writing style, yet still retained some connective tissue to past films. This allowed the film to build upon pre-existing lore, enriching the wider DCEU as a whole, whilst simultaneously providing a purely unique and self contained story for the audience to become completely immersed in, without worry of how things tie into other projects. One final thing i feel i must comment on is the design of the film. From each character's attire seemingly ripped directly from the pages of DC comics, to the unapologetically colourful and outlandish ""Starro the Conqueror,"" The Suicide Squad felt like a love letter to DC nerds everywhere, willing to engulf its main cast in the wacky regalia of their comic counterparts, where many other films of the genre would typically shy away in favour of tactical jumpsuits and modernised armour. As a big DC fan myself, i found a lot to enjoy in this film and hope to see more comic adapted properties daring to be as bold as this one. In simpler terms, I loved every second of The Suicide Squad and can't wait to see it again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is no dull moment, with tons of action, emotion, and comedy that lands perfectly. The beginning had me a little concerned about how the rest would go, but it gets better and better as it progresses, and by the end, I was more than happy with what I got. Every character is made to be loved or hated in a great manner, just in the style Gunn wanted. It makes you root for them throughout the entirety of it. But as he said - don't get too attached. And there's a beauty to that in and of itself. More superhero films need to follow in the footsteps of movies like this. DC in all of its problems, has managed to release one of the greatest movies of all time, and I just wish it would've gotten the attention it deserves. I've watched it time and time again and haven't gotten bored of it once. When someone asks me about my favorite movies, this one is definitely one I won't miss out on mentioning. I hope we get more and more from Gunn and The Suicide Squad in the years to come.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Having said that,this is the perfect blend of Marvel's lighter faring comedy & feel-good moments, mixed with the darkness of the DC world! James Gunn brought the perfect approach to a DC film franchise by giving us some needed darkly & emotionally heavy moments, (but not so heavy that the film is hard to watch, or literally dark & hard to see, like Hack Snyder's films.) He also gets in the comedy & lighter feel-good moments that help to refresh your palette at just the right times throughout the movie, which keeps the film from getting too tedious & depressing (like Snyder's slog-fests were.) Love him or hate him, Gunn has definitely proven that he is the perfect director for these types of films!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had a terrible theater experience with a group of teen couples walking in halfway through the movie. Talking, laughing when nothing was funny, using their phones, dropping their phones, using the phone flashlight to find their phones. Smh i wanted to punch them in the face.And i'm the kind of person that can't miss a single line in the movie. I never leave theater while the movie is playing. But they were so distracting that i left to complain. They quieted down when the attendant was standing by them, but as soon as he left, they resumed. I can't stand inconsiderate ppl.As for the movie. It didn't impress me. I was mostly amused/entertained. But i barely laughed. The action is decent but none of the scenes stood out (i'm struggling to remember any later the same night).I don't really know what was missing, but i just felt like it was almost there but not quite. I'll give it another chance and see if i feel differently about it without morons surrounding me. But i could see it going either way, up or downmy biggest disappointment, which i know won't change, is the same major complaint about the first one: in a movie filled with villains, where is the evilness? Where is the darkness? Why do they want to take villains and make a fun superhero movie. We already have a thousand of them. Don't get me wrong, i love me my superhero genre, but you have the ability to make something so unique.Yeah this movie is filled with bad ppl, but they're portrayed as good, loyal ppl.

"8","/10","Fantastic Fun But It's Not For Everyone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7203044/?ref_=tt_urv","MJL_Uncensored","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16949152/?ref_=tt_urv","7 August 2021","The Suicide Squad is an exhilarating entry into the comic-book genre that takes the best elements of past James Gunn films, other comic book adaptations like Deadpool, The Boys, any combination of Tarantino films, and turns it into a high-caliber exploitation film. That's not a negative; it's an observation that is crucial to understanding the creative choices that drive the experience of the film. This is a film about horrible people trying to save the world, and they never let you forget that they are awful people. In the process, we, as audience members, are tossed into an equally hilarious and vile world that makes you question the limit for comic book movies.From the opening scene, Gunn makes sure you're well aware of what you've gotten yourself into as he injects a vomitorium of violence to desensitize you early on. Then he spins the narrative around to introduce you to the titular characters and establishes what's at stake. This is a film about the risk for everyone involved in the story to the film's actual production. The Suicide Squad swings for the fences, and in the process of delivering a home run, the ball lands in a fan's eye and bloodies them good. No one is safe in this film except for a few. As shocking as many of the deaths are in this film, a savvy gambler could still see the foreshadowing behind the deaths of most characters.Gunn does what he has done well with the Guardians of the Galaxy, taking a group of misfits and helping them find synergy in the most unconventional of ways. But along the way, there's a tragedy, betrayal, and real stakes that make the film's absurd big battle thrilling to watch. He also manages to give the film heart by taking the easily most likable member of the group and giving her a story that makes you care for her. But as the film explores her roots, the film literally takes a dump on the type of people she represents in a weird social commentary about capitalism that feels like satire from Team America World Police.There are choices made that are juvenile and brilliant, all at the exact times. There are other tasteless and unnecessary choices, even for a film that establishes its extremes early on. So it's not hard to surmise that this film will be a hit with one segment of moviegoers and a turnoff for others. That's how polarizing this film is. But no one can deny the brilliant cinematic style on the screen. Gunn paints the canvas with some of the best cinematography I've seen in a comic book film. It's gritty yet colorful. He exudes mastery over the camera angles in this film, literally framing every scene in an artistic and kinetic way. And while audiences may split on their feelings about this film, everyone will walk away thinking about the lovable scene stealer that is King Shark.I can't say more about this film without rolling into spoilers, but what I can say is, The Suicide Squad is without a doubt one of the most creative comic book movies in recent years but it's also the most disturbing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The connecting link here is a script written by Gunn himself and with characteristic caustic irony playing superhero cliches. So, for example, the opening battle scene turns out to be a deception - and the first ""suicide squad"" dies in almost full force already at the tenth minute. In another scene, Peacemaker and Bloodsport arrange a competition in the number of murders, shooting almost defenseless victims (who, by the way, will turn out to be friendly rebels) - Batman or Superman would fall into an incurable depression after such a mistake. And during one particularly spectacular battle scene involving Harley Quinn, streams suddenly begin to gush out of the enemies... flowers instead of rivers of blood. Etc. All this frenzy of imagination is provided with an R rating, the potential of which Gunn uses to the maximum. Perhaps, people have never been killed so often and in so many ways in the DC movie comic: enemies are swallowed alive, torn apart, trampled, and the process is accompanied not only by copious blood splashes, but also, as usual with Gunn, perfectly selected music. A wide range of artists and bands, from Johnny Cash to Pixies, are heard behind the scenes, complemented by the musical theme of John Murphy. On top of everything else, the new ""Suicide Squad"" - and this is the main surprise - turns out to contain a political comment about the cynicism of American foreign policy and the flirtation of the White House with dictatorships in the ""banana republics"".In general, before us is a bright, dynamic and elegant in its wildness alternative to the conveyor blockbusters from Marvel, a kind of ""Dirty Dozen"" in the DC universe. It is unlikely that we will see a stream of such films in the near future - the author's handwriting is more important here than ratings and even characters. But the fact that the new ""Suicide Squad"" will take its rightful place among the movie comics of the 2020s is already certain.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After watching this a couple of times, I think that this movie is exactly what it wanted to be and does it very well. The characters should be the focal point of the movie, and they are all given a great mix of heart and humor. John Cena, Margot Robbie, and Edris Elba are excellent actors and really kill knocked out their characters which was the most important thing. The movie is a little long and the humor does not always hit, with a few scenes that just aren't at par with the rest of the movie.

Can't DC or whoever is behind this just trow in the towell and admit that Marvel has won that race, and stop trying to make the same thing?I have nothing against dark movies with an angry Batman or a dead Superman, but these trying-to-be-cool-movies are just annoying and does not work.Watch Black Widow instead.

I've watched and enjoyed silly or goofy movies before, but this didn't make me laugh once. Acting is stilted, scenes feel forced and unnatural. This movie has none of the hero / antihero allure you would expect from the title and certainly none of the excitement. They've tried some scenes where you are supposed to emotionally connect with the characters but it's so superficially done I spent the whole movie not caring which side of the fight got blown up. Not to mention the continued and boring over-simplified political and social representation of South American countries as seen through the lens of Americans, yawn.

I've watched it at least 10-15 times since it came out. Thirdly, although I was looking forward to the first ""Suicide Squad,"" due to the general premise, star power (Will and Margot,) the cool trailers, and of course Jared's Joker, I was greatly disappointed. It was a massive, heartbreaking train-wreck.And lastly, this was good, but not great. I liked it, and will probably watch it again sooner or later, because I love these types of movies, but probably not more than once or twice.

Lost a lot of faith in James Gunn after this. I also think Margot Robbie needs to be replaced after this film. She just has no passion for the Harley Quinn role. She phones it in along with John Cena and Idris Elba. Elba's performance was so bad, they renamed his character Bloodsport to leave the door open for Will Smith to come back, which is hilarious.The most interesting characters leave the movie at the very beginning, a very bizarre decision that left the rest of the movie with very boring characters to carry the film. It was very disappointing to see how much the trailers basically lied to the audience. Not sure if these decisions were COVID influenced, but it made no sense.The plot and villains were just not very threatening, which led to me playing with my laptop and phone quite a bit. I just didn't see a reason to care, especially when you know someone in the US government can just press a button and make their problems go away.Daniela Melchior is the best thing about the film. She upstaged Big Money Margot Robbie. Really embarrassing stuff. Whereas the film's loss of Will Smith hurt the sequel quite a bit, Margot's removal from the movie probably would have improved it. Daniela is so good in the role, I'd argue that she should replace Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. She's simply better than the Ratcatcher role.Watch this on streaming if you can, don't waste your time in theaters.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Disappointed in a lot of the directions taken and the try hard hard comdey. The second half saved it from being a complete bomb. The story was terribly incoherent. I had a hard time connecting with the characters. The characters I did connect with were from the previous film. The foundation David Ayer laid in ""his"" rendition saved the second act of this film because of the characters. I hope this isnt a sign of the future from WB for what's to come for the DC live action ""multiverse."" There were a few things I did really enioy, specifically a certain Harley solo fight, but not enough to give it a thumbs up. This film was JUST OK.

Unfortunately, it's a clinging feeling of utter indifference. For a director who gets off on being subversive, it's a shock at how predictable everything is with the only shocks coming from when a joke actually lands. Perhaps the most subversive thing about The Suicide Squad is when Gunn attempts to manipulate the audience into caring about any of these characters. It's almost as offensive as Taika Waititi's attempt at playing a Portuguese man.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Congratulations, Hollywood. You pushed too far. I'm a middle-aged man that's not squeamish. I've seen my share of horror movies, many of which will stand the test of time as actually good works of cinema (and many that aren't). I don't get rattled by much. But The Suicide Squad pushed too far, and it wasn't necessarily because of the brutality or the violence or the absolutely disgusting show the filmmakers put on but the fact that they want to strip empathy from viewers.As I've grown up, I've read and learned about the absolute cesspool LA is. I've heard all the horror stories about newbies going out and entering a city of sharks, people who don't give up their morals get eaten and spit out. I've heard that that city is ""fun on the outside and absolutely cutthroat on the inside."" It preys on the weak and ensconces those morals on viewers. I had pushed this notion away as long as I could, but The Suicide Squad did me in. It pushed too far. It finally let me see the man behind the curtain and that man wants to peddle violence and brutality and sociopath and a revelry of cruelty. This movie encompasses all of that. It's the first film in a long time that I didn't feel right watching, possibly like watching someone kick a dog to death while trying to get you to play along.The film gets 1 star for technical competency (cinematography, stunts, etc.) and 1 star for solid acting and that's it. But in a way, I kind of thank this movie. I thank it for finally bringing to light what I've felt of the entertainment machine that is Hollywood: it's a garbage city that makes garbage products and peddles garbage ideals. Because of this movie I'm backing off from that nonsense and voting with my wallet. Life's too short to fill with this kind of junk.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I don't pay much attention to that so I just watched it because I like a lot of the DC and Marvel movies. The first suicide squad was better than this one. The squad doesn't act like villains at all. I also feel like everyone (including Harley) was watered down. Sure the movie is gory, but no one is menacing (the squad or any of the villains). The comedy was just ok. I love comedic breaks in action movies, but these were just meh. (Harley trying to figure out who Milton was was actually really funny though). For me though this is one of the stupidest movies I've seen. There were just too many times I looked at my husband and ""Um that's just dumb."" I like the first Kingsman movie and thought Birds of Prey was pretty good. So I get the genre, but this one is just bad.

There is no real plot, it loses all meaning half way through. I seriously hope this movie is discredited, I can't take it as part of the DC universe.

I find it disturbing that so many talented people wasted hundreds of hours of their precious and finite time producing this rubbish.I would pay 10x the amount I paid for my ticket to know what thoughts ran through their heads when they watched the premiere. You know what...forget it. I am pretty sure they just patted each other in the back. If Hollywood had one ounce of self-awareness, everyone in the production of such petty crap would vow to ""never again"" put something as awful as this out. But it won't happen. Worse movies will be made.I don't know if this movie was created to cater to the demands of an increasingly dumb audience, fully committed to embracing only the most base forms of entertainment; or because Hollywood genuinely ran out of ideas, and they stopped trying; or it's part of something more sinister, a reflection of our cultural and social dereliction.Whatever the underlying mechanisms that allow such a movie to be reproduced on thousands of screens worldwide and get away with it (with bags of money) needs to be stopped. The very least that unsatisfied spectators can do is voice their contempt.Death as pornography (even a kindergartener stomping on ants for fun has more awe for their life than this movie), the gore, the dick jokes, the pathetic emotional interludes, the sheer stupidity of it all.And the ""heroes""? The men and women (and shark!) America summoned to eliminate a hostile foreign dictatorship. What are we supposed to...are we supposed to root for them?Maybe I am missing the point. But even anti-heroes have certain humanity, a ""soul"", a redeemable aspect that makes you forget for a second that they are the bad guys. The heroes of this movie are automatons. Who jump into every scene without any fear, compassion, nor any sense of humanity.The only redeemable thing about this movie is that it ends.And the worst is, as of August 2021, this movie has a respectable rating of 7.5 on IMDB, standing toe to toe with such classics as Eastern Promises (2007). A score it doesn't even remotely deserve.If something as trivial as a movie rating is so carefully manipulated what to think then, of more critical affairs?","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Set in between the ending of the Snyder/original regime and the middle of Hamada's tenure. If you look at reviews from the mainstream and those on twitter, you'd be hard pressed to believe this is the greatest comic book movie ever made. My question would be ""did we watch the same movie?""
The characters for the most part do make the movie but the ""plot"" doesn't really do them justice. The movie is mostly just character skits pieced together by juvenile humor. Given the beginning and the ending are entertaining but the entire movie in the middle is a bore to get through. I have watched this movie twice with friends and family and they ask me to watch something else when this in on. I guess this was unfiltered guardians of the galaxy and it shows. This is the director that WB gave the keys to and I can say that I wish them luck but I definitely won't be in the theaters for those films.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This was supposed to be action comedy, packed with famous faces and a great director but turned out to be uninventive trash big budget movie with forced stupid jokes and way too graphic violence. So dumb and violent that it's unwatchable. Who did you make this for? How low do you see your audience? This sets a bar high. I never gave a one star or wrote here a bad review but this movie deserves it and if it continues to be a trend where raw graphic violence is a merit for quality that tells us all about what audience we've all become.

And it's hard to figure out why since there's both good and bad here. To keep this short-ish lemme dwell on the bad: John Cena as Peacemaker. First, this ""it's your turn"" thing Hollywood does with actors is irritating. First it was when Will Ferrell was in everything from 2004-08. Then it was Kevin Hart 2016-18, and now it's Cena's ""turn"" to be in everything, ugh. And he's just not a good actor, he's too much ""himself"". Then there's the starfish villain, which seriously, did no one but no one tell him about Patrick in Spongebob?! And the desensitizing violence is just over the top. I suppose writer/directors get off on filming new, gory ways to kill people. There's not much ""story"" in this film, which I suppose is why Gunn filled it with so much nonsense action/violence. I was on the FF/skip button much more than I should've been.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I'm 100% done with her as Harley Quinn, she's a gorgeous woman but the character is unbelievably annoying. Also I'd imagine Quentin Tarantino would be absolutely fuming at the fact that Margot Robbie's feet play such a pivotal role in one scene and he missed out on them toes in his last film.Terrible dialogue, I'm talking daytime soap opera level.I watched this for free online and I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Is it the worst movie you'll see? No obviously not, it's just below average and dare I say not any better than the last Suicide Squad movie from a few years back.","11 out of 28 found this helpful.

I think James Gunn has done a great job directing Guardians of the Galaxy so I had high hopes for this movie.What does it get right? The actors are great, the top final villain is suitably over the top idiotic and the visuals are mostly great.So that leaves the bad..
Writing: we expect clichés in a movie like this, but most of them feel so old and over-used that it hurts to watch and the dialogue is pretty bad too.Humour: if you laugh when people are stupid and hurt themselves then this is probably your kind of fun, but it didn't do it for me - I think I smiled once.Violence: I don't have a problem with violence in movies, but it often feels unnecessarily graphic and brutal and wants the audience to laugh at it. I didn't.Directing: This had a lot of what I call Michael Bay syndrome.. when the characters constantly survive impossible odds without any good explanation. It also uses graphics in similar ways to Bay at times that is so much clutter moving on screen that you can't really see the action.Music: I didn't like any of the music (except a Cash song). If was like they consistently chose bad songs from good artists.When you put all that together the result is a terrible movie that is only slightly better than Wonder Woman 1984 - and I hope DC never sinks lower than that stinker.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This film is shockingly bad! In fact no, it's not shocking, it's totally expected. It's bad in that way that only DC movies seem to be able to achieve.Seemingly, the main brief of this and all other DC films I've ever seen, seems to be to make a film which is nothing like a Marvel film. And, they've achieved it again with this movie. You see, Marvel films are often good, coherent, entertaining fun, but this movie is none of the above. Nothing about the plot and/or characters makes you care about a single thing that happens in the film. Completely unnecessary ott gore, the only purpose of which seems to be to make sure that you know you're watching DC, not Marvel. Stupid cinematography and production, with silly gimmicky effects, the sort which would appeal to a child, (possibly the reason why the under 18s have rated this film so highly) like that scene where those colourful flowers/butterflies or whatever are coming out of Harley Quinn when she's shooting/killing people.This is not a very good film.

She stole all the scenes and carried entire movie on her back, making all the others as supporting as they could be. If wasn't her, surely would be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. So it's kinda understandable why her character is in a so supporting role this time, clearly because Gunn wanted to give space to all other characters to shine. But that didn't work as well. The movie tries so hard to give a deserved attention to each one of them that they all lack of a good development, and great potentials are wasted, in a way that they get in and out of scenes so randomly as Louis Lane in Batman v Superman.King Shark is Gunn's attempt to bring once again a CGI character of few words to be used as a comic relief the same way he did with Groot in Guardians Of The Galaxy. The result is that Shark's dumbness is weird and annoying and he's only there to fill gaps between scenes. In the beginning is told he was crucial to the mission, but turns out to be the most useless of them serving basically to make audience feels just entertained by his clumsy personality instead of a true importance he should have to the story.They didn't bring Deadshot back this time, but Bloodsport works alike. His background family drama issues with his daughter is also very similar. More of the same stuff, but fortunately story doesn't spend so much time on it more than a couple of scenes. But on the other hand there's Ratcatcher 2 to squeeze some unnecessary drops of drama from the plot working as this lovely sweet tie that bonds everyone together because they are crazy and suicidal but they will all live happily ever after.The biggest problem for me this time is pretty much the same of previous movie, the need to turn villains into likable trusty heroes, giving plenty of moments to make audience feel empathy by their endless moments of redemption, making their villainess be completely forgotten even when they are killing innocent people, which isn't exactly what some would expect in a R rated movie considering their nature. In other words, it's a teen movie filled with free violence and gore, far from being a dirty action packed comedy flick as interesting, clever and entertaining as Deadpool is, a character that is likable even though having no morality at all.I see the movie as a completely fan service so Warner and DC can desperately avoid the departing of what's left of their cinematic fanbase, which is ok, and that's why the movie's being so overated. But for those ones who know only the few necessary of the comics, like me, and are interested to have a great time and feel intrigued by their story, it isn't exactly what it offers. It's not memorable, nor entertaining. It was really hard to keep on its 120 minutes, not fun at all also because all the jokes felt flat. I could see the jokes were there and they could be really funny, but somehow they were very bad timed and didn't work most of the times. And the dialogs were painful when there were some. Mainly because there are no chemistry between characters or actors. Of course they have different personalities and they don't have any motivational intent to work as a team facing the fact that all of them are doing the work because otherwise their choices are limited to a life in jail or death sentence if Amanda Waller feels like it. But either way, writers should have created a better reason that could make them realize at some point that their efforts on working together - even at first hating each other's presence - could turn into something they could stand to rely on.I really enjoyed both volumes of GOTG and Gunn is a very talented director, but his attenpt to reprise the same formula, now using DC characters, have not worked for me as I expected.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm going to avenge my wasted two hours, and I don't need enemies at this point in my life.In my defense: David Ehrlich rated this 7/10, and also - and I've yet to comprehend how is this possible - the movie has a 74 Metacritic score. So, that's that for what it's worth. Now, I should've ditched this the moment I heard James Gunn had defended Marvel from the ""accusations"" Scorsese made toward it almost two years ago, saying that Martin did that to publicize his movie, which I think it's true. A guy making movies about mobsters all his life has to be a mobster himself. But that's beyond the point. Bringing that up after this long means only that is Gunn, the one who's in desperate need of some press. And, I get it desperation pushes you to do silly things. But it's embarrassing to ""go against"" Scorsese in such a lame and ignoble fashion when you have a perfectly well-constructed fanbase filled with rednecks that are going to love the movie and even complain of why isn't it longer. You have to be satisfied with that.I might have gotten a migraine watching this movie, so bear with me while I try to explain it. This movie felt like some children were playing with their favorite action figures, creating these very random, mindless play scenes. - The giant star at the ending crashing the buildings reminded me of when Stitch from 'Lilo & Stitch' creates his play scene and destroys the cars and other toys. - And then someone who saw the children playing sat down and decided to put all those play scenes together, and that's the movie. - ""Embrace the senseless action and the gorefest!""
Some of the scenes have something severely wrong with them on some level, be it the writing, the acting, or the over-the-top action choreographies. Something else they did which is unforgivable is that they raped some of the songs they used here by playing them in the most unfitting moments possible. So, there is a lot they did wrong with this movie, and they had no right to because it hasn't been long since the last dumb 'Suicide Squad' film. The comics on which these characters are based must be phenomenal for these guys to attempt to bring them into the film realm this often because I don't want to believe they're making these films only because they know there is big money behind them.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The only difference here between this & ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" is the excessive gore (believing the featuring of blood to be way more edgy than it thinks it is & is trying so hard to be) - which is needlessly there anyway, merely for cheap shock value.The juvenile humour is the same. The cinematography also; James Gunn has made no clear attempts to tailor / refine his directorial style to suit the DC brand & the cheap looking VFX is additionally imported from Disney too. Tonally, the movie's incoherent & lazily excuses its inconsistencies laden within the plot, utilising the justification of ""intentionally orchestrated madness"", characterisations are formed from constant quippy dialogue (Joss Whedon would have an aneurism reading this script) & (most unforgivably) Peter Capaldi's utterly wasted throughout. I've seen it all before; two dimensional villains, hollow, artless filmmaking & mindless spectacle etc.Don't get me wrong, I understand Warner Bros felt the need to potentially course correct after the unnerving divisiveness of Zack Snyder's brooding, philosophical seriousness (dissections of the super-hero genre that often attracted a niché group of cinema-goers) but there's surely a happy medium to be found in the middle (which could please fans & general audiences alike), without doing a complete 180? I ask in all seriousness because this? Viewers are mercilessly bludgeoned over the head with star-shaped excessive over-compensation. I'm almost suffering from whiplash from the brazen appeasement in a desperate & pathetic attempt to be liked by the production company. We've gone from one unpalatable extreme to the other.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Minuses, I don't think I would say it but Harley Quinn was a but over the top and was more annoying than entertaining. In Birds of Prey and the original Suicide Squad, Harley Quinn was the most entertaining part of those films. Here, she seems she was a secondary thought.The first suicide squad was flawed by DC's doing too much and not develop the characters. In this one, similar problem. Now James Gunn addresses the problem with better dialogue and scenes seem to develop better but still flawed.","16 out of 47 found this helpful.

If the bar is Guardians, yeah, this doesn't come close. That being said, if you're not big into DCEU, this won't change your mind, but it's easy enough to watch on its own, and the wacky ideas kinda make up for it. Although, as I will explain later, this is unfortunately not a reboot of the 2016 film.I give this movie an amount of credit because it feels like it could've been good. There are gags and visuals that are inventive, at times I was entertained. Harley Quinn was pretty good, I liked Idris Elba and the rest of the squad was never overwhelmingly annoying. James Gunn's attempt to go outside the box wasn't the problem here. The problem is that the pacing and the clumsy dialogue undercut everything good going on. Whenever there was a good joke, it never had any room to breathe before 10 more ok ones fired off. Sometimes character development happens in one scene when it feels like it should really be more fleshed out, and that's definately a side effect of how many characters they tried to jam into this film. Then in other parts, it grinds to a hault and drags on something that should take 5 seconds, often some experimental shot or something that might be interesting if they didn't take so long. Like, whoever editted this movie just made baffeling decisions on where to focus, and it's not clear how much of that was James Gunn. That doesn't mean the script is perfect, or that James Gunn didn't fall asleep at the wheel, but I think a stronger editor could've brought this film to a 6 or 7 out of 10.Of course, another issue that effects the plot development is that this film isn't actually a reboot. Clearly, Warner Brothers wanted people to think it was a reboot that just shared a few returning cast members, because they called this film, ""The Suicide Squad,"" with no subtitle, and I don't think anyone would've given this a chance had James Gunn's name hadn't been attatched. The last film called Suicide Squad was a critical bomb, Birds of Prey didn't do much better. It's clear that this movie is trying to take things in a significantly different direction. The problem is that they also didn't want to do another Harley Quinn origin story, but they still wanted Harley Quinn because she was the only good thing the other movies had going, so I guess they figured if they just changed most of the characters, re-explained the head bomb thing, and didn't put a number in the title, they could have their cake and eat it too. As I said, you don't need to watch the other movies to understand this one, but it does end up feeling somewhat like a sequel, which definately doesn't help.There's a lot wrong with this film, but I think if it were restructured it could be good. It's got some entertaining things going on, it was worth a watch, but the execution was poor and they should be able to do better.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The character hasn't evolved at all.King Shark should be a great source of jokes, but he mostly just shuffles around grunting like Sylvester Stallone who provides the voice. It's actually Polka Dot Man who provides the biggest dose of humour.The soundtrack and the director's use of 'cue cards' were overdone IMO.

Could be because the previous Suicide Squad was so bad. I enjoyed the rivalry between Peacemaker and Bloodsport. Unfortunately I believe Idris Elba played this character all wrong. Weasel was an enjoyable character and I think Rat Catcher 2 really held the team together as its' heart. I did not find King Shark as humorous as many did but enjoyed him during the pre-climax climax (if you watch the movie then you will know what I mean). Viola Davis nailed it as Amanda Waller. I could just visualize her in the comic every time she was on the screen. Harley's character was given abilities that she does not possess which detracted from my immersion into the movie. Apparently she now has super strength, is as good a 'marksperson' as dead shot, as deadly as Lady Shiva and has the healing powers of Wolverine. Harley was a psychiatrist who happened to lose her marbles treating the Joker. This, plus a story almost as weak as the first, is the reason for my rating.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

After watching, I wanted the time back as it was a complete waste. DCU is a mess with no end in sight. There is so much material to utilize and many capable people to use to write, direct, and act. However, it is a cluster each time. Harley Quinn was/is cast perfectly. It ends there. Save your time and stay away.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

And even if the comical situations and the humor feel forced at times, it still makes a really enjoyable experience once you make amends with the idea that nothing in the film is gonna follow a coherent script. Some scenes like the initial landing or the assault on the camp are as absurd as they're hilarious. The jokes and dialogue leave a bit to be desired, but in most cases they're not terribly out of place (except for the overuse of some of the comical elements).Visually and acting wise the much better sequel to the terrible first Suicide Squad appearance on the big screen is not bad either. The visual effects feel too lazy at times, making it look like you are watching an indie flick with a slightly better budget, but fit the overall feel of the movie and the acting is good enough for a movie of its kind. It even sparkles at times with its cinematography and some interesting takes and camera angles when they're not trying to overdo it.But it's on its story structure that 'The suicide squad' fails more noticeably. Nobody expects a great story or a perfectly polished script from an anti-hero movie. But so many scenes and subplots -and even characters- feel so unnecessary and out of touch with the main story it feels like watching four different movies that aren't related to one another. Harley's whole ordeal with the dictator -and almost Harley's entire story arc-, the whole resistance militia group subplot that has no impact whatsoever on the story, the Polka-Dot-Man (or whatever) mommy issues... There are plenty of moments taking up too much runtime that do nothing for the film but take you out of the main thread of the story -which doesn't have a satisfactory ending itself either-. In the end 'The suicide squad' is a bag of mixed puzzle pieces that fail to connect with each other to form a whole picture.James Gunn's take on the franchise is definitely a huge improvement from the forgettable first instalment, but wasted to much time trying to be funny and too little making the film go in the right direction.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The rest are awful and possibly the worst characters to ever grace any superhero movie.The script is dire and hardly funny at all. It leads to possibly something that is just ridiculous and stupid. It's like the film maker is actually laughing at the audience for making such a duff film.Not sure on what basis Peacemaker deserved his own spin off and even continue in the new DCU.It clear Gunn has a set template for his films and this is just a bad copy of GOTG. Clearly Gunn is a one trick pony and this doesn't bode well for what he intends to do with the new DCU and god forbid Superman:Legacy.WBD clearly has high hopes for Gunn, but if this is the best they can do (not sure on why the reviews were good) then the future doesn't look bright. Especially as this was a big bomb at the B. O.For all it's faults, Suicide Squad is a million times better than this junk, with much better characters and storyline. Let's hope WBD releases the Ayer cut which no doubt will blow this piece of rubbish out of the water.

But that's just not enough. The cheesy factor is just too high. You've got an anthropomorphic shark and an anthropomorphic weasel and a giant starfish from outer space. Then you have a guy who can remove his own arms and send them on ahead, floating through the air. Sorry, but there's only just so much suspension of disbelief I can muster.John Cena should have stuck to wrestling, because he can't act. Fortunately, most of the bad actors in this movie died very early on, but unfortunately, Cena was a central character throughout the whole thing. And there was so much interaction between Cena and Idris Elba that it made Idris seem like a bad actor as well, because he had to come down to Cena's level. Daniela Melchior was one of the best actors in the movie, and she was only 24 years old, and had only been in 5 TV series and 2 movies before doing this one. And this was her first English-speaking role. Margot Robbie was still great as Harley Quinn, but the special effects they added in her fight scenes were ridiculous. And of course, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller still makes me want to hit her over the head with a golf club, but I can't fault Davis for that, since that's the effect her character is supposed to have on you.All in all, this is one of those rare movies that I wish I could UN-watch.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The superheroes aren't as cool, the jokes don't hit as hard, and the story is frankly boring. Characters like John Cena's Peacemaker fall on the wrong side of corny. The soundtrack is one redeeming feature but it's a struggle to think of any more.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can't really say that it's better than the original... which I personally didn't dislike as much as some. Because it had a few things that probably shouldn't be mentioned on IMDB. And some soul. And some coherency. Yeah, imagine that. And it had much better action. Like damn, it really says something about the regress of DCU when you find positive memories about some of their worst movies after watching their reboots. Yes, the Josstice League was better than the Snyder Cut, as far as actually making a coherent and enjoyable 2 hour flick goes. And so was the original Suicide Squad... better in some ways than this... Pfft, I don't know. It's like a Deadpool 3, but without any substance. You can't really latch onto anything. Except for the jokes about american war crimes, their... N-word(the four letter one) foreign policy and the punchline of restoring democracy.The movie goes for almost two hours and, damn, you really feel those two hours. It starts nowhere, it has no build-up, no development, because... I guess it's assumed that everyone has watched the original and we don't need to kill Batman's parents for the hundredth time, figuratively speaking. In fact, the opening part of the movie is literally a waste of time. Instead of at least trying to build up the story, they just give you trailer material right away as if you had ADD and needed to quickly be occupied with action, if you could call it that.And, speaking of democracy - that plot line is totally worthless. Just a punchline for a joke. And Alice Braga's character is... well, rather insulting. Why was it included? The democracy fighters really, ""really"" have no impact on the plot. It's like... a mandatory backdrop to rather... like I said - criminal foreign policy activities that are being conducted. Except for these crimes are turned into a joke. And I won't even mention John Cena's character.I can't deny that the core of the actors did their job, because... well, they're actors. Robbie, Elba, Davis - they did their best to outdo Ryan Reynolds. But even 3v1 this is a lost battle, come on guys. The antagonists were not even joke-worthy. I suppose I have to commend Daniela Melchior, she was cute af. So cute that Robbie felt rather... plain in comparison. I have said it about the trailer and I do not stand corrected - Robbie has exhausted herself as Harley Queen. She is a good actress, and she can portray HQ, but... Let's be honest here, if you want to watch movies for Robbie - go zip your pants and drink some water. At least the King Shark was fun, Gunn employed yet another stale celebrity to voice a dumb character for meme value. And he's good at that, no complaints. Oh and David Dastmalchian really shined here. He looked and felt like he... actually had to play a part in this movie. Ew.Finally - I'd like to talk about the action. It's terrible. It's actually surprisingly terrible. Remember how you were cringing at the opening helicopter nonsense from the original Suicide Squad? Well, prepare to cringe for almost two hours, because... Either the action is joke for the sake joke, or it's a slapstick homage to better movies. I don't mind joke action, but it has to be about the characters. And, ironically, only the secondary characters had any form of relevant action. Now, some might say that ""Robbie killed"" in this one, but I will repeat what I said before. And I would like to remind people that she is supposed to wield a hammer. She is not John Wick. She is not John Rambo. She's agile, useless and good with a hammer. That's it. Making her a Mary Sue doesn't mean that she good. It means, again, that the writers didn't know what to do with her. Again, if not for the secondary characters, I'd dare say that this movie had PG13 violence.So... it's a bad attempt at Deadpool, a bad attempt at fixing Suicide Squad and it has politics. It starts nowhere... and goes nowhere. That's DCU for you...","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was no warning about the gore in this movie. It was Unnecessarily graphic and it showed closeups of people exploding and heads being sliced in half. Not to add the amount of animal cruelty in this movie is through the roof. I absolutely loved the first suicide squad, and was so excited to see this one. Now that i have seen it, i wish i hadn't. Usually i am fine with gore, but this went too far. I will say it had a good plot, however i would not recommend this to anyone.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

There's little to no character development or backstory and not much plot setup, so you're not attached to any of the characters and you're not invested in the mission they're going on. Scenes jump around too much and felt scatterbrained at times. The jokes consistently missed for me. The sound track didn't work for me either. The gore and the foul language were excessive and felt more forced than elements to complement the story. It's like a Guardians of the Galaxy meets The Boys, so you have this movie being some weird kind of hybrid of the two, with aliens and bright colors, trying to tell jokes while still looking all dark and grungy, swearing and blowing people's heads off.

The acting is really bad.

Just a series of events and silly delusions to spend more than 2 hours of your precious life.I've raised my vote by one just because it's slightly better than the version of 2016 and because of some good gore/bloody (R rated) parts.And last but not least:

Margot Robbie's performance (the highlight of the previous incarnation of the suicide squad) was lackluster, but still fairly entertaining.Pacing is a bit scattered.I'm ambivalent toward the excessive gore (a la ""The Boys"" or ""Watchmen""), it was funny at moments but felt like filler most of the time. It was so campy and over the top, that it felt like it wasn't supposed to do anything other than make you say gross and/or laugh.Style wise the best part of the flick was Polka Dot Man, without those splashes of color it would have barely clocked in a step above the typical, bleak DC movie color wheel.Overall glad I saw it for free on HBO. Closer to the mark they need to reach to compete with Marvel (helps they had a Marvel director while he was temporarily laid off) but still a long way away.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I just didnt like it. I think it does get better towards the final act, but just right off the bat there was nothing likable about the film. I didnt find it funny. Most of the ""jokes"" are just making the characters total idiots. Even Waller who is supposed to be the big brains of the operation is treated like an idiot. Some people may love the gore, and thats fine. Im no stranger to gory films either...but I cant say that even that is done well. It's relies way too much on CGI. They have this random B plot with Harley Quinn during the middle portion of the film that absolutely goes nowhere and has no real purpose except to pad the runtime. And barely any of the characters are likable/fun. I only really cared for Ratcatcher 2, Polka Dot Man and King Shark. Even Harley, who I liked in the first one was kind of grating on my nerves in this movie.The movie does have some really cool stylized shots and cinematography as well as a good soundtrack, I'll give it that. And as I mentioned I did like the above mentioned characters and the majority of their scenes. But otherwise the film just feels messy to me. To me it seems like James Gunn was more focused on shock value than anything else.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

But letting Gunn have freedom was like letting a toddler have sharpies on a new painted wall.I would have marked this lower, but there were some redeemable parts. Harley Quinn was good, the intro was good. It was funny to see bloody body's ripped apart or shot to start with, but after two hours of the same thing it gets tiresome.I won't spoil the plot, but it becomes like a lovechild of the expendables and Doctor who. Which is fine, if it wasn't the suicide squad. It lacked darkness and spite, instead was trying to hard to be funny whilst blowing people's limbs apart.I came out of the cinema not really knowing what Gunn was trying to do.Plenty of people have enjoyed it, and that shows the film was aimed for mass appeal which maybe is what the studio wanted. But for me, I will never watch another one of this new Disney wannabe DC drivel.Many will disagree, but I am now going to watch the Ayer version and appreciate what we had before Gunn got hold of it. But I don't blame Gunn:

At minimum, this film desensitizes viewers to graphic massacres & murders, a trait no great society needs not desires.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

The stupidest movie I've seen, the plot is so CLICHÉ, it has the MOST PREDICTABLE AND DUMBEST scenes in cinema history, the plot is nothing new, we've seen this million of times before, the typical story and Hollywood formula,
the only good thing in the movie was the adorable rat (so cute) and sexy Joel Kinnaman.The best characters that were promoted in the trailers are only in the first minutes, then they never show up again. A COMPLETE SCAM.The main villain/monster of the movie is THE DUMBEST VILLAIN ever, it's a joke, like literally, who wrote this??? My 4 years old
brother???The thinker is the stupidest man in the world, when the original character is totally the opposite, in the comics he's so smart that he can predict every
move and future event, here he just had screws in his head as an ornament, no powers or skills at all.Harley quinn is basically useless, it's there for nothing, just like
in the first one, she's too weak and has no powers so I don't know why she's still in movies, comics and cartoons,
the most deplorable and useless character ever created.King shark should have been called KING SHORT, cause it was like a dwarf, and weak, when in the comics, it is strong, tall, giant, powerful.And the rest of the characters were like meh, many explosions, some dumb fights, dumb script. Yeah it's gonna be a huge SUCCESS, people love these kind of dumb movies with million of bugs.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

The first one was okay, I enjoyed it but it wasn't ground-breaking. This was ground-breaking for all the wrong reasons. The plot line is disgustingly shallow and it's generous to even call it a plot 'line'. It's real more of a ball of screwed up, cut off, messy plot strings knotted together.None of the character are likeable, aside from Ratcatcher and Bloodsport. Most of the famous faces we were lured in with were simple 1-2min cameos. Harley Quinn was more or less just borrowed to draw in views, and did literally nothing AT ALL to contribute to the plot. Literally NOTHING. If you took her out, it would be the exact same spare a few cheap Harley Quinn themed fight scenes with more plot irrelevant minor antagonists.And the main villain? A giant starfish? Really? Why? Why did you make this film? Why did anybody ever agree to be involved in this project. Hands down, the worst film I've ever laid eyes on.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I understand that this movie should be held in it's own light and not critiqued with the past movies in mind, but you'll have to forgive me, I've spent a very long time being dedicated to a studio that keeps ignoring the expectations they set. I simply can't watch a DCEU film without expecting to see some positive acknowledgement of the foundation they've already laid... On it's own, it's wild, adventurous and pretty fun.

I don't know why she's in the movie, whether it's to do with some contract with WB, or they really thought that she could add anything to the movie itself. Now, mind you, I don't think the actor is bad, but the character herself is one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of seeing on the big screen.Early on the movie, Harley is separated from the main group of protagonists and is taken hostage. From there on, we follow a quirky, yet grounded enough group of people (+1) facing the challenges of completing the suicide mission they are given. Along the way, we find out more about the characters and their backstories, and I'll give it to the movie, they are pretty likeable. There's some action, some drama, some comedy, all in a mostly well-blended mix (though IMO, the comedy bits are a bit too much and too frequent, I feel it really clashes and takes away from the gritty and dark themes explored in the movie). But just when the ball really gets rolling, we cut away to the aforementioned Harley. Who, after being captured, is dolled-up, adorned with beautiful clothes and pampered like royalty, has the time of her life, before being captured again and 'tortured' (aka lightly tickled with an electric rod) waltzes through dozens of armed and armored guards, murdering each with a smile on her lips and singing some random song.To summarize;The movie has some very good things going for it, exploring some serious and sensitive topics in a rough, but well-put way, with some good action, dialouge, and VFX to boot. But it's hindered by over-the-top, poorly timed comedy, some completely illogical things the characters do, and the addition of the mary-sue of the century, Harley Quinn, who adds precisely nothing to the movie itself.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It unoriginal, lacks any kind of character development, is slightly cruel in tone and lurches from one action set piece to some uncomfortable but necessary plot exposition and then to the next action sequence. That all said the dialogue is well above average and the performances by all the lead actors are terrific, worthy of a better film.Its not a bad film at all, and so much more involving that the first, but you do feel you've seen it all before. And it just gets dull after a while. I found myself getting bored at times, I'm not sure why but I think its because you just don't care about anything in the film, nothing or nobody it in matters, everyone is replaceable at any time.I also thought that in some of the action scenes it was hard to track what was going on, lucky we get so many time line flashbacks!Overall I kind of enjoyed it for the performances but I do think this kind of movie has been done to death now and really wish they would try to make more original films rather than these identikit franchise movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A lot of the characters felt underdeveloped to the point where you don't care what happens to them (similar to the first attempt) and this goes double for the villains. The thinker could have been anyone, his character played no part in his role in the movie. Ultimately some clunky pacing and forced banter left a bit of a sour taste. Most people are bored of the marvel formula, so yes they finally got it right in a DC movie (even down to the pointless spin-off advertisement post-credit scene), but it's too late and just felt a little too formulaic. It's nice that they fixed mistakes of the past and finally made a film that tonally hits the mark on what they've been aiming at with the last few releases, but it all just felt kind of pointless and didn't really take the franchise anywhere new. Just your average run of the mill super hero movie, minus the super heroes.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think I've seen a worse film, but I can't remember when. First was the lack of story line, it felt like they were grasping at something, but there was nothing there. Second the mass use of really poorly constructed characters, most of which used for cheap laughs. Third the monster they were fighting was terrible, and not really much of a story behind it. Plus they defeated it rather easily in the end. Lastly I think they need to give up, the last two movies with Harley Quinn in have been awful the character has been ruined, this is also the case for some of the other DC characters.This was the first time we had been to the cinema since lockdown and it was a massive disappointment, my girlfriend turned to me 45 mins in asking if we could leave, it was that bad.

At least it was true to the franchise; The sad thing is that the movie pretty much epitomizes modern American values and as Roger Waters warned us 20 years ago, we are increasingly getting closer to being amused to death.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

But, it sins with the cliches of the previous one (not to say that it is the same plot base), there is no interest in telling a story, because it only strives to show its attractiveness, violence and jokes (not bad, but it is too exploited nowadays), you are not interested in the characters because there is no exploration of them, the R classification, it is vulgarly executed, there is no maturity or density in the plot so that the (R) classification is fair, but it is the same exploitation of the R rating, as an adaptation to the comic because it is far away, as a general film because it is a common and current, Gunn knows how to make interesting characters (like Super 2010), but this is an abysmal setback, it is on the same level as the movie to Birds Of Prey, they both waste an interesting cast and characters, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the experience (just the popcorn), but no wonder it had lower support, much lower support, this is a lot of noise and little nuts.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The acting was mostly great; Harley Quinn is still my favorite, Bloodsport was gorgeous and funny, and Rat-catcher and the Shark thing were utterly charming... But the timing and delivery was way off, the plot felt rushed and poorly thought out, and why does James Gunn hate birds so much? Arbitrary violence and gore looked childish, like a teenager's first time using special effects. I mean, a huge starfish thing? Really?? Viola Davis' character makes me sad... She's a FABULOUS actress, but in both the first SS and this one she just comes off as bored. Monotone, very little facial expression, and her character manages to somehow have zero redeeming qualities while also not being nearly menacing enough to grab your attention.

I must declare though I thought Deadpool was rubbish too and a lot of people seemed to like that. So if you like the 'comedy' in Deadpool then you'll no doubt like this too. For me though, this film is all that is wrong with Hollywood today.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It felt to long really. Especially with the ""end person"". And there were alot of things that felt like they could have cut out. Some of the comedy sort of fell flat. It also tried to squeeze in some emotional moments like the last movie, but they felt out of place.The only reason I even have it was a 5 was King Shark, Quinn and Weasel.

It seems that somehow you love it or you hate it like it happened in other, not so far in time, hero movies from DC.The story goes forward and backwards several times, a move that not much people like, it seems that the director choose that roadmap in order to try to give continuous thrilling and action, and that don't work for me in that angle.Margot Robbie's acting is awesome, Idris Elba kicks the same ball, John Cena goes a step down together with Joel kinnaman (a character more guided like altered carbon would have been outstanding), and the rest... Oh boy the rest could be almost completely erased and then the story would be almost the same. Viola Davis is indisputable, she has the talent and has showed it thousand times but here, nothing even near an acceptable figure.The story has some huge and heavy problems, not only of continuity (see ticking lights of police prison transport when crashes and half a minute later for an example) but also on what is trying to go. I can't stop thinking that here the producers had the same problem that fast 9 had: a numerous sequence of action tied by nonsense and boring nothingness that has nothing to do with the line of the movie. Starts bad like a class b movie, at 5 minutes it goes down and after 15 minutes it looks even worse.The enemies: when fighting against normal soldiers, the soldier's IQ is near 0, they can't see any far that a meter of where they are, even in straight line! Not forgetting than their aim is somewhere between inconceivable and hilarious. The latins show less ambition, emotion and violence than any 5 year old child. And the main enemy, looks like he was cut out from Looney tunes.The thing is simple: If you like the first 15 minutes of movie then you'll like the rest of it, if you think that it's like a waste of time then don't expect better for the rest.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

A lot of f-bombs which might thrill the children, but only the most juvenile of adults will find any part of this wreckage amusing.

In the end, it passed 2 hours. I found myself a little bored in places, also the story line was dull! Very dull.Some of the acting was fine. Robbie was good as Harley but didn't have the impact on the film that she did in the first. Still her parts were some of the better sequences of the movie.Elba was OK as the leader. If you gave me the choice I would have taken Will Smith.All in all, I was a little disappointed. I think the first film was better!! Watch it, but don't get excited about it. You'll forget this film very very quickly.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm a fan of Marvel, DC, Archies Comics, anybody can get this love... AND hate. I was so excited for this and No doubt, there are some things that I loved about this movie such as Peacemaker, Polka Dot Man, kinda Harley Quinn, and Pete Davidson's character. Otherwise, this movie was terrible to story writing, characterization, and just directing in general. Idk what those critics are smoking.James Gunn clearly wanted to show off some beautiful visual effects that had no substantial impact on scenes whatsoever. So many scenes in general lacked depth & substance, so I didnt care about multiple scenes. Is Amanda Waller a joke to y'all? This was just a corny Marvelesque movie in the worst way. This movie carried no weight and had no power system structure so basically anybody could up each other or die in the most dumb or unrealistic way. If you're gonna give your characters paper thin characterization or kill them off carelessly, then don't develop them with lame things like unconvincing daddy daughter issues.I'm so upset. The humor in this was clearly prioritized but in the worst way. I freaking love me some vulgar male part jokes, but I don't think I laughed at a single one. The suicide squads humor comes from them as people just being a joke. So they have to think of lame jokes to make them seem funny and endearing.Straight up I'm convinced this movie was catered for John Cena/Peacemaker so they could drop his TV show on HBOmax.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

My kids even loved the first one. My kids were so excited to watch this one and about 10 minutes in we had to tell them they couldn't watch it. This is not family friendly at all. This was super violent...which I don't entirely mind. What I do mind is every single character having to throw the f bomb around every other word.The story line was all over the place. It was so bizarre. I was so disappointed with this movie. We were so excited to watch it. While my husband and older son thought it was fine (they mostly loved all the ridiculous amount of violence). They agree it was just okay.Originally I was very upset that Will Smith didn't reprise his role. After seeing this movie, I am so glad he didn't. I would have been disappointed in him had he been in this. While I usually love Idris Elba, I hated his character. He was definitely no Will Smith. He too had a daughter, but he hated her. They tried to make you think she was proud of him, but it felt forced. She hated her dad more than he hated her. I understand these are bad guys, but there was no real redeeming quality in him.

What a shame!Almost every one loves to see Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn but I'm sure most of us pissed off her over-usage in DC movies. Harley Quinn isn't a big villain in DC universe, never was. Also she's not a hero nor a noteworthy anti-hero, never was. But yes, she's a woman and as everyone knows, Hollywood prefers to show us powerful woman characters recently. Unfortunately, an overpowered and invincible Harley Quinn just doesn't fit the nature of DC comics.The Suicide Squad is just another terrible DC movie which you wish you didn't watched. They've failed at all aspects and it seems they destroyed Suicide Squad for good. I hope they will find a better approach and at least, return to the roots of Dark Knight trilogy of Christopher Nolan for next DC movies.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Save your money and time and do something, anything, else.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, the movie is disappointing. The first half is a mess and gets better near the end. There are some really good moments and sequences. But overall the movie feels superficial, hollow, forced, and disjoint, from the start till the end. At many points, one can clearly see misfit/out-of-place dialogues and scenes, which were made specifically for the trailer and then the makers failed to organically splice them into the rest of the movie. Why the Squad members start caring for each other so much (except Harley and Flag) remained a mystery to me (or might be it was all rushed and doesn't connect). The cuts at several places look disjoint and abrupt, and makes you wonder if the director (or anyone else) even watched the movie after the final edit. And to make it worse, the humor falls flat half the time. The movie is quite derivative too. It strongly reminds you of Deadpool-2, The Boys, and (maybe it's just me) Taika's Hulk.The best movie so far in DCEU is the Snyder Cut. And at the very bottom, there is the infamous Whedon's JL, Suicide Squad-1, and WW-2. This Suicide Squad can be ranked above the latter, ranked alongside Shazam, but
definitely far below Man of Steel, BvS, WW1, and Aquaman.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first Guardians are one of my favourite films. But this was a huge let down and I don't get the positive reviews.The whole movie gives a WTF did I just watch feeling and not in a good way. It just feels nonsense (i.e. The president's plot...) and also there is a lot of gore - not just bloody but gross.With that, watching the movie - although action packed, at times funny (but rarely really funny) and with good CGI - feels like a waste of time. What could be a fun experience, turned out to be an over the top class B type movie (which might sound like fun but somehow isn't as much).What are the positives? Some visuals and action scenes are cool. Ebra is a very charismatic actor. Music is nice, but not Guardians level great. Plus like I said, sometimes funny and with good CGI.But all in all not a good movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There's violence for the sake of violence and its not stylized like Tarentino, it's gratuitous. Harley Quinn gets her own movie inside this movie and literally put me to sleep, but I confess I hate her character without Joker (not the actress).

(Watching on HBO Max.)Nope, it's pretty much what I expected. The fact that it got some positive hype made it sting a bit more when they tricked me into watching another Suicide Squad movie.I feel like DC has had so many misses, that if a film doesn't come off as ""bad"" people act like it's award winning.Suicide Squad is a middle of the road action film, that runs LONG, has tons of pacing issues and lots of cringey, juvenile humor that falls flat most of the time. It's not necessarily ""bad"", it's just not good.I think James Gunn caught lightning in a bottle with Guardians of the Galaxy 1, and people really love a redemption story.

This film reads like it was written by a committee of 12 year old boys, in all of its immature glory. I don't think personally that there is anything wrong with films like this occasionally, but the film industry is now completely dominated by this sort of inanely childish ""content"" (because that is what this was, this was not a film).The cast was fairly likeable when they where given something to do, but the only character that had any sort of real arc was the daughter of Bloodsport (who had all of two minutes of screen time). Polka Dot Man was easily the most interesting on screen, but of course Gunn's need to shovel in as many pointless ""expectation subversions"" left me rolling my eyes during ""that"" moment.Even despite the occasional fun and gonzo creative moments, a lot of the humour just absolutely did not land. A lot of that had to do with how adolescent the jokes where, and how the entire thing felt like it was trying too hard. I'm not a Marvel fan in the slightest, and I appreciate that DC is following the beat of its own drum, but this just didn't work for me.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

DC has been characterized by making real garbage destroying the reputation of characters who were designed in the same way: all shady, traumatized and with severe internal weaknesses (except Shazam). Here we see a series of characters with extreme abilities except the ex-girlfriend of the Joker who instead of using a stick uses a javelin as a weapon and has as much or better aim than Bloodsport or Peacemaker. There is an adequate choice of characters and it is obvious that the protagonist is carried out by those who impose trends in clothing or makeup (things that men do not care at all). Even so, and despite these concessions, it is entertaining and can be seen despite exceeding two hours.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Both were produced by DC. DC Comics doesn't come close to Marvel Comics. DC is the Mad magazine of comic book world: GROSS. // SS is about releasing from prison, a bunch of WEIRD superpower villains, to form a team to save the world. Yes. It's the Magnificent Seven, reborn, but revolting and nauseating . . if you don't like blood, hamburger, gore, people being eaten, exploding heads, etc., you ain't gonna like this movie. There's a scene where a guy's head is cut off, and 2 minutes later, a songbird is pecking at his severed neck, and eating bits of his flesh. It makes me sick to my stomach even writing this. And, hated the life sucking giant starfish as a nemesis. God help me . . I must be getting numb to all this, but I still kinda like the movie. // I loved the actors and their characters. Idris Elba is great. John Cena was comic relief, and very pumped. Margot Robbie steals the show. // The sound is awful. The voices are boomy, muffled, and garbled with thick accents. I couldn't understand what half of the people were saying. I missed half the dialogue and lost the flow. I kept thinking, it will get better, so I didn't turn on captioning, until it was too late. Told myself, I will watch it again. // The photography is actually kind of artistic and beautiful in half the scenes. In others, it is dark, hazy, colors gone crazy, and pretty bad. It's a mixed bag. The music is pretty good. I did like that! LOL // I can't speak about the plot and story, because I never did figure out what was going on.

What I did like was the realism of the gore, that was a nice change of pace for the DCEU, what I didn't like was the rest of the movie.When comparing Marvel and DC, Kevin Feige to Zach Snyder, Marvel is winning this race IMO. It just seems since Chris Nolan left DC there has only been flop after flop, with a few noteable exceptions: WW, Aquaman and Zach Snyder's Justice league. I'm a DC fan, more so than a Marvel fan, but this mediocre movie trend has got to stop.I really hope that the Dark Knight trilogy wasn't the high light of the DCEU. I mean, James Gunn is amazing, but come on, I don't believe anyone really would say this movie has rewatch ability.In closing, hero's are only as good as their villains, and DC had an opportunity to really make a great movie, but instead made another green lantern-esque flop. The ratings will drop in a week or so, people are just so beat down from COVID, that the first morsel of escape we collapsed on, like a dry sponge to water.

It definitely tries it's hardest to not be it's predecessor. It has a lot of genuine moments between characters as they explore their nature and true characters. As always, I enjoy Gunn's exploration of lesser used or known comic characters. For me it just felt a tad too long, frenzied and disjointed towards the end. There was some cringeworthy and just flat out odd moments. The use of sometimes laughable gore felt more like they just did it just to prove that they could. It feels like another slightly confused DC joint. Put up with the other DC Extended Universe offerings doesn't help me understand what the ""DCEU"" is trying to be. It does make me wonder what Ayer's untampered movie would have been like.

Same premise: a group of psychopathic inmates are chosen by a secret government agency for a high-risk secret suicide mission.The previous film wasn't anything special, but at least it had a more or less defined structure and kind of balanced, neither too stupid nor too serious. Now this one raises the bar for stupidity to a new level of stupid with finesse for the gore and the gross. There are so many superheroes and anti-heroes and so many villains coming and going and being dispatched that none of them ends up being relevant or revealing charisma, as charisma is built with time and actions to demonstrate it. Super powers are stupid and childish. None of the ""heroes"" is ever in danger of life, as they can face everything and everyone alone. So why send a team if only one can handle the job? The power to control rats is so superior that they didn't even need a two-hour movie but a short one of 15 minutes at most. As I write this review, I see that the film is even worse than I thought. But hey!, it's very colorful like a big circus full of painted clowns and balloons of all colors, so I have to like it, right?","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I didn't really know what was going on at some point. I barely grasped onto the storyline but i believe it was the first of it's type as the story line unfolded in a unique manner, that of which I have personally never seen on screen. I may be slightly overzealous with my review but I do believe they could have done a greater job with the production. Otherwise, the directing of the movie was first class as I believe that is what saved the movie. Some of the powers were ridiculous e.g. Polkadot man, kind of left me in limbo in combination with the costumes some of the characters wore as well as the star fish and the shark out of water which just left me in awe of the imaginative creativity of writer of the script. However, I did not feel fit into the dynamic of the suicide squad. A parasite would've made more sense maybe an alligator or crocodile rather than a shark but that's just me. Otherwise, beside the random scenes and the unexpected surprised the story line unravelled well in relation to the unique approach utilised to introduce the story line.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

King shark was built up as a cross between the hulk and Drax but dropped very short of being funny. Harley Quinn felt misused and treated as a side show, a great actress and character but jumped from javelin to Rick flag to one of the big bads. She fell back into the old ""lady needs a man "" trope which was extremely disappointing after her stand out performance in the first film and the character building in birds of prey. She could have been missing from the film completely and no one would have noticed. On that topic, random busty secretary character was an odd addition to the film. Idris Elba is a great replacement for Will Smith as the criminal team leader and the peacemaker suprised as a good character with the most humorous lines and scenes. Suprised by some deaths of main characters and Rick Flag very poorly used and sidelined. More suitable storyline than the first, but not a major improvement as promised.","1 out of 15 found this helpful.

Sylvester Stallone plays a fricking shark for God's sake! And it's a good job that John Cena is hot from the neck down, because he's got nothing else going for him. Why would they give him his own TV series based on this?The only characters that I do like are Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, she's a stone cold b!tch and very good at it, and Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie, there is something endearing and charming about her that I can't put my finger on. Maybe she is what I would be, if I actually did what the voices told me to, so I recognise something in her portrayal?Idris Elba (Bloodsport) kind of holds it all together and the focus is definitely on him. His character is fairly good too, but it doesn't really show us anything particularly new from him or from any comic book film or character either.Colonel Flag doesn't have any power at all as the government man in charge and Joel Kinnaman has no presence playing him either. I don't know if this is how it is in the comics, because I've never read any DC.Sebastian The Rat on the other hand is a superb actor and probably steals the whole film. It must have been a great honour for them all to work with him.It's a shame that he is let down by the terrible puns and nonsense.If you can get passed the first five minutes of slapping your hand to your face and hiding your eyes, because it's all just so bizarre, there is a certain something that compels you to watch further and you can just resign yourself to the fact that it's one of ""Those"" films.It is probably better than the first (Suicide Squad (2016)), purely because it is so notably bizarre and it feels more like there is a story to it, but it is also just gruesome for the sake of it, with explosions and destruction that are, at times, solely to tick off the action film requirements.It is vaguely enjoyable in a very strange way and Sly's shark is probably the best acting I've seen from him ever, but it is also quite embarrassing. I can't count the times that I cringed and shielded my face from the awfulness of this film. In particular when 'The Thinker' turned up. Peter Capaldi was a 'Doctor Who' for fox sake. Why would he give that up to do things like this? He literally has weird things sticking out of his bald head and acts like a complete freak!And Michael Rooker who has never been particularly attractive to me, looks worse than ever, having borrowed Christopher Lee's 'Saruman' wig.And don't even get me started on ""The Detachable Kid"" or the Polka Dot Man.Seriously though, how high were they all when they made this?I suppose that the special effects are pretty good, but they were so ""Comic Book"" and off the wall that it's difficult to tell for sure. And what was really weird was that my 72 year old mother seemed to enjoy it.Towards the end it becomes a bit like an episode of 'SpongeBob SquarePants' (1999) where Patrick gets mad.Was their something in my drink or did this all really happen on film?452.33/1000.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A one star review is for Birdemic and Justice League (2017). A two star movie has at least good production quality to it. The third star is for Margot Robbie's performance. There is very little to consider after the runtime of the movie.On the positive side, I liked the portrayal of the Ratcatcher 2 as a compassionate outcast. I am unfamiliar with the comic version. Above all, I thought Robbie's acting was excellent as Harley Quinn. She changed pose with fluid economy. There were micro-movements you would see for a split second. She used her whole body in the acting, and it helped make the character.There was a certain perspective brought by the Peacemaker late in the movie that was interesting. It could be, and probably is, the premise for other stories.Apart from those, it is a bland action movie that seems to be accepted as art for its desultory presentation of gore and suffering. At least it reminded the viewer that coups can only happen with cruel generales and Bond-villain quantities of mooks.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

After getting green lights from several sources that I trust and I heard positive thoughts about characters of the movie -- I decided reserve seat and grab some popcorn since (what a heck) it's been a while since I've enjoyed cinema. As I've been experiencing bunch of underwhelming and disposable superhero movies lately this almost like sparked my brain little bit. (Maybe I will enjoy a DECENT superhero movie again!?)And it was enjoyable. Characters had depth and they did meaningful actions which were not braindead. Simply I cared about what decisions the characters made and I was carried away how some of the jokes were actually funny. The chemistry between the squad felt also believeable and world building made sense lots of times. But then the plot let me baffled quite often and the ridiculuos plotarmor with the characters felt really forced (like it seems to be with many titles nowadays) to create these ""cool"" scenes. A scene should make sense more than look cool. I did not mind the limited nature of the worldbuilding --- not having dc superheroes there made actually little bit sense when you take into consideration the black ops feel of the mission. In overall I enjoyed movie, bunch of good characters, good comedy even though in many cases plot is quite shallow.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

That's it. That's really the only positive thing about this whole movie. Margot Robbie was meh, and even Idris Elba couldn't save it from being a complete waste of time to watch. It's like the producers, directors, and writers tried so hard to make it... something. But what? It failed on almost every level possible.The action was pointless, predictable and utterly, extremely, super, ultra, mega, über exaggerated - just like the string of adjectives I used - even in a genre that's known for those things. I watch almost every superhero/supervillain movie, too. So it's not the genre I dislike. It's just this film. The characters had no development whatsoever, and they ended up being more like caricatures of characters. The chapter titles were supposed to be cool and clever, but they were just distracting and only served to remind me how horrible this film was. I even fell asleep watching it the first time. Thinking I was just tired the first night, I re-watched it from the beginning the next night, and it was still just as uninteresting.This movie's special effects were decent I suppose. But these days, shiny special effects are commonplace, and by itself that's only enough to satisfy the least discerning viewers, aka the dumbed-down masses. (Judging by the inflated rating, there are plenty of those people out there, though.) Overall, the film was simply bad. Yet, sadly, it wasn't intentionally bad in the way that a pure comedy works as a spoof or a humorous take on a genre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So I was pumped when I started the movie. 15minutes goes by and Weasel drowns and you think hes going to be saved by white hair dude maybe one of those scenes where someone has to give a foul mouthed creature mouth to mouth at the same time getting blasted with nasty rodent breath or something. And no he just dies? The 1 min after pete davidson's character is a wimpy traitor and his face gets shredded, then next to go is detachable armed nathon fillion with no real dialog given to him and a pansy death. You would think they would use detachable arms throught out the move for comedy purposes but they don't use them at all. Last but not least guardians of the galaxy actor Xanadu gets the worst roll after helping to make james guns reputation these days his character was unspeakably stupid. At the beginning you were led to believe that he is a crazy kick a** machine and instead hes the biggest wimp and gets his head blown to bits. So at about the 30 minute mark literally every ounce of comedy that could've been pumped into the movie was dead I did not understand this choice at all it makes no sense to me. But it is hard to be as bad as the first suicide squad I'll give it that.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

All this, however, if it matters, it is small.The plot, which essentially boils down to just one - not particularly suicidal - mission, begins by creating a villain from scratch (if there were no idea with a detachment of villains, there would be no problem), and then markedly tramples on a rake.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We don't have too many contenders, but suffice it to say that I think this is much better than the bland Black Widow, and it goes toe-to-toe with the Snyder Cut version of The Justice League. Compared to previous flops such as the shameful Wonder Woman 1984, this is the best Warner DC released in years.DC should focus more on rated-R movies like this. Even though it's rated R, I didn't feel uncomfortable during the entire film. The gory sequences are not nearly as intense as those in any 10-year-old first-person shooter game. It's good enough for any modern teenager to consider just plain average.James Gunn did it again. I like his cinematography style, the editing, and how he blends pop songs into his shots. Each shot feels like just out of a good music video. In terms of production value, this is the whole package.Unfortunately, this movie fails further scrutiny. At this point, I hope people stop trying to make The Suicide Squad work on the big screen. A rag-tag team of dozens of people could work better in such a short amount of time. They need more time to breathe and for each individual story to grow. Every time, we get one or two characters with a proper arc, and everybody else serves as cannon fodder.Harley Quinn is one example. I don't understand her character, her motivations, or what she is pursuing. Although she has some of the best and most memorable action sequences, they don't add anything to the overall story. They're just there for show.Clearly, Gunn wants us to focus on Idris Elba's Bloodsport and a bit on John Cena's Peacemaker, and that's it. Even the Ratcatcher chick is nothing more than a gimmick, a plot device, with no proper arc. It's the same for the Polka Dot guy and the Nanaue Shark thing. They're just there as plot devices, so we never care an ounce about them.Out of all the bunch, it's Peacemaker I want to see more of. Bloodsport spends the whole movie holding back, and when he finally breaks free, it's not much. They could've been perfect foils for one another, but halfway through the movie, they part ways, and when they converge, it's very unsatisfying.This movie is good for the visuals, sound effects, and music alone, but better, tighter screenwriting would have helped. I don't get the point of the movie. It goes from nowhere to nowhere.Shout out to Viola Davis' Amanda Waller. She is in her own league. It's, too. The movie needs to explore her character more, and she is being relegated to not much more than an exposition device. But the few scenes she's in, it's powerful stuff. I love it.Overall, the movie is too long, most of the characters are not well used, the plot is fragile, and it isn't easy to be invested in the story or the characters.

The film, while aspiring to deliver a darkly comedic and action-packed narrative, regrettably falls into an abyss of cinematic disarray, serving as a stark example of how not to craft a sequel. It's a film that, quite frankly, challenges the viewer's patience and discernment, raising questions about its foundational intent and cinematic value.Narrative and Direction:
The film attempts to navigate through a labyrinthine plot with an ensemble of characters, each with their own convoluted backstories and motivations. However, this ambition is its undoing. The narrative is cluttered and unfocused, leading to a viewing experience that is as perplexing as it is unsatisfying. The direction fails to salvage coherence from the chaos, leaving the audience adrift in a sea of unmet potential and misplaced comedic efforts.Character Development and Performance:
Character development in ""Suicide Squad 2"" is woefully neglected. The film squanders the opportunity to explore the depth and complexity of its characters, instead relegating them to caricatures without meaningful arcs or growth. The performances, while potentially constrained by the script, are unable to inject the necessary gravitas or empathy to elevate the material, resulting in a disconnect between the audience and the on-screen personas.Visuals and Aesthetic:
While the film does offer moments of visual spectacle, these instances feel disjointed from the overall narrative, serving more as distractions than as contributions to the story. The special effects and action sequences, though technically proficient, cannot compensate for the fundamental flaws in storytelling and character development.Overall Assessment:
""Suicide Squad 2"" is a film best avoided, offering little in the way of entertainment or artistic merit. It stands as a cautionary tale of a sequel that not only fails to surpass its predecessor but also significantly detracts from the potential of its premise. The movie's attempt at blending dark comedy with action and character-driven drama results in a disorienting and unsatisfactory experience. It is a film that, unfortunately, might only be recommended as a dubious jest, for it is so far removed from the standards of quality cinema that it might inadvertently become a case study in how not to make a sequel.In essence, ""Suicide Squad 2"" is not merely a disappointment; it is a cinematic endeavor that should be bypassed in favor of more coherent and rewarding viewing experiences. The film's failure to deliver on any of its promised intrigue or excitement solidifies its status as a regrettable chapter in the superhero genre.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's funny because he didn't intend to blow the young guy's head off in the back seat. Viewers see the full frame by frame of the guy's head bursting open and his brains on the back windshield. It's both a horror and played for laughs. Suicide Squad (2021) is a lot like watching this Pulp Fiction scene played over and over.For me, the movie was heavy, a slog. No interesting set-ups or dialogue. Is part of the fun that they weren't really trying? For villains, a cigar smoking Cuban? A killer starfish? And I got no chuckles out of the shark suit. High point (I thought) was Idris Elba and his daughter screaming at each other in the opening scenes, after that it got less interesting. Viola Davis' natural hair was a nice touch. She had gravitas. The female character fighting her way out of torture, not needing a recue wasn't so funny. I found no sense of fun in the relentless violence. As criticism of America, that we are overfed, clueless brutes tainted by corruption it makes a certain kind of sense. It could be that I'm too sensitive for blood sport. Yet I can appreciate humor and didn't find it. I left 30 minutes before the end, feeling punished, worn out.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Must be paid reviewers and bots.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
