No, unfortunately not. Is it another watchable, fun superhero movie; yes, definitely. It's a really good movie and if we look at the way Alan Taylor directs this movie, it's actually not that much different from what Branagh did back in 2011. Chris Hemsworth is good as usual and Tom Hiddleston is more wonderful than ever as Loki, but the villain Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of motivation.","41 out of 66 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A good entry into the Marvel Universe","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2896320/?ref_=tt_urv","kuuk3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8378692/?ref_=tt_urv","29 October 2013","Having just watched a premier screening, I am delighted to come away from the cinema to write a positive review. Thor Dark World is a spectacular special effect driven film, much of which is set in Asguard.I was worried that including Loki yet again might become a little repetitive, but in this film he excels as a great character, I only hope however that they don't overdue his presence in the Marvel Universe. How many times can this guy come back from the dead?There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but its noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.The armies of Asguard were noticeably lacking in fire-power and weapons (even though they have an armoury), which is made even more evident when an entire guard division bring knives to a laser-gun fight. Their turrents were the only defense they had against an Ariel assault and proved to be practically useless. You would expect them to be better prepared.The healing powers of Thor, Jane, and even a smashed alien space-craft become a bit of a running joke as well. But at least they get hurt, even if it only takes them a scene to heal. And if smashing every column holding up a building is still not enough to take it down I'm not sure what will be. Christopher Eccleston played a competent bad guy, although his intentions for what he was doing was still unclear as to why. Its simple to say he was insane and just wanted to kill everybody, but when a threat of that magnitude appears and planetary alignments are in effect, you expect half the Universe to show up and stop him or take advantage of the situation, or come looking to take the power for themselves. I also expected to see the entire army of Asguard come to help out at the end like they apparently did in the past. Not just Thor who appears there by mistake.The scientist with the miraculous plot saving devise is also a little hard fetch to take in, especially when he creates a remote control for cosmic anomalies. Along with Loki's illusion power which also serves as a convenient plot-saving devise at times. I'm willing to overlook these but there's no denying what they are. Overall its a good enjoyable superhero movie, which you will want to watch several times and is a decent entry into the Marvel Universe.P.S. Watch it in 2D, The 3D added little of worth.","217 out of 404 found this helpful.

Yes I know this is entertainment, and this movie was moderately entertaining, but once again the makers have tried to please everyone by adding a bit of everything; action, special effects, romance and humour, just far too much of the latter for my taste in a genre that does not require hilarity to succeed.Although it has a lower IMDb score I much preferred the 2011 Thor, a stronger storyline, darker and no laughing matter!","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

I was a fan of the first but this one is superior in every way. The actions scenes are better, the plot is better and there is great banter throughout the film. Due to these factors it is entertaining and has more than enough in it to keep you interested. The acting is fantastic, especial by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, as they work great together and appear to have a great understanding of each others roles. I just can't understand why people don't like this film unless they are not a fan of superheroes. After seeing this film last night I read through a few of the reviews afterwards and was shocked as some people were giving it lower than 7. These people are clearly boring and have no idea about an entertaining film and enjoy watching films that just depress you and have no idea about what a fantastic superhero film this is. I recommend you watch this immediately as you won't be disappointed.","121 out of 221 found this helpful.

The production value was superb. Everything else was really poor.The back story and character motivations are laughably sparse. Most of the characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible exception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all action plots - some ""bad dudes who happen to be really ugly"" decide to ""destroy the world for no reason other than being evil"" and ""only our hero can save us all"", etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time. Of course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn't expect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made with a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the surefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard to fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in 2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.","502 out of 680 found this helpful.

The characters from previous Asgard related outings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3 dimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films that would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore further the motivations of the key protagonists. There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud humorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best superhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently the best movie I've seen this year.Don't miss this!","234 out of 451 found this helpful.

The supporting cast, a combination of bland and oddly quaint! Dennings character walking a fine line between being quaint and deeply annoying.The humor is on point, the visuals are interesting, Thor is the same mix of unlikable and funny (But less so than the first film) but the plot is really unengaging, Malkeith makes for a terrible villain and the ending is really quite poor.The film also distances itself from the MC quite a bit, there aren't as many nods as we're used to though the Captain America cameo was kind of neat.I consider Dark World one of the weak links in the MCU, thankfully Thors next solo outing made up for it.RantsI don't know what it is with Portman but she's so remarkably unlikable.

There are a lot of extremely funny bits in it as well as some dark and moving moments. Probably a much funnier movie than it had any right to be given the subject matter. Loki is done perfectly and the dialogue between him and Thor is superb.If you're a fan of the first, this certainly won't disappoint at all. Without spoiling anything, the scale of this film is very Avengers-like in that the action pieces are amazing. During a sequence halfway through, I literally turned to my friend and said, ""this is freakin' awesome"".Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama or intensity. I was expecting to simply see crazy mythology with monsters destroying the landscape of the nine realms for two hours. Instead, I was shocked at the depth and complexity of this film. You definitely need your brain and your heart turned on for this one, unlike other CGI mishmashes. If you want a movie with just dumb action and no plot then stay away from this exceptional film. The performances are top tier and the visual effects may be the best I've seen this year.

The powers on Asgaard contain this force and keep it hidden for thousands of years, only to be found by none other than astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). When The Aether takes possession of Jane, of course, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) comes to her rescue. However, as Asgaard and the Nine Realms face the resurgence of the Dark Elves led by the diabolical Malakeith (Christopher Eccleston), a catastrophic planetary alignment threatens to end the existence of the whole world. Thor was forced to solicit his incarcerated renegade brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to help him with his elaborate rescue plan. Can the two estranged brothers actually work for one common goal?Honestly the first hour of this new Thor film was so dark it was almost dull. The computer-generated special effects looked so fake and unimpressive, very obviously cartoonish mayhem. The acting can be so hokey and corny, so serious and heavy-handed despite the emptiness of the story. The plot itself is very familiar, and reminiscent of many other superhero films. The romantic scenes of Natalie Portman wearing a gown felt like scenes in a ""Star Wars"" prequel.But there was that sudden turn around midway in the film when Thor and Loki joined up that the film snapped into place and never looked back up to the very end. The second half came alive because of its quirky sense of humor. These boisterous moments were largely due to the characters of the eccentric Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), Jane's cute intern Darcy (Kat Dennings), and Darcy's own dorky intern Ian (Jonathan Howard). I feel these funny moments saved this film from wallowing in self-seriousness. They may seem so out of place, yet they were still so laugh-out-loud hilarious.However, are these funny scenes really what director Alan Taylor wants us to remember this movie for? The brotherly interaction between Thor and Loki should have been the main focus, but this can be buried under so many other less-important computer-generated details that tend to overwhelm this production. In any case, overall, this film turned out very entertaining superhero action film that audiences will enjoy. You may not really be able to fully understand how the fight action went from realm to realm in the climactic battle but these were exhilarating to see. The artwork in stark red and black with broad brush strokes over the final credits were awesome to look at. Don't leave right away as you know there will be extra scenes to whet your appetite for more adventures to come. 7/10.","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

It appears that the director/writer was focused on making the movie ""exciting"" first, then coming up with some plot devices to fit in with it. The ""Aether"" is particularly uninspired as a choice for the big bad. It's an excuse to skip writing any characterization for the antagonist; (""Hey, it's just an evil entity that's silent and just sort of.. there. Yay! Less work for us!""). (SPOILER) My biggest complaint with the movie (and this bugged the heck out of me) is the completely out-of-place spaceships and fighters (Think x-wings like Star Wars. Yes, really.) Asgard is supposed to be a realm out of myth. There is a reason everyone gets around using the bi-frost, isn't there? If everyone has spaceships, why were we told in the first Thor movie that the destruction of the bi-frost prevented transportation to other realms? And if these people have guns, why do all the characters on Asgard fight with swords/clubs/daggers? I'm trying to get over my annoyance about this ill-advised overlap with sci-fi. Not having any luck with that. The movie is entertaining, though, in the same way that mindless summer blockbusters are. This would have fit right in with summer releases. Some nice in-jokes for Marvel fans. Now for the actors:Natalie Portman is pretty boring. She doesn't have much to do except swoon, really. Chris Hemsworth does a good job; in my opinion there are limits to what you can do with Thor as he's written in these movies. A bad actor could make a disaster of it; a good actor can make it just fine. There's not much room for an actor to show off his craft. Anthony Hopkins is never bad, but both he and Rene Russo are just sort of there to occupy roles that have to be filled. Very one-dimensional, but then again, that's not out of the ordinary for superhero movies in general. The best part of the movie?? TOM HIDDLESTON. The dude wears Loki like a second skin now. He steals every scene he's in. The character of Loki would, in anyone else's hands, be as simple and one-dimensional as all the other characters in the movie. Instead, he brings subtlety to a role that could easily be reduced to scenery-chewing. He's a master at the grin that conveys, all at once, the mischief of a little boy, the evil of a true villain and a bit of the resentment of the orphaned and overlooked son. I found myself paying much more attention anytime he was on screen just because I find his portrayal to be bordering on the sublime. 6 out of 10 overall, because of the (gag) spaceships and the lack of any suspense for the audience.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms – it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness.But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us – that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe.This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is next for our mighty god of thunder.","10 out of 14 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not as good as the first film, but fun nonetheless","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2910996/?ref_=tt_urv","jafar-iqbal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30239261/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2013","Phase 1 of the Marvel Project is all done and dusted, a phase which started on a massive high with the first Iron Man (arguably the best solo Marvel superhero film to date), and ended on one with Avengers Assemble (the best Marvel film, in my opinion). Marvel Films did what was seemingly impossible, and did it unbelievably well. So, like millions of others, I waited with bated bread for Phase 2 to kick off. Iron Man 3 rolled around andheh. It wasn't an awful film and the Tony Stark character took an interesting turn, but it didn't live up to the success of his first two outings and the Marvel standard as a whole.Which brings us on to the next step of Phase 2 – Thor. The first film was one of the big surprises of the genre. While his other superhero friends are steeped in some level of reality, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is from an entirely different world, so the task of bringing him into 'our' world and making it believable was a tough one. But they did it, and the result was a thoroughly entertaining film that took advantage of the character's supernatural elements. With the sequel, directors Alan Taylor and James Gunn (taking over from Kenneth Branagh) decided to amp the supernatural side up even more.While the first movie introduces us to Asgard, Thor's home planet, The Dark World is set almost entirely in the alien world. This time, Asgard is under threat from an even darker foe hell-bent on literally destroying the entire universe. The epic plot allows the film to explore Asgard with much more detail, and we gain a better understanding of how the world works. Expectedly, we're treated to some gorgeous CGI and special effects, making it fun to watch. The fish-out-of-water formula is also subverted as Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is now in Asgard, essentially playing our eyes and ears. Unfortunately, that formula isn't as successful as it was in the first movie. Watching Thor try to make sense of Earth is genuinely hilarious, but we don't quite get that with Foster. Funnier than that is seeing Foster's Earth friends go about their business (Kat Dennings, in particular, is very funny).In fact, the scenes in Asgard, as a whole, aren't overly amusing. That is, until, one Tom Hiddleston enters the fray.As Loki, Hiddleston is once again sublime. That scathing sarcasm, the wry smiles, his excellent diction and tone; everything about the performance is a pleasure to experience. It is by no means an exaggeration to suggest that he steals every scene he is in. My favourite scenes were the ones that he was in – just waiting for him to say something, and knowing it was going to be gold. And it pretty much always was. The character's journey in the film is also very gripping, and sets us up nicely for whatever might come next. Loki is to Thor what Iago is to Othello: he is the actual main character, he is the one we want to see. And just like people have argued that Shakespeare's play should be called Iago, I would strongly argue that the film should have been named after Loki.Where we have a problem is that, when Loki isn't on screen (and his screen time is crucial but limited), the film just never seems as engaging. I found myself missing the character, and wishing he was ever-present. I won't reveal any spoilers but will say the ending makes up for that longing, but that doesn't stop the film suffering because of it.This is, overall, why the sequel just doesn't work as well as the first film. And it isn't just the lack of Loki's presence; other characters I wanted to see more of were used sparingly. Kat Dennings, as mentioned before, was one of those characters; and Stellan Skarsgard was another. Instead, we saw a lot more of Anthony Hopkins (boring and uninspiring), Idris Elba (strong presence but also boring) and Christopher Ecclestone (who is completely unrecognisable but actually quite good).Don't get me wrong, The Dark World is not a bad film. It's much better than Iron Man 3, and there is enough excitement and good action to stop you getting bored. It just isn't as engaging as the first one, that's all. Sadly, Phase 2 of the Avengers Project has started with a bit of a whimper; we can only hope it gets better from here.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This sequel is one such moment. I do need to see it again. In terms of pure enjoy-ability, I put it top 3 of all sequels that I have enjoyed.What I really liked...-Every single character gets a moment to shine and every single actor cast in these parts are perfect. -The comedy is perfect. It's such a fine balance overall and everything works because it's very subtle and fits in with certain circumstances. -Some very tender emotional scenes. I won't spoil anything with specifics. -Some superb action and what could very well be award winning special effects. -All characters interactions are great and handled very well. This is a fantasy story that really cares about character first and it shows all the way through. Even Natalie Portman's Jane feel more fleshed out than she did in the original film. -The set pieces and other realms talked about in the first are seen here and are beautiful and well done. Asgard was even better believe it or not. -The mid-credit and end credit scenes, both cool. Make sure you stay for both.Marvel hit a pure home run with this endeavor. This film works because of the great cast and the fact that they took this subject matter seriously but remember to have fun. Chris Hemsworth was again perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.","136 out of 247 found this helpful.

Since I was practically skimming through all the movies, I only remembered the ones that had something absolutely memorable to show. This one, however, I barely remembered anything, except for the scene where it was shown in the end that Odin was actually Loki. That's not to say that this movie is bad. That's just saying it's... forgettable.Thor: The Dark World is a movie that I only remember in fragments. I remember a castle exploding in which Thor's mother died but nothing before or after that. I remember Loki being upset because he had been imprisoned and was throwing tantrums but nothing after that. Normally if a movie is so forgettable like it was in the case of X-Men: Apocalypse or Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, I just watch the trailers, Honest Trailers, Pitch Meetings, Cinemasins etc to remember everything that happened in that movie. But I'm not gonna do it here. I want to see how much I can review based on what I thought of it on my first watching.The cinematography of this movie is pathetic, so is the CGI. Normally I prefer aliens having a bad CGI as in the case of Zack Snyder's Justice League since it gives a video game-like touch to it, but here it's just... trash. And what's the deal with the camera always being tilted sideways in many scenes? The characters were straight up terrible. The whole ""intern of an intern"" and punching Thor in the face to check if he's real (I don't remember if it was a slap or punch) wasn't even funny yet both the jokes happened twice. Also Thor hung his Mjolnir on a nail so that we could know it's not actually heavy. As I'm writing this review I'm remembering what all happened in it, but still not very nicely.I actually fell asleep while watching Thor: The Dark World, something I have never done for any other movie before. That's how slowly paced and boring it was. The talking scenes were a little too much and were barely audible. I think I really need to watch it one more time if I have to just get a basic idea of what it was. This could have been the MCU movie I hated the most if it wouldn't have been for Loki. He carried the whole movie on his shoulders. I remember all his scenes.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Its funny, its got action. And did I mention its funny? Honestly, I think this movie had more sarcastic comments, wise cracks per minute than it did hammer punches to the face.Story is fairly generic. Super evil guy thought long dead wants super evil thing. Thor and crew doesn't want him to get it. It's straighforward enough. However, for a movie titled Thor, it sure does spend a large amount of screen time with other people, Natalie Portman, the other scientists when Natalie Portman is in Viking Land, Loki, the bad guy, Loki again. Actually, I don't really mind the Loki part. I hate him as a character, but he is fascinating. He truly is the god of mischief, you never know what side he is on, though usually its his own side. I don't understand how anybody trusts him ever.Every character always has something funny to say. Every side character is comic relief, and Thor is pretty funny himself too. With so much casual comedy all the time, the incredibly sad and dramatic moments create a jarring tonal shift. Then after a short while its back to jokejokejoke. For most of the movie, the action isn't that mind blowing or fascinating. But the movie makes up for it with the final fight, full of chaos-inducing wobbly gravity and warping all over the place.tl;dr a fun, entertaining super hero movie, with jarring tonal shifts, but one of the most fun final action sequences.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

It tends to explore worlds beyond Asgard and Midgard, and innovating more details around this absurd universe. Because if your source material have a world this rich, it makes your everyday reality look boring. It's a fine escapism, but the joy stumbles when it goes to the storyline. It's almost like the opposite of the first movie. Here, it works better when it simply shows the heroes fighting off the bad guys, but feels forced when it tries to pull off a drama. The overall film can be entertaining, but it messes a lot of elements within the surfaces.The big problem already lies by justifying the word ""dark"" in the title. While being dark and serious is not really a problem to this modern era of blockbusters, the film never felt natural for it. Though, the first movie was more special when it was focused on the drama, here it definitely feels force. There are those ""tragic"" or ""emotional"" scenes when it feels so contrived for the sake of fitting and pleasing the audience who seek for sheer deepness. The result is surprisingly not compelling, which makes you wish it was handled by Kenneth Branagh again. The film also suffers with a weak plot, there are large parts where the good guys are lingering to brood, making plans, and just goofing around while they're surrounded by a formidable enemy. Those moments they waste pretty much kills the momentum.The movie is better when it stays loyal to the roots of a Marvel picture. Staying in the action and the comedy is when the film felt more comfortable, although it may get out of hand. The cast gives plenty of life, as always, especially when Tom Hiddleston is around to spice things up. Director Alan Taylor seems to be more interested in creating inventive action set pieces and featuring stuff that we don't normally see in the genre, which helps a lot to bring pure energy within the adventure, while the CGI effects bring massive scale in any world they stop in to.Thor: The Dark World had its fun moments, but also suffers by its missteps. The recent trend of ""darkening"" almost every latest superhero movie somewhat affects it. Having drama scenes is definitely not the problem since the first movie was fascinating because of those parts. The real problem is how the film delivers them, it instead makes them look preachy and pretentious. It would have been a straightforward quest, because that's where the film works better. If the whole film is completely adventurous and full of personality, then it might end up being somehow remarkable. Still, Thor needs some pizazz to its gravity to make it more than just another action blockbuster. For now, Thor: The Dark World is fine enough as a distraction.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

Yet, this film does just that. It really does appeal to all of your movie viewing skills. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from a director that crafted Game of Thrones. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the indirect link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us in his sequel.Also, I absolutely love the character of Loki because there was so much texture to the character. He's the perfect Marvel villain. He was complex but with a tinge of madness mixed in and perfectly written for the film. The rationale for what he does and how he behaves is masterful. I truly loved how Loki was written and portrayed. Then again, I honestly can say that about all the main characters. Thor and Jane really are allowed to shine here as well.My main critique after watching the first film was the instance romance between Jane and Thor. After watching this movie, you buy the love at first sight scenario boosted by the situational intrigue. This time around, the pace of the film really worked well. I can't remember a film that grabs you like they do right off the bat and never lets go but does it with intelligence and heart. Hard to argue any editorial cuts at this point whatever they may have been.Overall, a movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen this year.","40 out of 75 found this helpful.

Cinematography is great and the score is amazing. Whoever scored this film should do so for the rest of the Marvel movies in my opinion.I knew they would nail the pathos but was pleasantly surprised by the creative fight sequences. They are phenomenal. Not overly long but when they rage, THEY RAGE. Also, Kurse can rival the Hulk in terms of scary power. He was better utilized than the Destroyer was in the first film. Loki is the scene stealer that was all hoped to see! Jane and Sif add more than eye candy but you would expect no less from Marvel. Hemsworth has cemented his legend as Thor with this effort. My only real disappointed is a minor one. They didn't really show the nine realms in any real detail. It seemed a cop out that hey're just open landscapes.

Furthermore, the characters are grounded in reality and the sequel delves deeper into the intricate relationships between characters than its predecessor.Chris Hemsworth is an admirable physical and emotional embodiment of the Norse deity. Tom Hiddleston is able to delineate grey shades in another accomplished performance as the nefarious Loki. While the latter may garner plaudits for his portrayal, Hemsworth shines as the eponymous warrior as well.While Thor was ostracized to earth in the first movie, the roles are now reversed and Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman, is taken to Asgard. Portman is afforded a more substantial role and is pivotal to proceedings. All in all, she does well as Thor's star struck love interest.Doctor Who alum Christopher Eccleston portrays the implacable Malekith, a dark elf hell bent on seeking retaliation. While he delivers a menacing threat, assuring higher stakes for Thor, ultimately Malekith is tantamount to a generic and one-dimensional antagonist.The highlight of The Dark World is undoubtedly its humor. The blue print is akin to Iron Man 3 and the director is able to balance the comic relief with dramatic sequences. Secondly, the Thor and Loki dynamic is a thrill for viewers. Their collective charisma ensures some of the movie's better sequences.Moreover, the action and visual effects, in keeping with other Marvel movies, are exquisite. Battles are well executed and expansive, particularly the swashbuckling finale. Last but not least, the story arcs for both Thor and Loki culminate in an emotionally satisfying manner.The film is not without its loopholes though. At a running time of only 112 minutes, events unfold at breakneck speed, which may feel like several scenes have been edited. Ultimately, the sequel is bigger than its precursor in terms of scale and provides an engaging movie going experience.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

In truth it could've been 20min longer but I liked it. People love to complain about this movie *SPOILER* (DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM) The reason Thor and many others shift through one realm into the next is due to a Once in 5,000 Years event called The Convergence, where all Nine Realms line up, causing energy and matter to be able to pass realm to realm as though through a door. Some people can't grasp this and therefore, due to their sloping foreheads, will never grasp this concept. When asked, ""what is your favorite Marvel Film Franchise (?), a noted physicist said Thor 1 & 2, because of how true these events actually are being considered in the real world. (Wormholes, etc.) But back to the film. This is great. Im seeing people say They hate this but loved Avengers, or vice versa. This is ludicrous. Say you don't like Thor, fine. I have no issue with personal taste. All I'll say to sum up my feelings are, working at a comic shop, reading Thor all my life, this is a great story with great banter and action. Even my die-hard DC friends love this movie.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

To make it work in the ""real"" world was a massive task. Integrating a billionaire playboy who doubles as a tech-powered superhero, or a scientist who turns into a green rage monster was easier to accomplish than the fantastic world of Asgard, Gods & Monsters.Credit must go to Kenneth Brannagh who found the right balance between the fantastic and ""real"" (that's a stretch anyways) world. Furthermore, Brannagh focused on the characters instead of bombastic vfx (he still provided tons of beautiful shot visuals though).His replacement Alan Taylor however goes in the opposite direction and favors stylish visuals over character development. Worse still, the pacing and tone are all over the place.The Dark World tries to hard to provide the same brand of humor Joss Whedon is known for but fails to deliver the laughs, or they are rather misplaced.Bottom line: It's a too unfocused movie that suffers from a weak script and a director who tries too many things at the same time.","61 out of 106 found this helpful.

Mallekith escapes and Bor hides the Aether in-between two stone columns.In the present days, on Earth, the scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) that is waiting for the return of Thor, investigates a gravity phenomenon in an abandoned factory with her assistant and her intern. She finds the column where the Aether is hidden and the substance possesses her. In Asgard, Heimdall (Idris Elba) reports to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that Jane has disappeared. Thor returns to Earth and finds Jane; but when he sees that he has a strange energy protecting her, he brings Jane to Asgard to be healed. However, Malekith also awakes and goes to Asgard to retrieve the Aether. After a bloody battle, Frigga (Rene Russo) is murdered by Malekith and Thor proposes treason to his warriors friends of Asgard and teams up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to seek revenge for the murder of their mother and to vanquish Malekith before he destroys Asgard with his Dark Elves. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is another great adventure of Thor. In this movie, Thor makes the most unlike association with Loki and the result is a wonderful movie. The scene of Loki fighting with Thor is the best moment of ""Thor: The Dark World"". Chris Hemsworth perfectly impersonates Thor and the conclusion surprises. Last but not the least, the movie is to be watched until the very end of the credits because there are two additional scenes in the credits. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Thor: O Mundo Sombrio"" (""Thor: The Dark World"")","25 out of 45 found this helpful.

(aka the soul of a movie) well this movie had no soul in fact when i left i felt mine died a little, this made me kinda sad but i got a frozen coke on the way out so that made me feel better for a little while i guess. Anyway i thought we were going to see the characters develop more but i was wrong again and man i hate it when i'm wrong 16 times in one day, I felt nothing for them i didn't even care for any of them and that bothers me a lot when you go to see a movie like this and you don't care? something is wrong and or missing.4) The Humor! A lot of people are talking about this both bad and good but i can't comment cause i didn't see nor hear any humor.5) Reaction from the Audience! Like watching a movie with friends when you reacted together in the same way for example laugh at something amusing it makes the movie more enjoyable, non existent in my theater of about 12 or so but still you would expect something like a laugh, a giggle or gasping but well you already know what i'm going to say.In conclusion this is my first time submitting a review for a movie and to be bothered so much by a movie to then write one has to mean something, It just seems like movies these days are lacking in heart they just want to pump these out without putting heart in them and that makes me sad... sad enough that now i have to go watch friends to cheer me up.Thank you for reading and remember these are just my thoughts and opinions by all means if you want to see it please do and form your own thoughts on the experience and i hope you enjoyed reading.","11 out of 28 found this helpful.

I didn't think it was on par with The Hulk Remake, Iron Man, and even Captain America. I felt the Thor movie was a little weaker (Captain America is a close, but not too close, second place).That said, Thor: The Dark World gives Thor the type of movie that the first one should have been. The scale is larger, the effects are better, and I think the story was stronger. I enjoyed the humerus aspects of the film which were ramped up due the success of the Avengers. This formula works.Hemsworth does a good job with Thor. You can tell he's really embraced this role as it is his defining role to date. He obviously looks the part, and he does a good job giving Thor a personality. He's a little rigid, but I think that's the character he's playing. The intensity is there, but so is the comic relief when it needs to be.Tom Hiddleston really steals the show with Loki. His charisma shines through in his portrayal and you can really tell when a truly talented stage/film actor such as Hiddleston finds a role and a character that he truly loves. His portrayal is effortless and full of emotion, which in my opinion, makes Loki by far the most intriguing villain in the entire Marvel Universe.I could do without Natalie Portman's character. I understand it's necessary in order to humanize the film and link Thor to Earth, but I find it a little pointless that she has to be included as a piece of the puzzle surrounding the Dark Elf mytho. Having Asgaard and the Dark Elves battle on their own would have been just as effective and less annoying.The three Agaardians are utilized much less in this movie and were almost rendered to bit-parts. I thought this was too bad as I'm certain they have larger roles to fill in the comic book universe and would have been a better fit into the movies as compared to the group of annoying human characters.Odin (Anothony Hopkins) was a mystery to me. In the first movie he is seen as a confident, wise, powerful leader whom must be shown respect and yet in this movie he appears to be a cranky old man. I wasn't thrilled with the treatment Odin received.In the end this is a solid movie and I think much better than the original. There are some strange directions taken with the story, but in the end some fantastic effects, solid acting, funny jokes, and Loki redeem many of the flaws Rating: 7.5/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

And whereas the previous Thor movie was alright, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" does surpass the previous movie.Sure, the storyline is cliché and you see what's coming a mile away. But still, it works out, because this is generic to the core, but there is just something fundamentally entertaining about this classic good vs. evil storyline, where evil wants to lay waste to the universe, and a single force of heroic good-doers thwart the evil plans.The storyline in ""Thor: The Dark World"" is about an ancient race of dark elves, who according to Asgardian legend, are conquered and exist no more. Along with them is the Aether, a force so strong that it can lay waste to the universe. When Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) comes across a minor cosmic anomaly in her search for Thor, little does she know that she has stumbled upon the Aether and awoken it from its dormant stasis, and along with it the dark elves.As for the effects, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" does deliver right on the money. The CGI are awesome to behold and also very realistic, which just adds to the worth of the entire movie. Without proper effects, then a Marvel superhero movie would not work out on the same level.And as for the costumes, armors and creature designs. Well that just blew me away. There were so many awesome details and concept designs going on here that it was just mind boggling. Asgard is indeed a marvelous sight to behold, as are the armors of the Asgardian warriors. But the Kursed creatures that were with the dark elves, that was just beyond anything I have seen.It is nice to see people return to their previous roles, and even with a pinch of comedy as in where Loki portrays and makes fun of Captain America.If you enjoy these particular types of movies, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" is well worth watching. Great action and lots of adrenaline to keep you on your toes.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It improves on the original with larger action sequences and smoother, more appealing and more elegant scenes. At heart, the relationships between characters are amusing to watch, especially the dysfunction brotherhood of Thor and Loki, much to Tom Hiddleston's credit.It opens up slightly plain with monologue explanation of a banished ancient race that made an ominous weapon, was defeated in way and ultimately swore vengeance upon Asgard, which harrowingly feels all too similar to Superman's nemesis, amongst others. It then reintroduces the characters and how they fare after the events from the first movie. With Thor's concern over his duty and longing for Jane, the first half is a bit mundane. It does gradually become much more compelling with good acting and light yet efficient humor. Dialogues are funny, presented at timely occasions and don't feel forced. There lies sincere playful moments; more than most movies of its kind has to offer.Acting from the cast is charming. Chris Hemsworth seems more comfortable as Thor. He shows a fairly natural performance and it coincides well as the character itself becomes more mature. Natalie Portman as Jane is decent, but she's still somewhat trapped in the damsel in distress role. Tom Hiddleston performs wonderfully as Loki, still looking mighty treacherous but has a hint of redemption this time around. It's good to see both brothers interact with each other as that is one of the best moments of the movie.As expected from a blockbuster movie, it delivers quite well on its depiction of alien worlds intertwined with Earth. Asgard has abundance of tiny details, from its gadgetry, garment to mishmash of traditional Viking and futuristic housing. Color palette has changed from the first's dusky set of New Mexico to more cloudy grayish skyline of London. Nifty spectacles are spread throughout, battles are fought exotically and the clash of colors is enchanting. Its 3D effect has reasonably vivid impact, it won't impede the visual, in fact adds to the enjoyment.Thor: The Dark World is simply a better sequel. The plot might be generic, but its genuine humor, good acting and delightful graphic ensure an enjoyable lighthearted watch. As it stands now, it's one of the better action fantasy movies of recent time.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The one thing i noticed though, throughout Thor, Avengers and Thor 2, his hair gets longer every time (which i'm not complaining). The movie was full of action, which fulfills the audience as they walk out of the theater. On the other hand, comedy took place in many parts throughout the movie. What is more interesting is that most of the comedy was performed by Loki, who everybody knows as a major Marvel Villain besides Dr. Doom and Thanos. The comedy, in my opinion, was there because the success of the Avengers, which had many comedy scenes in it, made this movie likable. This movie totally fixed the things that miss from the first Thor. There were many scenes where they introduced Thor's ability to performed his power in certain ways that no one had ever seen before. The connection of Thor and the people of Asgard and his family was portrayed really well by their language, joke and style of speech. The music was an epic score. It really defined the story and I still could not get it out of my head. It's not as memorable as Pirates of the Caribbean but it definitely built the excitement watching the movie. Everybody must go see it. It's well thought and the story and action really defined Thor. Go see go see!","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It is quite impressive and amazing. A lot of effort has been put to make this movie a good science fiction movie. However, as in most of the science fiction movie or the stories from Marvel. there is always the nagging thing which bothers me. In the set up where the character is using laser gun or whatever they call it, there is still some army who is fighting with a sword, lance and using shield. This does not really making any sense. If they could create something weapon of laser class, why would they fight using a sword ? And to make it worse, the party with the sword is actually beating the guy with the gun. I know this is science-fiction and movie is an imagination of something, but can it be made with more sense ? Another detail which I find a bit annoying is the ""politically correct"" selection of characters. This is a story of Nordic god. I have nothing against the African American people, but does it make sense to see one of the God portrayed by a black guy ? It does not matter how good the acting of this particular person, but he is so out of place in the environment of Nordic setting. Maybe for once; drop the ""politically correct"" attitude and do something for the benefit of the art...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Go and see it, great entertainment. (Don't leave the theater during the credits, you know, it's a Marvel film.)","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

A dark elf who wants to blow everything up. Apparently that's all we need to know and all we'll ever know about the main villain in the film.2) Pointless Main Characters: The main characters in this film offer nothing of substance or value. For example, you could have replaced Jane with any other character without affecting the film. She exists solely as plot vehicle. The film does not explore her relationship with Thor, her reaction as a character to being transported to a different world, etc., etc. She's as thin as cardboard, like the rest of the main characters of this film.3) Very Poor Humor: Almost all of the jokes in this film made me roll my eyes and groan. It's as if the script writers liked the humor in Avengers and attempted to duplicate it without any knowledge of how.4) Ridiculous Plot Devices: Things in this movie only happen because the script says they have to. For example, Jane being the one possessed by the dark energy. Or the car keys being discovered on another planet. These things make no sense but exist solely because they have to for the plot to continue. I hate that.I had high hopes for Thor II but in the end it was just another disappointing let down.","92 out of 171 found this helpful.

In the big league, Loki was awesome as always though his deceptive plot seemed simple than complex which i prefer.Thor was being Thor, while i grow less of a fan of that beard by each passing movie, i do enjoy his dialog delivery. Jane Foster is growing tiresome at least on me, her animated counterpart was better portrayed in Avengers EMH, i guess Natalie Portman can't do much about this one as the cinematic character itself seems to lack scope for development. I really want Marvel to move to Thor & Sif, Sif for the brief period i saw her in Thor tales of Asgard, grew on me quite well.I was looking forward to the Dark Elf but again Thor Tales of Asgard did a better job with Algrim than Dark World with Malekith. Like Man Of Steel the movie can be better experienced in moments than a complete experience, the end credit scene for example just increased my curiosity & some scenes featuring Loki did bring out the best of Thor.I hope the Next Thor movie can build on this.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Actually really rather good...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2898245/?ref_=tt_urv","imdb-783-507847","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46387072/?ref_=tt_urv","2 November 2013","The Review: For me the original Thor film was my second , least favourite Marvel adaptation after Captain America (sorry Capt.). It wasn't bad but it always felt like it was missing something special. Now, two years later and bolstered by an appearance alongside his Avengers buddies, the Blonde, buff god returns in what is a far more well rounded and successful movie.The Story: Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all.Firstly let's get this out the way. Thor 2 is actually really good. Excellent in fact. Of all the Avengers films, it's probably the most 'together ' . It has a simple story, which moves at pace, with action and drama but keeping it tight enough to come in at under 2 hours. It even manages to get around (at least MOSTLY get around) the standard CGI monster fighting CGI good guy trope that has hobbled the end of every Avengers film since Iron Man.A large reason why the film works so well is the sublime decision to once again sit an unlikely candidate in the director's chair. Be it Jon Favreau for Iron Man or James Gunn for the upcoming Guardians Of The Galaxy, Marvel have a knack of picking the right man for the job. This time out respected TV and Game Of Thrones director Alan Taylor brings a more even vision to the film, much more suited to the material than Kenneth Branagh, and obviously revels in having a larger that his usual budget to play with. The action is clean and well shot, and best of all you can see every punch, every explosion and every insane flying spaceship moment.Oh and talking of flying Spaceship moments director Taylor is obviously a fan of 80's cheese fest Flash Gordon, being that he borrows a considerable part of the films finale for the attack on Asgard. Not that I'm complaining as the mix of sci-fi, Norse legend, super hero and action make for a pleasant change form the usual Earth bound Marvel world.Hemsworth once again proves he is a man of considerable talent, delivering action alongside comedy and the occasional pathos. Naturally Natalie Portman has little to do (as is the female role generally in a Marvel film) but she remains a welcome addition, as does the returning Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston (once again a stand out as Loki) and Anthony Hopkins (as his most gravelly). Rene Russo even gets to kick arse, which is nice. As for former Dr Who and professional grump Christopher Eccleston he does good with his limited bad guy role, but in reality with the added make up and FX it could have been anyone as Dark Elf leader Malekif.In truth the film has little against it, other than maybe an element of familiarity, and ends up being one of the best blockbusters of the year. Maybe not as good overall as Iron Man 3, but certainly more fun. For the most part.So overall a good script, great characters and some snappy dialogue alongside standout action sequences and a fast pace mean that deservedly Thor The Dark World will be another hit for Marvel. Truly a studio that cant seem to get it wrong.Reviewed By: Phil HobdenJoin the debate on our Facebook Group (www.facebook.com/groups/Filmsploitation) or on our website (www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk)","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A decent and entertaining sequel, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a lot of fun, but can't quite measure up to its predecessors.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2966851/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","23 February 2014","In 2011, I was given a very decent surprise by the Marvel release ""Thor"", the fourth entry in ""Phase One"" of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe."" (The overall franchise including characters like Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America and Thor, all leading to the ""Avengers"" films) I wasn't sure what to expect going in, as the character seemed far too different from prior films in the franchise. ""How could this work?"", I would ask myself. But I'm glad I took the chance- I was blown away by the imagination, humor and wonderful storytelling. And it ended up being one of my favorite ""Phase One"" films.So I went into ""Thor: The Dark World"" with decently high expectations. The first film was such fun, I couldn't wait for the second. And how did it measure up? Unfortunately, it doesn't quite match the high quality of the character's previous outings in ""The Avengers"" and his 2011 titular film. However, despite that, it was still a very decent, humorous and very fun continuation of the character's story, and is well worth seeing for fans of the character and franchise.The story centers on Thor (duh), as he struggles with a number of situations, all leading to the possible destruction of the universe. After being re-united with his beloved Jane, Thor realizes her body has been inadvertently infused with ""Aether"", a powerful force that could potentially spell doom for all existence. Forced to protect her from a treacherous Dark Elf lord named Malekith, Thor will need to forge an uneasy alliance with his imprisoned brother Loki in order to save the known universe from Malekith's evil plans.As was the case in the first film, the cast is fantastic. Chris Hemsworth is blast as the hero Thor, this time showing more range and emotion than prior outings, making him more identifiable and compelling. Natalie Portman is also great as Jane, though I will comment that despite having a lot to do in the film, she doesn't have a lot of depth, making her feel tacked on at times, and as though she's only there to drive the plot forward. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard as Jane's companions Darcy and Selvig are an absolute joy, being more or less the comedic relief, as is newcomer Jonathan Howard as Darcy's new intern, Ian. Anthony Hopkins and Renee Ruso add a lot of class to the proceedings as Thor's parents, Odin and Frigga. Christopher Ecclestan is adequately threatening as Malekith, though he feels a bit under- developed. And supporting roles by the likes of Jamie Alexander, Ray Stephenson and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are all very well-played, making good work in their secondary roles. But as before, the real show- stealer is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He is just such a breath of fresh air, and gives such a compelling performance that he almost always overshadows everyone else. A truly remarkable performer.The script by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (based on a story co-written by the late Don Payne) is where some of my issues lie. It's not a bad script by any means. It's tightly paced, has some great sequences, and generally had something for every character to do. It also has some surprisingly hard- hitting scenes of emotion that surprised me. But I just feel that it leaves some characters under-developed. And it felt like a far smaller story as a result. (Even though it's larger in scope, it feels like less is happening.)Directorial duties are handed off this time to Alan Taylor, best known as a television director, though he has a few feature films to his credit. And I think he did a serviceable job in this film, with a strong visual sensibility and a keen eye for visual storytelling. Though I do feel that his work as a television director does show in some sequences, particularly early on. While the film is mostly theatrical, a few action sequences do have a slight ""tv- aesthetic"", though I could forgive them as they were few and far between. That being said, I did prefer Kenneth Branagh's direction in the first film a bit more. His more operatic, even slightly melodramatic style just fit the tone better, in my opinion.The rest of the production is top-notch though. The costume and set design is shockingly beautiful as it was before. The different worlds are clearly defined, and it seems a lot of care, research and detail was put into every aspect, lending credibility to the overall story. The cinematography was also something to behold, and I particularly loved the lighting. And the visual effects are astounding. Some of the best CGI work I've seen lately. Even when I knew the things on-screen weren't real, I still ""believed"" they were there. The only thing I think fell a bit short was the musical score by Brian Tyler. It just wasn't memorable, and although it fit the mood, it felt generic. Whereas in the first movie, I found myself recalling the gorgeous musical cues and even humming them to myself... here, it's just sort of generic swords-and-sorcery fare. A lot of drums and horns. And a few appearances of what I liked to call the ""Hans Zimmer 'Bwwwaaahhh'."" That loud, deep noise that has been popular over the past 5 or so years, that just sort-of sounds like someone shouting ""Bwwwaaahhh"" with a deep voice whenever something big happens on-screen.However, although I feel like I was pointing out a lot of negatives, there's still many positives here too appreciate. The action is great, the cast wonderful and the humor a blast. It's still a darned fun, entertaining film, and worth seeing for fans... it just isn't quite as good as it could have been.I give ""Thor: The Dark World"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Worth seeing for fans, but it probably won't win any new viewers.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","Solid blockbuster with good mix of effects and entertainment, although needed to play to its strengths more","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2961961/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","16 February 2014","Years of disappointment and bad experiences have told me that most summer blockbusters are not the event movies that the advertisements would like you to believe; yes they are about the spectacle but with large TVs and strong sound systems being the norm now, it is not a big loss to enjoy such films in your home away from talking people, mobile phones, crowds and inflated prices. So it was with the Thor sequel. The original film had been pretty good but seemed cluttered with introductions and franchise stuff. The second film doesn't have so much of this and it mostly works pretty well although it must be said that it never seems to consistently play to its strengths.The plot does seem to link to Marvel lore that fans will appreciate but for the casual viewer it works well enough to do the job without knowing too much. Basically some dark power has escaped and Jane has been exposed to it making her a target for some dark elves who seek to destroy everything. Thor must not only protect her but also destroy the dark power before it can be harnessed by the elves – a task he can only perform with the help of Loki, currently rotting away in a cell. As a plot it sets up lots of confrontation and this is the main thing we are here for, so in that regard it works well enough. That said, it doesn't seem to be able to do enough of its better stuff.The better stuff tends to be the less serious material; Thor is a character and a story steeped in serious words and big Norse gods whereas Iron Man (for example) has a playboy at its centre, thus making the fun and swagger easier to come by. This film benefits from Loki being fun and playful as a villain and when he is around the film is better; there are a few other aspects where the playful fun comes in but mostly it is associated with Loki and there are frankly too few of these scenes. The fun adds to the entertainment value and while it does still work without it, it doesn't work quite as well.The special effects are good though and if you are looking for distracting noise and spectacle then this does the trick – perhaps not enough to hold your full attention but perfectly fine if you wish to switch off the brain to a certain extent. The cast act well considering they are mostly on a green screen. Hemsworth gets the balance right between playing a big god and also having a bit of fun, his only issue is sometimes the material doesn't let him do this. Portman is not so much of a presence although she does well enough and she has good chemistry with Hemsworth. Hiddleston gets the best material and has fun with it. Hopkins booms out his lines and Eccleston is a good (but unrecognizable) villain. Support is good from Alexander, Stevenson, Russo, Dennings, Skarsgård and others, while HBO fans will enjoy seeing two very strong characters from two shows represented by Akinnuoye- Agbaje (Oz) and Elba (The Wire).This isn't an amazing film but it is a solid blockbuster with good effects and plenty going on. I prefer it when it mixes some fun into the more faux-heavy dialogue and I'm not sure why it doesn't do this more often but it still works pretty well if you're in the mood for effects- driven action and spectacle.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I'm glad they've kept the cast together and hopefully Marvel can do this across all their franchises, as it gives them a bit of authenticity. It's fun to see how they link some of the threads back to 'The Avengers', particularly with Dr Erik Selvig (Skarsgård).Now, I don't know who out there actually loves Thor, because he's certainly one of my least favourite Marvel characters, especially in the comics, as he's so rigid and boring and never does anything too exciting. He's certainly no Wolverine or Spiderman. And that's the film's biggest hurdle - how to make Thor and the story interesting for 110min. It sort-of achieves this... I know it's mostly set in Asgard, a different realm, but even then there are still a few things which stretch credibility:
One of the big saving graces is some of the witty laughs provided by Chris O'Dowd and Kat Dennings (plus Stan Lee's patented cameo!). There's some expertly timed quips thrown in, which add some levity to what could easily become quite a cumbersome story. I think that Hopkins was pretty wasted as Odin, Hemsworth has some decent moments as Thor, but Hiddleston as Loki once again almost steals the show, because even though you may hate him, he's often so likable! A great character to hold this part of the Marvel Universe together.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Marvel has already gained a reputation as the creators of excellent blockbusters about superheroes. Thor is a wonderful character. And his return was expected.The film demonstrates an excellent picture, the play of the actors, a twisted plot, so necessary for the overall narrative of the entire cinematic universe. There is comedy, drama, battle scenes. In general, everything that the viewer expects when he starts watching a blockbuster.Tom Hiddleston truly adorns the picture. His Loki is a diverse and complex character, to whom one way or another he begins to relate with sympathy. And this is the merit of the actor, his charisma and good looks.Chris Hemsworth is irresistible again. He is smiling, severe where necessary, dramatic and again perfectly conveys to the audience the emotions and experiences of his hero Thor.Jane Foster and her friend are funny together, setting the heat with their antics. Jane is more serious, and Darcy is an eternal joker, without which the film would definitely lose.Christopher Eccleston's work is not very impressive. But this is rather an omission of the script. His villain Malekith acts as some kind of cardboard, brutal. The character is not revealed. He just exists and needs to be defeated.Computer effects are back on top. They are especially colorful when you watch a movie with 3D glasses. I've been waiting for this. That's what I got. No more and no less. Just for granted. The special effects are bright, which often even distracts from the essence of the film. Maybe that's why there was a feeling that the characters' characters were faded against the background of the picture.In the finale, you realize that now Thor is ready to become the true king of Asgard, he has passed the path of becoming, realized how important it is to be a loving and responsible hero.The film will not make fans disappointed. Good music, a strong soundtrack, a great picture and the actors' performance is on top. But still something is missing for a furore. There are a couple of memorable moments that are especially pleasing, but, unfortunately, not the whole movie.8 out of 10.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't understand why people are hyping Loki, yes the actor that played the part did an excellent job but the actor that play Thor also did an excellent job in how he portrayed the title character . I can't honestly see anyone else as Thor. I liked nearly the entire story the movie told and I did not find the villain to be as lacking as has been claimed by some, I just accepted him for who he was. The villain make have had a different personality to differentiate him from his counter part in the marvel comics.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

And while it is enjoyable, it isn't great. It's just...decent. I liked Thor a lot more in this movie than in his first flick and the Avengers. He was much more charming, likable and yet still a force to be reckoned with. Hemsworth's performance was a lot better in this movie too, even with his emotional scenes, like with Frigga's death and when Loki died.Speaking of Loki, he was incredible in this movie as well. His brotherly banter with Thor was so enjoyable because it is what normal brothers actually do. I'm glad that he's still playing his games with Thor and Asgard.I also really like how this movie looked. The first Thor film actually looked pretty good showing the mystical Asgard but in this film it's much more defined. I love the scene with the ships fighting each other because we get to explore the land more. Even the wardrobe for the characters looks better as it doesn't look like plastic but looks very well designed. One scene that was powerful as well as beautiful, was Frigga's funeral. No words were spoken but there was still a huge amount of emotion that could be felt. It also helped that it looked amazing.The villain in this movie, Malekith, was horrible. He was even outshadowed by Loki. He had no development or interesting qualities, we were just told that he was evil. He is no doubt the worst villain the MCU has had.I also have to complain about the humans in this movie. Jane was still annoying, and I still don't believe Natalie Portman as a scientist. Darcy was equally as annoying as total nuisance and caused mass eye rolls in the theater. I still like Selvig, as he's dealing with being under Loki's control. I am actually glad that a good portion took place in Asgard although Jane being there was bad.Even though the final battle took place mostly on Earth, it was actually really fun, having Thor fly around and go through portals to different realms and different parts of London.+ Better performance from Hemsworth + Loki + Asgardian aesthetic - Characters on Earth - Terrible villainFinal Score: 7.2/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has the spit out formula that blockbuster movies like Iron Man 2 have. It feels like TV has another spin off cop show. The CGI is big-budget, but the story here has hardly any suspense and is boring. The movie reuses the short action, talking, villain creates problem, talking, and conclusion plot line. The movie starts with a small-scale fight with irrelevant enemies to introduce Thor. Then Jane messes with a portal while an ancient vengeful antagonist who lost long ago shows up, all the way to the mid-point when Marvel recreates the Star Wars The Phantom Menace battle with the energy shield dome and two armies run at each other, and it ends shortly, to restart in the ending. Thor has no weaknesses and he needs Loki for distraction. Describing the ending in one sentence sounds like the premise of The Avengers ending. Save your money for the next Marvel movie. I wrote this review this morning and six hours have passed and I have forgotten most of the movie.","46 out of 82 found this helpful.

When it comes to a stand alone Thor sequel, I really could not have expected anything different. This sadly means that it is quite forgettable but even so, it is a Thor movie. Dark World focuses mainly on Thor, and Thor. The supporting cast is there but much less important than anything Thor does to progress the plot (the plot on Earth has no effect on the story). Even though this movie is a progression of the Thor series, it still manages to provide no development of the mentality of Thor, or Loki, or even Odin. This movie seems to me as a good way for Marvel to accomplish things that set up other movies now, The Aether, deaths, etc.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's just only been a few months since the release of the immensely successful ""Iron Man 3"". Now it's Thor, the God of Thunder to strike back. Thor is of course the least relatable of the Avengers. But that doesn't stop this movie from succeeding. There are multiple references to what happened in the blockbuster ""The Avengers"". Often referred to as the ""alien invasion in New York"", it doesn't really play a major role in the primary plot in ""Thor: The Dark World"" itself. So, even if you haven't watched ""The Avengers"", don't worry, you won't feel left out.The plot of ""Thor: The Dark World"" concerns with something extremely ancient. The Aether is kind of like a fluid that is extremely full of energy and is able to turn ordinary matter into dark matter. This ancient relic begins to play its part in the story after scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) travels to another world accidentally and encounters it. It is later revealed that every 5000 years, the nine realms will be in perfect alignment and therefore, borders between these worlds become blurred. This is an event known as the ""Convergence"". However, due to the recent activity of the Aether, a race called by the Dark Elves, led by Malekith, are awakened. Apparently, they were once ruthless rulers who were defeated by Odin's father Bor. Bor vanquished the Dark Elves and it started a peace that lasted for thousands of years. However, Malekith wants the Aether to plunge the whole universe into total darkness. He intends to that at the peak of the ""Convergence"". Now, it's up to Thor to stop Malekith and his evil schemes. If Thor is to defeat Malekith, he's going to need help from someone unlikely...... Loki.Yes! A team-up between Thor and Loki. This is one of the most exciting components of the film. Thor is serious, powerful whereas Loki is wise-cracking, mischievous, and very tricky. Together, they form a very well-balanced duo and seeing them work together is true joy. There is plenty of action. Of course! It's a superhero action movie. But the superpowers incorporated here are mighty and therefore the sequences are intensified. The Aether is slick and don't forget, Mjolnir is a ravager. The 3D is amazing and I watched this in IMAX 3D. Not all of the scenes were shot in IMAX, but some of the landscapes were incredibly beautiful. More of Asgard is revealed and it really is gorgeous. The movie also had a comedic nature. In fact, it was funnier than I expected. The mischievous and charismatic Loki is plenty of fun to watch. Watching him on screen is pure delight and his character is extremely interesting. But you also have to keep an eye on Dr. Erik Selvig, Jane's ally. He's gone a bit crazy in this movie and therefore, his antics are hilarious in the movie. Malekith is an all-powerful villain and he is intimidating. However, I didn't really think he was an interesting villain. His background is rich but that was short. We don't know really know Malekith. He is extremely devoid of character and sometimes, he's so boring. He, along with his race, speak a language that sounds like pre-historic dialect to me. Performances were wonderful. Chris Hemsworth is a well-rounded character and has given Thor adequate depth. Natalie Portman is stunning as the pretty and intelligent Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins shows his class as Odin. Tom Hiddleston is flawless as Loki. His performance is top-notch. Christopher Eccleston's performance was polished enough, although his character was a bit boring. So is it a good movie? Yes. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a good sequel and I would say that this exceeds the original in quality. I enjoyed the film although the villain was kind of dull. It may fall in some aspects but overall, this is a great success. And as a Marvel film, check out the two post-credits scenes. Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a well-polished sequel that has great action, excellent chemistry (especially between Thor and Loki), but lacks character in the villain.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

This second independent Thor film in no way disappoints and in my opinion is only topped by The Avengers in likability. The sheer scope of the movie is awesome. We see a lot more of Asgard and get to bounce around to a few of the Nine Realms for a very enjoyable ride. Director, Alan Taylor does a phenomenal job balancing the action (and there is a lot), the drama, and the humor in this film. There are some genuinely touching scenes in this film, something that Marvel, overall, has done a good job with in the Avengers based films.The basic plot involves some pretty nasty Dark Elves and their desire to unleash some cosmic badness, effectively ending the universe as we know it. These elves are tough hombres. They have stealth ships and weapons powerful enough to cause Asgard and our heroes some real problems. But the heart of the film lies in the relationship between Thor, again played perfectly by Chris Hemsworth, and his mischievous brother, Loki, who Tom Hiddleston has made my favorite villain. The best moments are between these two. I won't throw out any spoilers, but I will say that Loki is spectacular.Natalie Portman is back as Jane Foster, Thor's love interest, as is Stellan Skarsgård, who is very fun to watch as Erik Selvig, the slightly off astrophysicist. Anthony Hopkins, puts in another turn as Odin, Thor's old man and conveys a tiredness of the old king as he once again faces war with an old enemy.See this film in the theater. The big screen is the right place to enjoy this piece of epic story telling.

Look at him... swinging his hammer around, flying through the sky, saving countless lives in the Nine Realms he protects... What a guy. His brother Loki might be a bad sort (he's already tried to destroy the world twice) but good ol' Thor will always be there to save the day. And we need him now more than ever... Because some Dark Elf is going to blow up our planet with the aid of The Biggest TV Transmitter Ever.Sadly it pains me to reveal our long-haired demi-god has problems of his own. Ya see, the love of his life, the apple of his eye, (a human FYI, our friend Thor doesn't know the meaning of the word discrimination) has been infected with a rare life-form which will KILL her. For a crisis this big, What will Thor do? What's that you say? Team up with his despised brother on a suicide mission to save the girl and the Earth? I never would have thought...So, yeah. This is exciting. It's thrilling. It also has a naked dude roaming around Stonehenge, but seeing as everything is pixellated, let's not hold that against it too much. The highlight is Loki and Thor's enforced partnership, though it doesn't last very long. Seeing these complete opposites who don't trust each other one inch attempting to fight their enemies and each other simultaneously is great fun. Can you say 'The Odd Couple'? It's got all the popcorn crackling entertainment you'd expect from a Marvel production. Roll on the next one. Until then, I'll have to make do with my handcrafted puppets... 7/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are some fleeting moments of humor, but there's also a lot of gloom and doom. In THOR: THE DARK WORLD, Thor has to save the universe (Avengers anyone?) from Malekith and the Aether. Sure, there's some half-baked scientific explanation for all of it but the end result is a little disappointing. Malekith was a cool-looking villain, but not very engaging or charismatic. There were also a few too many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to impersonate other people. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kind of what I've come to expect from Marvel. The acting is very good, as is the action and visual effects. I still don't buy Natalie Portman as a scientist, but oh well. This isn't Marvel's best, but Phase 2 is going pretty good so far. If you've liked Marvel's previous entries, you should like this one too.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Once the movie caught me interest I stayed caught. The story is coherent without any instantly noticeable plot holes, which is about as much as you can hope for from the typical superhero movie, and there are some nice surprises and some good WOAH moments.

I love marvel movies. In fact, The Avengers was one of the best movies of the last couple of years. While I thought the first Thor movie was the worst of the first wave of Marvel movies, I went into this one with high hopes. But within the first five minutes of the movie I was bored out of my mind. Throughout the entire movie NOTHING happens. They spend the entire movie talking about doing something, or talking about things they did off screen. Even the action scenes were incredibly boring. they just bounced around from punch to punch. Nothing really ever gets resolved. Then there's the writing. The characters are very one dimensional. There dialog was very unrealistic. I mean, no one talks like they do in this movie. And there is absolutely no character development, the characters end the movie exactly where they started! Then there's the villain. I love Eccleston. But they didn't give him anything to do. He simply walks on screen, looks at something, then walks off. He's BORING! Just like everything else in this movie. All this movie is capable of is beating you over the head with all of the pretty lights. And while the movie is gorgeous. That doesn't cover the lack of story. In the end, this movie was terrible. It was one of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen.","70 out of 145 found this helpful.

The director presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend of action and humor and yet it still remembers to pack a heart. The pacing was perfect even though I would've liked to have seen more quality time spent between Jane and Thor. That would've added more credibility to the chemistry and longing they both display for each other. Besides a few minor shortcuts in story, this film packs quite a punch and is every bit as good as I hoped it would be.Just like Iron Man, they played both sides of the fence perfectly. You need know nothing about the character to enjoy the film yet the fans were respected and spotted the little things that service the story but don't really register to non-fans. There are heavy ties to the events of Avengers but since everyone saw Avengers, that's a good thing.I think this sequel is very well written and proves the character and the mythos have layers to explore. They can't jam everything from the past forty years in to one film but they delivered enough smarts to go along with the spectacle to be sure.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's as well to remember this is Marvel-Disney; so what if there's the odd mix of dark menace and light-hearted frivolity, it's only a motion picture after all. I enjoyed the first Thor but the second was even more stylish and enjoyable if weighed down by even more nonsense-science.Er, basically primeval dark forces attack Asgard – and Greenwich, London – pretty obviously via gravity space-time wormholes, Thor's girlfriend Jane is accidentally invested with a sinister Mcguffin power that is chased after by the head baddie (whose physog reminded me of a young Davros from Dr Who), Thor doesn't trust Loki and Loki doesn't blame him, and cartoon bones and concrete are crunched remorselessly from the off. On the way to the crackers climax Thor obediently hangs his hammer up on a handy coat rack and decides to catch a handy tube to get to the final battle in time. Light comedic touches like those always go down well with me, I love panache when trying sell a ridiculous plot or watching a film revelling in brazen brainlessness. It's also the first film I've ever seen to contain a last minute killer twist, then a sinister teaser for the next film, and finally a droll comedy moment to end on but one that would definitely have dire implications for anyone happening to be walking by at that moment! As with the first film I thought Tom Hiddleston stole the show, and Idris Elba had a marvellously enigmatic character to portray. And again, the serious reason for some of the warring sides to fight with swords and some with guns escapes me, as it did at 11 years old reading Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian series. The cgi cartoonery seemed perfect to me, capturing flawless vistas of other worlds and impressive violence alike to these old eyes.The kids would probably make much more sense of it all than I could, and maybe even follow the swift impenetrably dark battles successfully – me, I went along with it in the right spirit and thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean why bother giving it a chance at all unless you want it to work?","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And because I have seen the first part of Thor (I know I haven't reviewed it yet but I will) and really liked not only the overall concept of it, but also how it has been made for viewers to enjoy.Although IMDb suggests that this is an action, adventure and fantasy genre movie I would definitely add comedy to this list as well. You will see in this post later on few silly quotes I fancied, but believe me - there was a lot more where it came from! I was laughing really often although others in the cinema weren't quite as much, so it gets back to your sense and level of humor.Story totally fascinated me by its moving around the time ans space and how it all fit together. Although partly I wished I could get to know other worlds as well but they managed to connect every story on the timeline quite good.This movie totally inspired me at the time I really needed it and especially by showing me really well made bad character. He was gruesome, ingenious, evil and overall resentful. Although from the story I understood that their species weren't left a lot, but in the movie it seemed like quite a lot of them fought and died, and fought more, I would have wanted to understand - where did they came from? Born suddenly, and if so then how? But this was the only thing I couldn't understand as one super strong warrior can't be at all places at the same time to win the war, right?Although I couldn't understand why the quality of effects changed during the movie from really crappy made ones to really great, overall I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely watch it few time more.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

For all the action extravagance and adventure, a surprising connection occurs here. This certainly isn't some wild video game popcron flick. It also packs the perfect amount of comedy and connection. It's what Marvel does best, give us heroes with flaws.A lot of this film takes place hopping across realms and that was absolutely the right way to present the film. The fantastical elements really work. Asgard is breathtaking and incredible. They manage to be dramatic and serious most of the time but balance it with a sense of humor. Thor finds the right mix similar to the way Avengers did. The film never becomes too self-important or portentous but still is dramatic and fun. That is something to savor and enjoy. Sure, viewers are thrilled by his powers, but we relate to his emotions and his flaws. Add some intense sibling rivalry, great action and romantic entanglements and Thor may just be the best movie of the year.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

While I enjoyed it, I felt it didn't have quite the ""wow"" factor the first film had. The mood throughout is somber, both in look and feel, with the occasional bit of humor (mostly from Kat Dennings). The story is more complex and I'm not of the camp that feels that is always a good thing. Once again, the cast is great although it seems the supporting characters like Sif and The Warriors Three are largely wasted. Odin is especially pompous and unbearable this time around. When you have Thor having to counsel his father on peace not war, it feels at times like this isn't even the same Odin from the first film. Obviously the sci-fi gobbledygook elements will please many. I'm referring to the Aether nonsense and everything surrounding it. It's one of those ""shut your brain off to enjoy it"" moments for me. Also, Loki's trick of using illusions or impersonating people was used way too much. It made the last time he uses it in the film less effective. The villain Malekith is uncharismatic and, frankly, dull. Finally, the look of the film wasn't my favorite. This is just a stylistic preference but I felt it was too ""Lord of the Rings"". Everything was muted colors and kind of depressing. The first film was much brighter and felt like more of a superhero movie. Stick with what has worked for you, Marvel. Let DC make their dour superhero films. Keep it bright.OK, now you read all that and you probably wonder how I can say I still enjoyed the film. Well, I loved the performances from Hemsworth and Hiddleston. I also liked Kat Dennings and appreciated how she lightened things up. Natalie Portman had way more to do than the first film and was enjoyable and pretty as usual. While I said I didn't care for the overall dark look of the film, I did admire the special effects. They were very well done, save for the opening scene which was a little too fake with obvious CGI soldiers. Ultimately, I enjoyed it enough but it wasn't one of my favorite Marvel films. Thor is my favorite Marvel superhero and I loved the first movie. I realize a lot of fans are rabid about these films and have a ""you either love it or hate it"" mentality but I'm in the middle. I liked it but I didn't love it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I fell asleep early on, went to get popcorn and soda to wake up; after another 30 min found myself dozing again. This is amazing considering it was cold and very loud in the theater. Forgive me, I like story development, and characters to root for, or root against. There is nothing worthy here. This was made because the previous entry made money, so why not chase the cheddar shall we?! Hollywood and their overuse of CGI is increasingly bad and overdone. The characters hop around, as they do in Man of Steel another bad flick. They move really fast and do things we could never imagine characters doing 30 years ago on screen. Well so what?! It looks sooo fake and the result is an unimportant, needless and ridiculously boring movie.

Yes the Asgardian Odinson, the God of Thunder. And blame that on the 2010 movie Thor. Compared to other Marvel movies at the time, I found Thor to be lackluster. There was action, there were epic set- pieces, there was fish-outta-water comedy and most of all was the origin story of Thor and Loki who'd be seen more in the upcoming The Avengers. But while Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk set the perfect stage for The Avengers, Thor's origin story faltered at it. I could only see it as a companion piece to the Marvel Phase One and nothing else.Directed by Alan Taylor, who's directed a whole bunch of HBO Shows, Thor The Dark World's story takes place in Asgard and London, presumably coz New York was still in ruins post the incidents from The Avengers. And our world's once again at stake, all thanks to the Dark Elf Malekith and Thor is instinctively called upon by Jane Foster who, of all the people, stumbles on the very thing Malekith wantssome gooey evil thing called the Aether. We are once again counting on Thor to save the day (or save Jane). Thor The Dark World is as drab as the original but I was impressed with the pacing of the movie. It had a lot of fun moments as well touchy drama sprinkled around. Usually I'd be taking mental notes when the movie gets drab but Thor The Dark World didn't give a chance for that. Was it coz the movie was that good? NO! Was it entertaining? YES! I was constantly thrown around from one set piece to another. The movie also cleverly manages to incorporate several nods to The Avengers and its upcoming sequel as well S.H.I.E.L.D., as the story progressed.Chris Hemsworth once again dorns his Asgardian armor and cape as the Thor and he was very much in character and makes me wonder if he's always so. Then again, having seen his Red Dawn, I need not raise a bet. I was not a Loki fan, neither in Thor nor in The Avengers. But here he was just mind blowing. I'd say this one is one of his finest performances ever. A real show stealer! And a particular scene with a grief stricken Loki showed every bit of it. An immediate comparison would be to Heath Ledger's Joker but we all know that ain't so.To my surprise, the gorgeous Natalie Portman, once again takes up the role of Jane Foster. Is she being a good Samaritan not leaving the role for somebody else? Or is she really rooting to play the role again? An actress of such caliber does need her own break and I suppose Jane Foster makes for a wonderful one. Christopher Eccleston plays Malekith with admirable sincerity but I felt his character was severely underwritten and towards the end he felt lesser and lesser intimidating.Kat Dennings is just plain annoying. I don't know why. Despite the few smirks that her Darcy delivered, she felt more like a character which was being dragged onto this one just coz she was there in the first one. Other notable roles include Zachary Levi's Fandral, Idris Elba's Heimdall and an old but exceptionally well-acted Odin by Anthony Hopkins. And btw I feel Jaimie Alexander would make a spectacular Diana (Wonder Woman).If you can forgive the weak story and its tendency to inject humor at odd moments, Thor The Dark World is thoroughly enjoyable and will be entertaining even for people not keeping up with the Marvel Phases. I for one, was glad that as a stand alone movie, it entertains and excels more than its predecessor.PS: Stay back for two shawarmas after the credits roll.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Natalie Portman returns as an astrophysicist and Thor's earth babe, Jane Porter, who's infected by an eerie otherworldly substance called aether. After Thor brings Jane to Asgard, war breaks out when the dark elf, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), comes for the powerful substance.The Thor comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms: the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories. Like the first movie, this sequel is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).The bulk of the movie takes place on Asgard and the sci-fi effects are just mind-blowing; I particularly like Malekith's spacecrafts and the Asgardian ship-crafts. Thankfully, there are some Earth sequences, including the dynamic climax in London. Bottom Line: This is a thrilling sequel; if you like the first movie you'll appreciate this one too.ADDITIONAL CAST: Anthony Hopkins appears as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Rene Russo as Frigga, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, Zachary Levi as Fandral, Ray Stevenson as Volstaag, Tadanobu Asano as Hogan, Kat Dennings as Darcy and Stellan Skarsgård as Eric.The movie runs 112 minutes and was shot in England and Iceland, with additional studio work done in Manhattan Beach, California.GRADE: B+","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jane (Natalie Portman) has been infected with a powerful elixir that causes Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves to return to Asgard in an attempt to retrieve the elixir.REVIEW:
This film isn't terrible, but when comparing it to a lot of the other MCU films, it falls a little flat. The whole ""Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) is crazy"" bit that they play for a lot of the film came off quite random and wasn't necessary. Then this film really made me realize that the character of Darcy (Kat Dennings) is completely pointless. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Denning is bad as Darcy and there are even a few moments that I fount quite funny with her, however, absolutely doesn't help the story in any way. As a sorta kinda mannish character that doesn't work. It's also very clear in this film that despite being in a science group, she knows absolutely nothing about science. At least make the character worth something in that realm. Aside from that, I felt that we didn't see any progressive character arc for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) We had a less funny version of himself separate from his other film and The Avengers. Honestly, I felt there was much more to Loki (Tom Hiddleston) than Thor. I found myself wanting to get to the scenes with Loki. Other than that, I think the film was serviceable. The action was decent, good amount of conflict and some entertaining moments. I didn't mind the film as much as I was dreading watching it. 6.0/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

With no surprise, expectations were high on how this film would handle the resurrection of the hammer- wielding god of thunder considering how the cinematic universe is set speak to the fanbase rather than Hollywood's general expectations. This only bring us to the question of whether it succeeds. The answers lies square in between yes and no. Kenneth Branaugh who directed the first film dropped out of the project, and the director's chair was handed over to Alan Taylor. The final outcome shows the Branaugh holds a slightly more gifted handling on the source material whereas Taylor's rendition of the titular hero leaves more to desired. By no means does this mark a disaster of a sequel but rather a disappointing one to say the least. It has the sleek visual scope that everyone would expect to come from a big- budget MCU entry, but what it has to offer from a narrative standpoint is fairly underwhelming. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor, the god of thunder who returns to Earth to find his lover Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) cursed by a mysterious force known as Aether, a sinister weapon helmed from a dark realm. And the evil leader Malekith (played by Christopher Eccleston) is behind all this. When Thor brings Jane to Asgard to learn what's happening to her, his father Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) lacks interest is helping. This leaves Thor with no one to turn to but his dubious brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) in a fight against Malekith and his army of Dark Elves in an effort to free Jane of this sinister curse. Watching Thor battle against the evil demonic forces, thrashing his lightning-charge hammer in an ass-kicking frenzy should be a whole lot of fun. For awhile, it has its moments of excitement, but it is not too long before the excitement steadily starts to drain out beneath the underwhelming storyline. The film does what its predecessor did best, and that is setting up the story with an intriguing premise involving a mythological war raging between Asgard and the evil forces that threaten the mythical realm. Once the the plot kicks into gear, it settles with something less interesting than what is promised. The first half moves along a series of frenetic, visually-arousing action sequences intertwined with overlong exposition used to establish our new main villain Malekith, who is played cleanly by Christopher Eccleston, but nonetheless fails to grow as an interesting figure. Whereas Tom Hiddleston's Loki flourished with charisma that made him a compelling villain, Malekith lacks depth and feels awfully generic which only renders it final climatic sequence less effective; though not without plenty of sweet special effects to go around. As for Chris Hemsworth, he remains charismatic ever as ever in the title role as does Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki who's alignment on both the good side and the bad side stands ambiguous. Meanwhile, Natalie Portman is restrained in the damsel-in-distress role that operates more as a plot device than a solid character. Many will be wishing she and Hemsworth demonstrated a much stronger chemistry.Thor: Dark World marks a fairly inferior chapter to the now- franchise, and ends on a rather disappointing note. However, it is not to say that Alan Taylor doesn't offer the goods in terms of special effects action elan to occupy those who are able to skim past the patchy flaws in its script. Compared to other entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this makes for a lesser option, but maybe one worth at least a try for better or worse. After all, the movie is not a total washout","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

One of the campier Avengers who was surrounded by full-blown fantasy elements, the Norse God with a big red cape and hammer wasn't even being played by a well known star. What a difference two years and a box office behemoth in the form of The Avengers makes. This sequel comes with virtually no risk and a lead actor who is now a bona fide A-lister, but it also comes with much higher hopes. Swapping Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian influence for Alan Taylor's Game of Thrones experience, The Dark World has decreased it's regality and amped up it's grittiness, yet thankfully retains its sense of fun. There's definitely a feel of greater peril here, with no-one but Thor seemingly out of Taylor's reach for a fatal ending, however for every scene of despair or Dark Elven malevolence, there's a hilarious gag (Loki's shapeshifting and any time Stellan Skarsgard's nutty scientist is on screen are highlights) waiting around the corner. The action set-pieces don't disappoint either; the climactic battle is inventive, if not mind-blowing, and a couple of earlier melees - including an attack on Asgard - are exhilarating and keep the pace moving swiftly along. What elevates this follow up though is the pairing of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who, after two previous movies to build up their brotherly baggage and perfect their repartee, are scintillating whether in the process of a daring escape or just engaging in some general chit chat. Fulfils its blockbuster quota of action spectacle whilst adding a healthy dose of spot-on humour and sharply written dialogue - what's not to like?","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in custody and has been imprisoned for life on Asgard, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has brought peace to the nine realms, and all is good in the universe. Or so it would seem.Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her intern, Darcy (Kat Dennings), noticed some gravitational anomalies in London. Jane stumbled into a wormhole of sorts and wound up with some dark matter in her body called Aether. That was Marvel's hackneyed way of putting Thor and Jane back together again.We find out that the gravitational anomaly is due to the nine realms coming into alignment; a phenomenon called ""The Convergence."" This happens once every 5000 years, and it's a big deal because a dark elf named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) wants to capitalize upon this event by releasing the powerful Aether in order to bring darkness to all nine realms. Didn't we just escape a world threatening disaster?Thor will have to figure out a way to stop Malekith and save the nine realms. Standard superhero stuff. It's a bit anticlimactic after watching ""The Avengers."" Instead of seeing multiple heroes do their thing we're relegated to one guy and his helpers. I'm glad he saved the world for us mortals even if it wasn't that exciting.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The cast, led by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, did a great job once again. Supporting actors Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, and so many more really are amazing. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pace being too quick and difficult to keep up with. My response? Don't take stupid people to see the movie. I honestly don't see how anyone would have trouble keeping up with the pace of the film. I thought the plot development was actually one of the stronger parts of the film. Another strong element was the humor. Like the first installment, there was a lot of situational humor. However, this movie took it to an entirely new level and didn't feel forced and out of place. Most of this is thanks to the aforementioned Kat Dennings and her unique comedic flair. Also, watch for the Captain America cameo for maybe the most humorous scene in the film. The action sequences were up to par with the rest of the movies, meaning they were epic. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The only negative in the movie, and I'm really not sure if it's a fair one, is that I wanted more Lady Sif. I'm sorry but you have one of the most beautiful women in the world, who happens to be a fantastic actress, playing one of the most badass and intriguing roles in the movie and she's barely even relevant? You've gotta do better than that. Supposedly she originally had a more prominent role even creating somewhat of a love triangle but the studio ultimately decided to trim that back, essentially eliminating a large chunk of her screen time. After some thought I decided it didn't really ""hurt"" the film so I won't let it affect the rating but I would've liked liked to see her more. Hopefully we'll get that in the special features when it releases on blu-ray. Overall, I'd say this is probably the third best Avengers film yet, behind Iron Man and The Avengers. Hopefully they continue to deliver because they've got one helluva series going.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

There is enough surprise moment and humor to keep it ongoing and sustainable. Movie lends shameless elements from Star Wars and Lord of The Rings movies and combines them together to an original adventure. Movie looks and sounds beautiful. Bouncing between different dimensions could easily be confusing but director Alan Taylor keeps them tightly together. Even the length of the movie is suitable, less than two hours, which is great remittance despite all the action and scenery. That ensures that you won't get bored and movie rumbles through it's duration like fast train. Balance between humor and drama is great in spite of some murky moments. It is good to see that Marvel takes good care it's movies and combines finely different productions. That ensures nice comic feeling in their movies. Unquestionably Thor: The Dark world is Marvel's elite in these comic book adaptions. The end of the movie promises more sequels for this sledge hammer hero. I just hope they have more courage to bring elements from Asgard mythology in upcoming sequels. That would make this even more enjoyable movie experience. Hemsworth is good choice as Thor but Natalie Portman's role leaves a little bit too easy. Great entertainment no matter what.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Jane was the love interest in the original movie and she has now been hot with something that has given her a strange power. Thor returns to Earth to protect her from the evil Dark Elves.This is a very worthy sequel. It was made after the Avengers Assemble, so if you are going to watch these movies in order, then watch the original Thor, then the Avengers Assemble and then this.The story is really good. I like the way that Jane has got more involved in the fight this time around. Thor takes her up to Asgard to protect her so most of the movie is set up there. As I have stated in the original review, the vision of Asgard is so colourful and beautiful so I was happy that a lot more of the movie was set up there.As before, the effects were very good and the fighting scenes were great. The action was a lot of fun and kept you glued to the screen.The main thing I didn't like about this film was how quickly Thor had forgiven Loki for what he had done. Thor needs his help and understand that, but he should never forgive him for destruction and death he has caused in the last 2 movies. It just didn't feel right.The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston and Christopher Eccleston. The acting seemed better in this movie than the last one. It was great to see Christopher in this. I have always liked him and thought he did a great job in this.The make-up looked great too... the creatures looked really creepy and fit in really well into the movie.This is a good movie and if you enjoyed the original one then you will like this.""Well done, you just decapitated your Grandfather.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Marvel takes a full-on sci-fi/fantasy approach with 'Dark World'","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2904099/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2013","Most moviegoers probably didn't realize Thor was a comic book character in the Marvel universe before his big-screen debut in 2011. Flash forward just two and a half years later and Chris Hemsworth has portrayed the Norse god of thunder three times already. ""Thor: The Dark World"" looks to continue riding the post-""Avengers"" wave, but Avengers cameos and S.H.I.E.L.D references aside, it's not what most audiences have come to know as a superhero movie.This won't matter for the target audience of ""Thor: The Dark World."" I count myself among the many who get giddy over mentions of realms, Dark Elves and powerful Aether. These, however, are the hallmarks of sci fi/fantasy. So, let the record state that ""The Dark World"" falls most definitively in that category, because if that doesn't excite you, ""The Dark World"" most likely won't.Marvel Studios hasn't misfired since ""Iron Man 2,"" which — all superhero films ever considered — wasn't that much of a misfire. Thor's second solo outing more or less measures similarly to Iron Man's. The movie just doesn't have much going for it besides its geek-tastic charms, a charismatic leading man and one of the most complex and lovable villains in Loki (Tom Hiddleston).Anything that opens with a scene explaining a battle that happened long ago in which a villain and an evil power were thought to be sealed away forever better be ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" otherwise it belongs in a video game. Unfortunately, that's the sour note ""The Dark World"" begins on, explaining how Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim tried to use a powerful dark matter called Aether to cast the nine realms in darkness exactly 5,000 years ago, the last time all nine realms aligned. Of course, such things happen every 5,000 years, and when Thor's love, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), happens upon the Aether, Malekith awakens to take his vengeance.""Thor: The Dark World"" shares a lot of characteristics with ""Star Trek,"" jumping between realms as ""Star Trek"" does planets, introducing new species with cool spaceships and cooler weapons. Asgard comes to life with the same aesthetic that original ""Thor"" director Kenneth Branagh and the Marvel Studios creative team dreamed up a few years ago, but ""Dark World"" director Alan Taylor (""Game of Thrones"") gets to play around in it. The film is almost unapologetic in the way it splashes around in sci-fi/fantasy hallmarks, and Taylor's fight sequences are a significant improvement from the first ""Thor"" in terms of style.Taylor was also a decent pick in terms of familial tensions in fantasy. The Thor-Loki dynamic was a highlight in the first film, and given that Loki caused all the mischief in ""The Avengers,"" it's twice as interesting watching Hiddleston and Hemsworth together. Hiddleston in particular continues to step even deeper into the role in this film, though Loki is mostly relegated to a subplot except for the film's most exciting sequence, when Thor and the Warriors Three enlist his help to try and trick Malekith. The script takes full advantage of his trickster powers, but also creates an intriguing character arc for him. It's hard to say if it's the writing and Hiddleston that make Loki a huge highlight of ""The Dark World,"" or the notion of his subplot also serving as a continuation of what happened in ""The Avengers"" and a precursor to what will come in ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron."" Either way, ""The Dark World"" has significantly more of a post-""Avengers"" component than ""Iron Man 3"" did. The script also shares the same sense of humor that gave the first ""Thor"" its charm. Hemsworth is such a presence that when he gets to deliver a subtle a joke it has an ironic twist to it that works every time. The humor revolving around the human characters, however, such as Kat Dennings (who needs to not appear in these films ever again — she isn't going to be the deciding factor for teenage girls thinking of buying tickets), tends to be corny. Predictably, Portman is a wasted talent yet again as Foster is further reduced to a damsel in distress fawning over Thor despite his tendency to run off to other realms and leave her for extended periods of time.Given Marvel Studios' pedigree, it's fair to call ""Thor: The Dark World"" underwhelming. Plenty to look at, laugh at and geek out over, but a film that will ultimately be seen as a gap-filler between two epic ""Avengers"" films. That's okay for Thor, because you don't necessarily have to give grounding to a fantastical character from such a strange universe, but some effort to make the film a bit suspenseful and prove a trial for the main characters might've helped stave off our wild anticipation for May 2015.~Steven CThanks for reading!

But Malekith is stopped by Bor (Tony Curran) and the armies of Asgard.After the events of The Avengers, Loki has been taken to the prisons of Asgard, only to avoid a death sentence by the grace of his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo) as Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends try to bring peace to the Nine Realms. Soon, Thor is drawn back to Earth when Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) makes a discovery of a strange an anomaly in London. Thor takes Jane to Asgard where the realm the Dark Elves attack with the fabric of reality at stake.The filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World go for the approach that bigger is better. There is more action, larger stakes, lots of fantasy and plenty of battles. TV director Alan Taylor, best known for his work on Game of Thrones shows great confidence with transition to film. The action is bigger and a improvement upon the first film, getting massive battles and fights and more regular. Audiences can easily geek out as it blends medieval weaponry, magic and laser battles.Thor: The Dark World goes the whole hog with its blend of sci-fi and fantasy, from a Lord of the Rings style opening, the gravity anomaly in London looking like something from a Doctor Who episode and the use of spaceships. It is a film that is completely unashamed about its comic book origins and 10-year-old boys and the 10-year-old inside all of us will love it.The events on Earth and Asgard are juxtaposed by two different styles. The action in Asgard is treated seriously with the full embraced of the fantasy, whilst the Earth scenes are much more light hearted. Kat Dennings continues to be the comic relief and this time she has comedy with her own intern played by Jonathan Howard and Stellan Skarsgård's Dr Selvig is relegated to running around Stonehenge naked and being locked into mental hospital.Taylor does put his stamp all over Thor: The Dark World, making a visually darker film by using dark cinematography and the art direction for Asgard is clearly influenced by Game of Thrones. Asgard has more of grounded medieval look in Thor: The Dark World then the grand look of Kenneth Branagh's film.Thor: The Dark World is a strong continuation of the Thor series and this is illustrated with the relationship between Thor and Loki. The characters have learned from each other and their experience and the relationship has evolved into one of banter between the brothers. Loki continues to be the most interesting villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and shows growth with his tragedy and pain.Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston took on the villain and he does the job well, giving a professional performance as Malekith, He may not have the depth of Loki and his motivations are stock, but he does a great job. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and his large stature as Kurse gave Thor a big physical challenge that he needed and leads to a massive fight.Thor: The Dark World is far from deep or meaningful, but it's a fun ride and an entertaining fantasy adventure that raises improves on the action level and strong follow-up to the series.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was never a big fan of Thor when I saw the first movie but what really made me a fan was when i saw The Avengers. I was still a bit skeptical but after the first 30 min i was hooked. It was a rollarcoaster of action, drama, and a few laughs. It was so much fun watching this movie even though i just watched in 2D but i will definitely go see it again in Imax 3D. Loki is my favorite villain in the Marvel world I love him! Every scene with Loki was wonderful! Man hes a sick bastard but i love it. I know who I'm dressing up as next year at Comic Con ;) I strongly recommend seeing Thor the Dark World its great for the whole family and the crazy nerd like myself.

However as soon as those were over the movie started rather slowly and took too long to get on track. I felt like quite some time was wasted on comic relief and attempting to explain unnecessary things, instead of character development and the much needed spotlight on the motivation behind certain characters. This made the movie a little bit boring in some scenes and prevented before mentioned characters from truly flourishing, which is a pity. Thankfully the pacing went up a notch after the first act. The movie ended the best way possible and left me hyped for the upcoming MCU movies.I liked the villains. However, where the main villain was quite menacing in some scenes, I do think he was equally unimpressive in other scenes. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was good, although I wished the screenwriters had given him better lines and the director would push him to show more emotion in some scenes. As much as I like Chris, I do think his performance in Rush was better than here. I also wished that Thor's inner struggles were fleshed out a bit more. Tom Hiddleston as Loki was flawless, and without a doubt Loki stole the show in every scene he was in. Loki got nice character development in this movie, and when I look at his journey from Thor to the Avengers to this movie, I think the directors and Hiddleston did a great job with the character.Overall I liked this movie, so my rating would be 7.5/10","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"","","Not quite as compelling nor emotionally engaging as its predecessor, this post-Avengers sequel still packs plenty of jaw-dropping action and some well-placed humour","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2896642/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 2013","Like 'Iron Man 3', 'Thor: The Dark World' finds us reunited with the hammer-wielding Norse demigod in a post-Avengers world, where - for the benefit of those who may not remember - Loki was last seen returned to his home planet of Asgard in manacles after wrecking half of New York following a megalomaniac plot to take over Earth. And so, picking up right after the events of that movie, one of the very early scenes has Loki meeting his stepfather and King, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), expressing absolutely no remorse for his actions before being committed to a glass- walled whited-out cell in the dungeon.It's a huge pity we say, keeping Loki locked up for pretty much the first hour of the movie; indeed, the best moments of 'Thor: The Dark World' are when Thor and his vengeful adopted brother Loki share the same screen, forging a shaky alliance to take down a common enemy that has united them (surprisingly) in grief. Thanks to their combined charisma, this sequel defies the second-act doldrums of most movies, truly coming to life at the halfway mark - beginning with Thor's treacherous plan to spring Loki out of prison (with the help of his pals of course) and continuing on to the black dunes of Svartalfheim where the squabbling siblings confront their foe. Yet, not to get ahead of ourselves, there is of course a fair bit of scene-setting that needed to have taken place in order for our favourite hero and anti-hero to be brought together under those circumstances. Working from a story from Don Payne and Robert Rodat, screenwriters Christopher L. Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely spin a Tolkiensque plot where the leader of an antagonistic alien race, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), returns to plot the destruction of the Nine Realms using an all-powerful source of dark matter known as the Aether.Long story short, a once-in-5000-years cosmic occurrence is about to converge the realms across time and space, which inadvertently causes Thor's Earthly love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) to fall into a different realm when investigating the phenomenon and be infected with the Aether. Malekith wants her, so Thor jumps to her rescue to bring her back to Asgard - though the price of his half-valiant and half-selfish (after all, he does want to be close to her) act is laid bare when Malekith arrives at the kingdom and launches a deadly assault on Odin's palace. Switching back and forth between Asgard and Earth, the trio of Yost, Markus and McFeely clearly struggle to find a consistent tone especially at the start. While the threat facing Asgard is treated with the utmost seriousness and solemnity, the proceedings back on Earth unfold with strained humour - whether the awkwardness between Jane's understudy Darcy (Kat Dennings) and her new intern Ian (Jonathan Howard), or even the odd behaviour of Jane's old mentor, Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), who goes butt naked in public at the Stonehenge. Between the two, we are much better off at Asgard, where veteran 'Game of Thrones' director Alan Taylor is on more familiar territory.It is also at Asgard that Taylor will stage the film's first stunning setpiece, which culminates in the turning point that sees Thor and Loki form that unlikely partnership. Malekith's assault on Asgard is staged with impressive clarity, starting from their stealth crossing at the Bi- frost bridge to their aerial attack of Asgard's defences to their storming of Odin's palace. There is little doubt Taylor's experience on the HBO series has placed him in good stead here, and more than previous director Kenneth Branagh, he demonstrates a boldness and imagination to stage the action on a much larger canvas.That is also a nice segue into the reunion of Thor and Loki, which proves rewarding not just in the witty energetic banter that follows but also in yet another wowing setpiece that has the pair teaming up to outsmart Malekith. There is also crackling tension between them, especially since one knows better from the events of 'Thor' and 'The Avengers' than to trust the scheming Loki to have abandoned his insatiable thirst for power and position. Unfortunately, Loki doesn't quite have a place in the nonetheless outstandingly conceived finale set in Greenwich, London; that said, what adrenaline Loki's return brings to the film is still very much intact by the final showdown rolls around.Kudos to Taylor for putting up not just a thrilling, but also an extremely fun exercise in physical displacement at the climax, as Thor pursues Malekith across multiple dimensions in the midst of the convergence. Rather than just visual spectacle, there is good tongue-in- cheek fun to be had as the characters appear and disappear from one realm to another without forewarning - and we especially like that one which ends up with Thor taking the Tube three stations from Charing Cross to Greenwich. Unlike Christopher Nolan's superhero screen incarnations 'The Dark Knight' and even 'Man of Steel', Marvel has never failed to find humour in the midst of spectacle, and this enormously entertaining finale is a great example of that.And yet compared to Branagh's origin story, there is still something lacking in this sequel. For one, the narrative isn't quite as compelling this time round - especially as Malekith proves quite the underwhelming villain. For another, it lacks the humanity that made its predecessor something more - and by this we mean not just the bond between Thor and Loki, but also that between Thor and Jane. Still, you cannot fault the assuredness of the performances by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, nor for that matter the action, otherworldly grandiosity and occasionally well-placed humour that makes it an overall crowdpleaser - if anything, it proves the Marvel juggernaut continues to be very much in shape, no less evident from a mid-credit and a post-credit scene that will have its fans in rapture.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Yet another mediocre output from Marvel, sure it's not bad, in fact, it's completely watchable but is that all we demand from blockbusters anymore?Though, that is not to say Thor 2 is without its merits. It's greatest achievement is perhaps it's absolutely flawless production design. I'll congratulate the fellow who could find a single fault within the sets, costumes, make-up and/or CGI and even directing and acting. Moreover there are more than a handful of Grade A action/comedy sequences that truly transcend the film and may I say, are completely kickass.But there are some major things wrong with the film and with a production this flawless, the blame can only fall on one spot... The writing.As a screenwriter myself I got a lot to complain about here, I'll try to keep it short but get ready for a roast...Character development is lacking with no real motivation for the Dark Elves actions and no significant growth in Thor or other characters by the end of the film. The pacing is uneven and sporadic, with way too many breaks for exposition. Which brings me to..Too many things set up and not enough payoffs, ex: whatever happened to the Asian guy in the beginning? I would have loved to see that tie together to something at the end.And lastly, there is a lack of momentum and sense of scale to the story. Instead of a slow build to a giant payoff the movie sort of meanders and wanders. Worst of all , even though apparently the entire universe is on the line it never feels that way. I mean what the hell?! the Dark Elf invasion of earth is like one ship and a few dozen soldiers..End roast.Long story short, Thor 2 is a beautiful film to look at but overall suffers from a script that doesn't do justice to the material. Though, despite the scripts numerous shortcomings it has just enough moments of brilliance to keep you watching all the way through. If you keep your expectations low you'll have a decent time with the movie, just don't expect much.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms – it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness. But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us – that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe.

In theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. But a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. X2 was better than X-Men. Spider-Man 2 was better than the first. And now that I've seen it, I can tell you Thor: The Dark World is better than Thor. (And the fact that these are all Marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, when I only saw it for the first time just this spring. In fact, I watched it again the same week. Which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. So I was really looking forward to tonight and I was not disappointed.Thor 2 was helmed by a different director, Alan Taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but I take my hat off to him. What I admire is that he managed to capture the tone that Branagh set in the first film flawlessly – even perfected it in a way. He brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: Taylor made Thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. I take my hat off to the writers as well – they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. Had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. I found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. Even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. Now that's good entertainment. Two thumbs up.The actors all wear their roles like a custom- made suit. It's obvious that Chris Hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. This guy IS Thor, hands down. The same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. The one that intrigued me most, however, was Loki – personified absolutely magnificently by Tom Hiddleston. Much like Hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. He captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. And then that grin Perfection. The way Hiddleston plays Loki is strangely captivating. You know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him – you might even end up rooting for this guy, and I'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.All the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. I have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and Asgard looked even more beautiful than before. It was all convincing and very well done. Still, I have not completely explained why T:TDW is better than the first. Actually, I might not fully be able to. It's mostly a feeling. As much as I was entertained the first time, I was even more entertained now. It was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline. The only thing that I think was weaker in this film, was the character of Jane Foster. Her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. I actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped Thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her Also she was somewhat of a damsel-in- distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. It's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with ""three degrees in physics"" (as Darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. Most of the time, Natalie Portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. So maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it. Having said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. Every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. Those two hours went by in the blink of a eye. Thor: The Dark World is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every Marvel fan. In fact – at the risk of enraging the Marvel Gods – this might just be pretty stiff competition to X-Men Watch out Wolverine, I think I have a new favorite superhero.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Unpredictably 'The Dark World' is above what I think it would be. 'Marvel: The Avengers' franchise has never been this much fun since first 'Iron Man'. Alan Taylor as director dares to take risks in storyline and makes it out from comfort zone. Some action scenes are entertaining and sometimes hilarious, especially when Loki involved. Thor character is shown much more development than the previous movie. In 'The Dark World', Thor is described more grown up and more responsible to save Asgard and Earth from villain's threat. Also the studio has succeeded to exploit Thor's power in this movie that doesn't happen in first franchise or in 'The Avengers'. The presence of Malekith has succeeded enough to give good impression as villain. Perhaps there's quite disorganized in plot and some jokes aren't in the right place. Overall, 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the most memorable superhero movie this year, also great one from 'The Avengers' franchise. The IMAX 3D is worth to watch though.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm really not going to waste any time going over a ""plot"" because there really isn't much of one. I'm sure die-hard fans of Marvel are going to love this film but to me it was just very pretty looking but rather hollow. I was surprised at how effective the first film was and looking back on it, it's clear that director Kenneth Branagh had a lot to do with that. The first film had a very strong story, great characters, good performances and an energy that not many action films have. This one here is pretty much missing all of that stuff and instead we're just given routine action scenes that are quite loud coming from the speakers but they contain very little else. You know you're in trouble whenever an action picture has non-stop action and yet you continue to yawn. The entire movie just seemed so flat from an energy standpoint and to me it was clear that director Alan Taylor just wasn't able to pump up any emotion. The action scenes are incredibly flat and even the better than average CGI effects couldn't make up for it. Even worse is that the characters are all rather one-note with no real surprises to be found. There's no question that Hemsworth is perfect for Thor and he manages to turn in another good performance. Portman seems rather bored or just doing the film due to a contract forcing her. Even Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo appear bored this time out. Tom Hiddleston does a very good job in the role of Loki and he's without question the best thing in the picture. Kat Dennings offers up the only amount of energy in the film. Thankfully, unlike many other Marvel movies, this one here keeps its running time rather short and for that I'm very thankful.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The story makes little to no sense and incorporates all the tropes one would expect: the monster of the week (Dark Elves this time around, the Frost Giants seem to be a distant memory), some enemies become friends and Chris Hemsworth takes of his shirt.However, even though I've never been a fan of 'accepting something for what it is', that is exactly what this movie forces you to do. It doesn't attempt to make any sense, nor does it even slightly attempt to take itself seriously. I think the last time I laughed out loud so much during a movie was watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and that says a lot.This movie truly is a stellar example of an action comedy, but could benefit greatly from a slightly more coherent plot.

Thor is going thru out the nine realms trying to restore order. wars have broken out as a result of Loki's interference. When Thor has brought peace to the nine realms. He is once again offered the throne of Asgard. But Thor misses Jane Foster. On Earth Jane discovers the long lost hidden doomsday forged by the dark elves. The Dark ones want to bring an end to light and restore the universe to darkness. Jane absorbs the weapon and it possesses her. The one thing making all of this possible is a alignment of the nine realms that occurs once every five thousand years. It happens briefly. but it lasts long enough to waken the Dark Elf overlord who plans to destroy Asgard. And then destroy light. Thor returns to Earth to discover JAne is now the living embodiment of the deadly weapon. He brings her to Asgard to try to find a cure for her. But the Dark Lord follows. Asgard is in danger and all of life hangs in the balance as Thor must find a way to defeat the monster. His only hope is a unholy partnership with Loki.Thor the dark world is simply a better movie then Iron man III. The action is impressive. The acting is very well done and the direction is sharp.

In his attempt to get it (in order to destroy the universe) war broke out between the Dark Elves and Aasgard which ended up in the Dark Elves being annihilated and the Aether buried forever. Or so everybody thought. As it so happens Malekith managed to escape and due to a rare convergence of the realms the Aether has become uncovered. And Malekith wants it badly. The only problem is that ""Jane Foster"" (Natalie Portman) has not only discovered it but it has also infected her very soul. Recognizing Jane's serious plight Thor takes her to Aasgard for medical care. So in order for Malekith to acquire the Aether he now has to battle all of Aasgard in the process. Anyway, rather than detail the entire story and risk spoiling the picture for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good movie which had plenty of action and humor throughout. In all honesty though I thought there were some parts which seemed to drag a bit while other parts went overboard with the graphic action. In any case, this was quite enjoyable and I rate it as above average.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even tho the story is your typical superhero fair, (bad guy wants to destroy the universe, good guy fights to stop him) it isn't typically told. There is a abundance of superhero action to be had, but also some really tight emotional moments as well,as characters grow, die, morn, go a bit nuts, and laugh together (and we with them). Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are virtually unrecognizable under their make up as the chief villain, Malekith and his henchman Kurse, but that doesn't stop them from oozing malice every time they are on screen. Chris Helmsworth is still rocking' the God of Thunder thing exceptionally well as does the rest of the returning cast in their respective roles (with some stellar work from Hopkins as Odin)....all except Natalie Portman. She is the one and only drawback to TtDW. Without going in to too much detail here, she was contractually forced to return for the sequel, and it shows in her phoned in performance. But the shining moment of the whole film for me was, of course Hiddles, who returns to his third go 'round as Loki with great scene-chewing aplomb. Every time Hiddles' Loki hits the screen we can see something working behind his eyes. Plot, scheme, love, or hate..we're really not sure....but you can't take your eyes off him.Loki's not the villain here..nor is he the hero...he is a live wire, or loose cannon, if you will, we never know what he'll do or say next, all we know is he's having more fun than a Norse god should be allowed to.But underneath all the bravado and anger Loki exudes, thanks to Hiddles layered performance, we are treated to moments when Loki's conflicted (after the death of someone he supposedly hates) and that he also has a protective side (puts his body between destruction and a mortal) for those he ""likes"". Loki will never be a hero like his ""big brother"", but TtDW shows he has the potential, if not the desire.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even the actors seem a little lacklustre and not fully committed to their roles. It should be better as there is so much talent in this cast but a bad script will always hurt a movie.I know I'm going to cope flack for this but Thor is certainly the worst marvel superhero that has been turned into a movie.

Sure, it was fun to watch, but that was all, and the clichés were quite annoying. Frigga's death was perhaps the most glaring of them. And she dies for the only reason (if you can call that a reason) that they need Odin to loose control and prepare to go after Malekith like an enraged bull (which he never seems to get around to do, leaving everything to Thor once he and Loki get to leave Asgard. Also, Asgard's defenses and army were pathetic. Being caught unawares makes no sense, as Bor was supposed to know that Malekith was alive, and thus so should Odin. And even caught at unawares would not provide for such a ridiculously easy victory by the Dark Elves over Asgardian forces and such a horribly silly idea that Frigga could take care of herself (I mean, seriously, what is the good of having an army in the palace if they can't even guard the queen?). And all that so Thor could be shown as the only one that could fight the Dark Elves. And Odin only gets to kill one with Gungnir!! Of course the cliffhanger at the end was just silly. I believe we are to assume that Loki was disguised as the guard that came to announce the arrival of his ""corpse"" to Odin (considering the sidelong look the guard gave Odin), and thus managed to overpower him somehow (which should be very difficult indeed, but, hey, the movie is way less coherent than the comics, so...). Another thing that annoys me (that was somewhat present in the first movie, but not to this extent) is Odin's and Thor's insistence that Asgardians are not gods. They are! They are the Norse gods. Seriously, I can only think they were afraid of offending the sensibilities of Christians watching the movie, but, come one! Odin is called the All- Father because the is supposed to have created the Nine Worlds. And so on and so forth. Just boring. Ah, by the way, if Asgardians are mortal and not gods at all, why does Odin refer to Jane as ""mortal""? He should have used a term like ""short-lived"" or something like that. Of course the magical day-saving device Erik and Jane put together is not a problem: Marvel does that all the time, like when Dr. Doom manages to create a device that steals the powers of the Beyonder, a being so powerful and alien he should be beyond the understanding of any human without centuries of studies and scientific progress. But Doom, like Reed Richards, is supposed to be a genius, which apparently means, in comic book parlance, he is wiser, more knowledgeable and more intelligent than anyone (except Reed Richards, of course. :) As a final comment, no, the film did not have the promised wider scope: the 9 reals are barely shown, Hogun's village is just as bad as any cheap Conan-like under financed TV production, Svartalfheim is just a desert filmed through darkened lenses, we just get to see enough of Asgard to, as I said, see how badly organized they are, and then we come back to Earth... again! My perfect Thor film would be if they compressed the old Colonizers of Rigel Saga into a movie. No saving the Universe (which is also a boring cliché, like, Thor will only show up on the big screen when he is saving the world), but just fighting an alien race waaaay away from Earth.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

What's noticeably missing is Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearean touch, the whole grandiose spectacle of it all. Everything which made Thor charming is missing from this and even cast changes (Zachary Levi as a replacement for Josh Dallas and surprisingly, quite a forgettable Fandral, seeing as he was the original choice.) Poor Ray Stevenson doesn't have much to do, and Jaimie Alexander casts a bitchy stare at Jane Foster, but nothing else ever comes out of it. Whereas in the first movie, we all gawped at Chris Hemsworth's magnificent physique, we now get a Loaded Weapon 1 moment, where I half expected to see one of those ""unmotivated butt-in-the-moonbeam walks."" Chris Eccleston isn't used to full villainy advantage as Malekith and wasn't really sure what his true motives were (nor did I actually care.) The first half is OK, while the second is more entertaining, if very far-fetched. Alan Taylor may have directed outstanding episodes for Game of Thrones, but here, he's delivered an uneven package with lacklustre action and forced, hammy dialogue for actors who deserve better. That said, Tom Hiddleston does have fun and seems to be the only one. Kat Dennings routine as Darcy should be getting stale by now, but does provide some comedic highlights. If Marvel wants to rival the greatest film franchise in history (James Bond of course) it had better pull its socks up. Sure, 007 has had its misses but it also knew how to reboot itself and stay fresh. I'm not convinced neither Stan Lee or Kevin Fiege have a game plan and this could be their downfall. This was a kiddies outing, but when you look at the richness of The Avengers and Joss Whedon's literary prowess, they need that kind of impetus to stay afloat.I'm now convinced that Captain America: The Winter Soldier, will be my most anticipated superhero sequel (as it's a surefire bet that Singer will mess up Days of Future Past and turn it into Wolverine 6.)More fun than kickass (with a great cameo in the middle) this gets 7/10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The special effects were out of this world. I loved the fact that there was more Asgard, this time. I also liked that they introduced us to more worlds like, Anaheim & Svartalfheim. The climax was so unexpected & mind blowing. This is the only Marvel film, to have such an unforeseen twist. This film was way better than Thor(2011). It was way more action packed & hilarious compared to Kenneth Branagh's watered down original. The performances was definitely one, of the many pros of the film. Chris Hemsworth plays the part of Thor, to perfection. Natalie Portman is brilliant as Jane Foster. However the standout performer in the film is, yet again, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston's cheeky & witty dialog delivery keeps the viewers guffawing for a good part of the film. However, Loki can turn terrifying in an instant. This shows what a versatile actor Tom Hiddleston is. No matter how despicable Loki is, I can pretty much guarantee that everyone loves Loki. This is the magic of Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin. Christopher Eccleston is menacingly evil as Malekith. Jaimie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson & Tadanobu Asano are impressive as Sif, Fandral, Volstagg & Hogun respectively. Idris Elba is spectacular as Heimdall. Rene Russo is outstanding as Frigga. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is effective as Algrim/Kurse. Kat Dennings & Stellan Skarsgard are great as Darcy Lewis & Erik Selvig respectively. If I had to pick one teeny tiny flaw then that would be that, the film was too short. I would have loved an extra ten to fifteen minutes. Anyway, Thor: The Dark World is a must watch for pretty much everyone, even the Marvel haters.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Thor 2 opens with a Lord of the Rings style sequence with a lot, and I really mean a lot, of incomprehensible mumbo jumbo that I couldn't care for at all. Hopkins delivers his silly lines as if Shakespeare himself wrote them...which is kinda funny. Several actors are once again underused (Russo, Elba), the villain is even more one dimensional than all the previous MCU villains. The story...ah well I just did not care one iota. Hiddleston is good, as always, but not as effective as in Avengers. Hemsworth as Thor is at his most entertaining when he is playing the slightly stupid hero on Earth. You do get to see some of this in his interaction with Natalie Portman during the third act on Earth. But it wouldn't be until Thor 3 before they would really nail the way they should use this character. All in all Thor The Dark World is rightfully seen as one of the weakest MCU films.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The sets felt were more organic. Asgard still seemed squished.The only characters to have any development were Thor Loki and Jane. Everyone else were just there. Simply just there.The effects were better. The fight scenes were also better. Although the fight scene of Thor getting beat up by kurse was lame. That one could have been better x60.Jane is just Jane. She teleports to the aether and that's how the story begins. Her stooges minus Erik. Were bozos. I like Darcy but she's a kind of a waste.Melekith the accursed. Many people don't understand his motives. I do. His people need darkness to function and live like man needs the sun. In order for his people to survive they plan on making the 9 realms dark (plus for revenge and because they are just bad elves. )
The movie doesn't emphasize this at all. That's where I think people go wrong with not understanding Meleikth the accursed. It's typical of mcu movies to not explain things and leave things up for countless fan theories. Or some times deliberate plot holes.Odin is there but wasted.Thors mom who we rarely saw gets axed. Her funeral scene was iconic.Warriors 3 and Hiemdall. Wasted talent and potential.Overall Thor 2 is a fun galactic mystical viking movie. If it were not for rushing for a connected universe. Thor 1 and 2 would be simular to Lord of the rings.
Thor mcu movies is basically one of a kind that isn't over the top spectacular. Still you can enjoy it.Verdict: can I get my shoe back?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That should give more than enough scope to have large scale battles between the protagonists, plenty of opportunity for Thor to run around smashing righteous thunder into anything he encounters. Like Gimli in Lord of the Rings, but with Legolas's hair. Yet the battles are more one on one. The acting may be strong in parts (which is to be expected with Portman, Hopkins and Skarsgård), yet it would have been good to see some more of Eccleston as the main protagonist. And you can tell that Malekith has spent his time not only plotting, but also in R&D, while the Asgardians haven't learnt much from the previous film. Not to mention the number of pillars that get destroyed, no wonder the world is dark! Hiddleston shines as the tricky Loki, with the rage of a son betrayed by his father, the despair of a son lost to his mother and the contempt of a betrayed and lost brother. He may have been the obvious figure head of evil in Avengers Assemble, but here he gets to play a full range of roles and comes out as the real star of the show. And despite knowing Zachary Levi was playing Fandral, if I hadn't I wouldn't have recognised him with the blonde hair!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Visually this movie has a lot to offer, but about halfway thru a realization comes that the fluff isn't enough to sustain a seasoned movie-goer. I had a similar reaction to the Harrison Ford epic ""Blade Runner"" and other movies that have a lot of style, but very little heart. The story revolves around a matter hidden deep beneath the Earth called ""Ether"" that can change compositions quickly and is sought after by an evil elf-like creature from a world before there was light, Aka. The Dark World. He believes this Ether has the power to bring back his world. Natalie Portman, plays Jane Foster, a companion of Thor and a scientist – who comes upon this substance during an investigation and it possesses her. The evil creature is then after her and Thor(played by Chris Hemsworth), and he, of course, wants to protect her. The settings in the movie consist of Asgard – ruled by Thor's father Odin(played by Anthony Hopkins), London, and the dark elves' world.the movie jumps back and forth between these worlds partially because of a weird warp found during the investigation that transfers items across these worldsbut Thor seems to be able to go in and out no matter what. There is plenty of action to be had, decent acting, and a little humor but other than the expected battle between good vs. evil there is no real reason or emotion to stay with the movie to the very end. The movie should probably win some visual effects awards, but I'm looking for a complete experience and in my opinion – this isn't one. It is a good try but not quite good enough for my approval.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

The film has many great qualities. The effects are amazing.The effects in the first film were already great, but this film ups the ante. The effects are twice or even three times better than the first film, as is the world building. This film showcases more of the nine realms, and also fleshes out Asghard better than the last film did.The film spends more time in Asghard and in the Dark Elves' home world than on Earth which I was okay with. I did not dislike the time spent on Earth like many people did, but I just found the scenes on Asghard and the Ice Realm to be more interesting and fun. Lastly the action scenes are greatly entertaining, especially the Loki prison break scene. The action is another thing that is upped in this film. I also love the design of the Dark Elves. I also like the technology employed by both the Dark Elves and Asghard. This film does a better job at showcasing the technology and mythology of these different realms.However, where this film excelled in action and effects, it unfortunately drops the ball when it comes to character. There is really no character development in this show. Thor is now a wise leader that puts other first. Other than having to defeat the bad guy there is no conflict he has to deal with, and he does not change or grow. Granted, I would rather have a character remain static than regress and forget the lessons they learn from the previous film like in the Iron Man sequels. However, I would like some form of development for the characters, especially the main ones, but we really do not get that.Thor, as well as the other main characters are still likable and they never irritated me, but I felt that their characters never went anywhere.Solid 6+","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But why is it a better movie than the second installment? It's mostly because the motivations of the characters and villains are clearly laid out and establishes a better impetus with the story. Loki is struggling to find out who he is, Thor is trying to become who he is expected to be, and the frost giants work out the rough edges in the story arc, the same can't be said of The Dark World.You don't have any sort of interesting dynamics between the characters and instead get references to the first movie, or things that worked for the first movie, and try to play them out again. The movie never really picks up any identity for itself and just continues to harp on the events of the Avengers as well as the lead into new films of the franchise being its primary focus which makes the plot really spread thin and boring after a while.For the sake of not repeating myself, concerning the villain that is, I'll leave it at that.

He will always look like the California surfer guy smoking the second hand smoke. He's a character that is supposed to fit into Norse mythology but I don't see much of that in him whatsoever. Unlike someone like Batman or Spider Man, this character has only one weapon and that is a hammer and this is cheesy.That said though, Thor still has a lot of potential. The character is different every which way. Also Norse mythology is a very uncommon thing in the comic book world and also in the film world and this shows originality. Thor is also a character with an interesting history that breaks many norms and no doubt the series has an audience.After an impressive run at the box office with the first feature film, Thor: The Dark World is the sequel. The plot has Thor (Chris Hemworth) fighting Malekith ( Christopher Eccleston) who is a villain that is trying to destroy this world by making it darker using the weapon called Aether.Like the 2011 film, the cast here is a hit. Chris Hemsworth is the likable Thor who again brings a sarcastic tone. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman ) is Thor's love interest and is a character that goes with the flow and who along with Darcy (Kat Dennings) brings more humor than the first movie which was unexpected. After what he did in The Avengers, (Tom Hiddleston) Loki is the character we are most looking forward to seeing. Here Middleston plays Loki, Thor's brother, as the same type of character as before. Loki is silly and an un-credited villain though ironically he ends up being on the good side here. Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is the humble father who is trying to keep the peace between the brothers and also outsiders.This being a superhero film, the next biggest question that comes up is just what does the villain bring to the film. Even with the tired concept of trying to take over the world again, Malekith is the villain we want. With different makeup and being a dark character, the weapon of Aether brings a different element to the table. It's also not that hard to follow the story like some other superhero films plots that we have had in the last couple of years. Unlike the first movie, there is a big ending here presented in a joking matter that feels like something out of a David Lynch movie. There are so many turns in the third act and final scenes that it creates a lot of discussion coming out of the theater. Still though, it sets the Thor series up for what seems like an interesting sequel and it also shows that director Alan Taylor is willing to make some very risky moves. Call it a mixed ending at best.After the story, the next interesting side of Thor is the main world Asgard which is full of interesting colors, lights and tones. Nothing in the Marvel Universe really comes close to Asgard. As with the 2011 film, the part of the sequel in Asgard is a little thing of the film but it goes a long way and something I would enjoy seeing many more times.It is probably something we don't need but Thor: Dark World is still none the less a very solid sequel. It is so good of a sequel it shows that something of this depth can work again. This will get even more interesting when we get the next sequel.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

So after all that is explained in the first 10 minutes we get to the story line which revolves around a Dark Elf known as Malekith and his search/revenge plans. Christopher Eccleston did a very interesting role although after watching I think he didn't own it, other people could have done it as well, if not better. That didn't ruin it though as another, unexpected, plot point revolves around Loki and the issues of trusting him which make for some very twisty and questionable scenes. I'd have to say I enjoyed the parts set on Earth more rather than in space for some reason, but all in all I liked how it looked although some elements I had seen before in other media. There were of course references to past films as the Tesseract got a mention as did New York. So my final thoughts are this: the special effects were great, the plot was OK but I've seen better, and all-in-all I have the same feel about it as the first, it didn't wow me but neither was I bored, it was just in the middle.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

There is to much to write down here and you should see it for yourself but this is up there with the Avengers and Spiderman 1 and 2, it's just that good and that much fun. And let's be honest, who wan's to leave the cinema being sorry he went. This is not likely in this case!I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Probably not as dark as you might think it is, not bad though","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901700/?ref_=tt_urv","zig_utzig","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36539959/?ref_=tt_urv","8 November 2013","The title of this second instalment of ""Thor"" may lead spectators to believe this is a dark movie and less humorous than the first one, but that is very far from the truth. Actually this second film is even more comical than the first, for the good or for the bad. I say this because the frequent humour in ""The Dark World"" bothered some fans while pleased others. As I was watching it I did think some of the comical scenes were a little over the top and others even unnecessary, but generally I very much welcomed the humorous touch. Some of the scenes that put a completely characterized Thor through trivial human situations were very funny. Cameos were also very well used (there's even a special appearance from one of Thor's colleagues from The Avengers). Stan Lee's cameo in this one was one of my favourites from all Marvel films.Another thing that some fans complained about was the motivation (or lack of it) from the villains, the dark elves. Well, it's hard to put in a 2 hour action movie too many explanations without taking the risk of spoiling the pace of the movie. However the explanation in the beginning seemed clear to me, even being quite superficial. I don't read comic books (so I don't have any reference from them), but when the narrator said that dark elves are a race born prior to the birth of light and they want to spread again the dark energy across the universe, their motivation was pretty clear. I mean, unlike humans or asgardians (who were born from light), dark elves were born from dark energy and they simply want that energy taking over light as the moving force in the universe. Dark energy, which is represented in the movie by the alchemical element known as ""aether"", is considered a natural force in many mythologies and philosophies and is also a widely accepted theory among today's astrophysicists. So asking what is the purpose of the dark elves is the same as asking what is the purpose of dark energy, and that is a philosophical question.The spaceships battle scenes in Asgard were also a point that raised complaints. The movie creators were definitely inspired by Star Wars here, even the spaceships designs are quite similar (X-Wings for the good guys and Tie Fighters for the bad ones). I was not bothered as I saw the movie because I am a big fan of Star Wars (especially the original trilogy), but I understand that crossing fantasy/mythology with science fiction might not please some people, even if this crossing has always been present in Thor. I also have no complaints about CGI or sound effects, I think the movie is technically great (as every other movie produced by Marvel).Lastly, characters and acting. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) are the movie's stars and they are perfect in their roles. Along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America they are the best casting in The Avengers, in my opinion. I have no criticism to their work. Anthony Hopkins is again excellent as Odin and Rene Russo is just average as Frigga (she certainly does not inspire majesty to me). Stellan Skasgard is again exceptional as Dr. Erik Selvig (crazier than ever) and Cristopher Eccelstone plays a just reasonably evil Malekith (I was much more afraid of the excellent Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Algrim). Natalie Portman as Jane Foster does a good job despite her character being a little too bland; she plays much more the ""defenceless little girl"" type than in the first movie and that was a bit disappointing. The rest of the cast did well as they did in the first movie, some playing comical parts (Kat Dennings) and others more serious ones (Idris Elba). So Thor: The Dark World is one more movie from Marvel Studios that combines action, comedy and science fiction, but with the ""bonus"" touch of Nordic mythology. If you enjoyed the first one I recommend you to check this sequel.My rating: 7/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, I did watch most of the recent superhero films due to my sister being a huge fan of them. I'm usually unimpressed with superhero movies, even with the successful Avengers and the Batman trilogy. It is a massive challenge to create an entertaining storyline in a film that everybody knows the hero is going to win in the end. Recent superhero films (especially Man of Steel) failed at this and I was prepared to face disappointment upon stepping into the cinema hall.Thor The Dark World was one that I can honestly say was entertaining. Surprisingly. I think I was generally happy with it because of the realism of the conflict that they face. In the Avengers, when alien beings attacked earth, humans on earth somehow decides to do almost nothing. No appropriate military action by earth's governments. It's the same with Iron Man 3, US military did nothing when the president was captured.In Thor The Dark World, the threat was at Asgard. The whole of Asgard was ready to go to war. Due to the effects of the alignment of the Nine Realms, portals between worlds were opened but as it all happened too sudden, nobody from other realms was able to react on it. This is more believable than the Avengers' situation (where Loki was on Earth for a long period of time and Shield knew he was up to something having stolen the Tesseract yet no military action were taken when the aliens attacked).You still have to ignore some plot holes and ridiculous logics (like why Asgardians still fight with swords and shields when their enemy who were in suspended animation for the last 5000 years had laser guns) but it was still very entertaining for a superhero film. The development of the main characters were done satisfyingly. Thor, who were a rash, short-tempered Asgardian prince with a thirst for war, is now more mature and sensible in making decisions. We also saw the other side of Loki despite his continuous mischiefs.The balance of action, humour and ""superhero realism"" makes it fun to watch. It's not overly complicated but it's also not too dumb or predictable. Overall I'm quite happy with this film and I would recommend it to anyone who is starting to lose faith in the superhero genre.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

This film spent way too much time with Natalie Portman and her throw-away friend characters trying to dish out quirky comedic relief, which resulted in painfully unfunny scenes that dragged and dragged and dragged... I'm not sure what it is about Natalie Portman's acting but for me it was excruciatingly reminiscent of her Queen Amidala performance. Her acting tends to be pretty hit or miss for me but these Thor movies just haven't been doing her any favors. The relationship she has with Thor is so unconvincing and bland that the movie can't even be bothered to tack on a little farewell scene for the both of them when Chris Hemsworth goes back to Asgard at the end. It cares that little. Also, generic evil bad guy is more undefined than any other super villain the Marvel movie universe has come up with so far. Why is it so difficult to write a memorable antagonist in these movies?","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

It got Loki wrong to satisfy the demands of a generic plot with evil squarely on one side. But up above it had a gilded astral world, and down below Branaugh had all sorts of fun at the expense of his Shakespearean setup.Why did they have to mess a good thing? They made a good early decision for starters. The whole cinematic world would be defined by (hypothetical) quantum physics that allowed all sorts of spontaneous fun with appearances and transportation, an illusory fabric that changes at whims. They could now graft on it the right Loki from the fables, which are from a pre-Christian time when evil was not yet neurosis and sin, where Loki embodied capricious nature, illusion, uncertainty, spontaneity, a deeper understanding than a simple duality.So this could be fun, inventive and revealing in the same swoop.It's easy to see where this went wrong, they wanted a serious dark saga. A serious saga demands no surprise really, allows no playing. Thor goes from goodhearted jock to Superman brooding about Lois and his duty as protector of worlds as he flies around fighting gods, the worst possible decision.Why do we need these to be serious anyway? The forces are no more comprehensible in this way, the heroes no more human, just archetypes of some inner conflict. It should be as baffling to encounter these worlds, a civilization which has mastered the quantum field but still fights with swords, as capricious to decide on their mechanics as the actual physics at play.Strangely, they got a better Loki. Their whole trip together with Thor to the elven realm has a bit of that scent of the sagas. This is not a matter of sticking to origin, but seeing the value. We have some of that playing and illusion around Loki, that is until the end when they unmask him again as malicious tyrant.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Actually, it has a few problems. The battle scenes are generic. The editing is sloppy. There are moments of cheese, and the dialogue needs some spicing up. Most dubious is the confusing main conflict with the forgettable villain, Malekith. However, despite the corniness and the convoluted elements plaguing it, ""The Dark World"" is a highly entertaining, engaging, and surprisingly funny addition to The Avengers universe. In order to buy into these Thor films, one must be okay with Thor being a stupid, albeit fun, Marvel character. Sure, his entire lore is hokey, but it is intentionally so, and the filmmakers behind this installment are well aware of this, using it to their benefit in great humorous effect. And while Portman seems bored playing love interest Jane, most other performances are strong and lively. Hemsworth, Dennings, and Skarsgard are better fleshed out and play their roles with ease. However, the real winner here is Hiddleston, gleefully villainous as Loki, one of the most complex and sympathetic baddies in years. Outside of ""Star Trek"", this is the best big franchise film of the year. Even though Marvel slightly missed the mark with ""Iron Man 3"", they have returned to solid filmmaking form here through great cartoony graphics, unique superhero cinematography and a solid action movie score. So while it won't win over many new fans for Thor, it will satisfy old ones biding their time until the next Avengers movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Bifrost has been rebuilt, and the Aesir are only now done world policing the other realms back to peace. Things won't remain quiet for long - a primeval race, the Dark Elves, return, determined to bring all of existence back to the nothingness before there was light. An oft-used, abstract ""villain goal"" - here visualized well, and made quite literal; part of their arsenal(the only advanced weapon in this that isn't so bland that it's downright distracting) is a grenade that creates a tiny black hole, relentlessly pulling away those caught within the blast radius. To this end, the leader Malekith(Eccleston bringing out the big guns for the least compelling bad guy of the current cinematic Marvel-verse), with the aid of his lieutenant, Algrim(Akinnuoye-Agbaje, using his immense physical presence to bring a seemingly unstoppable force of destruction to life - a lava-infused bull-like being), seek the Aether, a powerful essence that enables the wielder to drain life and light.It has recently resurfaced - in fact, it infected Jane Foster(Portman, cute in her awkward social behavior and obsession with discovery; she and our titular hero are pining for one another - with that said, the romance was better in the first one). This makes her a target, and the Asgardians find that their old foe is extremely dangerous. The only way to save the universe(can you say ""raised stakes""?) appears to be for Thor(Hemsworth, charming, strong and, yes, arrogant - but now with an appreciation of planning and not rushing in) forming an uneasy alliance with Loki(Hiddleston at his most duplicitous, unpredictable... and vulnerable; in short, his best yet), who now faces consequences for his actions, and the two will come head to head over their on-going conflict - in general, this takes care to follow up on what has happened to these characters(in part by trimming the large cast some, not introducing many new faces, and, yes, less overall development for them) so far, a surprisingly personal story in this adventure of an epic scale.As this flies by with a pace that never overwhelms in spite of opening the until-now-only-ajar door to the vastness of space, the comic relief jokes and gags come in a steady stream, with the ""Terminator 2"" style humor - easing the otherwise heavy and bleak subjects, without becoming, well, T3, a parody. There is a ton of action(another of the many improvements on the great Branagh film), and it's much more varied - not merely(which doesn't mean they're gone) deities fighting creatures, we now have mid-air combat, jet fighters, chase sequences, even a major attack on a fortress! Aiming for Star Wars, this shows us more of the galaxy, defining the various areas as unique from one another. The grand orchestral score aids this tremendously, as does location shooting, solid FX work including prosthetics - with practical, suits and the like favored over CG. We go on an adventure - away from that which is familiar to either us or the protagonists. The plot is easy to follow, yet with good twists, and everything is properly set up and pays off.There is a lot of disturbing content, some mild violence and a little moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy, graphic novels and/or Nordic mythology. 8/10","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's entertaining and is a decent, solid entry in Marvel's cinematic universe.But it could have been so much more. I see in this movie yet more evidence of a troubling habit in Hollywood action films: cutting vital character moments for the sake of inserting more action.The emotional underpinning of the first Thor film was the title character's growing maturity and redemption. In its follow-up, the heart of the film should have been Thor and Jane's growing romance. In particular, we had the opportunity for a compelling love triangle (Thor-Jane-Sif) that would underscore the differences between Asgard and Earth, between making the safe, obvious choice (Sif, the practically-immortal warrior maiden) and the hard, risky one (Jane, the vulnerable, short-lived human). But aside from a few seemingly throwaway lines that hinted at what could have been a much better story, we get none of this. This is a problem, because what is it that's driving Thor in this movie? It's his quest to save the woman he loves, even if it means betraying the realm where he grew up and is destined to rule. At least it's supposed to be, but we never get more than token acknowledgement of Thor's inner struggle--unlike the first film.Instead, what we do get is a pretty standard action movie: seemingly unstoppable bad guys; the stalwart good guy and his spunky love interest; their quirky helpers; clever one-liners; and, of course, action, action, special effects, action. It all holds together well enough, but the first Thor movie had so much more of an emotional foundation. This one feels rushed, as though several important (quiet, emotional) scenes are missing. Apparently some of those will show up on the DVD; I certainly hope so.Marvel should learn not to be afraid of making its movies a little longer. Thor, with his basis in mythology, deserves a big, epic canvas, and if it takes an extra 10-20 minutes or more of screen time to fit in the whole story, then so be it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In this one however I find Idris Elba wasted and unbelievable as a character. Even Anthony Hopkins seemed to have just turned up for the cash. Loads of special effects and CGI especially in the Asgard scenes but if the story is not involving then they count for nothing.

As someone else pointed out it looks as if it were put together by a committee!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I think that the first thor movie is not that great, so I came to the theater with no high expectation. But this movie is actually awesome. The story is great, the duration's not too long, nor too short, it's enough. The casts are great. Chris played thor well. He showed the emotion, but still can keep his arrogance. The effect is amazing. I watched it in 2D (because for me, 3D just ruin the story), but I can still feel the effect. There are some little joke that actually made this movie better. The audiences cant stop laughing during the movie. So for conclusion, this movie is great, I think its better than the previous one.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

There is always some reason why the other Avengers are not present and I guess you could question that, but you would take a lot from your own movie watching experience if you did.

When he is being coy you can see the cheeky Australian come out of him and he is clearly more comfortable in this side of Thor than the tough stoic version. Thor appeared to be missing the old English type of speaking that was in the Avengers or Thor which at times was quite witty. This also means I couldn't walk around the house imitating his old English speech which was disappointing for me. Chris Hemsworth does provide a little bit of eye candy for the ladies (impressive back and shoulder muscles I say), in one scene an actress purposely falls on him just to see if the muscles are real.Tom Hiddleston makes Loki his own. He is broody, depressive, defiant and a smart alec. He pulls all sides off his character, one could say almost perfectly. Hiddleston and Kat Dennings were definitely the two actors who brought the most to this movie in both acting and giving the movie character. Without these two actors I might as well have been watching the Expendables but this time set in space.Natalie Portman was not acting to the quality she has done previously, for example the Black Swan. To me she appeared to be going through the motions or it could be just the depth of the character she was asked to play was quite shallow.Kat Dennings who is the main actor in 2 Broke Girls was a stand out for myself. Every time she walked on stage I think I found myself smiling or having a laugh.Christopher Eccleston whilst being the main ""baddie"" in this movie is not giving enough depth for you to feel ""yes this guy deserves to be beaten and is a real threat to the nine realms"". Instead you are left feeling yeah he provides good action scene fodder and special effects. This character needed to be more menacing.Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo play small but important roles in the movie.The special effects of this movie are very good. There seemed to be scenes where the special effects was the main actor without the need for any human or dark elf actor to step in front of a camera.The movie was directed by Alan Taylor, he has mainly done big TV shows in the past like Game of Thrones and the script was led by one of Marvel Comics main writers Christopher Yost. I feel that sometimes the characters though lacked the depth for some of the big name actors that were obtained for these roles. But if you're in a $300 million movie within 9 days why wouldn't you act in this Marvel studios cash cow.A criticism I have of this movie is that it is following the trend of a 'serious' comic book movie where there seems to be more brooding than fun. Yes the movie has great special effects, good action and drama. Though comic book movies have seemed to forgotten the term comic relief. That is why I enjoyed Tom Hiddleston, Kat Dennings and at times Christopher Hemsworth when they had their moments on not taking themselves too seriously.Other moments I really enjoyed were the cameos of Chris Evans as Captain America and Stan Lee the creator of Marvel Comics.Overall as an adult, Thor: The Dark World was solid with great special effects, some solid performances and other actors going through the motions. I have a feeling that young teenage boys will really enjoy this movie. This movie is a popcorn movie built for the masses and definitely a movie that will not strain your brain. It is slow moving and at times it is appeared the storyline chucked together inefficiently to ensure it fully explains things that are not needed for an action movie. Time wise it goes for almost a full 2 hours.http://mondaysheroes.wordpress.com/thor-the-dark-world/","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

In his awaited return after The Avengers, he takes the legacy further. His loved one is cool Jane Foster played beautifully by talented Natalie Portman. But the most lovable character remains his cunning, clever, cool, likable evil brother Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. In fact he is my second favorite villain after Joker of The Dark Knight in todays superhero universe. Visual effects vary from fantastic to excellent to mind-blowing. Stakes are much higher this time, but movie never tries to take them too seriously. In fact there are lot of funny situations and one liners but this fun was overdone in the messy climax. Nevertheless, it is a fun ride during which you would like to enjoy lots of popcorn. Please note that once movie is over, wait, there will a mid post credit scene to give you a clue for Avengers 2 and one at the very end showing the actual last scene of the movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The scenes with Loki were the film's saving grace; while he was around, I found myself interested. But trying to make sense out of all the rest of this slop just made me tired and frustrated.

The look of the film is wonderful, Asgard is just as colourful as it was in Thor yet also darker too, matching the darker, bolder tone very well. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations, especially Iceland, are stunningly vivid. The special effects are even more dazzling than in Thor and the same can be said for the stunts. The music score by Brian Taylor is dynamic and never repetitive or pedestrian, adding to the action sequences rather than detracting. Speaking of the action sequences, they are packed with thrills with battles almost on scale of Lord of the Rings and smack-downs that are enough to crush the bones. But Thor: The Dark World is not just about action and spectacle, it has substance too(or at least it did to me), laden with humour that will genuinely make you laugh but doing so without over-powering the dark nature of the story or the tense sparring between Thor and Loki. The story is compelling with the right doses of action, humour and drama, it's bigger in scale and bolder in tone than the first Thor but also more expansive in characterisation. The acting is top-class with most of the cast getting more to do, Anthony Hopkins is always dependable and Natalie Portman brings a touch of class and Stellan Skarsgard has some very funny moments but the acting honours do go to Chris Hemsworth, who's more robust and poised than he was in the first Thor, and especially Tom Hiddleston, who is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. My only complaints here are Christopher Eccleston having very little to do so he gives a somewhat one-dimensional performance that exudes moody menace but not much else and Loki surrendering and Thor forgiving him too easily and quickly. All in all however, a truly excellent follow-up that improves even more over the first Thor. 9/10 Bethany Cox","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

I'm not a huge fan of the comic book character of Thor so I obviously prefer other movies about super heroes but it's still pretty good.

Title in review has quite weak plot and above all it lacks emotional intensity and thrill which first part had. Because of shallow plot, this movie will fail to take you along. In these kind of movies Villains are very powerful and invincible. But heroes look for out of the box solutions to get them down but in this movie Villain character is very weak and is without any convention. Villain doesn't look intelligent and dangerous to me. He was just a villain to fill space. Good news is there are 2-3 laughs as well though I didn't laugh as I found them not very laughable.Direction was OK. Acting was good as normally is in these kind of Films. Portman was bit better. This movie has high production value. Lot of effort and money used in creating stunning visual effects.So my suggestion to readers is that ""Don't watch it in 3D"" specially if you have watched Gravity in 3D recently. You will feel very bad like me. And will curse 3D technology which I think is mind blowing if used properly.Its OK for one time watch but nothing memorable.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

This is the problem with Thor, you just get tired while watching it. Thor just isn't drawn in this installment interesting enough. He was a great fish out of water in the first movie, a egoist brought down by kindness and guilt. In this movie he's just sad and mopey.

It's the ever same ""Capture the Flag""-formula, where the hero needs to wrest a ""Holy Grail""-like magical stone from the enemy's greedy claws in order to save the world, that we have not just recently seen in too many movies before; whether it's called ""Tesseract"", ""Allspark"" or like in this case ""Aether"", it may be a somewhat necessary plot device that brings forward the action, however, if it remains like here the only impetus, the only sense without a deeper meaning, without a humane message, then it is too little and trite to have a lasting impact. Nowadays, every episode of ""Game of Thrones"" offers much more excitement and drama than many a Blockbuster I've seen in recent years.What's missing plot-wise is compensated with great visuals and nearly breathtaking action sequences that come along as a Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings meets Viking mythology crossover fantasy/science-fiction mash-up which is definitely a plus. The invasion of Asgaard by the Dark Elves strongly resembles the great Battle on Naboo in ""Star Wars: Episode I"" especially since Bambi-eyed Nathalie Portman plays the dame in distress in both movies. The chemistry between her role Jane Foster and Thor is good although their kisses lack the fiery passion we saw in Spiderman for example; much more touching love stories have been told than this one for sure.""Thor: The Dark Kingdom"" is at least nice to look at.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And MARVEL does nothing wrong while bringing out this new Thor movie. It has all the fine elements of a MARVEL film. Comedy,suspense,action and also a surprise cameo(I'll say no more).This movie's story focuses on the power of Aether which was hidden from Black Elves by Odin's father. Then the story goes on about how Thor stops it from reaching the hands of evil Malekith when the Aether re-surfaces. The best part in the movie is the wry humour, the action of course and a little sentimental touch. And Loki also has a very interesting role in this one. The earth part adds a bit of scientific element to the mythology, thereby making it a complete package.MARVEL's bringing more and more great films with The Avengers franchise and also a good TV series (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D), so we fans are definitely not going to miss this one.

With my logic, the reviews would REALLY not subside my experience of the film. Well... they were spot-on. The top critics that is. I'm not going to re-tell the synopsis for you. It's Thor. It's the sequel. There's a comic book to it and when you read a review for a blockbuster sequel, you just want to know the simple answer to a very simple question: Is the movie good? No... but let's not get too carried away with the fact it's not great, because it's not bad. So where does the problem lie?Well for starters, this movie was underwhelming as hell. With so many twists and turns, and changes in character motifs, you'd think the film would be very emotionally enveloping. But it just feels so dry, because the pacing is too abrupt to let you soak in the material. And characters just pop in and out of places, without a sense of cohesion or above-average scriptwriting. The first to me really nailed the chemistries between characters, but this one didn't make me care for anyone with the exception of- you guessed it- Thor. I found Darcy to actually be borderline obnoxious here, and Jane was just... Natalie Portman. Even Anthony Hopkins felt underused with his character.I understand being a sequel, you want to rush to the big action set pieces and show off every penny you've spent on graphics/effects, but what made the first Thor so great is while it was visually pleasing, it connected to its viewers on a more emotional level. This made for some truly epic moments and considering it took its time, the payoff was way more substantial.Also, while I viewed this in 2D, I feel it would be so unnecessary to see in 3D. No 3D moments. It doesn't seem like it'd have this grand depth of field. It just looks like a lovely 2D production.While ""The Dark World"" may snag an Oscar nom. for its art direction, there's a reason why the nominations stop there. I'm not saying ""Thor"" should aim at an Oscar (that'd be spectacular though), but just saying it should aim at least somewhat higher. With a more rushed pace, a lack of cohesion (feeling dodgy in parts), and a more than underwhelming resolution, ""The Dark World"" roped me into a lackluster one. It's not exactly a bad movie, but with the inflation of movie tickets, who wants to see an inferior sequel to a better-made original? (Which is cheaper to view by the way).","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The stakes were higher. The characters were mostly brilliant though I felt Malekith could have been developed slightly more. Loki was simply wonder and maybe the class of the entire effort. I loved the plot and the balance of action and story. That's where this film excels over the original. There's heart and humor but far better action and far more dire consequences.Honestly, If you're going to turn a comic book into a movie, do it with utter belief in your story and do it with the best talent and FX possible. That's why Marvel movies do so well and why they need to get ALL their properties back under their roof. We'd all love to see the Marvel Universe united if it's all to be done this well. Not looking ahead, just enjoy this movie for the wonderful spectacle and story that it delivers.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Production feels uninspired and run of the mill. The plot, props, action, effects and gags are all neatly in place to generate just enough wonder and excitement for the average viewers so they don't fall asleep.During the movie, we are told that there are nine realms, but each one is nothing more than a snow globe when compared to the diversity of Earth. Apparently, in all the other realms, people can travel between dimensions but still fight with swords and axes. Whereas on Earth, we have all manner of weaponry but knows sh*t about the universe save a few super geniuses who like running around strip naked and whatnot.So there you have it.If none of what I've just said sounds like a major turn-off, I will say that this is good entertainment equivalent to regarding an extra value meal at Macdonald's being a good meal sometimes. Otherwise, please do yourself a favor and steer clear of the movie to save yourself from having to cry about it later on the boards.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Asgard was amazing and had a great feel about it, you felt you were there yourself. But I felt although humour in the marvel movies is great and they hit it just right in the first movie, it was to forced in this one. It almost felt like they should have run a canned laughter track and had some of the awful jokes written by the people who made 2 and a half men (the world most over rated crock comedy). Thor's use of flight was really great and had some great shots of him flying about. But like in the previous movie Loki stole the show! Christopher Eccleston did a great job playing the Dark Elf king. If you love Marvel you have to see it just to complete the set.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Thor - The Dark World is far better than the previous Thor but I have to admit that the sequel wasn't worth to watch in the cinema, on the release date. Even though we can see a film, which offers you far more action than the forerunner, you can't overlook the fact that Marvel-Studios has created this film. During the first 40 minutes I've experienced an immense entertainment because the director Alan Taylor was really successful at creating a great atmosphere, the plot was taken really seriously, because it didn't contain any of these typical small jokes which normally appear during a Marvel-film. In addition there were a lot of mistakes considering the logic of the plot. After the first part the film became more and more atrocious, especially in the end. I will give ""Thor-The Dark World"" 6 out of 10 points because the film offered me more entertainment than the forerunner but if it was only for the first part, I would give 9 out of 10 points.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) tried to use Aether to send the universe into darkness. In a great battle, the Dark Elves were routed, Malekith managed to escape and Asgard buried the Aether beyond use. It's many years later in the present day. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is imprisoned. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is fighting to bring order back to the nine realms. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is alone on Earth since Thor left her in New Mexico 2 years ago. She's now in London with her intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) who in turns has her own intern. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) has gone a little crazy and very naked. Jane is doing research on an anomaly which Asgard and the Dark Elves call Convergence. She gets sent through a wormhole to Svartalfheim where she's impregnated with all the Aether. Thor brings Jane back to Asgard despite Odin (Anthony Hopkins)'s disapproval.This is a lighter and jokier affair. Its broad jokes delivered mostly by Kat Dennings playing the traditional best friend rom-com role to Natalie Portman. Portman continues to be a weak point in this franchise. It's more her Jane Foster character who really lacks consistent chemistry and reason for their love affair. This is a love that spans the universe and I can't explain it other than they're both played by really gorgeous human specimens.The best parts are that the world of Asgard is expanded more. It's not just a set but a real place now. The movie gives a real sense of it. Also Thor and Loki expands their relationship. Their brotherly rivalry is deeper this time and Loki is set to become a big Marvel character in the future. Malekith is a slight disappointment as the villain. Quite frankly, all the usual fun villainy characteristics are given to Loki while Malekith is merely a one dimensional plot device. Malekith is really only a secondary character and maybe that's a good thing. The battles are great. The final battle is thrilling with a lot of fun. That's how I would describe the movie as a whole.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Like most of Marvel movies in recent years, Thor: The Dark World is presented in a light and humorous tone(in contrast to DC Comics movies that are darker and more serious). It's a straightforward fantasy/sci-fi/action movie. Some attempts on humor would seemed a bit desperate and unnecessary, especially when they are doing some serious sequence. The storyline is pretty standard, but it's pretty much what is expected. The visual FX is good, but the 3D version is still the Hollywood version of ""Show me the money"".

The movie however does what it is meant to do - i.e. entertain. Don't go looking for logic, questioning at times that if Thor can fly, then why does he need to take a subway or a taxi. Natalie Portman is given her due share of screen time.The build-up to the story is good, better than some of the recent superhero movies, and the special effects give a lot of life to the movie during the first hour. Performances are quite decent. Loki stands out and maintains is stature as someone who can constantly surprise you.What really disappointed me was the way Thor saved the nine realms. He did something that worked (had to obviously as he is the superhero). I am not even sure if the writers and director were sure about the logic that was used for defeating the dark side. Honestly, I think it could have been a good movie if they could get the end right, but the movie still meets the purpose, which is thrill, entertain and dazzle, and then forget once the movie is over.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The chapter one THOR (2011, 5/10) and the mega-amalgam THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10) didn't lure me into Thor's fan base, but this sequel does boost the franchise's morals by further intermingling the epic apocalypse between the vast Gods' realm and the puny but ego-maniacal earth, saw it in its over-charged 3D version (nearly impossible to find a 2D screening nearby), THOR: THE DARK WORLD is a massive crowd- pleaser, terrific art production and the trappings of a Marvel vehicle, shrewdly fictionalizes the love-and-hatred bromance between Thor and Loki, which is much hyped as the dominant draw for this action-packed escapade. There is darkness before the birth of the universe, so as to against the plot of Malekith (Eccleston) to utilize an amorphous weapon called Aether to set the universe back into pitch- blackness, Thor (Hemsworth) has to team up with Loki (Hiddleston) to rescue his earth girlfriend Jane (Portman) who has been infected by Aether and being pursed by Malekith and his toadies, notably, a mutated fiend Algrim (Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Whiling the most entertaining part comes the polarized tenors of the Asgard kingdom and the contemporary earth, one is solemn, majestic, atavistic and Shakespearean (thanks to Kenneth Branagh for setting the tone in THOR 2011) and the other (this time the locale is an overcast London) is glossy, modern, farcical and doomed to be pulverized. The spectacles are generally gratifying and on a par with the earlier IRON MAN 3 (2013, 6/10) to say the least. Wonderful comic relief from the earthbound trio, Dennings, Skarsgård and Howard plus a surprising cameo by O'Dowd. Hemsworth and Portman are predictably playing the hero and his fearless girlfriend-in-danger default while Hiddleston easily grabs all the attention by influencing meatier character development, more ambiguous in his stance and a timely twist in the end can suffice to ignite fans' passion to the next installment, or maybe a Loki-based spin- off which will be more intriguing and anti-trend in its own way. By any means it is a solid sequel which inherits the merits from its predecessor and put more verve into its gods vs. mortals contradiction, director Alan Taylor has well handled a hot potato, next step, sit and wait for CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014) coming this upcoming April. ","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's true - 'Thor: The Dark World' was more or less a ""bridge"" movie to get from the bigger hit that was 'Iron Man 3' to the superior 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' but it served its purpose.At the center of 'Dark World' is an ancient force called the Aether that takes hold of Thor's love interest Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). What ensues is a multidimensional cat-and-mouse chase in a race to save Jane and put an end to the destructive plans of an evil elf named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). So, pretty standard plot for a superhero movie, and much less interesting than the previous film's plot.While the 'Thor' franchise boasts some memorable characters who have good resumes, including Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Eric (Stellan Skarsgård) and Darcy (Kat Dennings), their performances in this sequel feel just like a continuation of the first movie - nothing new or special. This applies to the dialogue, as well - it's well written considering the genre, with enough cheekiness and wit to go around, but again, it's same old, same old.As per usual, the special effects are great. The world of Asgard comes to life through the CGI, as do the barren lands of ""the dark world"" (which was aptly filmed in Iceland). But other than these elements, the film is fairly forgettable.'Thor: The Dark World' was a necessary entry in the Marvel film universe, and should be seen as a ""cross off the list"" kind of movie, but it's not near the top of the list when it comes to quality.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film was casted extremely well as it is a sequel to Thor. Chris Hemsworth done an excellent job as usual fitting into his character. Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki was an extremely comedic actor in this film and i found that he was naturally funny with the script given and made it his own. Natalie Portman was not you're usual super hero girlfriend that continuously gets into trouble and screams at everything she sees instead she was a very perky character and brave she got her hands dirty helping Thor with his fight. I strongly recommend this film as it has some amazing graphics in.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I will say that i enjoyed Thor The Dark World just as much, or better then the first movie, even without the flow of the first movie. All I can say is they left a little bit to be desired with the villain, and the movie was way to short. The acting was fantastic on everyone's part, and it was a great movie.

It pains me to see how much the third film threw off the balance and became my least-favorite of all the MCU films to date.Worth noting is how complex Thor and Loki's relationship was, and how as a viewer you are often trying to understand how sincere is their bond, how problematic the interplay of altruism and hubris, and how layered and nuanced their sense of justice. I contest that none of the MCU films depict this complexity as effectively, and with so many layers, as this one.Unlike the third film, the playfulness in this movie always supported, rather than undermined, both the plot and the character development. In the third film, horrific death was treated as a joke, as was Jane's absence. But here you feel the weight of things.And the mystical elements in this movie made sense; you understood (at least with repeated viewings) how the physics of the trickery worked. Whereas with the third film, well, I still don't understand why weapons just went right through Hela, why such was depicted at the edge of the screen, with no characters seeming to notice or acknowledge her imperviousness, and why the filmmakers had the characters continue to attack someone unaffected by weapons, removing any sense of the stakes involved.This movie lives up to its name, keeps things dark, and it works: very, very well.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed the first (no matter how average people thought it) and the trailer for the sequel looked awesome. And I hoped it was awesome. Was it awesome? Almost. This movie takes place a few years after The Avengers. The nine realms are at peace until all of a sudden, evil is released. Best synopsis ever. As plots go, it's pretty good. It stays true to the superhero formula and has a couple of plot twists. One is a complete surprise, one is completely predictable. However, there are a lot of plot holes in this movie. Often in the movie, I was scratching my head thinking, ""Wait, how would that work?"" That kind of detracts from the movie a little. Now, I'm going to be straight with you. For the first forty minutes or so, I was thinking, ""Okay, this movie is having a hard time going anywhere."" Yeah, it starts out rough. The beginning of the movie starts out rather dull. It had a hard time pulling me in and keeping me invested. But, when things started going down and punches were thrown, that's when things got interesting. It turned out to be a fun movie, but I wish it had the same charm from the beginning. Speaking of charm, this movie is very funny. It's the funniest Marvel movie since The Avengers (which isn't saying much because the only other Marvel movie that came out after The Avengers is Iron Man 3, but it's still the funniest). There were chuckle moments and even moments that had me laughing out loud. However, there were some jokes that felt stale. Most of them came from Kat Denning's character. I think she's very cute, but she didn't really have that much of a point in this movie. The action is what you'd except in a superhero movie; action packed awesomeness. And that's what this movie has. It was just cool seeing Thor wipe out a bunch of people with his hammer. IT'S SO SATISFYING! Overall, this movie is good. It isn't quite as good as the original Thor, but I still enjoyed it. It's definitely a worthy successor to The Avengers and it's definitely worth checking out. And it has not only an awesome Stan Lee cameo, but also an awesome cameo of a certain Avenger. No spoilers, just saying.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

For one thing, there WERE no dark elves in the original comics- not ONE, that I can recall. (Granted, ""this ain't your daddy's Thor,"" but it IS, just revamped for today's less discriminating moviegoers.) Why not do a story about Ulik, mightiest of the Rock Trolls...? ('Cause this ain't your daddy's Thor...?) To see the mighty troll marshal his army to invade Asgard itself would've been great. Consider: We see an Asgradian outpost on the edge of the Troll Lands. Battle-armored trolls attack the outpost (using the widest array of weapons imaginable, forged in their underground furnaces). Cut to another outpost, as trolls emerge from underground to attack and capture it. Thor (wearing his trademarked helmet, which he DOESN'T in THOR: THE DARK WORLD) gathers his men for a counter-attack. The armies battle to a standstill- at which point Ulik steps forth to challenge Thor to a one-on-one slugfest (no cgi, just breakaway boulders and such). Here, we discover that Loki has had a hand in the troll invasion, giving them strategic information every step of the way. Thor, to overcome superior numbers, calls forth a thunderstorm that wipes the troll army back from whence it came. Compare THAT scenario to what we see in THE DARK WORLD. I don't think I've seen a movie with so many clichéd lines in quite a while. While the makeup effects and the cgi are better than in the first film, the story is every bit as ponderous: scenes drag on interminably at times, with pompous characters hammering the point(s) mercilessly- and the attempts at humor, while they might garner the occasional chuckle, are sophomoric at best and are used more often than not to undermine the ""seriousness"" of the situation(s). And am I the only one more than a little tired of the post-credit ""tag"" scenes? (We were subjected to a half hour of television commercials prior to half an hour of previews BEFORE the movie started- then we had to sit through ten minutes of production crew credits before the last scene. Come on, people- give us a break.)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has some better references to Star Wars (lasers, sounds), Star Trek (cloaking device) and Chronicles of Riddick (ships, SFX effects). It is all that a movie of this genre should be in the first place (and, for example, Green Lantern was not): an illusion of reality that entertains. No morals, no subtle messages. Plain simple, yet intelligent, script, fun, action (with destruction, of course), very good acting (considering the ""circumstances""; the casting was excellent), direction, editing and music. SFX is really superb and very convincing. This movie sort of sucks you in, relieving you of all the bad mood or frustrations you had before watching it. It delivers. It makes you sleep well afterward. Highly recommended for those moments when you need something to make you feel - ""this was made for me"". Now grab what you usually do before a (really) good movie and watch it. And have fun.

When the original aired in 2011 it was perhaps the Marvel property that people were most skeptical about. The God of Thunder, wearing a red cape, Norse mythology and all, it sounded really silly. It was perhaps this low level of expectation, which I also had for Iron Man, which helped to make it such a success. It was fun and loud with a good heart at its core, not to mention introducing Chris Hemsworth and the outstanding Tom Hiddleston. Their chemistry helped to seal the deal and this continued with their adventures in Avengers.I think over the years, many of us have become quite endeared to all of the Avengers characters, they are almost household names and each new Marvel entry is welcomed with considerable fanfare. Thor: The Dark World is no exception.The story begins by introducing us to the Dark Elves led by Malekith in a time before Thor and Odin. Bor, father of Odin, managed to stop Malekith from using an energy known as the Aether to return the universe to the darkness it once knew before there was creation. The Aether was hidden and the story fell into legend and fable.However, as the alignment of the planets approaches once again, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), now residing in London, inadvertently makes a discovery that is going to draw her straight into the heart of Thor's latest adventure. Thor is forced to return to Earth and even bring Jane back to Asgard where the Asgardians are given something of a rude awakening. They soon realize that the Dark Elves they remember from their bedtime stories are very real and have once again returned to try and throw the universe back into darkness.This is a great adventure with real consequence. We are reminded that although perceived to be gods by people on Earth during the time of Vikings, Asgardians can be hurt, can be injured, and they frequently do. Thor has to muster more than just physical strength to try and defeat the Dark Elves and it is not without some dire consequences. More than once I found myself wiping away a manly tear from my eye. Thankfully, Thor has the assistance of all his friends from the original movie and they play no small part in helping him try and restore order to the nine realms.I enjoyed once again seeing these characters that I've grown to love and I was happy to see that this movie can be enjoyed as a complete story in its own right, not serving to be just a set up for the next Avengers movie. There is a healthy dose of well-timed humour, which helps to balance the otherwise dark overtones of the story. Performances are great all round, continuing the old world Shakespearean style of banter we have come to expect from Asgardians. I particularly loved some of the imagery seen on Asgard, seeing their world, how they live, watching Thor and Jane meander around the charming streets of this beautiful alien world.I felt Thor seemed somewhat underpowered in this outing, especially after seeing him topple cities with his hammer Mjolnir previously, but this may simply be a reflection of how powerful his adversaries are this time.What I did feel was weak were the 3D effects, so save yourself a buck or two and just watch it in a standard 2D digital screening unless you really want to see the extended Captain America Winter Soldier trailer which is attached to the 3D screening.Another homerun for Marvel, I strongly recommend you catch this on the big screen and, it goes almost without saying, stay right to the end of the credits as there may be more than one golden egg waiting for you.Check it out!Rating 8 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

With a new and different threat, the battle takes place behind the lines, in wastelands, and on metropolis Earth, rather than the cold world and small town scene of the first film. Trickery, subtlety, and cunning take the place of brute force this time, and it's a good direction to take.The characters, for the large part now established, were furthered well. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was played well, but could have spoken up a great deal more near the end. It should have been more shocking when he finally spoke English, in fact I don't recall the exact moment he started.The action in this film was great, but skipped a few beats at times, which is forgivable this time with Loki's interchanges with Thor. Marvel did meet my expectations with intermittent comedy, once again. This sequel was full of it, and each time it was written and performed very well, and got a laugh from the whole audience.The movie is family-friendly except for fantasy violence, two moments of direct violence, partial nudity (a character is shown in public on television, but is thankfully censored), and less worrying details seen here. See it in 3D, see it in 2D, either works. 3D doesn't stand out, for better or worse. All in all, Thor: The Dark World is worth seeing in cinemas.P.S. Stay after all the credits roll, and you'll be doubly rewarded.I was given early access to see the film by Walt Disney Studious. I was not required to write a positive review, and the opinions here are my own.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I did not find any awesomeness in it or any mind blowing scenes. The first movie was quite interested me because of a new actor, new superhero character and the birth of the new franchise from Marvel studio. All together with a mythical Greek character in a modern world, it was something that hit me. Just a few months back, I praised Hemsworth for his best ever performance in the biographical picture 'Rush'. Here he has fallen back to okay kinda performance. The movie was nothing special, but a decent entertainment. Technically, it was rich in visuals with good graphics, no one must dare to doubt it. My problem was the story which followed the usual fantasy movie protocol. One of the disappointment from 2013, completely a commercial purpose behind its creation and production. Yeah, all the movie are but this one is very much visible. So in my opinion, it is one time watch movie.6.5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Definitely a must watch film. A few things that I felt failed its justice I'm not sure could have been made better without making it a Lord of the Rings film. Firstly, I'm not sure the Dark Elves had enough screen time. They were awesome, and I think they chose some good actors for the part. I just feel they could have used their skills more. Secondly, they could have spent more time on the story about their past. It was good but they could have really highlighted this scenario to expand their fan base and create a cult of nerds. Again not sure if they could have been fixed, but as fiction fan who appreciates lore I have to express that. Lastly, not a big fan of the comedy, but I'm not a fun guy. Everyone else had a good time in the theaters. The acting was pretty good and I believe you felt the drama and emotion between Thor's family. To me that was the highlight of the movie. The custom, props and effects were great. That much said, I believe this movie makes you want to know more about the Marvel Universe and the scene after the credits leaves you handing.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

There where a few things that made me lose concentration and interest in the film. For example in the middle of a big destruction filled scene, they try to make you laugh. Why? the whole purpose of an action scene is to become fixated on the screen, to hold your breath while chaos ensues. Not to make you laugh. But OK, the action scene resumes and it build and builds and then....yes they try to make you laugh again. And why? Well because when you strip back everything; when you retract the unnecessary comedy; when you holster the money making action scenes; the story is dull. So, they inject a lethal dose of comedy and romance to try and distract you. And hey, there's nothing wrong with adding comedy to give a more varied experience for the viewer, but doing it in the midst of a Malekith (the so called villain of the film; played admirably by Christopher Eccleston) attack is preposterous; all it does is undermine the fear factor that the villain is supposed to carry; he may as well have been wearing a t shirt saying ""i have no chance"". And it was constant; no real focus on the villain, just little bits here and there. Him and his cronies may as well have been at Santa's workshop preparing for Christmas.Let's build a ""monster"" of a villain and laugh him to death. The World's seemingly beginning it's end and unless you are a scientist you are running for your life. That's basically the story of the film, with also too much happening in it. In order for a superhero film to succeed it has to focus; although profits would disagree with me. But it is because of the special effects that people empty their pockets, to be in the cinema and hear the roar of Thor's hammer, the rumble of explosions. Not the story. Look at Batman's latest outing, three films focusing on the darker side of a superhero; it was simple, the villains where built to be feared. It stayed on track, and apart from one or two one liners in each film, there wasn't any need for comedy because the story was so good. Thor, like Iron Man, Like Avengers will always make money,they will always be blockbusters. But they are not solely superhero films, there is always another character who is just as important as the hero and that should not be the case; unless of course it is the villain and in this film there is no sign of that. The villain is vanilla and when you don't have a great villain, then the hero cannot reach greatness. Action was amazing but everything else was uninspiring.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Marvel turned to their second tier with Thor and Captain America, if their desire to make the Avengers film was to become a real possibility.Kenneth Branagh was entrusted to get Thor of the ground. The Shakespearean actor and director was a left field choice that turned out to be an inspired and bold move.Now with the sequel, we go back to the land of Tolkienism with elves and the age of darkness. Before the reign of 'Odin' (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by 'Malekith' (Christopher Eccleston) who craved the energy source called 'Aether.'Although Malkieth was initially unsuccessful a rare convergence means he can begin his task again to grab this energy source so he can destroy once again.It is up to Thor to stop him and he might need to get Loki to assist him. The action moves from Asgard to Greenwich which seems the London location of choice for many US blockbusters in the last few years. Loki making his third appearance in a Marvel film get the best lines, Eccleston the actor responsible for the relaunch of Doctor Who gets little to do or show his skill because Loki has all the focus.The film despite its action, special effects and CGI is just average. Entertaining but instantly forgettable, but the film leaves you with a set up for a third film because even Norse legend/superheros can be dumb by trusting any stranger with there powerful artefacts.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Having said that, the first Thor film was a little 'meh'. I'm glad to say this one improves on it in every possible sense. It starts off slow but builds into an engaging and thoroughly enjoyable story.The story is pretty good for a film that makes no logical sense, the characters are well-developed, the action is excellent, the script is good and the jokes are amusing throughout. There is less overacting and the overly Shakespearian language has been toned down a bit, but still present as it should be. And I'm glad to say that there is only one moment for girls to swoon over a shirtless Chris Hemsworth.The CGI and effects were excellent but, for an effects-driven film, they were almost overshadowed by the quiet intense moments between Loki, Odin and Thor. The acting was solid throughout from pretty much every cast member, Hemsworth doing a good job as the hero, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins with solid performances and Ecclestone excellent as the menacing villain, even if his motivations and plan don't make much sense. The most surprising thing about this film was its successful attempts to be funny. It could almost be called an action-comedy, with many laugh- out-loud moments. A film that is fairly dark, hence the title, but still doesn't take itself too seriously. There are missteps; I might be the only one who didn't realise that Charing Cross isn't 3 stops from Greenwich, and frankly I didn't care, it was still an amusing sceneThe film itself is littered with Easter eggs and references to other Marvel characters and films, which make it very enjoyable for fans of the comics. The best part of this film was the ending, with a few huge reveals, teases and WTF moments for anyone with knowledge of the comic books. This is simply a well-made superhero film, possibly one of the best ever. Certainly one of the best films of this year.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Focusing a lot more on Jane Foster in this is what killed it for me. It's just not anything exciting that makes you care about it. And the idea of Jane finding the Aether is just stupid and unbelievable. This plot is very forgettable.I really love how we get to see Thor and Loki working together. They're dynamic is super entertaining to watch.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 5/10
The overall plot is super boring and not entertaining at all. The big fight scenes also aren't that cool and entertaining. The last fight has some very interesting stuff to watch with all of the portal things.But Thor and Loki working together is very entertaining to watch, and I enjoy that bit a lot. I also enjoyed watching Thor interact with all the other characters, since they've all been previously introduced.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 6/10
We see a lot of emotion in this. All if the characters relationships with each other are developed a lot in this movie.The story kind of coming out of no where and not really being believable makes it hard to get invested in it, even a little bit.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 4/10
I really couldn't think of a good theme in this one. Maybe just Thor's relationships with other people. Jane Foster especially.The movie as a whole isn't very deep. But there is a lot of depth with Loki and his relationship with Thor. And also they develop Thor and Jane's relationship a lot more.5. Characters - 6/10
I love how they gave Loki more of a role in this. His character is very intriguing. I also enjoyed how they gave the warriors three more screen time. They are very cool characters. I also love how we get more Heimdall in this movie. He is a very cool character.Jane Foster is just not anyone to care for. And Darcy is even more annoying. I also think they ruined the character of Erik Selvig. It does make a little sense why, but not completely. Because Clint Barton is just fine after being controlled by Loki. But to be fair, Selvig was a being controlled a lot longer.6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
All the acting is very good. Especially Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He is very good. I also love how Zachary Levi is in this film as Fandral. And wish we got more of him. And Natalie Portman is pretty mediocre.7. Cinematography - 6/10
There were some very cool shots in this that I actually really liked. And the big, grand shots of Asgard are very cool.I just don't like how dark this film is. The whole film just feels cloudy, which makes it less entertaining to watch.8. Score - 10/10
I really enjoyed the music in this. It was really good. It sounded very similar to the music in Avengers. It has a very epic feel to it.9. Editing / Pace - 8/10
The editing is very good. Especially the last fight scene. It is edited in a very cool and entertaining way.The pacing is OK. It is already a shorter movie, but at times feels like it is dragging on.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 7/10
Pretty good but not perfect. Only a few times when Thor was flying, or the Aether that it didn't look very good.Average Score:
6.4/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
6.3/10
Bringing the Aether in this way with Jane Foster is just dumb. Especially for how important it becomes. I love the Loki, Thor dynamic that we see. This movie is just very very forgettable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story, villain, and connectivity to The Avengers is laughable and the cliché humanoid 60's Star Trek aliens take you out of the movie.

This is a delightful feast for the eyes and a masterful story. I'm an old guy and my tastes run all over the place, but I was taken in from he start As I've said before, people are taking their times with these films, not throwing out some cheap sequel to get a quick buck. Once again the setup is very well done. Loki is in prison in what looks like the city zoo. He rests in squalor, waiting his turn to return to power. He is a master of misdirection and disguise, so we never know when we can trust him. The answer, of course, is never. Still, for me, he is the most engaging of all the characters. He is a perpetual thorn in the side of everyone. He is the incarnation of the true Norse character, the trickster. The plot is really interesting. Ultimately, we must get to earth because all the adventure above the ground becomes a bit distant to us mortals. The researchers, including Natalie Portman's character (who has fallen big time for Thor and he for her), continue to try to figure out a way to understand the workings of this netherworld. An array of fun characters, most carried over from the first film as well as the Avengers, parry and thrust their way. Despite the grave consequences of their actions and those of the gods, there is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor and surprising twists that make it more than a bunch of characters trying to beat each other to a pulp.

The storyline and characters are much more developed so you a better sense of the life of Thor. You also see that Loki has true heart felt feelings for his mother and brother which is not seen in Thor 1 or the Avengers. I laughed several times during the movie which was great considering the heavy subject line.The only drawback to the movie is the overly ""comic book"" and ""superhero"" feel to the story. There is the token ""helpless woman"" who the hot superhero is working to save. This is way over played in superhero movies these days so I cannot deduct rating stars for Thor following this ""guideline"".

Maybe they were different for a reason."" Two Years after saving New Mexico, Thor (Hemsworth) still thinks often of Jane (Portman) and vice versa. After receiving familiar signals on her equipment Jane and crew check out the source. What they find not only reunites them with Thor but also endangers Earth, Asgard and the entire universe. Having no other choice they all must unite with the enemy they most despise in order to save everything and everyone. As many of you know by now I am not a huge comic book movie fan. I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had. All that said though this is a good movie and worth watching, especially to continue the complete story of the saga. Overall, good movie but I didn't think it was as good as first one. As always don't forget to keep watching through the credits...there are two extra scenes! I give it a B.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It wasn't a masterpiece, but nobody should expect too much of a superhero movie: they are all made to entertain with enjoyable sci-fi mumbo jumbo and some fan service for the female public – which is kind of unusual, since men are the main target audience of superhero movies, and we haven't had any relevant/good female superhero movies recently (or even ever?). But I digress; the important thing here is that the first Thor was good and – according to the superhero movie rule – the sequel should have been even better: was it? Thor: The Dark World starts by telling a myth about Dark Elves, their lord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and how he wanted to send the whole Universe into darkness by using a strange substance called the Aether, but was defeated by Asgardians. In the present, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is still waiting for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to return after two years, and investigates all anomalies she encounters. Such an anomaly makes her invisible to Heimdall (Idris Elba) for some time, so Thor, worried, comes to take her to Asgard, where they discover that the Aether runs through her veins and is slowly killing her. Chaos ensues as Dark Elves attack Asgard and Thor has to team up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to stop them.The first thing that you might notice about this movie is that it is laughably silly, but also very entertaining: it is almost 2 hours long but it doesn't feel like it, and it doesn't bore. Actually, the ending almost feels rushed and I wish it were a bit longer and more developed. Action and non-action scenes alike are entertaining and interesting. But it is very silly: the Dark Elves, the exposition, the story itself – everything feels as if it was made for really dumb people who, hadn't the movie been so simple, would have flooded the internet with ""I don't get it"" threads. But still, I found it enjoyable and laughed at the silliness a few times, especially at that one scene – that goes nowhere – where we see Thor shirtless, washing his hands and then staring at the distance. It lasts a few seconds and is completely useless – except for maybe making girls faint/stare in awe. A truly good movie feature is the villain: Malekith is quiet, ruthless, dangerous – he doesn't joke around, he truly wants to kill everybody.Christopher Eccleston, who plays Malekith, is great (and maybe that's why he never looked good as The Doctor: he's much better at playing villains!), and I want to congratulate him for being able to stand 6 hours of make-up every time to look like Malekith. Tom Hiddleston is simply amazing as Loki, he stole the show and fit his role perfectly. Too bad he got so little screen time, especially considering the other actors. Hemsworth is still good, but Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman are just awful. I can understand Portman's horrible performance, since she wanted out of the project (but wasn't allowed) when Patty Jenkins, who should have directed this Thor, dropped out due to creative differences. I still have to find a reason why Hopkins looks so bored and tired the whole time. I sure hope one of them gets a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor, because they really ruined the movie – just like the awful green screen in some scenes, which is shameful for a movie that has such a big budget. In conclusion, Thor: The Dark World is an entertaining popcorn flick that could have been better but that you'll enjoy nonetheless.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Thor continues to be a captivating force, balancing strength and vulnerability. The film editing seamlessly weaves together cosmic battles and human drama, creating a whirlwind of excitement. Its strength lies in its exploration of the convergence and the potential consequences of disrupting the balance of the Nine Realms. The music elevates the epic scale, and the cinematography paints a visually stunning world of Asgard and beyond. While it may not be the most heralded entry in the MCU, ""Thor: The Dark World"" brings a cosmic charm and showcases the importance of heroism across the realms. My love for it is as vast as the universe it explores.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Could have fooled me that's for sure.When people talk about this movie they often talk about how great it looks, well the budget is 170 000 000 dollars so OF COURSE it looks good.It would take the biggest idiot on earth not to be able to make it look good with that big of a budget, just hire a great director of photography, set director and CGI artists and everything will fall into place... Visually.To get it right story-wise and acting-wise of course requires a little more finesse which in reality is not the movies strong parts if we're being realistic here.The plot is messy and throw random sci fi logic (with very little actual logic) and events around like they are sprinkling an ice cream and not really seeing the full picture of what story they are trying to convey, random transportation ports and monsters for instance is very convenient to say the least.And the acting, oh no, Nathalie Portman who I usually like a lot does the definition of a phoned in performance clearly just doing the movie for the money and the rest of the cast is not that much better.But who cares about plot and acting in a Marvel movie right? Clearly not that many considering the high rating (of currently 7.1).If people asked for more than just a stylish movie and didn't sucker in just because a movie looks good and has cool action scenes then perhaps we would have gotten a little more substance to it, but clearly that is not a lot of people's priorities which is unfortunate.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Thor believes his love interest Jane Forter (Natalie Portman) safeguards the power within her and it's up to him to want it destroyed before his new enemy Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) can use it to kill his father, destroy Asgard and Earth too.

The great special effects, especially at first when the dark elf (yeah, that happened) space shuttles attacked Asgaard, the ridiculously cool Idris Elba, Loki's tricks, Thor's pathetic heroism and Stellan's craziness, the native brutality that Eccleston can radiate with so much ease (screw Doctor Who, I'll just destroy everything, LOL!), they all had something to do with it.But the story was not good, there so many holes in it that Swiss cheese would laugh at it. I don't want to spoil the movie, but in retrospect, Odin's plan was a lot better than what Thor did, not to mention the effect it had in the end. Jane's character is a helpless damsel in distress, although considering the other protagonists, it actually made sense. Thor's friends started cool, but then they ended up less than support characters. Thor himself does nothing but speak with a really deep voice and look pretty. Odin seems fickle and mean, I guess being king of the universe does that to anyone. Renee Russo is a queen, her character made the most sense to me.If one character stole the spotlight, it had to be Idris Elba's. He freaking destroyed an invisible space shuttle by jumping on it and stabbing it! Thor just swung his phallic symbol around. It was nice to see science triumph (after all, it always does) but the mambo jumbo spear like thingies that detect and also cause stuff were really too much.Chris O'Dowd is in this film, too. He is right in his element, as Malekith wanted to restart the universe to fix things, as it were, but has a really small role. Benicio del Toro appears as the mysterious collector at the end (wait until after the first credits to see him). He looks really cool. And if we are to praise the support characters, Zachary Levi looked interesting as the calm gentlemanish swordsman with great skill. Perhaps an offshoot of Thor, featuring Thor's friends rather than himself, would be a good idea, no?Also, after all the credits there is a funny scene with the Gwoemul- like monster that people forgot on Earth. Yeah, kudos if you were wondering what happened to it in the end :)Bottom line: you can make a thousand How It Should Have Ended parodies after this film, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It hurts to think of the exquisite beauty the graphics people created for a movie that had the story of a fairy tale book for three year olds and how much more coolness a great story would have gotten out of the film.

The story of Thor is based of the scandinavic myths and songs and in the movie Thor more or less acts as a viking and looks like one too everything in Asgard is made to mimic the Scandinavian culture or perception of Asgard after all thats where the sourse is from and it is such a bummer when you see that Heimdall is cast as black nothing against Idris Elba great actor but thats not how Scandinavians describe it in their songs thats not how it is even in the comic book sourse and what about Thour's gang one of them fights with rapier the other one is Asian thanks god he does not fight with nunchaku although that would make more sense.

I hadn't seen the movie in forever and was just getting around to it while rewatching the MCU. This movie is underrated. The only real problem I have with it is the villain. In my opinion, this would have easily been the standout of all eight MCU films that had been released to this point. Excellent performances by Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, and Tom Hiddleston. The best special effects in the franchise to this point. A great cosmic plot that follows up immediately after the events of ""The Avengers."" Some great character development for Thor, Loki, and Jane Foster.Again, it's the villain that sours the movie for me. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) does not have a character at all. I love the idea of his scheme, colliding the Nine Realms together to wipe them out. A god hero needs a cataclysmic event to stop; this isn't Tony Stark or Peter Parker we're talking about. It's just a shame that Malekith and the Dark Elves get next to nothing, very similar to the Frost Giants from the first ""Thor.""Could have been much better, but I still think even then that it's severely underrated for what it delivers on.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In this theory it's a great sci-fi epic about beings that look like viking gods. In practice though it is not a great movie as much as it is a deeply flawed movie with some very nice individual scenes in it.The biggest problem T:tDW has is, that it is a Marvel movie and just like very other Marvel movie it does its best to make the viewers remember that they are in fact watching a Marvel movie. This leads into nudges and winks towards the other movies in Marvel's arsenal, which in this case make the movie feel a bit disjointed as it assumes that the viewer has already seen those. It also means that the characters don't really get that much flesh in their stories as the writing clearly seems to assume that someone else is going to flesh out the characters more in somewhere else. That's why the movie is filled with familiar faces whom a casual viewers might have very hard time identifying with, as they have no inkling who those many faces are and what is their significance.TtDW is a fun movie none the less. It is more or less forgettable sequel to a relatively forgettable movie in the first place, but just like the first movie it is reasonably well done to fill its purpose of entertainment. Sadly though it could have been so much more, but in the end that wasn't in the cards.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That process made it so much more boring.Gone are the operatic tones and performances. Gone are scenes of father and son yelling at each other over big things in large sets with bright colors. Instead we get father and son arguing under their breaths about things in dark rooms with ""realistic"" performances. It's such a drab drag of a film.First we get a prologue about the Dark Elves who fought Asgardians five thousand years before when the Dark Elves tried to put the entire universe into darkness. They, of course, failed, and will surely never be mentioned again. Just ahead 5,000 years, and it's two years after Thor had visited Earth, and some undetermined amount of time after Thor had his little adventure in New York, the nine realms have been thrown into chaos and Thor helps to tamp down on rebellions and plunderings. Thor has succeeded enough that now there is talk of him returning to Earth for the first time since the last time he went to Earth and didn't see his sort of girlfriend Jane Foster.Jane Foster, in order to justify her mere presence in the movie, falls into a random hole that takes her directly to where the aether is, the mystical substance that was going to darken the universe at the hands of the Dark Elves five thousand years prior. The aether inhabits her and sends her back to Earth. It is unclear if this was a random occurrence or if the aether is somehow intelligent with agency (I'm leaning towards random since the aether does nothing else on its own in the film). Thor takes her back to Asgard where the Asgardians are amazed by the aether's presence but have no idea what to do. The only one who knows what to do are the Dark Elves (Surprise! They're back!), who have been in hibernation for the past five thousand years and wake up that very day. Probably because they have some sort of aether detecting peace of fantasy tech that can detect the substance across vast distances instantaneously. Or, they came out of hibernation a couple of days before the event from five thousand years before is going to repeat. Or something. The Dark Elves and their motives are really unclear.I'm sorry. This movie was tough to sit through. It's garbage from beginning to end. The plot doesn't matter because it makes no sense. Much like Iron Man 2, I was left constantly asking myself as I watched, ""What is the story of this movie?"" I mean, what's Thor's emotional journey in this? It seems like it's actually about his relationship with Loki, but Loki disappears for more than an hour, having nothing to do with the movie at all for almost two-thirds of the film's runtime. The Dark Elf plot feels like a serial adventure while the stuff with Loki (which was added late in the process after people loved him in The Avengers) is the actual meat of the emotional journey. It's a rather stark juxtaposition. But even then, the ""meat"" is given almost no real time to develop before Loki ""dies"" again and we're off to the film's climax.Now, I'm not one to nitpick things not conforming to reality, or even to a film's own established rules on smaller things. My focus is on character and theme. If those things are going well, I tend to be more forgiving of stupid nonsense. However, when the basic tenets of storytelling are being shredded through sheer incompetence, these bits of idiocy bug me more and more. For instance, the portals that seem to follow no rules whatsoever and become so important late in the movie. Well, they don't follow any discernable logic. I think that's the point, but when fights to the death turn based on this randomness, it doesn't feel like randomness, it feels like a screenwriter trying to be clever while also giving his characters easy outs of tough situations.This makes me kind of sad. Thor was one of the bright spots of Phase 1, and Thor: The Dark World is probably the worst movie of the franchise.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Was the public ready to take to an actual hammer wielding God played by a then virtually unknown Australian actor in a setting that seemed ripe for parody? In 2014 the answer is an overwhelming yes with Thor and in a real world sense Chris Hemsworth becoming one of the most popular Marvel screen incarnations but with this popularity comes more expectation. The original Thor was a pleasantly entertaining surprise directed with a stately manner by Brit Kenneth Branagh so how does the sequel match up? The worst thing about Thor: The Dark World is just how achingly predictable the whole plot line is and if it were not for that there is much to enjoy in this sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously and features a rampant pace that is missing in many middling Blockbusters of recent times. Most scenes in the movie feel well paced and edited with barely a moment in between set pieces to catch your breathe. It's perhaps thanks to Game of Thrones mainstay and now Dark World director Alan Taylor that the film plays out in such a manner and produces some at times highly impressive visuals and vistas. With all this highly polished production and behind the scenes wins going back to the story is what makes the movie sadly such a forgettable one.Thor's original casting was a major win in the beginning and again the leads in Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston and Hopkins all do a fine job with their respective roles with predictably banter between both Thor and Loki a particular highlight. Eccleston as the lead villain Malekith is sadly a complete non-event with what is perhaps the most lame and uninteresting Marvel screen villain we have yet seen (that is saying something when you look back to The Sandman). In concerns to the story it seems like an afterthought with the melodrama that plays out within it and there is never any real sense of the stakes as the film just doesn't try enough to have that dread that worked so well with the Avengers or even the original Thor.To criticise a story in a Marvel movie may seem trivial but to go with your bang for your buck you want your brain engaged also with a story that feels somewhat fresh and original and sadly despite spectacle and an easy going charm The Dark World misses this mark badly. In saying this characters within the film remain interesting in their own right and with such a brisk pace the film truly never outstays its welcome.3 convenient cave time travel portals out of 5 P.S – as per usual with a Marvel jaunt make sure your stay through all the credits!

The truth is somewhere in the middle, Thor will never be the best movie you ever saw, nor will it be the worst ever, if you think its the worst ever then you haven't seen Dragonball evolution. What can i say about this movie, There was far too much going on to connect with the characters in too short a time.Yet still, the acting scenes and action were solid. The movie just lacked emotional substance, which you would expect from a Thor movie. Things could have been explored a little differently especially when it comes to romance and some other of Thor's relationships including Natalie Portman's character, Jane. There was a lot of one dimensionality to the characters with the exception of Loki. Other than that this movie was solid fun.I would suggest renting it or having it in your DVD collection, for that boring Saturday. It isn't a memorable one but it will wind the time away and give you a few laughs and giggles.

With a lot of humour to add to the plot it could be said this is one superhero movie that doesn't always take itself so seriously and shows that Thor can do more than just one film. I felt by the end that it was a firmly OK movie and here below is why so.The story is kind of confusing like at times, it jumps from one thing to another and although you won't be lost, some scenes are fairly quick and dialogue can be missed. I did enjoy the action side of the film and the scenes shown containing fights etc are well laid out so that the film never gets to dull for the viewer. It tries to crack a few jokes here and there and they can be funny at times, if anything it lightens the movie up in parts.I found Chris Hemsworth to be good, not great but he does the job he is supposed to do and it has to be said he is well choreographed all the way through. Natalie Portman is OK but can maybe seem just slightly under acting but is usually saved by fellow cast members. Tom Hiddleston well I wasn't too sure on him in this second instalment, I felt he tried too hard to be the big sinister guy in certain scenes and although by the end he has done an OK job, still just a little over the top.It is well directed and to say the effects are so big and expansive in this movie, Alan Taylor seems to finish this up well. I wasn't always too keen on the script whilst watching and although I think it improves as the movie progresses, it still could do with a few tweaks here and there. On the point of effects, they are everywhere it would seem but not bad at all and contribute very well to the thrills felt throughout the film.The main negativity coming from this is the way in which it has too much a complicated plot that isn't a smart one, I mean that in the sense that it could be intelligent and well thought out but by the end the story seems to be only about attracting box office receipts. Wasn't also always too keen on the acting side but people such as Hemsworth really start to regain control of that part of the film and stop it fading badly.For the fan of superheroes or comics, this could be said to be not the best of them but still highly recommend if you really want a lot of action with an epic back story. If your not a fan I would still say go and see, it has a certain air of comedic charm which kind of make it feel a bit different to other such films and not always trying to be too serious.Overall I felt It to be Firmly Pleasing and a film that never quite loses the aim of the game. My review may seem very negative indeed but in many cases it is not bad, hugely enjoyable in parts, confusing but fun in others this is one Superhero movie that could by the very end, very much split opinion among people.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

From the beginning we have a poor plot, like most Marvel movies. For some reasons, Dark futuristic space Elves want to wipe out the world that they failed eons ago. Taking too much out of the great battle of the Lord The Rings, the Elves are broken and exiled, promising to return with a weapon to destroy and rule all life *cough one ring* Meanwhile somewhere else in the space time spectrum, Thor and his cliché mundane battle brethren who seem as out of place as the swords and axes with their stupid cross over space ships, grenades and guns, are waging war with other.. things not explained. Returning after certain victory with Thor on their side, our Northen hero in space gets an itch that tells him that whats her face, Jane I think, comes into danger by stupidly touching an alien and obviously evil substance. Oddly enough she isn't abducted by a secret American syndicate, something I thought was definitely going to happen with this plot but alas, it's more simple. Jane is brought to Valhalla as they are the ones to remove said evil substance where we are sadly subjected to Hokins horrible over acting( a shame), Loki being as ordinary as ever( really we have seen this character in a lot of movies, The black sheep of the ruling family intent on taking it over) Loki is in jail, Loki is suddenly not in jail, fight between siblings, more fights, more fights in more stupid sword and gun cross overs, fights on Earth and some professor without pants, obviously a Stan lee cameo ( the only laugh) and more fighting with a nice little boring love moment, all wrapped up in a foreseeable and weak excuse for a plot twist. Pretty visuals... that's really about it that's worth it. I was sad to see Chris D in it. I really just wish movies with such a huge budget put money to novels or more thought out comics with better plots and less stupid content.Thor had great visuals, Decent enough typical blockbuster action and an Australian. 3/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The premise of the film sees an ancient force looking for a powerful weapon that forces Thor to return to Earth and reunite with Jane Foster.Main Character
Chris Hemsworth is always good as Thor, for me this is probably the weakest he is playing the role but he is still good here. After the events of the first film it is pretty cool to see Thor in a solo film with all of his powers and he has plenty of time to throw down and does it well. The film also has clearly showed the development of the character from his first film through The Avengers to The Dark World and it is one of the better elements of the film. He starts to show some of the comedic timing we know he has and it leads to a pretty decent lead performance.Supporting Characters
Tom Hiddleston is back as Loki and for me he is easily the best part of this film, he is so charismatic and has the best lines here. He is more of an anti-hero in this film and it is a nice development of the dynamic between Thor and Loki that we had seen at this point in The MCU. Anthony Hopkins was always a good choice as Odin and his character has an interesting character arc here, in the first film he seems to be the all knowing wise king but he has some issues in this film that requires Thor to sort them out and it provides an interesting wrinkle. Idris Elba, Rene Russo & Jaime Alexander are all decent in their roles but they are much smaller so seems a bit unfair to talk about them too much. Natalie Portman is back as Jane Foster and she didn't work for me here. I thought their romance worked in the first film, but here it feels like she is just a damsel in distress and no a well developed character and just a really bland element here. Christopher Eccleston plays the villain Malekith and this is one of the most boring villains in The MCU. He has nothing interesting and unique about him at all, he is so forgettable and the film does a terrible in making him a threat to Thor and it really hurts the film. I also wasn't a fan of the use of Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard here and felt like they annoyed me, especially when everything is going down in the final battle.Story
The story feels like a pretty natural sequel to The Avengers in how it treats certain characters and that is nice to see. I liked how the development between Thor and Loki was handled and the fact we got to spend more time on Asgard, also the film has a great pretty clifhangery ending. But the film lacks real weight to it, the bad guys plot is generic, half the characters are useless and there is a romance I didn't care about. The film just doesn't have great storytelling and overall it shows despite it doing some things okay.Script
The script is similar to the story, there are some fun exchanges and a few dramatic moments but overall it lacks bite and a real sense of scale and intrigue. There is just too much of the film that I found boring and actually make no sense which on this occasion really hurt the overall product.Style
Along, with Hiddleston and Hemsworth, the other best thing about this film is the style. The action scenes are great and feel very grand and exciting with a fresh feel to it. Also the film is paced well, with the film not having too much downtime which is effective.Overall
Overall, this is a good film that is an entertaining watch. I don't think it is as good as the first Thor film but if you like super hero films then this is a decent way to pass 2 hours.Rating - 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Comic scenes are perfect and make you laugh. The second half has some great visual effects and good action. The climax fight is what most of the people dint like in the reviews but I loved it. Chris Hemsworth has owned the character and I can't imagine anyone else in that outfit now. Loki is funny and intriguing. Overall a good package but not as good as the first installment.Cons: Comic scenes were good but there were too many. If you wanted it to be dark, you will be a bit disappointed. As a character, Malekith was not developed properly. The story does not revolve much around him even though he is the main villain of the movie. The first half was a bit dull as compared to the second half. The 3d effects are not up to the mark and i was feeling irritated watching it in 3D as there was nothing so great about them that I had to watch everything with a tint of black.Overall if you like Thor, you will like the movie. He is my favorite Marvel character (of course after Tony Stark). Natalie Portman has nothing much to do except being a mess or the source of problems for Thor and Asgard.The post credit scene reveals a bit about Avengers: Age of Ultron and was worth waiting for.The post post credit scene is something you may as well skip as it's definitely not worth the wait.I liked the movie but wanted it to be better.7 on 10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Those are traits of many comics, and not necessarily bad ones.Maybe it's my interest in Nordic mythology which gives Thor the edge, or the astonishingly great, epic scenes in the movie. Or Loki, who is mostly great, as before.Highly recommended - don't pay too much attention to reviews!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So, assuming you've already enjoyed anything from Thor 1 to Iron Man 3, then you'll probably enjoy this, too. It follows the whole 'Marvel superhero formula' pretty closely and, if I'm being harsh, doesn't really bring anything new to the table. However, when a movie is this much fun, a lack of originality isn't that much of a problem.It's a fun, action-packed romp and, even if you haven't seen the first one (or any other Marvel film of late) then, as long as you understand the basic concept of 'good vs evil' then you should have no problem picking up on what's happening.Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Tom Hiddleston is equally great as Thor's nemesis 'Loki' and the rest of the cast all play their parts well, too.So, all you need is a big bucket of popcorn and an hour and forty-four minutes to kill and you should enjoy some seriously fun 'hammer time.'

The best aspect of the movie is Loki, literally every scene he's in he absolutly crushes it. Thor's relationship with Jane was satisfying to watch but not explored enough. Much of this is due to the misuse of Jane's character.Despite all the narrative problems this film has great action as well as a good soundtrack and effects. It's safe to say that you're on to a decent adventure.All in all, this film shows us the problem of producing movies just for contractual duties, it can be fun and exciting at times but the substance will always be lacking...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

We have the standard bad guy who doesn't really have much motivation other than to consume everything in darkness because... well, evil?The great positives of this movie are firstly... surprise surprise, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Certainly my favorite part of both the first Thor movie and The Avengers, he's still fantastic in this movie. At one point his one-liners became rather tiresome, but for the most part in this movie, he's a greatly enjoyable character with the greatest character arc.
Secondly, Asgard is still just as beautiful as in the first Thor movie, if not even more beautiful. Tons of great VFX work throughout this movie makes it look gorgeous, I bought the blu-ray for this movie for the visual aspect alone.Some negative parts of the film would be firstly as mentioned before, the ""bad guy"" who carry as much depth as a kiddy pool. The script overall feels a bit ""meh""... with some poor dialogue throughout. Direction is also a tad messy and you can expect this whole ""9 universes"" thing to make up some confusing and messy scenes.I must admit that I was afraid a huge triangle-drama would occur when Jane and Thor's female warrior buddy, Sif exchanged looks, clearly indicating Sif's jealousy towards Jane. Luckily, they never went further on this.To conclude...
Enjoyable movie with great visual effects and most importantly, Loki.
Some negatives can be found, but overall I consider this to be among the better Marvel movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Not Thorful, But Not Thorsome Either","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2926696/?ref_=tt_urv","BharatSamra","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23758725/?ref_=tt_urv","22 December 2013","Thor: The Dark World expands on the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe, quite literally, this time with one of the least exciting Avengers taking the spotlight for Hammertime.Despite the devoted fan-base of this incredible world of Marvel superheroes, you can't help but feel that Thor: The Dark World is the first instalment in the franchise to feel most contrived and out of place. Yet, this sequel is still a mild improvement on its predecessor, though together they combine for the weakest in the series of superhero films, even though Thor is probably the strongest out of the bunch. The film finds Thor doing his thing in Asgard, before his lady love Jane Foster conveniently stumbles upon a weapon known as the Aether, which the Dark Elf Malekith intends to use to destroy the universe. Asleep yet?Negativity aside, Thor: The Dark World is a mostly enjoyable comic-book flick with some superb action, actors and, I can't think of another word that begins with 'a' so, humour.For an incredibly cheesy character, Chris Hemsworth still has the oh my demigod factor to bring a great balance of confidence, charisma and physicality to the role of Thor. This can be said of all of the Asgardians, including Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Tom Hiddleston's fan- favourite portrayal of Loki. While narratively Thor: The Dark World is predominantly yawn-inspiring, the presence of Hiddleston's Loki compensates as fans are genuinely interested to see his current personality and relationship with Thor following the events of The Avengers in 2012. It is the human characters that are the dull, annoyingly cheesy and unnecessary obstacles that often get in the way of the overall pleasant 112 minute sequel. Notably, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is used as a pathetic damsel in distress signal masquerading as a character with any significance, while Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) is pretty much the idiotic joke machine waiting for her cue. These characters, along with the contrived villain Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are really the Aether to what could have been a very promising second outing for Thor. With no disrespect to these actors whom deliver fine performances, it is their characters that suppress absolute enjoyment of Thor: The Dark World.Apologies for this tennis match I am having with myself in complementing and then hammering Thor: The Dark World's qualities; still I'll continue to play. More positively, the film is possibly the greatest comedic achievement for the superhero squadron on screen to date. One moment had the audience in an uproar of laughter; those that have seen it will know the moment, and those that are yet to see the film will know when they bear witness to its hilarity. Even during other scenes where the humour feels slightly inappropriate given the circumstances, you'll easily yield with laughter, or at the minimum, a low-key grin.It's almost superfluous today to commend a modern blockbuster for its CGI quality. However due to its stark visual improvement over its 2011 predecessor, Thor: The Dark World is certainly worth mentioning as an aesthetically potent force which makes the movie a Thorful lot of fun!Whilst the Thorsome Asgardian actors, humour and visual effects are enough to keep Marvel fans entertained for two short hands around the clock, it doesn't take too long to realise that Thor: The Dark World is probably the most forgettable and forced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though by no means the first for Marvel (I'm looking at you 'Amazing' Spider-Man). Thor's lack of character development since the end of Thor, along with the villain out of nowhere and no care Malekith make this sequel feel pretty purposeless in the grander scheme of things. And that's not even mentioning Jane Foster: Marvel's version of Daphne from Scooby-Doo, except more pointless, boring, unconvincing and no fun for anyone.After a Thortless and needlessly dull opening 45 minutes, Thor: The Dark World has plenty of surprises along the way to amuse the fandom inside of devotees, that'll shadow its flaws until you really start to think about the film, but it's some fun while it lasts.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Solid Improvement Over the Original THOR","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3050367/?ref_=tt_urv","brando647","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3947986/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2014","I may be alone in this opinion but I believed Kenneth Branagh's THOR was the weakest film in the first phase of Marvel films. Yes, even weaker than IRON MAN 2. It wasn't that I hated the film but it failed to leave any sort of impression on me. Thor was always going to be one of the more difficult characters for Marvel to bring to the big screen. As opposed to characters with more ""grounded"" (in the loosest sense of the term) origins, Thor is a more mystical being. He's a demigod from another dimension who's near invulnerable to most forms of damage. So, right off the bat, he's not the easiest to relate to. So the first film went the route of a ""fish- out-of-water"" scenario as Thor loses his Asgardian powers and is banished to Earth to learn his lesson. So he spends a nice portion of the movie without actually being a superhero and we spend it on Earth. You know, that place we've spent every other Marvel movie to that point despite Marvel having a rich mythology with countless other possibilities. So, yeah, THOR was enjoyable but forgettable. But THE DARK WORLD corrects for these past weaknesses and actually brought us a Thor movie that I really enjoyed. The movie begins following the events of THE AVENGERS, with Loki condemned to the Asgardian dungeon for his crimes and Thor struggling to clean up the mess his brother's defiance had created across the Nine Realms.So, for starters, that's a major bonus in this film. We get a nice glimpse of realms other than Asgard, Earth, and Jotunheim. We even get to visit Vanaheim and Svartalfheim. So finally, the Thor films spread their wings a bit and we spend very little time on Earth this time around. It gave the filmmakers opportunities to have some fun with the production design. We get a much grander view of Asgard. It doesn't necessarily look as polished this time around. The first film made Asgard out to be very polished and shiny while THE DARK WORLD gives it a more tactile appearance with stone constructs and shady taverns. Svartalfheim is nothing more than a desolate wasteland with dark sands and a bizarre greenish atmosphere. It is the home of the film's villains, the Dark Elves. With their ruler, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston, the Dark Elves have been around since the creation of our universe and once thrived in the darkness before it's creation. Since the arrival of our universe and the light it brought, the Elves have been fighting for a means of eliminating it to return the universe to ever-lasting darkness. They'd been defeated once before by the Asgardians, under the command of Thor's grandfather Bor. They are awaken from their slumber once again when Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, returning) stumbles across the MCU's latest mystical artifact, the Aether. We never really get a good idea of what the Aether does. We're just told that it's incredibly powerful and Malekith can somehow use it to bring darkness across the Nine Realms during a cosmic event known as the Convergence when all of the realms align.There's our first misstep. The Aether is poorly explained. We see that it has some pretty nifty powers but their never really defined. It's just a shapeless mass of red liquid that provides its owner with seemingly unlimited power. We know these films are bound to have MacGuffins but do we need to treat them so shoddily? Give us some history, some detail. Malekith is obsessed with it and, again, that's about as much detail we get on another important aspect of the story. There have been a lot of complaints about Malekith being underdeveloped and I can't say I entirely disagree. We have a basic motivation and that's about it. He wants to return the universe to darkness and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish it, but give us some more. There has to be more to him. He seems like such a cool character. He could've easily been one of the better MCU villains with some extra time spent getting to know him, but he's relegated to a single mindless goal. The Dark Elves seem to be a very proud people and their talented warriors. There's some history there, so give us a bit. I love their visual style. The black and white color scheme and emotionless face masks give them a wicked creepy appearance. And Kurse is probably the best creature design in any of the films. Director Alan Taylor and his team nailed it with the film's visuals.The cast is mostly fantastic as well. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston inhabit their roles at this point better than I can imagine anyone else would. There's a great brotherly chemistry between them and each of them have grown over the MCU series. Thor has become the noble warrior he was destined to be, surpassing even his father in his tact and strength. Loki continues to reign as one of Marvel's best movie villains and he's given a chance to show a more compassionate side when tragic events give him a reason to fight alongside his brother. Natalie Portman continues to prove that she's just not quite meant for comic movies. I know she's got talent but she always comes across as wooden as Jane in these movies. Kat Dennings returns as unnecessary comic relief and, while I was fine with her excessive goofiness in the first movie, it wasn't really needed here. THE DARK WORLD is a more serious film than it's predecessor and I would've been fine with the little bit of humor that comes through the Thor/Loki interactions. Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are wasted potential as the baddies but they do the best with the limited material they're given.In the end, THE DARK WORLD is a great sequel to a decent film and helped solidify Marvel's second phase of films as an improvement.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In Dark World, Loki had the greatest character arc, from being imprisoned and indifferent to his family, and of questionable loyalty and trustworthiness, to agonizing the death of his mother, and ultimately saving Asgard although remaining mysterious and mischievous throughout. We last see Loki on a great setup for the opening of the third installment. Good humor throughout the film, especially from Professor Selvig. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster was unfortunately a little flat but honestly I think that has less to do with the screenplay and a lot to do with Natalie Portman's acting (she's gorgeous, just not exactly the most convincing actress). I'm not sure how Thor's love life plays out in the comics, I'm sure he ends up with Jane Foster, but I think they should have kept things more interesting with Sif, somewhat of competition for Thor's heart, except Sif never even had a chance which is really a shame, script-wise; a missed opportunity. We don't see anything new from Thor in Dark World, just some additional humbling-down that we saw from him in the first Thor movie when he started off so arrogant, spoiled and entitled, and now he's decided that he'd rather be a superhero than king.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is no shaky cam, which I find tends to get a bit disorienting, and the camera has you right in the middle of all the battles. There is also a lot of humour, more so than in the first instalment of Thor. But I do have a couple of gripes about this film. At the start of the film, which deals with a bit of Asgardian history, Thor's grandfather hides the Aether where ""no-one will ever find it."" You'd think then that some human scientist wouldn't stumble across it very easily not even half an hour into the film. Also, the villain Malekith was very disappointing. Christopher Eccleston did a good job, but there is no back-story to Malekith, his motives are never fully explained, the audience doesn't get a true sense of who he is, his power is underplayed (I thought) and all in all he's just a rather weak antagonist. Finally, Darcy. Annoying, not particularly funny, adds nothing to the film, I just don't know why she's there. And the intern has as intern? Okay, whatever. But apart from that, I really enjoyed it, great action, and a rather satisfying ending.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) searches for the Aether, an indestructible force and finds it in Jane (Natalie Portman). Say what? Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must find a way to save Jane and defeat the Dark Elves. Thor needs the help of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is in prison by order of his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins).This was okay, but the CGI sets showcased all you see and they are spectacular. The action scenes are very good. The only comedic lines were uttered by Loki and to be truthful Loki steals the show. I suppose the professor running naked at the Stonehenge site was funny to some, not to me. It wasn't funny and didn't add much to the story. Why have it? Not much happens between Thor and Jane although she had been waiting for his return for 2-years. This was okay, but the Convergence when the 9-Realms line up to a point when Malekith can use the Aether to destroy the known universe should have made us pause and be concerned, but that didn't happen. Things happened too fast and we knew Thor would be triumphant. It's really not good to say that we just didn't care, but we didn't. This was okay, but for a civilization as advanced like the Asgards their weapons of choice only seemed to be knives and swords and we did see the Dark Elves use what looked like ray-guns. Oh, yes, Thor has his Hammer. Knives and swords? Give me a break. This was okay only because of the action scenes and sets design and they were very good. Now for the dilemma: Two people die in this. What will a sequel bring us without them? One is kind of important to the Thor story. Huh? However, there is that scene at the very end that confused me and may confuse you too. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

This will ensure the nine realms live happily ever after, under the benign rule of ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) and his much loved wife Frigga (Rene Russo).Meanwhile in an ancient flashback we get acquainted with Aether, a very dark power the Dark Elve warriors ""Kursed"", led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are keen to get their hands on. They are frustrated in this endeavour by the armies of Asgard, led by ""Bor"", Odin's father from many thousands of years ago.Back on Earth, Astrophysicist ""Jane"" (Natalie Portman) is led by her intern ""Darcy"" (Kat Dennings), equipped with her own PA, to an abandoned warehouse where objects appear to act oddly, disappearing to another dimension when dropped from a staircase.Separating from the group, Jane is suddenly teleported to another realm as you do and becomes possessed by the ancient super weapon Aether, an easy mistake to make whilst out taking a stroll.Concerned for Jane's safety, after being alerted to her plight by Fandral (Idris Elba), Thor brings Jane to Asgard. It is obvious her presence in Asgard is dangerous, as it lures the Kursed like a moth to the light, or darkness to the Aether. Following events, Thor is obliged to trust Loki and Fandral to find a way to leave Asgard against his fathers wishes, leading to an attempt to trick Melkith and destroy the Aether.Can Loki be trusted, is the fate of the world's safe, will the foretold alignment of all nine realms lead to a cataclysmic event, all good comic book questions to answer.The film is an obvious upgrade from the original film with a budget to match, Hemsworth and Hiddleston play their parts with consummate ease and obvious glee. Hemsworth retaining his almost Shakespearean style of delivery, which remains a source of amusement to the audience but is largely accepted by the earth bound characters. Both lead actors star wattage is much higher than before and clearly are enjoying every scene and one-liner. It is now difficult to imagine either part being played by other actors.As before, the film seemingly represents a hybrid of earlier movies, stealing like a hyperactive magpie from new Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Occasionally the slim story and movie Macguffin (Aether) is exposed and the film skirts close to Game of Thrones (GOT) without the sex and gore. All huge throne rooms, fabulous cities and dark portentous events hanging over proceedings. Director Alan Taylor, previously directed 6 GOT episodes which may explain the similarities.However, if you treat the film as pure entertainment, as you should, there is much fun to be had. Buoyed by the lead actors having a blast and not taking themselves too seriously. However Hopkins looks somewhat uncomfortable, perhaps not getting the ""do not take this too seriously memo"" and Rene Russo gets little to do. However gate keeper Elba, obviously a much bigger star than before, gets his role beefed up accordingly.Back on earth, Stellan Skarsgard as a scientist helping Jane, gets ready for his ""Nymphomaniac"" Lars Von Triers directed role, by spending much of the time in a state of undress or in an institution, presumably the pay was good. Portman, understandably performing heroine in distress duties most of the time still manages to be attractive, strong and vulnerable as required. We also get a brief cameo from Chris O'Dowd as Jane's prospective boyfriend post Thor, good luck with that endeavour.There is plenty of humour to puncture the preposterousness of a man/god with a big hammer smashing stuff up, which is almost a pre-requisite in our post-modern, self referential movie world.Watch out for two post credit sequences, a neat cameo and of course Stan Lee, all now well established Marvel studio trademarks.Summary A different, better and more confident film than the original and continues to expand the Thor universe in an interesting way.Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on fine form, if you like comic book superhero films with state of the art effects and enjoyable characters, this will do very nicely.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

His mythical roots and overwhelming power never made him the most popular character out there. That all changed with 2011's Thor, and even more so in The Avengers. There definitely are stumbles along the way, but Thor: The Dark World gives another solid solo outing for The God of Thunder.As the second entry in Phase 2 of Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU), Thor: The Dark World is restricted to telling a story that will fit into the MCU, but that doesn't hold back the story one bit in this solo adventure. In fact, in ways you don't fully see until the very end, this movie undoubtedly pushes the entire MCU forward in high gear. The plot focuses around the Aether, an ancient weapon hidden by Asgardians thousands of years ago from a race of Dark Elves and their leader Malekith, who has since returned in pursuit of the Aether and Thor must stop him from consuming the universe in darkness. The plot is interesting and involving, but the pacing is a little all over the place, bouncing between a Lord of the Rings in space vibe to the fish out of water comedic tones on Earth. The narrative has some twists, turns and plenty of humor throughout the whole film, but sometimes things just fall out of place. The Nine Realms were also not expanded on as much as I had hoped, giving a lesser sense to the greater cosmos that exist in Thor's universe, but the film's scale still feels large enough to satisfy.Yet even more entertaining than the main plot, is the subplot created between Thor and his fan favorite brother Loki, now a prisoner of Asgard. This subplot almost takes the form of a villain redemption arc, and it is stellar to say the least. At many points in the film, it almost seemed as though Loki was the star of the show.With each new release in the MCU comes an expectation for high-level action scenes and breathtaking CGI. The Dark World succeeds in delivering both of these in the movie, and in top form as well. Large scale battles with ancient sci-fi tech make for some wonderful CGI and entertaining action sequences. Thor himself is not under powered nor is he over-powered, thus creating a hero who is a blast to watch in action, but also has his short comings against a powerful enemy. All in all, the action lives up to the expectations you'd expect from a MCU flick.The aforementioned enemy is Malekith, and along side him his army of Dark Elves and the powerful, Hulk-like Kursed who provides Thor with a re-incarnation of his Avengers tilt with the green machine. Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, is a pretty poor villain. Dark and evil yes, and that's the main issue, he's utterly one dimensional and unfortunately underdeveloped, as many MCU seem to be, not getting the chance to really evolve into a movie-changing baddie. Yes there are some moments of entertaining action featuring Malekith, but it can't bring him to a level of a top tier villain, and it hurts the film as a whole.The vast majority of the cast from the first Thor returns for the sequel, and mostly still in top form. Chris Hemsworth still proves that he his the perfect man to play Thor, while the supporting cast is very strong. Tom Hiddleston once again puts on a performance that captures him the essence of a lead role, cementing himself as one of the best characters in the MCU. Natalie Portman returns to portray love interest Jane Foster, a less than admirable performance while Anthony Hopkins provides some awesome star power as Odin. These names are just a few that have important roles in the movie, and the wonderful performance by most of the cast gives the characters depth, and in turn are exciting to watch.Since 2008, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been pumping out pure entertainment for hardcore and casual fans alike. There's no denying that this film has some problems with a lack of some character development, and sporadic instances of feeling too small, but Thor: The Dark World continues on Marvel's triumphant path by delivering a fun, flashy and entertaining movie with solid acting and action plentiful enough to keep the movie from ever coming to a complete halt. With a mid-credits scene that teases some potentially major plans for the MCU, this terrific Phase 2 entry seems to be just the beginning for what's to come from the ever-growing world of Marvel heroes.7.5/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jane Foster was not my favorite character in this film since she created so much havoc while exploring about an abandoned structure that she became possessed by a terrible power aether that was slowly killing her. Thor, being the hero, transported Jane to Asgard for help, unaware that the activation of the aether had awoken the Dark Elves and their lord Malekith, who wished to destroy Asgard for their suffering. Frigga and Loki almost were killed as a result, which was tragic.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot was indecisive for me, and scrappy! It was as if there was never meant to be a sequel to Thor...but they had success in the last one so asked Stevie wonder to knit a movie together...and this was it!The action scenes were impressive as always, and the beautiful Natalie Portman is always a plus...but I can't help feel this may have just crossed the line of too much fantasy!On the other hand..certain elements of the plot did impress me. The emotional scenes of a family torn apart, and the introduction of new creatures and mythical relics seem OK to me...This really is a film which I think needs rewatching to fully grasp the elements...the cliffhanger ending is always a Hollywood classic but can't help but that was a bit farfetched...judgement on this film will be more concise once I know the true depth of what is to come

Let me put the weakest elements of this film out first. Emotionally, this film rarely connects as much as the first film. Thor does not receive any noticeable development. Characters like Siv were underutilized and the villain was forgettable. The comedy dosage is a bit too high as well. In these ways, it falters behind the first movie.In other ways, in most other ways, this film is actually an improvement over the first. It's an all around solid film with good pacing and memorable scenes. I'm sure many people were glad to see a fully powered Thor for so much of the movie. The main attraction though is Loki, who, in tradition, steals all the scenes. In fact, Loki's character is written better than ever in this film. The rest of the movie which is at least good, pales in comparison to any scenes with him. There is a noticeable spike in writing quality when Loki is on screen. Thor is also at his best when interacting with Loki.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Replacing Kenneth Branagh, Alan Taylor takes over as director to helm Thor's second solo adventure.Working to restore peace among the nine realms following the destruction of the Rainbow Bridge, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finally puts an end to the chaos. Paying for his crimes on Asgard & Earth, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) finds himself locked in an Asgardian prison. After stumbling upon the Ether, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awakens the leader of the Dark Elves, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). Forced to team up with his brother once more, Thor & Loki have to put their differences aside to save the realm they love.For years, Thor: The Dark World claimed the unfavorable spot of 'Worst MCU Film' and, while one of them has to hold that unfortunate position, I do have a soft spot for this film. Thor: TDW is a lot of fun and although it does make jokes at nearly every possible moment, most of the land. There are some great emotional moments, that truly feel emotional and they are given the proper time to breathe rather than rushing to the next gag. While it starts rather slow with more expositional narration, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is reliably enjoyable in his role. Thor & Loki's relationship is always a high point of any film and the side characters get fleshed out a bit more than they were in the original. The action sequences are fun and exciting, especially the climax and its utilization of a 'Portals' scenario.Staying rooted in its serious and slightly boring nature, the issues with Thor (2011) echo in its sequel. I do believe there are improvements here, but I believe they don't do enough for the franchise. Thor: The Dark World provides memorable, emotional moments, but being held down by its tonal issues, it falls into the same problems as its predecessor.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I did enjoy the first ""Thor"", but this movie does a much better job of exploring some of the other worlds and raising the stakes.The original cast returns for this second film and they are great! Chris Hemsworth is still a great Thor and Tom Hiddleston really gets a chance to shine as Loki. Natalie Portman is still hot and plays a good Jane Foster. The rest of the original cast is good, also, though I really wish that Kat Dennings was not in these movies because she's annoying and pretty pointless. Christopher Eccleston is Malekith, the new villain for the film. He's a bit boring and is honestly pretty forgettable, which is a shame because Eccleston really is a good actor.The story for this movie is very fun. No, it doesn't always make sense, but like other successful Marvel movies, it keeps you entertained and wanting more. The film also does a much better job at foreshadowing ""Avengers 2"" than ""Iron Man 3"" did, so that's an added bonus that all fans should look forward to.The effects are sort of hit and miss. Asgard and the other realms that are shown look spectacular. The action sequences are well choreographed and make for an exciting time. But some of the costumes look a bit silly and fake.Final verdict: ""Thor: The Dark World"" is exactly what it is meant to be. It is an entertaining thrill ride from start to finish, with good characters and great, action packed scenes. It is not a great Marvel movie like ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"", but it is a worthy entry that will leave you entertained and wanting to see it again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So far. And it still means that, by any objective standard, it's a good film with plenty of great action, phenomenal visual effects and good actors.It's just that the story is boring. We get to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) once again as she continues to unravel the mysteries of the universe with her band of plucky sidekicks. Meanwhile, an old threat awakens to cast a shadow over the peace of Asgard, the Realm Eternal. And thus Jane and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) meet once again to protect the Nine Realms. Sounds exciting? It could have been. Unfortunately, whereas in the first Thor movie we had an extremely interesting and dynamic villain in Loki (Tom Hiddleston), here the villain is about as interesting as watching a cattle drive. It sounds and seems exciting at first, but the monotony settles in very quickly. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) has no edge, and quite honestly no personality either. He wants to take over the world because... he wants to take over the world. All the Marvel villains before this film had been huge. They were individuals, larger than life, always scheming, plotting, usually with a smirk on their face. This... man... elf... emo band reject, on the other hand, is only distinguished from his troops by the fact that he speaks a bit more and has a snazzier uniform.The rest of the movie is fine. It's not as good as the first Thor, or any of the other Marvel films, but the returning actors are on the top of their game, it's certainly nice to see Jane, Darcy and Erik once again, not to mention Loki - who still absolutely steals every scene he's in - and the visuals works splendidly. It's only that the story cannot be as captivating as it needs to be without an effective villain.Thor: The Dark World is not the first bad Marvel film, the coming of which we fearfully still await and hope to avoid completely, but it is the first Marvel film that can only be described as average on the whole. Which makes it disappointing, but ultimately still worth a watch.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Thor could not fly; he rode a chariot. His hammer only returned to him if he wore magic gloves. Frigga was not Thor's mother, Jörð was Odin's love and Thor's mother. Loki was not evil, merely a particularly annoying practical joker and mischief maker. Odin was not a peace keeper, he was a pure warmonger always willing to start a fight. Sif was not a warrior, she was goddess of the harvest and grain--and blond. Of all the characters depicted in this movie, only Heimdall was fairly accurate. Natalie Portman is always pleasant to see, but her limited role in this film was not enough to salvage this pathetic excuse for a movie.IMDb viewers gave this movie a 7.2, obviously because they have more familiarity with Marvel comics than Norse mythology.

Alan Taylor has been pretty frank & open in countless interviews regarding his ""particularly wrenching"" behind the scenes experience in helming this movie during the post-production process, admitting he was granted full creative freedom during pre-production & principal photography, only to have his project unexpectedly hijacked & all control seized from him by executives in the editing room - & it shows...
Expertly utilising his skills in capturing fictional, yet striking fantasy locations (a talent previously showcased in HBO's Game of Thrones), the director undeniably breathes new life into the world of Asgard & totally reinvents the aesthetic to seem more grounded & realistic & most importantly, lived in; the spectacular goliath landscape suddenly evolves in to something increasingly believable to audiences; well-realised & more appropriately representing the Norse mythology these Gods initially originated from. To summarise, the faultless world building is utterly incredible & it's no surprise the film decides to spend noticeably more time within Thor's homeworld than in the first by Kenneth Branagh. Moreover, it's really worth acknowledging Kramer Morgenthau's stunning cinematography here too as he somehow manages to enrich the visuals even further in order to create an impressively deeper colour palette which - even to this day - is distinguishable from the rest & unlike any MCU movie which preceded or even followed this installment afterwards, making each & every image in the frame pop with a genuine beauty - accentuating the darkness of the black present in shadows on screen, avoiding the usual dull, lifeless, muted greys we're normally accustomed to from this particular franchise.
In addition, Alan & outstanding cast member Christopher Eccleston (who is SO underrated) have both been brutally honest in subsequent discussions about their aversion to featuring a stereotypical, two-dimensional villain (or a ""cackling fiend"", to quote them directly); preliminary talks began between the two of them for the former Doctor Who star to assume the role of the lead antagonist under the shared pretence that Malekith would be complex; both his backstory & motivations were to be explored to their fullest potential.
The Dark Elves were therefore supposed to be three-dimensional & well-developed nemeses - & would've broken the continuous Marvel tradition of only including forgettable villains. Thus, both Alan & Christopher spent a lot of time devising an entire civilisation, crafting an individualistic language, societal construct & hierarchy that the opposing species would inhabit so as not to fall in to the same avoidable trap - endeavouring to provide the protagonist's rivals with a constant perceptible presence by having them possess a ""regal"" sense of ""gravitas"" & ""aristocracy"", with a feeling of their ""ancientness"", gifting them a ""sense of entitlement & bearing"" throughout. The relationship between Malekith & Kurse was also apparently intended to be elaborated on in more detail... But those moments of development ended up on the cutting room floor too.
Deleted scenes which were released have but given just a mere glimpse of what more we could've also expected & it's clear Thor: The Dark World began as a character driven, uncharacteristically dark, mature, grounded installment in the MCU which told a self contained story that primarily focused on progressing the narrative of our recognisable & beloved heroes but unfortunately, this wasn't on brand with the Marvel Universe, was likely seen as ""unsafe"" / a little too daring / risky, possessing a lack of comedic laughs etc. & so as a result, the movie was cut to make it ""faster"", ""tighter"" & ""funnier"" at the expense of everything that made it unique & different from the rest.
It's such a shame to see this effort & conscientiousness squandered unappreciatively by Disney - particularly when Alan knowingly sacrificed his alternative opportunity to helm at least one other episode of Game of Thrones for the following season, S3 (likely ""The Red Wedding"" of all the ones to turn down). Truly, as a consequence, he was forced to pass on the chance to retain his previous titles as his schedule wouldn't allow it (he was too busy with Thor) & instead, he invested his time in perfecting the sequel before its inevitable release. It can't be stated enough how Taylor took a major personal risk with his career in exiting the show as lead director / co-producer when it was at its strongest (& we should be mindful of that); his committment to the film was deserving of praise & gratitude. Not to mention, that gamble should've paid off & his devotion to the 2013 blockbuster should've been fairly rewarded in return so to witness that brave risk sadly end in cataclysmic failure (for reasons beyond his control) is ridiculously disheartening & tragic.
It's no surprise whatsoever he backed petitions for a director's cut because what's left of his movie are the bare bones of a fascinatingly original solo Thor outing - which you can enjoy & appreciate if you watch closely enough, but it's still ridiculously frustrating to know the story could've had far more meat on those bones - meat you'd actually have been able to sink your teeth into - as opposed to the mere scraps of it we were finally discarded by the end.
In hindsight, Alan Taylor is just another victim of overbearing studio involvement - from a company which failed to respect his artistic integrity by supporting his creative vision. He wasn't the first to be treated with this kind of contempt & as we know, he certainly wasn't the last either. What we do know is if Disney wishes to right the wrongs of its past like Warner Bros has attempted to do, it should seriously consider this idea: #ReleaseTheTaylorCut","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Of course the Aether goes after her in the movie. Also that gal who played her friend was a natural. Like to see the that kind of excellence. At first I didn't realize that was Rene Russo playing the mother. Guess it's been awhile. But they're always having problems with Loki so that puts a little strain in the plot.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I found it incredibly hard to come up with any ""The good""s let alone some ""The great""s. Simply put, I think this is the first MCU film that I don't like at all.If you read my review for Thor (2011), you will know that I really loved that film. I loved the cast, the humor (in particular the physical comedy), the redemption story, the introduction of Hawkeye, pretty much everything about it. The Dark World trashes everything that was great about the first movie, and I don't even know why.To start, the comedy of the first movie is almost entirely around Thor and how he doesn't understand the world he has been thrust into without his powers. He is hit by cars and subdued by orderlies. He smashes cups and drinks his new found friends under the table. His ego is the joke and we laugh and smile along with him as he finds his feet (and his place) in a new world. In TDW, the jokes are much meaner and, to me at least, far less funny.One of the principal sources of supposed humor in TDW is Dr. Erik Selvig's mental breakdown. We see an absolute shell of the brilliant scientist we saw in Thor. He runs around naked, gives lectures to a group of disinterested mental patients, and takes off his trousers to think. This is funny how? His mind was almost destroyed by being forced to create a device that killed thousands and practically caused the downfall of his own planet. Har Har.Another source of ""humor"" is Darcy's Intern...cause picking on/abusing people is funny.Unfortunately, the fantastic ensemble cast is entirely wasted. Sif is turned into some sort of love rival and the Warriors Three are turned into mindless, characterless drones who do what Thor tells them, no matter how dumb. Darcy is a joke, a caricature of her character in Thor, and the chemistry between Thor and Jane is as flat as ever.There are so many other problems with this movie. The plot doesn't make sense and relies on so many outrageous coincidences. Death happens too easily and with little real emotional impact. Unnecessary twists happen for no reason. It treats the viewer with such little respect, I could go on for pages.In summary, did not like, won't watch again anytime soon.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Hemsworth again vanishes into his role, and Hiddleston is as slimy as ever. The humor was probably some of the sharpest and least forced of all Marvel's movies so far, with everyone really upping their game. I loved the change from Shakespearean drama to Lord of the Rings-style fantasy; it really allowed for some epic locations and battles, while overall showcasing some new sides to Asgard and the universe in general. The use of various color palettes was genius, changing from greys to greens to oranges and browns really differentiated the worlds and tones. The plot mechanisms also gave way to some of the most inventive and thrilling battle sequences I've seen. If Man of Steel dragged a bit for you in the battles, you'll probably feel the opposite here. In fact, the entire film clips along briskly and could stand an extended cut. I was just sad when it ended; I wanted more. Some clever twists and turns kept me completely invested in the characters and story. Unfortunately, an undeveloped villain left a lot to be desired, and prevents it from ranking as Marvel's best for me. But for sheer exhilaration, it parallels Marvel's The Avengers and Man of Steel, earning bonus points for the change to outright fantasy genre Thor belongs in, as well as some brilliant tie-ins to Viking culture. There were also some very appreciated nods to the first film, and a scene that will take you so off guard you'll need the movie to pause just to recover - in a good way.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thor takes Jane to Asgard for answers and help. Unbeknownst to anyone in Asgard (or in the rest of the Universe for that matter), the reemergence of the Aether has woken Malekith, a Dark Elf intent on gaining the Aether's power. He'll destroy all of Asgard if need be to get what he wants. As expected, it's up to Thor to save Jane, Asgard, and all of creation.Overall, Thor: The Dark World (or Thor 2 as I'll call it for the rest of this) is an entertaining film. It has a few problems that keep me from calling it one of Marvel's best, but it's not a bad movie. Despite most of what I'm about to write sounding negative, I'm rating Thor 2 a 7/10. I honestly like the movie.There are at least three things in Thor 2 that could have been better. First, the relationship between Jane and Thor has about as much life as a dead fish. There's no spark or chemistry that I could feel. It reminded me of another ill-fated on-screen romance featuring Natalie Portman - Padme and Anakin. The on-screen chemistry isn't helped by Portman's acting. It seemed obvious to me that Portman would have rather have been just about anywhere other than making another Thor movie. She looked disinterested in the whole thing. Second, the plot is thin and never really drew me in the way I'd hoped. Maybe others felt different, but it just didn't work on me. Maybe it was the villain that I didn't find engaging or Portman's off-putting performance or events I the movie that required huge amounts of exposition - whatever, the plot was a weak point for me. Third, Thor 2 could have been better with more Loki. For me, the highlight of both Thor movies has been Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He's so good. I'm not sure what kind of plot the MCU folks could come up with, but I would love to see a stand-alone Loki movie. How awesome would that be!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now with most new movies I review this review may contain SPOILERS so read at your own risk. Thor: The Dark World improves on many flaws of the first Thor, like probably my biggest problem with the first Thor was that the 9 realms were way to polished and neat in this movie the realms look more like actual places that have dirt and muck. And also Asgard looks much more Viking-like and that makes a whole lot of sense considering the Norse mythology was created by Vikings. In this movie Thor got to do more Thor-like things with his power, and be more of a hero. Thor The Dark World also threw in more creatures they all looked pretty cool especially the secondary villain Kurse, he was big, and violent a real Challenger to Thor sadly I felt he didn't get enough screen time. Thats one of the problems with the movie, the villains were really cool but had no were near enough screen time, like Malekith, great design from adapting a comic to a movie, cool powers, good threat, worthy enemy, threatening but in the end he was only on screen for like 17 minutes, I fell they should've cut out parts of the Earth scenes and replaced it with more Malekith and Kurse scenes. On Earth there were two characters in particular that the whole movie could have doe without, the two interns (I know they probably have names but I didn't care enough to remember them) they annoyed the crap out of me, I hated them really took the movie down a notch. But out of the negatives there were some positives that outweighed them, the character of Thor was much more heroic and godlike, Loki's back and he's good in the movie and doesn't overstay his welcome, the fights were great very imaginative especially the final fight with portals and realm jumping. Now some cameos that I noticed of course Stan Lee had one and it was great as all the rest, and the one that's probably the best is a Captain America cameo, I wont tell you when were or how it happens but man it's cool. So in the end Thor: The Dark World is better than the first but this is still a flawed movie, but even with the flaws Thor The Dark World gets an 7.5 out of 10. Stay during and after the credits there's two scenes","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Of course, Earth must be the location where everything converges to. Where else?Though the movie is predictable - as all Marvel movies are. That Loki attacking Thor was just a plan was to be seen from thousands of miles away. Of course, it was just a cheap trick. Of course, it would fail. But it was convincingly acted! The plottwist at the end of the movie I did not expect, though... Curious about the next Thor movie.Sometimes in these Marvel movies, however, I wonder where all the Avengers are and what S. H. I. E. L. D is doing. You would imagine that a threat which could potentially destroy the entire universe wouldn't be a minor threat. You would imagine that SHIELD knowing Sevik might expect something is up. But no, they're just slumbering, waiting for others to fix the crap.Also, the kissing was the intern was a bit unfit. If someone of the opposite gender saved my life, my first action wouldn't be to snug them. (I think.)I complained a lot, and yet I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and was drawn into it.

Thor: The Dark World beautifully expands on the world building of the first part once again combining Norse mythology and sci-fi elements. It brings back the whole support cast in meaningful way and fleshes out the main protagonists in a believable fashion.Like in the first film the complicated relationship between Thor and his brother Loki is an important theme here and its nice to watch it one last time before the writers turned both characters into complete jokes. I'm aware that a lot of people see this as one of the weaker marvel movies but for me it sits comfortably in the top five and is without a doubt the best Thor movie. The only real criticism I have is that the main antagonist stays as pale as his make up and and only exists because plot has to happen.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Also the most head scratching. It makes you wonder what they were trying to achieve and what was the point. It's a mishmash of all fantasy franchises before, themes of lord of the rings, star wars, game of thrones, and even pirates of the Caribbean. Its shot very dark with amazing looking villains who look extra evil. Irritatingly not used to their full potential. Being so dark they also shoehorn out of place humor that is confusing and mostly misses its mark. This film also has some of the best visuals and effects in the entire marvel universe. Loki is also at his best. Its wacky, goofy, and a complete mess. I recommend on the grounds to watch in awe.

Though Earth still factors into the mix, particularly in the clever, gripping climactic fight scene, there's no mistaking that this is Asgard's story and that clear emphasis, missing from the original, makes a big difference. As a distinctly fantasy-laden epic, it also benefits from a fresh, authentic flavor that its stable-mates just can't match. There's more to see than smashed skyscrapers and flattened taxi cabs in Thor's world, and that brand of open possibility makes the realm an absolute delight to swallow up. As visual feasts go, this is at or near the top of the pile - it's gorgeous, innovative and generally unlike anything else in modern cinema, a stuffed bagful of sensory treats. The acting, too, has taken a grand step up since our last trip across the rainbow bridge. Surprisingly, this time Natalie Portman comes across as a clunky third wheel: Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston provide the real intrigue, hammering home Thor's complicated relationship with his conniving adopted brother, Loki. A fantastically imaginative flick, well-paced and triumphantly acted, that does something its precursor couldn't: whet my appetite for a sequel.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film does not take itself too serious which is why the story works so well and is such fun to watch. After now three movies Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston seem to live and breath their characters and Hiddleston once more steals the show as Loki.

"9","/10","The little girl who loved Thor in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987)...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2904438/?ref_=tt_urv","dee.reid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0892646/?ref_=tt_urv","12 November 2013","My biggest complaint with that great British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh's take on ""Thor"" (2011) was that its titular character, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the God of Thunder in Norse mythology reinterpreted as a Marvel Comics superhero, seemed to adjust to life on Earth fairly quickly after being exiled here by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) as a lesson in humility.That problem can be forgiven here (since in the grander scheme of things, my overall opinion is hardly consequential to anything), since two years have passed and Thor has spent that time on his home-world of Asgard, rather than on Earth, even though he still longs for his mortal would-be girlfriend Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and she for him.And that's one of the things to take away from ""Thor: The Dark World"" - the resolutions of various relationships - with Alan Taylor replacing Kenneth Branagh (who brought some Shakespearean-styled drama to a superhero movie with the first ""Thor"") and he takes the series into much darker territory, even though there's still a variety of well-placed humor here to liven things up a little bit; imagine even a smidgen of humor in Christopher Nolan's ultra-serious ""Dark Knight"" movies - oh, the horror!To be fair, I enjoyed this picture more than I did the first one, if because the changes in the director's chair also resulted in a change of direction into a darker one. So again, Earth is in danger from an other-worldly threat that is beyond human comprehension. The Mighty Thor is forced to not only save our planet, but his own as well, from the genocidal warlord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), a Dark Elf who sacrificed his entire army to try to defeat Asgard in a thrilling a prologue, only to go into hibernation for 5,000 years so that he could once again try to wipe out Asgard, something that requires the life of the human Jane Foster for him to do.So Thor is forced to do the unthinkable: he must team up with his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, a ""Thor"" film's best performer, once again), who is now currently imprisoned for his crimes against humanity in ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers"" (2012), if they are to save both Earth and Asgard.The focus in ""Thor: The Dark World,"" aside from the various superhero battles, are the relationships - chiefly Thor's romance with the human Jane Foster, and his complicated familial relationships with his parents and of course, Loki, who still vies for the throne of Asgard. And it's also about how Thor must juggle all these if he is to save two worlds from a threat that not even he can defeat all on his own (hence the teaming up with Loki).I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did ""Thor."" Here is one of those rare sequels that performed better than its predecessor.9/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

After Iron Man 3 before, this movie allows us to resume Thor's solo story, but with some continuity to the other films thus keeping the audience aware of the larger story.The problems with mysticism and magical abilities from alien creatures are there are no rules to go by. When we last left Thor, he was unable to travel back to earth of see Jane again, yet he was able to inexplicably go there for the Avengers. There was a half hearted attempt to show that Jane was kept out of the way for that movie, but her character returns in The Dark World, still trying to reconnect to Thor.After locking Loki up after the events in the Avengers, Thor and the Asgardians have already repaired the Bifrost so traveling between the realms can happen, yet he still does not go to Jane, as he claims to desire. Jane, with D'Arcy and her new ""intern"", accidentally discover a way to travel between the realms. Jane, also accidentally, absorbs a substance known as the aether when on said travels. Dr. Selvig, after the Avengers, is now in a psych ward.In the standard ""people don't talk to each other therefore here's a plot"" trope, Jane is now infected with the Aether that is naturally desired by nearly everyone in the 9 realms. Had Thor returned to earth when he could, none of this would happen, and a very serious death could have been avoided.Loki gets a very fun piece of character development, but it still enacts a toll on him that always leaves the viewer guessing as to how he is dealing with it. His work with illusions makes it difficult to know what he is truly feeling.I think the problem I really had with this movie is that a ton of negative consequences come about simply because Thor is too much of a wuss to go back to see Jane after the events of the first movie. Literally none of the Infinity War would have happened if not for that cowardly act. If the filmmakers intended to use a metaThor (see what I did there?) to explain that minor choices could lead to catastrophic consequences, then they were certainly successful. However, at the time, those consequences would not have been obvious, and may not have been planned out yet, so I don't want to give too much credit.This film finally brings up the terms ""infinity stones"" and uses them to describe both the Tesseract and the Aether. Both of these artifacts are then deposited with ""The Collector"", Taneleer Tivan, a name more associated with the Guardians of the Galaxy.Stan Lee's cameo happens in Dr. Selvig's psych ward, and it involves a shoe.It's one of the more forgettable films in basic premise, but it is single handedly the most important film in the Infinity War saga. This is a dichotomy difficult to wrap one's head around.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Asgardian warriors have the onus of restoring order and warding off all evil. Meanwhile back on Earth, Jane Foster has accidentally unleashed an ancient weapon of the Dark Elves that resurrects their race, threatening the very existence of the Universe. The Norse God of Thunder has a mighty force to reckon with and will need the assistance of his deceitful brother Loki. Thor must prevent the world from falling into darkness before the imminent convergence of all realms. With most of the events unfolding upon Asgard, some fantastic special effects were obvious devices to be used by the celebrated TV director Alan Taylor whose most recent works include several memorable episodes of Game of Thrones, Mad Men & Sopranos. 'Thor: The Dark World' is undeniably an exciting superhero epic that outdoes its predecessor and establishes Chris Hemsworth as a worthy Avenger. While the Asgardians police the realms and keep trouble away from their homeland, Thor's ambivalence is highlighted. On one hand, he has a role in protecting Midgard as an Avenger and being closer to Jane Foster and on the other, the responsibility of being the King of Asgard in the near future. As Jane accidentally becomes the host for the dark power Aether on Earth, Thor decides to bring her to Asgard. Darkness then draws onto itself and the resurrected Malekith (Christopher Eccleston – Who?) attacks the might of Asgard itself causing terror and despair. Thor must now seek the assistance of whom he wouldn't trust at all but retribution, has common enemies. Together with Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor must prevent Malekith from unleashing darkness upon the world before the convergence of all nine realms occurs. The common plane of this rare alignment falls in Greenwich, which then serves as the final battleground for an epic clash between Thor and the forces of the Dark Elves. At his third outing as the God of Thunder, Chris Hemsworth is more convincing and iconic than ever before. He effectively manages distinct relationships in this sequel, between his father, his conniving brother and his love, Jane. With more humor, action and evil, Hemsworth does a mighty job with his hammer. Natalie Portman has a better role that is suited to her talent and at Asgard, she feels just at home as she was on Naboo as Queen Amidala. Anthony Hopkins might look weary of playing Old Odin but his voice and persona still make him the most suitable King. The show stealer however, is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. His comic timing and charm simply add to his character's dishonest nature. The untrustworthy Loki is turning out to be the most lovable villain and that simply asserts how well Hiddleston plays the part.Alan Taylor's comprehensive background with major TV series does enable him to blend in several elements of the story in a fast paced, eventful and exciting movie of less than 2 hours. A seemingly uncomplicated plot does yet provide the grip and thrill. With some exemplary visual effects that not only showcase the fantastic realm of Asgard in vivid light and colors but also showcase the epic destruction in Greenwich, Taylor makes remarkable use of technologies to enhance the story's appeal. The best part is, he directs the screenplay in a seamless manner that keeps the audience engaged with the pace so the film isn't heavily reliant on its visuals but is merely aided by it in its storytelling. That is precisely how such superhero movies should be made. The cinematography is excellent even with simple scenes such as Thor's arrival upon Earth, London's aerial view and the action on desolate landscapes of other realms. The background score has the epic tone and sustains the darkness associated with the film's evil. Technicality finds its happy medium with comic book storytelling and Taylor deserves credit for enhancing Thor's presence in the Marvel world. As Malekith's evil grows with the power of Aether, Thor's strength increases with his loved ones around him. His definitive stance for Midgard's well being and for his love, Jane Foster will establish him as an Avenger and protector of all realms. Meanwhile, Loki's wile ways shall keep us entertained with the brilliant Tom Hiddleston. Thor: The Dark World isn't ground-breaking but it does everything right for a superhero movie and that, is the simple reason you should spend that money. Oh, and to watch the scene where Thor sheds his cloak, jumps off the balcony, catches the incoming mjölnir and flies away. Epic.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Directed by Alan Taylor, this Marvel installment struggles to distinguish itself, delivering a rather average superhero experience.Chris Hemsworth continues to embody the God of Thunder, but the film doesn't provide substantial growth for the character. Thor's internal conflicts lack the depth seen in other MCU entries, making him feel somewhat stagnant in comparison.The narrative attempts to explore the cosmic consequences of the Aether but falls short of creating a truly engaging storyline. The dark elves, led by Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston, serve as forgettable villains with minimal impact. The lack of a compelling antagonist diminishes the stakes and weakens the overall narrative drive.While the film maintains the visual spectacle expected from Marvel, the realms of Asgard and the dark world of Svartalfheim lack the innovative flair seen in other cosmic MCU entries. The visuals, though competent, don't leave a lasting impression.Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is given a central role, but the romantic subplot with Thor feels forced and doesn't resonate emotionally. The chemistry between the characters lacks the charm seen in other Marvel pairings, making it challenging to invest fully in their relationship.The film does have its moments of humor, largely courtesy of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Hiddleston's charismatic performance injects much-needed energy, providing some relief from the otherwise lackluster elements.Overall it is entertaining enough to watch it once and forget about it so you can get on with the rest of the saga.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He's back for a third time on our big screens, but this time things appear to be a bit darker and Thor becomes more desperate for help. I felt the first Thor movie was good, but could of been a lot better as I felt it lacked in the action side of things and concentrated more on humor. The Avengers movie showed more of Thor's strength and abilities but I still felt like he was holding back.The story of the film shows Thor (Chris Hemsworth), making up for Loki's (Tom Hiddleston) mistakes by clearing up the nine rounds 'planets', and shows that he doesn't feel like he belongs anymore and misses his mortal lover, Jane (Natalie Portman). He soon manages to reunite with her, but an evil elf named Malekith returns from the past to destroy everything in his path. Thor soon realizes he cannot do this alone, and takes desperate measures by asking Loki for help but the question is can Thor trust him?This new film is the definition of awesomeness. This time we get to see a lot more action, which is both clever as well as fun. We see the hammer used a lot more and we see more of Thor's strength, which helps to prove that he isn't a god to mess with! Marvel have always been clever with there humor and I feel this film is the funniest so far, yes even better than Iron Man 3! It manages to make you laugh even in the more serious of moments. Christopher Eccleston I felt brought a lot to the role of Malekith, despite the face he was unrecognizable, his voice managed to bring originality as well as the sense of darkness that was needed. In the first movie I felt it was hard to connect with Thor, as he is obviously a God, who is hard to be beaten. However in this film I felt more connected, as you could sense his emotional pain, which is mainly loneliness.If you like action, a good laugh as well as a good story, then please go and see this amazing film! Also look out for the scene after the credits..............Enjoy!(for more reviews go to: http://joshwhitnallfilmreviews.blogspot.co.uk/","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I haven't had so much fun in a movie theater since THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that good. The Hobbit on the other hand isn't near close. Thor is nothing like the other Marvel movies about super heroes. This one is a totally different animal. It is up there with the big boys-Star Wars, Star Trek and The Lord of The Rings. I could tell that the movie crew spent a good amount of time to make it right. This is not a fast production for easy cash ins. This one is The Real Deal-A True Movie Magic! I was a bit afraid that the second one is not going to match the quality of the first one. I mean how do you top the scene where Thor is being cast out of Asgard by his father Odin. The level of acting delivered by Anthony Hopkins was just awe inspiring! Well, the second one has few of those scenes and it just keeps delivering. How long has it been since I wanted to see a movie over again. Thor and Thor 2-Tthe Dark World are an instant classic and as I love to say: Do yourselves a favor and see those two movies! I recommend regular projection over 3d screening since the film was originally shot in 2d and was meant to be viewed in 2d. It is cheaper too. Actually if you go to a morning projection in any theater you will pay close to nothing. I payed only $6.00! If you don't want to pay that you can always rent it off of the RED BOX kiosks for a dollar and some cents(the movie will take a few months to be available to rent). Always pick the blu-ray over DVD for richer colors, greater resolution, crisp details, supreme audio quality and that cinema feel that is bigger than life.I want you to know that my review is totally independent. I am not paid by any company for my reviews and will never let myself be paid to deliver a review. I am a regular citizen that enjoys watching movies and I stand behind all of my reviews. Please check my List of Movies and if you disagree with this review you are most likely a looser. Just kidding, not.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Possibly the worst pacing of any movie I've ever scene, with random scenes that slow down the film while not actually having a purpose of being there. Some of the characters have been improved upon since the first thor film while others have had a major downgrade. Thor, I believe, had an upgrade, he is much more likeable in this movie and continues to make the right choice and shows how his character has developed since the fist film. Loki was probably the biggest disappointment, he really played no role in this movie and was just thrown in at stupid points in the story. Loki also had an unnecessary amount of comedic lines which really does not fit his character at all, especially in a movie like this. Jane Foster was awful. The dark elves were awful. The scientist guy that runs around naked was awful. Even the mothers death was awful. The soundtrack for the movie was good though...yeah.

Needless to say, this is the weakest Thor film because it takes all its set-pieces for granted, the story beats are more or less the same as the first movie, and one of the twists of the first Thor is ACTUALLY repeated (won't say what exactly, but it should be pretty obvious as to what I'm talking about).Thor: The Dark World doesn't know the intimate stuff from the universe-encompassing stuff and the story becomes a mess real quickly, even with Thor and Loki's admittedly fun chemistry on-screen. The film's weighed down by its placeholder villain the Space Elf Malekith: a villain so one-note and uninteresting it's kind of a cinematic miracle he exists at all. A baddie's only as good as the hero he's starring opposite; and Thor 2 doesn't know how to treat Malekith as an equal to the film's co-villain Loki. This is a film that wants to leave you in awe: but it ends up doing the opposite and feels surprisingly empty because of it.Thor: The Dark World gets 2/5 stars. Aside from some good stuff, this film's a forgettable 'blockbuster'.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jane shows up and is infected by the force. Thor takes her to Asgard and Odin finally reveals what all this is about. The evil Elves who want this force invade Asgard and close all exit portals trapping the gods. By using this force, the Aether, they can destroy the universe and let nothingness rule. That forces Thor and his sidekicks to join forces with the imprisoned Loki. But can they trust Loki? Long CGI carnage ensues between the Asgardians and the Elves, Loki, Thor and the main villain. It's no mystery who wins the battle. We get several instances of Asgardian politics- Thor's insecurity of being the ruler, Loki's ambition, and Odin's wisdom. At the end we're left with...questions to be answered by part 3 I guess.Thor I was beautiful, captivating, fascinating, visually and story-wise. Thor II just falls flat. Almost entirely without charm, it teaches us nothing new about the Norse world. Relationships don't matter here all that much and Loki gets slapped by some girl. It took 3 writers to come up with this weak story that's just there to justify hundreds of millions wasted in dull CGI battles. And what better way to ruin a good thing than by hiring a director with near zero experience in movies and hand him the (formerly) strongest of the superhero franchises so far. Thor II is disappointment. These movies have gone into industrial mode, are being cranked out by the dozen now without regard to quality, anyone who's got time is hired to direct. A shame, but typical greedy cynical Hollywood behavior. Hopefully someone who actually cares will take control of Thor III before they start hiring rappers and Bruce Willis to act, try to sell us some lame soundtrack, and let Thor become a copy of Transformers 8.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

While this is the second Thor movie, we feel a bit more familiar with the Norse God thanks to The Avengers. It's not surprising that Chris Hemsworth can hold his own with the character given his looks and physicality, but this time he gets a run for his money thanks to Tom Hiddleston as Loki.The film's real villain is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who rules the Dark Elves and is trying to re-capture the all-powerful Aether, a substance of infinite energy. But the whole battle for the 9 realms is really just a sideline to Thor vs Loki, and Thor's touch of humanity and eye for Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Most of the key characters are back: Anthony Hopkins as Odin (even more over the top this time), Rene Russo (Thor's mom), Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Jaimie Alexander (Sif), Idris Elba (Heimdall), Kat Dennings (Darcy), and Stellan Skarsgard (Erik Selvig).This sequel is kind of interesting to analyze. It's certainly bigger than the original ... the special effects are huge and much improved. Light comic moments abound, but luckily the snark from Kat Dennings is minimal. Chris O'Dowd shows up for a couple of pretty funny, but slightly out of place scenes. There are a couple of cameos including an off-beat appearance by one of the The Avengers. Rene Russo even gets her own sword fight! Though it matters not to me, I assume there are many who would choose a Skarsgard other than Stellan to run around Stonehenge sans clothes. So while it has all of that going for it, the story is certainly fails at engaging the audience.This one is directed by Alan Taylor, who is quite a successful TV director, and there was clearly some upfront concern over the script as Joss Whedon was brought in for scene doctoring. I believe what we learn is that the fish out of water story works when Thor is on Earth, but it loses impact when Jane Foster visits Asgard. Still, Tom Hiddleston is such fun to watch as Loki, that none of that really matters.It's a superhero movie that will entertain the fans and provide plenty of ammunition for the critics looking to bash. If you see it in the theatre, you should know to stay for BOTH post-movie scenes. A rare Benecio Del Toro sighting makes it worthwhile.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I had a blast ! The action were very entertaining, the universe that the director has made were beautiful. It was also really funny (though some jokes just seem too forced), and the script was also well written. The first 60 minutes was a great build up, and the next 60 minutes were just better, in other words this movie was entertaining from start to finish. This movie's surely on par with Iron Man and even The Avengers (not necessarily better), and without a doubt better than the first Thor. This movie had a lot of flaws, but it doesn't matter since it's so entertaining. It might just be the best superhero movie of the year (though I really liked man of steel).If u either like action movies or superhero movies, you must definitely watch the film. Some people might not like this film because they mostly don't really follow about what's going on or what's happening in the asgard world, if u are one of these people, do yourself a favor and watch this movie for a 2nd time!! It would be much much better if u really know what's going on since the start.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't know what people were thinking at that time, because this film is far from that and is actually underrated in my opinion. Chris Hemsworth returns once more as Thor who after helping defeat Loki's army in the battle of New York, returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, is ready to be crown king at last, but feels that he still misses his love life on Earth he briefly had. Natalie Portman returns as Jane Foster as well who finds what is called Aether which is used by evil beings known as dark elf's that Asgard once fought and defeated, which is placed inside her, that also forces Thor to bring her to Asgard to extract it before it's used by the dark elf's to destroy the nine realms. Anthony Hopkins returns as Odin and honestly this is probably my favorite performance of him portraying the character. Tom Hiddleston is definitely the standout character Loki that is dealing with the consequences of his destruction of New York , while also slowly coming around to help Thor against the dark elf's. Christopher Eccleston who plays the villain Malekith I thought was alright, but is probably one of my only cons I have with this film and the dark elf's itself. To me, I felt they weren't as menacing as they were intending to make them be, but in the end, they made it work for the film. I was also glad we got to see a little more of the world of Asgard and it's side characters in action such as Heimdall played by Idris Elba, Sif played by Jaime Alexandra, Fandral who has been recasted and played by Zachery Levi, and Volstagg played by Ray Stevenson. Overall, Thor: The Dark World is far from the worst MCU film as it's explores more of the world of Asgard, it's characters, and sets up the MCU for what's to come.

It features the return of super god Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who tries to save Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) after she gets cursed with a powerful entity known as the Aether. However, an evil race called the Dark Elves wants the Aether to conquer the universe.This movie was rather slow and at times, boring - just a lot of talk that really goes no where. The overdone special effects made the movie look like a Star Wars retread and a story appeared it couldn't make up its mind if it's a drama or comedy. At certain poignant moments, the characters didn't really show any emotion, with the plot not allowing time for the audience to generate any sympathy. And, much of the comedy were very corny and lame, making you not wanting to take this film seriously.Hemsworth and Portman still had some good chemistry and did their best in their acting with what they were provided. Thor's fellow warrior comrades, Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Fandral (Zachary Levi), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) were great in the film, but sorely underused. I could have really done without the corny Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and her clueless intern - really lame jokes and dialog offered by them, and they served no real purpose in the movie as a result from their dumb performances.There were dabs of exciting action scenes here and there, as well as a suspenseful plot point where Thor have to rely on his not-so-friendly brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) for help. But overall, there's really nothing new in this movie - just another hero vs. villain-who-wants-to-conquer-the-world story with messy CGI effects.Grade D+","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm afraid the same problem can be said about Thor: The Dark World, which was an entertaining movie but I don't think I'd enjoy it as much on a second viewing. Most of these films are fun and exciting as you experience them for the first time, but the magic seems to vanish for me after a few weeks. Perhaps The Avengers was so great that these sequels don't seem to live up to the standard set by Joss Whedon. I still had a great time in the movies and enjoyed the sequel to Thor considering I wasn't blown away by the first film either. By now Thor knows exactly who he is and doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, so we get to see him in action with his might hammer quite a bit. At times the film has a sort of Star Wars vibe to it mixed with The Lord of the Rings (with Jane reminding me of Frodo), but the final action scene suffers from something we've seen in way too many superhero films recently: buildings getting completely destroyed and blown up. It also mixes some elements near the end that we've seen in Jumper, but all in all the film succeeds thanks to the great chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. The way they played off each other and interacted was the highlight of the film, and Hiddleston was extremely funny here. I wasn't a huge fan of his in the first Thor, but after The Avengers I began to enjoy his performance, and his character in this sequel is better than ever. I wasn't blown away by the action scenes, but I did like the smaller comedic and light moments which the film had to offer. The film is entertaining enough to garner at least one watch.The film picks up after the events of The Avengers with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) back in Asgard serving his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) trying to restore peace to the nine realms that his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has altered. Loki is sentenced to prison after his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) insists he shouldn't be killed. It turns out to be a good decision because Thor will need his service after the city is attacked by a race of beings known as the Dark Elves. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), is searching for a weapon known as the Aether which had been taken away from him thousands of years ago by Odin's father. Since the aether couldn't be destroyed, the Asgardians had to hide it. In the meantime Jane (Natalie Portman), who hasn't seen or heard from Thor since he left two years ago, along with her assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) discover an anomaly very similar to the one that had brought Thor to Earth in the past. When she goes to investigate she is sucked by some sort of wormhole and ends up right next to the place where the aether had been hidden. After Heimdall (Idris Elba) warns Thor that Jane has disappeared, he goes after her, but somehow Jane has awaken Malekith which is what provoked his attack in Asgard in the first place.Thor: The Dark World is pretty generic and follows a similar formula of most superhero films. That is the reason why so many scenes remind us of other scenes we've seen in other action films. I was never at the edge of my seat during any of the action scenes, but I did have a great time with the light and funny moments. Some people actually enjoyed the action sequences in this film, but it really didn't do anything new for me. The highlight of the film for me was Tom Hiddleston and the scenes he was in were probably the most memorable of the movie. Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, and Ray Stevenson all return for their supporting roles here as Thor's soldier/warriors but their characters aren't really developed too much. It is strange to see a summer blockbuster film in November but I guess that the timing was right considering all the superhero films that came out this year. Thor doesn't stand out (and I guess none really did this year), but it is still an entertaining movie. This Marvel universe is growing so fast with all these films that at times it feels like a TV series. So I guess it was a good idea that they brought in the Game of Thrones director, Alan Taylor. He has made an enjoyable film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What it does have in common with the Avengers e.g. is an excellent balance of humor, action, effects and drama. We have arrived at a point where VFX can't hardly improve anymore but in The Dark World they pulled out all the stops: we get gorgeous vistas, battles and large scale destruction effects and not a single shot looks fake. Chris Hemsworth also seems to be getting more familiar with his character as his performance has certainly improved. I was getting pretty sick of superhero movies but I'm glad to say this one has restored my faith (partially). For me The Dark World is certainly better than any of the Iron Man films.

"6","/10","Thor: The Dark World has a few decent ideas and solid performances from Hemsworth, Portman, and Hiddleston, but overall feels a step down from its predecessor.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8977157/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2023","Sometime after the events of The Avengers, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned his villainous adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to Asgard where to face judgement at the hands of Loki's adoptive father and Thor's father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) who sentences him to imprisonment within Asgard's dungeons mostly due to the intervention of Odin's wife and Loki's adoptive mother Frigga (Rene Russo). While Thor leads victorious battles across the nine realms seeking to bring about peace, he often remains distracted his thoughts of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the human woman he met and fell in love with when last he was on Earth. When Jane finds an anomaly in London that bears a similar energy signature she stumbles into a void where a malevolent force attaches itself to her. When Heimdall (Idris Elba) tells Thor he can no longer see Jane, Thor goes to Earth to find Jane and bring her back to Asgard to help her. Unbeknownst to them, the force attached to Jane is an ancient weapon that is sought by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) the king of the Dark Elves, an adversary of Asgard long thought to be dead who seek to plunge the universe into eternal darkness.Following the decent success of the first Thor movie, Marvel and Disney eventually committed the resources to develop a sequel to the film. While director Kenneth Branagh had initially intended to return for a sequel, he didn't feel he could deliver a film in the quick time Marvel and Disney wanted and bowed out. This lead to a scramble for a new director with choices such as Brian Kirk and Patty Jenkins briefly attached while also bowing out for various reasons until eventually Alan Taylor took the reins. Upon release the film received mixed but positive skewing reviews and made $650 million against an estimate $150-170 million budget but is often seen as one of the lesser entries in the early days of the MCU. While I maintain that Iron Man 2 is still slightly worse, Thor: The Dark World is a film I often struggle to remember with only a few highlights sticking out.In terms of character I like how unlike the Iron Man films it does feel like Thor has evolved and undergone development with his experiences across both the first film and The Avengers. The movie also dives a little further into the love story angle present between Jane and Thor in the first film and while Jane isn't the most interesting character as she's essentially there for reactions to the wonder of Asgard, the chemistry between Hemsworth and Portman is really good and the romantic scenes feel like what George Lucas wanted to do with Attack of the Clones only with better chemistry and dialogue. It's no surprise that Patty Jenkin's intention was to frame the story as a ""forbidden romance"" narrative inspired by Romeo and Juliet because that element of the story does feel like the most substantive and resonant part. The movie also gives us some good scenes with Hiddleston's Loki very enjoyable in his return with a unique way in which he factors into the plot, and Rene Russo who was barely there in the first entry is given some more meat to chew on characterwise that it's unfortunate more wasn't done with it.Where Thor: The Dark World faulters however is in the actual superhero aspects of the story, especially the villains with Christopher Eccleston's Malekith being one of the most boring villains in both design in writing that I've seen in the MCU. While Eccleston is a solid actor as anyone who's seen Let Him Have It or the first series of the Doctor Who revival can attest, Malekith feels so generic with no real character besides universal domination and a character design that makes him feel like a forgettable villain of the week on Star Trek. It's been about 10 years since I've seen this movie before my second viewing, and upon watching it I remember very little about this character with no standout quotes or deliveries to the point I'd forgotten what he even looked like. The stuff with the human characters isn't all that great either with Stellan Skarsgard's return as Erik Selvig doing a lot of strange things who's behavior is explained by events in the Avengers that don't make sense if you remember Hawkeye, and while Kat Denning's Darcy is still unnecessary, at least she's dialed back a little bit.Thor: The Dark World seemingly has all the right pieces to make a good story and I did legitimately like Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman together including Thor's character development, but the rest of the movie feels lacking in that same level of personality and it's only made worth the viewing thanks to the inclusion of Loki. Not terrible, but also not an MCU movie I plan to revisit anytime soon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"2","/10","This is, without a doubt, one of the worst Marvel films. But, does it have any redeeming qualities? Check out my review below!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8348950/?ref_=tt_urv","TheHonestCritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66610649/?ref_=tt_urv","19 July 2022","""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), after being blown away by the first movie; ""Thor"" (2011), I was interested to see if there would be a sequel. But, after a while, I didn't really care if they made one. Maybe because after such a strong first film and especially ""The Avengers"" (2012), it was a tough act to follow. Sure enough, when I went to go see ""Thor: The Dark World"" in the theater, it sucked. It has a very poorly paced and jumbled storyline, the acting is all over the place, all of the sets/locations are boring and the soundtrack is cliched. The plot is, the Dark Elves (yes, you're reading this right, that's actually the name of the villains), are planning to plunge the universe into darkness and it's up to Thor to save the day. Okay, first of all, this story is the epitome of filler. That's one of the biggest problems of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; you have to go through pointless filler to keep you satisfied until the next big on-screen event. The best way to describe ""Thor: The Dark World"" in a nutshell, is filler without substance. I've seen this ""movie"" multiple times, and I cannot remember a single full scene. It's one of the most forgettable Marvel films. I can only recall a few moments and shots. Such as: Thor hanging his hammer Mjolnir on a coat hanger (which is stupid, but somewhat funny). Another thing I remember, is the scene where he destroys the monster and says: ""anyone else?"" Plus, the ending is not too bad, it caught me off-guard when I first saw it. If only the rest of the ""film"" was as good as those parts! You can easily tell that it was directed by someone else. It's more grounded and down to Earth compared to the first one. The first movie was directed by Kenneth Branagh, but this one is directed by Alan Taylor. It was like watching a completely different film! Another issue, is that the tone is inconsistent throughout. Sometimes it has drama, sometimes it has action and once in a while it throws in boring comedic bits to pad out the runtime. On top of that, the villain isn't interesting at all. So, his eventual comeuppance at the end has very little to no satisfaction. The only darkness I experienced, was the movie theater lights going out. Yes, I know I'm making a joke, but the whole theme of darkness in this ""film"" makes it all the more dull to watch. I understand what they were trying to go for, but it didn't work. All we got was nothing but lazy filler to attempt to hold us over until the next ""Avengers"" movie. As for the acting, it's all over the place from every actor and actress. The only ones who seem to be trying with what they had to work with, are: Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins. Just by pure coincidence, those three were the standout actors from the first film! That being said, unlike the first movie, the acting in this ""film"" is nothing short of a joke. Not even Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston or Anthony Hopkins could redeem it at all! There are some in the cast that do all right, granted. But, the rest of them just suck with their performances! All of the sets/locations are boring and give the ""film"" a dull atmosphere. Yeah, they somehow made Asgard look boring. How is that possible? The only cool locations here in this ""movie"" were in England. You can't go wrong with filming a movie there, or anywhere else in Europe! The soundtrack is about as generic and predictable as you can get. This time, Brian Taylor composed the film score and it's obvious that the soundtrack was written by someone other than Patrick Doyle. There are some parts of the film score that weren't that bad. But honestly, it's nothing to write home about. That's a shame, because Brian Taylor has written much better movie soundtracks! He could've done a much better job with this one. The only positive I can miraculously salvage out of this ""movie"" is the special effects. All of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing how it came out in 2013! ""Thor: The Dark World"" is an embarrassing ""film"" in the superhero genre. Is it the worst superhero movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? No, not by a long shot, as there are much worse films in this franchise as well as other bad superhero movies out there! I'm giving this ""film"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from this ""movie"", you're not missing anything. Even if you're making your way through the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the first time, you can skip this ""film"" and not miss a single thing. ""Thor: The Dark World"" deserves to be banished into darkness under the shadows, and never be seen again. What a pile of filth it is!","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Somehow Kenneth Branagh managed to avoid any possible silliness in the story of the super-powered, bleach-blonde Asgardian God battling against his greasy-haired brother and save Earth from destruction. Thor tended to stay away from the gold-plated, computer-generated tedium of Asgard and told a slightly comedic fish-out-of-water tale that was both charming and, even surprisingly, emotionally complex. The sequel, directed by HBO veteran Alan Taylor, spends less time on Earth and more time zapping around the other worlds that make up the universe's Nine Realms.In a backstory-heavy introduction, we learn that a powerful 'Dark Elf' Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was the leader of a powerful race that tried to use an energy source called the Aether to plunge the Nine Realms into darkness, but was overthrown by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) grandfather, Bor. With Malekith defeated, Bor hides the Aether in a stone column, establishing a new era of peace across the Realms. On present-day Earth, Thor's old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) accidentally discovers the Aether, which is absorbed into her body. Malekith, who has being lying dormant for years, is re-awoken by this event and seeks the Aether for himself, but not before Thor manages to whisk Jane back to Asgard.It's a typically McGuffin-riddled story that Marvel have managed to turn into a multi-billion dollar franchise, that simply allows the superhero to get from point A to point B in order to face the new big baddie in town. The Dark World is a loud, convoluted and epilepsy-inducing mess of huge battles and CGI landscapes, but, even if you can't get your head around the ridiculous, head-spinning plot, it's sure entertaining. But what The Dark World lacks is the tongue-in-cheek charm of the first film, insisting on making the story and tone 'darker', and moves the action to the sickly world of Asgard.What it does boast, is the return of the superb chemistry between Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, the latter as the imprisoned Loki, forced to reflect after the near-apocalypse of The Avengers (2012). It has been reported that Loki's involvement was beefed up significantly post- production, and his sneering, malevolent, yet wounded presence is welcome, especially when Thor is forced to team up with his brother to tackle Malekith. This, however, came at the expense of Eccleston's pointy-eared menace, whose back-story and screen-time were reduced so harshly that you almost forget he's there. Portman's Jane Foster is still, unfortunately, a bland bore, mad at Thor for not calling in two years. He was saving the world, love.Ultimately, Thor: The Dark World is sporadically fun, punctured by moments of CGI tedium and head-spinning exposition (usually delivered by Anthony Hopkins' bored-looking Odin), that often evoke the unnecessary complexity of the rather painful Pirate of the Caribbean sequels. When the portals start appearing and the wrestling Thor and Malekith begin to throw each other between different worlds within the Nine Realms, I held my hands up and just gave up. And maybe this is the approach to take - just simply let it play out in front of your eyes, enjoy the charisma of Hemsworth - who delivers another delightful performance - and pray that someday Marvel will give Loki his own movie.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This could seem like overkill, except all of the aforementioned movies already released have been good and some great. Which now brings us to Thor's third big screen outing – how does it compare to slew of Marvel movies around today? Very favourably.Following the chaotic events that rocked New York in 'The Avengers', Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) are back in Asgard, with the latter being imprisoned for his crimes. The Nine Realms appear to be in order, but an ancient race is on a vengeful path – The Dark Elves, led by the villainous Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). Upon discovering a portal between Asgard and Earth, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) accidentally reawakens them and they set their sights on Thor's homeworld.In stark contrasts to the recent DC films (except 'Green Lantern', but let's forget that ever happened), Marvel Studios' movies are unadulterated fun. 'Iron Man 3' and 'The Avengers' set the bar high for the level of sheer fun and Thor's latest continues along this path. It's also leaner than every other recent action blockbuster and all the better for it, as e.g. by the time the 30 minute climactic battle in 'Man of Steel' begins, the end credits start rolling on 'Thor: The Dark World'. Additionally, the action sequences are terrific and exhilarating, while the comedy is properly funny and occasionally hilarious. There's also an unexpected cameo from a Marvel regular that is one of the most joyous things I've seen all year. Alan Taylor uses his experience from the brilliant 'Game of Thrones' to great effect when approaching the fantasy worlds. As per usual, Tom Hiddleston is a delight to watch, lighting up the screen whenever he appears, while Hemsworth is efficient and the rest of the cast are solid. There are flaws – one or two plot strands disappear and some roles are underwritten. However, 'Thor: The Dark World' may not be a profound classic, but it is gloriously entertaining from start to finish and a very worthy addition to the ever-expanding Marvel canon. Also, make sure to stay for the entire ends credits, as we got, not one, but two post-credit sequences, which I won't spoil, but I will say that one of them offers an excitingly weird glimpse into a future Marvel movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Have there been weak ones? Sure! But, at the very least, the weakest entries still have things about them that make them worthwhile. 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the prime examples of this. However, it still has just enough in it to make it an enjoyable enough minor outing in the MCU.In some ways, this film actually improves upon its predecessor. More time is spent in the Nine Realms than on Earth and the visual effects and action sequences are both improved upon. Plus, any scene between Thor and Loki is a major highlight.However, as far as what happens in it, it doesn't really contribute much to the overall lore of the MCU aside from a few twist reveals. Also, it, unfortunately, has the weakest villain in the entire MCU in the form of Malekith. Christopher Eccleston is sadly wasted in the role, restricted by makeup and an elvish language. Despite what it may seem, he proves to be a lackluster threat for Thor and company to deal with. Clearly, the increased screen time of fan-favorite Loki affected Malekith's role in the story.Like 'Iron Man 2', this is clearly one of the MCU films that was most affected by the infamous creative committee, and in some cases, it does show. But 'terrible'? Absolutely not. I will say, though, that this one doesn't really warrant as many re-watches as some of the other MCU films.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.This one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.Anthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.The movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.On the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And, while this tactic may be a guarantee for a monthly onslaught of paper-backed mayhem, the same cannot necessarily be said in regards to consistency of quality.The most recent example: Thor: The Dark World. Why the sophomore attempt at the Thor franchise may have slightly outperformed its predecessor in regards to direction, story concept and art design; it, ultimately, still found itself over-welding its weighty Hollywood Hammer, resulting in an utter demolition of continuity, writing and optic nerves.Once you get beyond the pseudo-(meta)-psychics and babbling tech-talk, the background story is left suffering from a big floppy case of motivational dysfunction; as you find the characters haphazardly wandering though scene after scene, perhaps searching for a certified script doctor.And, while the story lent itself to several subtle moments of potential acting gems, most notably from Tom Hiddleston, they were soon obliterated under the mystically omnipotent sledgehammer of Hollywood Blockbuster.Sure, we could chalk up Thor: The Dark World as just another comic book inspired popcorn-fest if Christopher Nolan hadn't already proved that you can masterfully take the absurd and polish it into a piece of cinematic art.So, while this most recent high-def installment to the Marvel universe may satisfy your immediate super-hero craving, expect its fatty leftovers to spend their golden age in the back issues. 5.5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was an understatement to say I had high hopes for this movie. It hurts me to say this, but I left a little disappointed.The beginning of the movie to me did not start off well. I thought the idea of the movie beginning with Thor restoring peace to the nine realms was good, however, I could not stop but from thinking that it all looked silly. The costume design looked like it was just mashed together at the last minute and I thought they could have picked a better setting to at least add some tone of seriousness to the opening scenes. I did like how all the Marvel movie including this one continue to offer good laughs through out the film. Unfortunately, there is a time and place for those laughs. Thor: the Dark Work did a relatively good of monitoring where to put those jokes until the final fight scene. The final fight should have had some intensity to it. I'm not gonna lie, I did laugh along with everyone else, but I was still expecting something more. This part that I was waiting for never came and because of this, the movie felt incomplete. The brightest light of the movie to me was Tom Hiddleston. His acting continues to grow and I thought he was even better in this movie than in the Avengers. He is the perfect choice to play Loki, the devious brother of Thor who is not sure which side he is on. Hiddleston dominated every scene he was in. Chris Hemworth delivered another solid performance as the hammer-wielding God Thor. He adds good humor to the character and does the best with the story line that he is given. Natalie Portman does an above-average job at playing the pretty yet extremely clever scientist Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins seemed like he was not really giving his best effort as he was playing Odin, king of Asgard. Still, Anthony Hopkins worst is still better than most others best. The only time I thought the plot was well-written when the ending came which really got everyone in the theater thinking and that Tom Hiddleston's great performance finally resulted in something good. Now, just like any other Marvel movie, there is a scene after the credits. I was confused by what it meant, but I would be lying if it didn't leave me intrigued and excited for the next one. Was this movie the best in the Marvel series? No, not by far. Aside from its predecessors, the movie still offers enough good laughs and some solid action to make your experience entertaining. Still though, I was expecting a lot more than it gave.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thor The Dark World does not live up to the standard set by its predecessor. Although it ups the ante with the action, it lacks that personal focus of the first movie. Thankfully, a stellar cast and amazing chemistry saves the movie from falling into mindless blockbuster territory.With a combined movie universe, it begs the question of how come other heroes do not appear to intervene in the various world shattering crises that other heroes face in their individual movies. THOR: THE DARK WORLD provides just such an explanation by setting most of its action off earth. After the events of AVENGERS, Thor leads an Asgardian force to bring peace back to the 9 realms. On earth Jane Foster, Thor's love interest from the first film, stumbles on an anomalous place with portals that transports items, and herself, to another world; the so called ""Dark World"". There, she unwittingly bonds with an ancient weapon of tremendous power called the Aether. This alerts the evil Dark Elves, technologically advanced ancient enemies of Asgard, and their leader Malekith.As villains go, Malekith and his Dark elves are no where as memorable as one would have hoped. Like a crossbreed of LORD OF THE RINGS's Uruk-Hai with STAR WAR's Sith Lords and Clone Troopers. They have superpowered ""Kursed"" warriors, who are like Berserkers on steroids, they have space age technology centered around the manipulation of gravity (and novel use of mini-black hole grenades); all these are quite cool but seem to clash with the more fantasy-tech of Asgard. Malekith himself is a one note villain who is out to destroy all realms. Zero depth, zero development. Then again, what do you expect? He is not the star of this movie.What Thor The Dark World succeeds very much in is its world building. It crafts and expands upon the Marvel movie universe, adding much needed history and depth to the people of Asgard. This depth extends to the characters; this time focused mainly on the relationship between Thor, Loki and their parents. While Chris Hemsworth does a marvellous job as a heroic yet humble Thor, Tom Hiddelston is magnificent as Loki. He just oozes nuance in his performance, portraying the trickster as a truly tormented soul torn between the love for his mother and the hatred for his brother. You never know his true intentions or where his loyalties lie. If anything, this is more of a Loki movie than a Thor movie where your tragic villain outshines the titular character, stealing every scene he is in.Sadly, this leads to all the problems inherent in the movie. THOR: THE DARK WORLD has a great story. Yet its execution is muddled in direction and its general look and feel. Also, its character development is almost non existent except for Loki. As it opens up the Marvel cinematic universe into the far reaches of space age science fiction, the whole thing feels very much like the ""Star Wars"" prequels. High speed chases in space ships accompany the ever present laser guns, cloaking technology and plasma turrets. That sequence where Thor and Loki escape a blockaded Asgard with Jane just reeks of a similar scene in STAR WARS EPISODE 1.Then there are the romance and comedy. For most of the movie you have Thor and Jane pinning for each other like teenage love birds. Once together, they clearly look like they should be in love yet there is feeling of ""fakeness"" to their romance. Thankfully such scenes are few, with the focus on bigger action. In this department, the movie does not disappoint. The action is clearly of an epic scale and the stakes are high. Yet the movie sees fit to throw in as much inappropriate humor as possible into such heavy scenes. The humor just does not fit and in fact pulls us out of the moments. Moments where reality itself is crumbling and a character cracks a joke just feels like Disney at work again, killing another chance to take comic book superheroes seriously.Alas THOR: THE DARK WORLD is not a bad movie, it is good. It is just not as good as the first THOR movie, and this is likely due to executive meddling trying to get all new Marvel movies to follow the tone of Avengers. In trying to squeeze different types of stories into a single mold (no doubt to further cement their shared universe concept), you kill what made the concept great to begin with. Gone is Patrick Doyle's unique and spirit lifting symphony replaced by Brian Tyler's disappointing rehash of his CHILDREN OF DUNE soundtrack spliced with LORD OF THE RINGS and (believe it or not) Marvel's AVENGERS.In a similar vein, gone is what made THOR unique to begin with. It may not be a typical mindless blockbuster, but it is becoming a typical Marvel movie. Like Iron Man 3, like Avengers, and quite possible like all subsequent marvel movies; chock full of comedy, big action and cartoon style dialogue with no effort to try and take superheroes seriously or to craft a deep themed tale of costumed vigilantes gifted with awesome powers.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When she accidentally gets sucked into a wormhole, she becomes a target for the evil elf, and after he conquers Asgard, all nine worlds are at risk of being subsumed into perpetual darkness. As with the first film, there is humour here - there is chemistry on screen between Tom Hiddleston's untrustworthy ""Loki"" and Hemsworth, as between him and Portman. Skarsgård seems to spend a fair amount of the film in his underpants, and it all happens under the sparingly delivered gaze of Sir Anthony Hopkins. The story is good, and forgetting for a moment that Eccleston is not (remotely), this makes for an enjoyable to watch film that remains completely detached from the Marvel/SHIELD series and it should be appreciated for that too.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While we might ask where are the Avengers when the entire universe is under threat, we're better off dismissing concerns about the too-fantastic overly high-stakes plot and just enjoy the ride.Imaginative FX, great action, lots of cool alien tech & architecture, a fairly compelling villain due to his visual design more than anything else (his motivations are the usual guff). Cast were mostly all fine tho' not too convinced by Natalie Portman's character, feels a bit miscast, like there's a lack of chemistry between her and her cast-mates.Other than that not much else to pick on. Turn-brain-off and enjoy the spectacle. While I appreciate Iron Man's quasi-realism I think the MCU really shines when things go really 'out-there'. Aliens, gods, magic...all that stuff. It's not easy to get such a film right, some of cinema's most awful movies are magical-space-fantasy efforts, but the Thor movies get the balance right. So far.Tho' short of a rare 9 or 10/10...as fun as this movie is it lacks a deeper substantial impression. You won't be in awe of it...but you will enjoy it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm not saying that they recorded a very bad films, but to me they are just average (except for Iron Man and The Avengers). So record a movie and give a teaser to another, recording another, giving a teaser for the third, and so on ... What concerns the film itself, I was somewhat impressed. They're great cast assembled for this movie, but we know who will spend most of their time on the big screen. Fight scenes and CGI are superb as expected, but I still want something a little more than a movie. I liked Loki, who confirmed his class. The effects are excellent, although I felt a little robbed Star Wars, but alright. Of course, there is a scene after the credits, and then patience for a minute, if a little track you will see they announced another film in the world of Marvel. The new machine for printing money.

This gave it personality, and made it the better of Marvel's two 2011 films (the other being Captain America). The sequel, though by no means lacking in the laughs department, takes a darker approach to the continuity, with considerably more action than its predecessor. The acting is still commendable across the board, but it is Tom Hiddleston who delivers the breakout performance, perfectly showcasing the pent-up rage Loki has against the world that has exiled him. This time, Asgard is under seige by an ancient enemy known as the Dark Elves. The action has a sort of stormtroopers-vs.-Ewoks vibe, as the Dark Elves cut down the sword-wielding Asgardians with energy-based projectile weapons. While it's obvious that Asgard will not be destroyed this early in the storyline, it does indicate that forthcoming Marvel tales might not be as light as they were in the past.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Despite a hokey narration that sets up the plot, 'Thor: The Dark World' starts off promisingly with a good action sequence and re-introduction to Asgard, but it soon becomes clear that the film is aimless. Far too much time is spent with the uninteresting 'Earth characters', and the pacing is terrible. Even when the action finally begins, it's boring. Sure, the special effects look good, but we don't care about them because we don't care about the characters. On top of that, the film has what is probably the worst villain of the entire MCU and it has horrible cinematography. At least it has a better handle of tone than the first and the camera is held straight. Plus, it's watchable enough and stands on its own two wobbly legs without setting up further films. 5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Alan Taylor does a very good job directing. Improving on the first film with its overuse of dutch angles and keeping the filmmaking more simplistic and stylistic. The best part of the film is the action scenes are very well filmed and beautifully designed with special effects, great direction, and fantastic acting. This is though not Taylor's best film in his career and it sadly is the weakest Thor film in the now trilogy with a lot of issues from the script and some questionable acting choices as well that could come from Taylor or the casting director. Getting to the writing, it feels like each act in the film is written by a completely different person and has a few times that I felt like I was watching a different film completely with each act change. The script portrays the main antagonist as this one sided generic villain that has just one job and it is to destroy the universe, heard of that one before?, yeah me too. And especially with Iron Man 3 having a very rich villain, it falls short on the writing. Besides that the characters written are all good. But I do feel like they were trying to cram in as much as they can into this film which was completely unnecessary for this aftermath film. Then the tone change, with it going from extremely dark and serious scenes to awkward comedy doesn't transfer well at all in this film and honestly doesn't feel like a Marvel film when rewatching it. The acting is overall amazing. Hemsworth drastically improved in this stand alone film compared to the first in his acting. Hiddleston is once again amazing as the god of tricks and his manipulation and use of great plan developing to get what he needs. Even minor characters like Thor's warriors and his mom and dad all are so much stronger than the first film and have a lot more useful parts and more defining roles than the first film which is nice. But the main villain once again comes off bad compared to the rest of the film. It could've been from the prosthetics but his acting comes off so bland and feels like his voice is one of those computer text-to-speech things. But one character compared to an ensemble of amazing actors can be forgotten. With a huge issue of storytelling and a single character that could've been better written and acted. It falls short on its potential as the sequel. Thor: The Dark World gets a 6/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's not a necessity but it's been proved repeatedly that building proper characters is getting a lot more attention than constructing real good plot. I can understand the reasoning behind it, when the characters are appealing, the actors find it easier to relate and do their work better. And almost everybody here excels though Tom Hiddleton as Loki deserves special notice. But the story could definitely be built better. And I'm not speaking about the plausibility of the basic premise, as I said more than once the entire idea of a living super hero calls for some suspension of judgment, but if this super hero operates inside our own world, some other laws of logic must apply, and many of those are ignored here.

However, under Alan Taylor's direction, this powerful, impersonal visual-effects extravaganza is peppy and unpretentious enough to counteract its concoction of generally trite fantasy/action themes.Even while the film's formula of catastrophic mayhem combined tongue-in-cheek humor remains pure essence of Marvel, the fact that much of the action takes place in Asgard and other far dimensions allows for an enlivening change of scenery at the very least.An old prologue describes a conflict between the valiant Asgardian troops and an evil race known as the Dark Elves-so called less for their fair skin than for their passion for all-consuming darkness. The Aether is buried down underground in a location where no one would ever find it, while the remaining Dark Elves, commanded by the supervillain Malekith, are sentenced to millennia of dormancy.Of course, Jane Foster, Earth's most attractive astrophysicist and the mortal soul mate of everyone's favorite hunk with a hammer, Thor, should discover it centuries later. The Dark Elves' plan to activate the Aether, however, could have disastrous effects on all Nine Realms, so the coronation will have to wait.Unbeknownst to most people, Earth is one of those Nine Realms, despite the fact that, if ""Thor: The Dark World"" is to be believed, it is such a dull planet that it is difficult to feel any grief at the idea of its extinction. Things become stale nearly every time the movie returns to earth, where Jane's perpetually sarcastic assistant Darcy and new intern Ian attempt to come up with a scientific solution with the assistance of Dr. Erik Selvig, Jane's former mentor, who appears to have added crazed nudism to his list of eccentric pastimes.Fortunately, Asgard rarely features the forced humor and uninteresting scenery of the Earth sequences, so it's generally enjoyable to visit with Thor and Jane, who looks especially lovely dressed in the finery of the realm. Director Taylor creates some of his most captivating set pieces in this ethereal realm, beginning with the Dark Elves' lethal attack on Odin's palace and ending with a rather breathtakingly gorgeous mass funeral scene.Also in Asgard, we discover Loki, Thor's scheming and power-crazed brother, who is currently incarcerated there for his involvement in the events of ""The Avengers."" When it becomes evident that the two will have to work together in order to stop Malekith, the brotherly rivalry between him and Thor takes a genuinely exciting turn. This development is cleverly handled for chuckles as well as tense emotional drama.In the end, the film's humor is essentially its saving grace since it keeps the action interesting and energetic enough for viewers to not notice how rehashed the plot is or how low the stakes feel. And several clever turns are based on the Asgardians' prowess at shape-shifting, which here serves as the magical equivalent of people taking off latex masks like in ""Mission: Impossible.""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Everything that I truly enjoyed in the first installment of this franchise had an oddly opposite reaction for me in Thor: The Dark World. Everything in this latest installment seemed out of kilter from its entertaining 2011 predecessor. (However, it was during the film that I did have a full out-of-body experience: I so wanted to take this body out of the theater, away from the stifling boredom and unending disengagement of all the silly action and sci-fi mythos, but dear moviegoers, I dutifully fought that urge.)In Thor: The Dark World, the comic banter is missing (with only one laugh total), as is the beefcake factor (with only one shirtless interlude). With this sequel, everything seems terribly oppressive. In his battle to save Earth, Thor must battle a new villain, Malekith (played one- dimensionally by Christopher Eccleston). Malekith is the leader of the Dark Elves, a group of mutant warriors bent on world destruction (what else?) with the help of a weapon of mass destruction called the Aether (pronounced ether). As with the first film, the film bounces from one battle scene on either a desolate planet or an Art Deco wonderland. Whenever the action takes place on Planet Asgard, the film has recharged energy and strong action footage, whereas, when we go to Planet Earth, the film bogs down and lands with a thud.Chris Hemsworth, who was so much fun when we first met him as Thor, plays the role all too seriously. He's still an earnest hero, but that fish out of water conceit is no more. (And it was that premise which helped achieve the film's unique and special charm in the first outing.) Natalie Portman is wasted in her role as his astrophysicist gal pal. The wonderful chemistry between these actors playing Thor and Jane that once was is no more. Now Jane is a cute harpy and Thor goes from hunk to lunk. At least, he still has that magic hammer and knock- out abs. Hopkins, who was solid before as Odin, is now all ham and he never quite passes the muster. Such fine actors as Ray Stephenson, Idris Elba, Rene Russo, Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgard are underused in minor roles. Only Tom Hiddleston as Thor's jealous and evil sibling, Loki, has the campy menace and star presence to make this film sequel-worthy.The CGI is more than adequate as is Alan Taylor's direction. A few action sequences are well staged while others are inessential time fillers. Like the mighty Aether, the numerous and loud sci-fi action numbs the senses and only dulls the pain. The screenplay by Christopher L. Yost, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely is more convoluted than necessary with too much exposition spent on the Norse sci-fi background or establishing the next fight scene instead of developing characters and motives. Thor: The Dark World just seems needlessly strung together from one battle sequence to the next, as Thor, Jane, and the gang travel from one portal dimension to the next anomaly. The film plays more like an expensive video game than it does a real movie. Boring.As superhero movies go, the film is a minor disappointment. Marvel's Thor: The Dark World is no marvel at all. It's just more of the same, and not really all that interesting.

And how have they done it? By NOT making super-hero movies.Stay with me here...Marvel Studios has made it a point to make action-genre movies, that just happen to have their super-heroes in them. Iron Man? Action/sci-fi. Captain America 1? Action/war themed. Cap 2? Action/espionage/political thriller. Guardians of the Galaxy? Action/space opera. Thor 1 and 2? Action/fantasy. The point being, if Thor didn't have ""Thor"", the Marvel comic character, but just some random big dude with a hammer, the movie still works as an action/fantasy movie. IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE COMICS, YOU CAN STILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE JUST AS MUCH AS ANYONE. You can't really say that to the same extent when it comes to the Batman or Man of Steel movies. Marvel's got it down to a science, and you gotta give it up to them for that.That being said, let's get into specifics...All jokes aside, this is just a great, well written, fun time at the movies. 3D isn't necessary for this, BUT Marvel sweetened the deal by adding an extended 5+ minute trailer for Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier to the 3D screenings, which includes a pretty great fight scene. So, 2D or 3D is really your call.Thor: The Dark World earns a 4.25 out of 5 on the BDBOS. Well done.STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!!! There are TWO bonus scenes to stick around for, one halfway through the credits (!), and a 2nd scene at the end.(Hey guys, thanks for reading my review, hope you enjoyed it. If you'd like to see more of my ramblings, check out my humble little page at facebook.com/TheBDBOS. It's a little hobby of mine that will probably grow to be the BIGGEST THING EVER in movie reviews...okay, BIGGEST EVER might be exaggerating. BIGGEST THING OF OUR GENERATION? That feels right.

Going into the theater I expected a great movie, though I had some small doubts deep within myself after seeing Avengers.

It's just boring. There's not much to it, except for a new infinity stone and more of a relationship between Jane Foster and Thor. To me, the main villain, Christopher Eccleston's Malekith, is overshadowed by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Kurse, a smaller villain. But it's always fun to have Kat Dennings' Darcy, so they had that going for them. Tom Hiddleston's Loki stole the show entirely, taking up the only performance that stands out. And the only other good thing was a couple action scenes, which were a little cool. The entire movie is just slow and a little pointless, though, so the bad definitely outweighs the good by a long shot. Something you should take with a grain of salt as you sit down to watch.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Kenneth Branaugh's film has always felt like a ""good but not great"" affair, so this sequel had nowhere to go but up.Naturally, there are loads of great action scenes throughout the film, with Asgardians, humans, and dark elves fighting on land, sea, air, and space. Among the film's highlights, the elves' raid on Asgard is a fantastic sequence with spaceships zooming around the city with dazzling laser beams and mass destruction. The final act presents a wildly imaginative sequence with characters duking it out across multiple worlds. In between, the film goes through plenty of compelling drama, but a lot of it is ultimately crushed by the comedy; hardly a moment goes by without something funny or ridiculous.The story continues after the first Thor film and The Avengers in a logical manner, continuing the established character arcs. The plot goes through a pretty standard structure, but it is far from predictable; there are a few surprising twists and turns, and the film takes the characters to bold new directions. A lot of the characters are fairly one-dimensional (especially Thor himself, the main antagonist, and the scientist characters, who are there mostly for comic relief), but everybody's favorite supervillain, Loki, easily steals the spotlight. Fortunately, most of these characters are likable (save for Darcy, who I think is cute, but many complain is overbearing). It's largely the villain who comes out as the weakest link, lacking in depth or range.This film pretty standard photography, with some good movements and angles, which let the action scenes flow and speak for themselves. Editing struck me as being a little screwy in a few scenes, but is mostly spot-on. Acting is good: Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Anthony Hopkins all reprise their roles admirably (Hiddleston has especially grown into his role most comfortably). Natalie Portman continues to play a rather ditzy love interest, but she is given more to do in this film. Everybody else is decent, although I don't think Christopher Eccleston stood out much at all. Writing is not bad, although I felt that the film's explanation of the Aether and its connection with things like dark matter and the universe in general was pretty weak (pretty much technobabble just for the sake of it). This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. Most special effects are cool, but I thought that some of the backgrounds and starfields looked a little low-rez. Music is alright.I find Thor: The Dark World is a grade more enjoyable than the first film, and it's worth seeing to see the characters' progression and plenty of otherworldly action. It's an easy recommendation for fans of the Marvel films.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

A universe that is an incredible feat in movie-making. Sure, not all the movies have been mind blowing but that doesn't change the fact that what Marvel/Disney is doing is changing movies, more notably the big blockbuster films. They have these intertwined films in a way that we've never really seen before, it's all one big universejust like a comic book. And I love it. As for this 2nd installment in the Thor franchise, it's pretty good, is it the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? No, not really. But, it is certainly an improvement over the 1st film. The movie opens with an opening narration just like the first one about the Dark Elf Malekith who wants to destroy the universe using a weapon named the Aether. This takes place a long time before the days of Odin's rule and involved Odin's father, Bor. Time passes after the Dark Elves have failed and we turn back to Thor in present day. Loki is sent to prison. Thor is lonely but protecting the nine realms. And we have an onslaught of fun action scenes that felt very Lord of the Rings esque which I loved. The Dark Elves are the main villains in this film but they aren't exactly the most interesting which has been a problem in most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Loki really being the only standout villain out of all the films, at least in my opinion. There is still plenty of great action pieces especially towards the end which rather than being a big, insane fight is slightly more focused and certainly fun. The humor is there, not in The Avengers doses, but it certainly is still there, especially with Loki and Tom Hiddleston doing a great job.I don't expect to go into these movies and get my life changed or be enlightened in some way. I come to have fun. And I certainly did. Is the movie a bit safe? Yeah, it kind of is, it doesn't try to doing anything crazy or even for the most part, impact the Cinematic Universe a whole lot but it still delivers where it needs tobe entertaining. Overall, I don't think I need to be telling you to see the movie because most of you probably already havebut, these are Event Movies and that's truly what I love the most, these have to be seen in theaters with a large crowd who are excited to see it just as much as you are, that's the way to do it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I didn't hate it. I didn't even really dislike it. It was a movie that was just there. A one word rating for it would be meh. When Avengers came out I was pleasantly surprised by how much more entertaining the Thor and Loki characters were. They started to grow on me.

If you stuck around after that last statement, instead of just going out and throwing your money at some teenager with a poor complexion, then let me tell you why this movie is so great. It really breaks down two three things. The first is the Amazing visual effects. Thor: The Dark World is much more in the production style of Avengers, than the first Thor. It had big ambition, big talent, and an even bigger budget. These amazing VFX are only highlighted by some great cinematography, and amazing locations. Iceland (as an alien planet) was the most amazing of them all. The second was the story line. Thor: The Dark World focuses on an agent race of evil elves that are in search of a substance that can destroy all nine realms by throwing them into eternal darkness. While the elves were goofy looking, they made for a formidable foe. I won't lie, the script won't win any awards (except maybe something goofy like an MTV movie award), but it's fun! Fun counts for a lot. The third and final aspect that made this film so great was Tom Hiddleston. The man who plays Loki is an amazing actor, and portrays villianry at near Tim Curry levels. Hiddleston has an amazing career in front of him. Go see ""Thor: The Dark World,"" wait through the credits (there's two stingers), and enjoy the large amounts of fun that is the Marvel universe. You wont regret it, and you'll be prepared for the next Avengers movie. http://watchplayread.com/thor-dark-world-worth-money/","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The acting is still strong, with Chris Hemsworth delivering a powerful performance as Thor, and Tom Hiddleston once again stealing the show as Loki. However, the plot falls a bit flat and the villain, Malekith, is underwhelming. The special effects are also not quite as impressive as in the first film. That being said, the film still has its moments, particularly the scenes featuring the dynamic between Thor and Loki. It's worth a watch for Marvel fans, but it's not as strong as the first Thor film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Another highly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi fantasy action thriller from Marvel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2900454/?ref_=tt_urv","YJLcool","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34627686/?ref_=tt_urv","6 November 2013","Thor The Dark World is another highly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi fantasy action thriller with some surprising plot twists and surprises throughout the film. The sequel surpasses the first film for its stunning depiction of the other realms (especially Asgard, which is lacking in the first film). The artistic designs for the costumes, weapons, set designs were nothing short of impressive and visually spectacular.The film has a fine balance of action, humor and emotion. There are more enjoyable action scenes and several emotional scenes involving Loki in this sequel which proved to be better than the first film. The climatic battle and Dark Elves' assault on Asgard were shot brilliantly. There are several interesting cameo appearances which proved to be a delight to the Marvel fans as well. The lead actors managed to deliver charming and heartfelt performances and most of the character interactions in the film were great and handled very well (especially Thor and Loki's constant bicker).However, the film has a rather short running time (a mere 112 mins) considering the number of characters they have included in the film. The characters of Odin, Heimdall, Sif or Frigga are simply not given enough screen time, which is a minor disappointment. The Asgardian army are shown to be too weak considering their ability to invent flying ships or even an Einstein-Rosen bridge (Bifrost Bridge). The main antagonist of the film, Malekith is not shown to be compelling enough or rather generic, his intentions are not fully elaborated and has to rely on two other villains to further the narrative. There are some unnecessary characters and scenes in the film (Notably overly long scenes involving Ian or Richard). Strangely enough, the Dark Elves have their own alien language but the Asgardians don't (they speak English instead).The love triangle between Thor, Sif and Jane was not explored at all in the film.Furthermore, how Thor managed to arrive in New York in The Avengers film is not further explained in this sequel as well(The Bifrost Bridge has been destroyed and it is expected for the sequel to provide a proper explanation...The Avengers film just briefly mentioned that Odin have to find considerable amount of dark matter to get Thor to Earth).Overall, the film still succeeds as a decent entertainment and remain as a wonderful addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that will not disappoint the fans and satisfy most casual moviegoers.Rating: 8/10Note: As for all Marvel films, be sure to wait for the mid-credit and after-credit scenes.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/11/movie-review-thor-dark-world.html","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Thor: The Dark World is entertaining and fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2901389/?ref_=tt_urv","insessionfilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47021818/?ref_=tt_urv","8 November 2013","DIRECTION Alan Taylor, mostly known for TV, gets the directors chair for Thor: The Dark World and brings us Thor in some new and fun ways. This version of Thor is much more complex and darker than the first time we met the God of Thunder. The visuals are just as amazing and the main characters get a little more interesting. The camera work is solid, especially when shooting the aerial combat scenes we get. There's also another great shot when we first see Loki and Thor together where Loki is being sarcastic and the camera work almost operates as another character. Not to mention, Taylor throws in some great cameos there. The pacing is very good and there's a great mixture of Thor in action and dialogue that sets up the story. Some of what Taylor is doing can come across off as confusing, especially to new fans but overall what Taylor does is entertaining and fun.Grade: A-SCRIPT The story pretty much picks up right after The Avengers as Thor is now back in his realm making sure that all the realms are at peace. We are introduced to a new alien race that is an old enemy of Asgard. Their secret weapon is eventually found by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and all the worlds collide (literally) as Thor and Odin try to find a way save Jane and destroy this secret weapon. At the same time, Loki is now in an Asgard prison because of his actions in The Avengers. However, after an attack on Asgard and a tragic incident, Thor must now rely on Loki to help him destroy the enemy. The conflicts created here are interesting and well explored. Much of the dialogue and scenes between Thor and Loki are very funny and well crafted, showing realistically what a brother-brother relationship looks like, but amongst Gods. The story is also very science-y and is heavy on the dialogue that is sometimes hard to keep up with. The main villain isn't that interesting and isn't explored enough to really care about much. Overall, it's still a fun story and the gripping relationship between Thor and Loki keep it engaging.Grade: B+PERFORMANCES Chris Hemsworth has become a defining character in the Marvel universe and hammers down this character well (see what I did there). He's fantastic as usual and brings a wittiness to the character we haven't see much of yet. His action shots, especially with the Hammer are really good. Portman on the other hand is more hit or miss. The character could be written better but for what she's doing she's okay. Portman really didn't want to reprise this role and it's easy to tell in some scenes but overall brings it when it mattered. Tom Hiddleston is unbelievable as Loki. And by unbelievable, I really mean it's hard to believe how believable he is as that character. He's got all the charm and evilness that makes this a fun character. Anthony Hopkins is also great as Odin. I thought he was fantastic in the first Thor movie and again, he's perfect as the Asgard King. The rest of the supporting cast, including the awesome Idris Elba, is very good even though they have little to do overall.Grade: A-SCORE This is perhaps the best Brian Tyler score yet. Tyler's scores in the past haven't been bad but they haven't been stand out worthy either. Patrick Doyle's score for the first Thor is really good and stands out on it's own very well. Tyler doesn't use the same themes here but the theme he does come out with is very good and brings a good element to the film. It's not too distracting but it's also fun to listen to inside and outside of the movie. Without giving anything away, I do want to mention there's an Alan Silvestri theme that plays out in a cameo appearance that's really awesome. The crossovers have even gone into the scores as well. I love it.Grade: AFINAL THOUGHTS Thor: The Dark World is a great continuation in the Marvel Universe and it's a better direction than Iron Man 3. It's entertaining and the relationship between Thor and Loki is great. It's a good step up from the first film and introduces some new characters. The average fan may have a hard time with this though and some elements are tough to care about but overall it's still very enjoyable. Also, if you see it in 3D, there's some awesome footage you'll see of Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Overall Grade: A-","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Accomplishes what it sets out to, which is mostly popcorn-action, plus a few pleasant surprises.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2902027/?ref_=tt_urv","Buildinwings","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16529161/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2013","Thor: The Dark World is a movie that doesn't shy away from its genre or source material. For the most part, it is a simple and relatively formulaic plot, couched in well-shot and entertaining action sequences. The context of the fantasy universe works well, again the result of ""leaning in"" to this quasi-supernatural setting. The other things this movie accomplishes is in developing the characters further, without falling victim to the stagnation that it risked in being a third installment with these characters. We see Thor mature, and place personal sacrifice ahead of the lives of countless people. We see Loki put aside differences for a common goal (however capricious he may be at heart). We also see the differences between Thor and Odin that explains why Thor is a guardian, and not a king.If all you're looking for is a fun, function film that follows and builds on established characters, you've found a good one. If you're looking for something deeply cerebral, or something that goes into the deeper implications of this multi-dimensional existence, look elsewhere. Overall, 8/10 because it accomplished what it set out to, 1 point off because the dark elf masks remind me of the ""putties"" from the Power Rangers, and 1 point off because ambition was set a touch low in being an archetype of a plot arc.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is not a very good movie for the simple fact that every second we get with the villains or the humans, the movie feels like a Transformers sequel. All the human and villains parts are exactly like Michael Bay's franchise, fill of: pathetic attempts of (very, very) low brow humor, terrible exposition, bad acting.The difference here is that we have another big junk of the movie that involves Thor, Loki and the Asgardians, and it's very good, probably more because of the actors (Hemsworth and Hiddleston are both amazing at what they do) than anything the movie does. Also, like in the first one, all the family drama and storyline is pretty good, and I liked the 3rd act, for the most part.So in the end, the movie is broken. They continued the totally unnecessary connection with the humans by forcing the storyline and they maintained the worst part of the 1st movie, and they sadly wasted an opportunity to make a really good Thor movie, which would end on Kevin's Feige decision to just parody and laugh at Thor in the sequel and last of the trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

More action, more explosions, more drama, also, more ""grey"". What is it with all the new adventure movies and extremely bland colors? The original Thor managed to keep me interested and excited throughout the entire film, but this time I really didn't find myself having very much concern for any of the characters. Now, I know the plot is important, but It's hard to care about a plot when you don't care if the characters live or die. I found I was bored, and completely uninterested in the usual banter between Thor, Loki and Odin. It's become very dull and predictable. I also never really found myself rooting for anyone, unlike the first film where I found myself rooting for multiple characters. Whatever made the chemistry work in Thor seems to be almost lost in the sequel. The pacing was slow in all the wrong places, and the dialogue in my opinion went from acceptable to corny with nothing in between. All of the comic relief was terrible and did not work. The Chemistry between Thor and Jane lacked sincerity, and Darcy's character actually made me roll my eyes on several occasions. She's pretty much the Jar Jar Binks of this franchise...Just there so the kids can have a character to relate to. What was good about the film? Clearly a lot of effort was put into the visual effects and action sequences, I guess that's worth noting and the plot itself is not bad either. Basically, it's your run of the mill action sequel. Not terrible, but not great either. Just bland. In conclusion, although this is not a great film, it's watchable and if you're someone following the Marvel Universe, it's kind of a must watch as some major events take place.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's also the eighth movie in 'The Avengers' Marvel film franchise universe. Tom Hiddleston also returns as Thor's villainous brother Loki, Anthony Hopkins once again plays his father Odin and Natalie Portman returns as his earthling love interest Jane Foster. Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Stellan Skarsgard, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Rene Russo all reprise their roles from the original film with newcomers Christopher Eccleston, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jonathan Howard, Chris O'Dowd and Zachary Levi (now playing Fandral) all joining the cast. In this installment Thor must battle 'Dark Elves' trying to gain control of a powerful weapon known as the Aether, which would send the universe into total darkness. The story is irrelevant; the epic action, visuals and superhero spectacle (that fans expect from a Marvel's 'Avengers' film) is all there! Fans of the original won't be disappointed.Many years ago Odin's father Bor (Tony Curran) defeated the Dark Elves, as they tried to gain control of the Aether and destroy the universe. Bor hid the powerful weapon in a stone column but unknown to him the Dark Elves' leader Malekith (Eccleston), and his surviving followers, hid themselves in suspended animation. In present day Jane Foster (Portman) finds the Aether and is infected by it. When she disappears, for several hours, Thor (Hemsworth) returns to Earth to find her. He brings her back to Asgard with him, so his people can find out what happened to her, but Malekith and his Dark Elves army have awakened and soon attack Asgard looking for Jane and the Aether (once again). Thor must turn to his brother Loki (Hiddleston), who's now locked up for his crimes on Earth, for help. Like with a lot of big action movies (especially superhero films) the plot line is confusing and uninvolving but it doesn't really matter in a film like this. People come to see the characters and action and as long as a film like this is visually stunning and well cast (and some decent dialogue helps as well) then fans will be pleased. I think 'Thor' fans will definitely be pleased with this movie (I was). I'd say the movie is about as good as the original; it's grander in scale and a bit more epic but it also lacks some of the awe that made the first film so entertaining. Fans of the comic book will probably get more of a kick out of it (as they're more likely to follow what's going on and pick up on easter eggs); I have friends that read the 'Thor' comics that have really enjoyed both movies. I don't think it quite lives up to the best comic book films but it is better than most. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are once again both outstanding in their roles and Alan Taylor (the film's new director) does a decent job directing. Portman is once again underused (and she's really above roles like this) and the script (by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) is pretty routine but the movie still has plenty of what fans are looking for!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This has exceptional action, good heart, good sad and a good bad. The humor was about 65% on, but I think the 35% that didn't hit was dry smirking humor, which is good for me. I do think the 2ndary Aasgard fighters or Thor's posse could have been used in the final battle against the other elves and that probably would have made it a 8.5 - 9.0 straight out.The disclosure is that Thor was my 2nd fav superhero growing up behind Spiderman so it would be hard for me not to like it, OVERALL IT WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","i would use 4 words for Thor: The Dark World, Fun Fun Fun and Natalie Portman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2918990/?ref_=tt_urv","illusioner","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5689398/?ref_=tt_urv","8 December 2013","i would use 4 words for Thor: The Dark World, Fun Fun Fun and Natalie Portman :).Watched it today. I liked Thor 1, it was a Fun, well executed and acted Origin story with the main lead fitting for the role. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect Thor, just like Hugh Jackman is a perfect Wolverine. Chris has totally taken over the role of Thor and made it his own. When you see him on screen he truly is a believable God of Thunder. And when you see an actor embrace a role like that, you automatically enjoy the movie. I was hoping Marvel would improve more in Thor 2 specially after the Blockbuster The Avengers, and boy, they have . The Action and effects in this one is top notch and as big of a scale as they should be, and Marvel also finally realized that they need to show Thor fly (Thanks to Man of Steel :D), and they have with some awesome sequences. No comparison to Man of Steel of course, but still some really awesome scenes, specially in the end. The Final sequence is literally been fought every where, you'll know what i mean when you see it. Special effects this time around are absolutely fabulous, although i am very much disappointed at the use of 3D. Its not utilized to the extent or in a way that you would feel the 3D, if i had a choice i would have preferred it in 2D. As that makes the Action and effects pop out.OK aside from the cool action and visuals, i won't go much in to the story line as always, an overview though. After the Bifrost destroyed since part 1, Thor is busy bringing peace to the 9 realms when an ancient weapon, forged by the king of The Dark Elves, long beaten and forgotten by the Asgardians, is activated accidentally by Jane (Natalie Portman) and The Evil King Awakens with his army. From here onwards the story move forward as Thor needs to protect and save Jane and all 9 realms from this powerful weapon and The Dark Elves. And of course what a Thor movie would be without Loki (The Awesome and charismatic Tom Hiddleston), Thor requires Lokis help, in which again i won't go in to details, and we get to see some awesome scenes with both specially when Thor frees Loki, and you will witness an Awesome Awesome and unsuspected scene in a hall when they are talking . What leads to there alliance, is again you need to see for yourself . and the conclusion to that will make you go WOW....For the last Epic battle, this time around the last action sequence is kind of centered in Greenwich, London, you'll know what i mean when you see it and if you guys are following Marvel Agents of Shield TV series, you should watch Episode 8 ""The Well"" after watching Thor 2, as it starts, where the final battle ends, u'll enjoy more. I loved every single minute of the last sequence, it had some really really great moments and as much as i want to talk about them here, i can't as it would spoil it for you. It had some cool funny moment as well. And i have to say one thing, i just have to. Last year, Man of Steel was criticized for showing too much destruction and collateral damage, every other person who didn't like the movie was talking about it that they didn't like it coz of that. Well, i think those people who criticized MOS for those specific reason, should stay away from this one and hate this as well , as Marvel has shown some massive destruction in London as well as Asgard and they have shown some major collateral damage as well. Lets see how many people make this ridiculous complaint now. Just Enjoy people, Superman is Alien with super powers, Thor is an Alien/God with Super Powers, what good a movie will be if they don't get to show us what they are capable of, at least this time around, Marvel didn't shy away from these things and actually showed it.Rounding up, i need to mention the Awesome Kat Dennings, every time you see her on screen, she will make you smile if not laugh, she is one funny lady . As good marvel have used Dennings character this time around, they have really miss used Lady Sif, Jamie Alexanders character in this one. Everybody was hoping to see her more in action and Marvel actually promoted it that way as well, but that is not the case, she has almost the same role as in 1.All in all, Thor: The Dark World is an awesome and fun Sequel, there is not a single dull moment in the movie and any person who loves fantasy, scifi and action movies, will love this one as well. It is a worthy sequel, bigger and definitely much better. The only thing i didn't like about the movie was its 3D presentation and the fact they didn't give Lady Sif more screen time, as i was expecting to see her more in action . Oh well, i can settle for seeing Natalie on screen anytime though lol. Another thing which is itching my brain, thats related to Loki, but since it is directly related to the plot, i can't discuss it here. but i really hope that makes sense in the upcoming Marvelverse.Go watch Thor: The Dark World in the cinema. Its Fun and Awesome. Highly recommended.Score 8/10 (it would be 9 for me, but the 3D was disappointing)","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The pairing of Tom and Chris as Loki and Thor is always great viewing and sadly there is not enough funny duo action. It has been noted that the film is a lot shorter than most and a fair few good scenes have not made the final cut, mainly Loki, Loki and Thor and Thor and Frigga. Saying that the film is great with a brilliant cast. Anthony Hopkins does seem a bit wooden in this but it is due to Odin aging and the fact I think he has just had enough of the situation in Asgard.

It is a movie for lovers of comic book tales and it just bounces between firestorm and dissolution of nine realms to London and back. The plot? This synopsis makes a little sense of it: ' Thousands of years ago, a race of beings known as Dark Elves tried to send the universe into darkness by using a weapon known as the Aether. Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown.' The other good folks on Asgard are portrayed by Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stephenson, Tadanobu Asano, and the folk down on earth are Stellan Skarsgård, Kat Dennings, Jonathan Howard, and Chris O'Dowd. Oh and there is a cast a thousands of Asgardians and Dark Elves to tear up the screen. The real star is the team of CGI artists.For THOR addicts, this is an entertaining film. For others, not so much...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was actually probably my favorite of Marvel's phase one films. The mixture of high Asgardian fantasy mixed well with the fish out of water humor on Earth. I'm sure having Kenneth Branagh in the director's chair certainly helped. He has a good touch for switching between high drama and light humor.The Dark World arrived at a time when Marvel needed to build its larger universe's ultimate conflict. As a result of this, the antagonists in this movie feel undercooked and nonthreatening. Maybe its their designs, which look alarmingly low budget, but they are maybe the weakest villains yet in the MCU.There was ripe opportunity here to make it a personal threat, where Jane's life was legitimately at stake. But the human element of the Marvel movies always plays second fiddle to the spectacle, and this story line is no more than a brief distraction until we get to the ships colliding into cities and CGI explosions.I actually quite enjoyed the climax of the movie, which is usually not the case for these. There's always a light comic touch to the Earth scenes in these Thor movies, and they thankfully continue that trend even during scenes of mass destruction. It's nice to see Thor asking for directions on the Underground, or confused office workers witness two supernatural beings slide down their window in agony. While not exciting for a story point of view, it was entertaining. Plus, I really liked Natalie Portman's red rainboots.It's too bad then that I was really not a fan of the first 75 minutes, where much of the action needs to be explained to us for it to have any weight, and then for the action to be middling at best. I don't know if it's Alan Taylor or what, but his Terminator film was just as generic and dull as this felt for a good long while.Mildly enjoyable in the end, but a forgettable entry in the grand scheme of things.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It retains the things that I liked about the first installment without repeating them. The plot moves fast and it's intense. Things never gets too grim and has a genuine sense of adventure and awe. Dry witty humor is used again effectively to balance out the ridiculousness of Norse gods walking amongst humans. The fights look tough and grueling, more so than in The Avengers. Partly because everybody's physically melee fighting and the Dark Elves are actually physically challenging to Thor and the Asgardians.The Nine Realms are explored more thoroughly and the audience gets to spend more time on Asgard, which is a much more interesting place to be than Earth. The designs and world creation are impressive, particularly in the disaster sequences. It shows how brilliant an idea it was in the first film to imply that magic is unexplainable science, thereby combining and justifying both.Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor with his presence. Thor is a character whose depths are only shown when interacting with other characters, which is that served as a disadvantage in The Avengers. In his own movie, there's an immense cast to give him that depth. I liked his arc in this story. Natalie Portman gets to be the fish out of water this time around and it's an entertaining reversal.Tom Hiddleston again oozes charm as Loki. It's a great actor relishing a great part. He plays the audience like an instrument as we intermittently love and hate him. The writers put a lot of work in designing the twists and turns in Loki's infinite mind games, truly earning the character the title of ""God of Mischief"". Loki fooled me again and again throughout and I kept wanting to trust him.The Warriors Three gets wrecked a bit. It seemed like there was some scheduling problem in which Tabanobu Asano's Hogun had to be reduced. Also, I prefer the Joshua Dallas as Fandral, who had to be replaced by Zachary Levi from Chuck. Levi by comparison seems to struggle channeling Errol Flynn. Both cases are unfortunate.The new villain Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston is buried under a lot of Dark Elf make-up and speaking an alien language in his own scenes, which removes any chance of proper scenery chewing. His presence as a villain is ultimately functional on par with Hugo Weaving's Red Skull. Malekith exists for the main characters to grow and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it is noteworthy. Marvel seems to be ensuring that their villains never are more interesting than their heroes. The heart of the story is still the central relationship between Thor and Loki. In fact, it's probably the most interesting relationship in the current Marvel cinematic universe. Director Alan Taylor knows this and competently moves their story forward.The numerous Stan Lee cameos is starting to get creepy because it means there are a growing amount of Stan Lee lookalike clones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And is it me or has Anthony Hopkins been playing the majority of his roles like a Norse god all this time? I am just kidding.Depending where Captain America: Winter Soldier goes with Captain America's story, I wonder how many more solo movies Marvel actually needs to plan out. It doesn't look like they're planning any solo Hulk films and Iron Man seems to be up in the air right now. Who knows how Guardians of the Galaxy is going to turn out.

"8","/10","The Dark World finally marks the establishment of Thor as a true hero, facing an imminent threat in a darker context, without leaving aside the humor","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5521359/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","2 March 2020","While Iron Man 3 started the second phase of Marvel, with Tony having to deal with the consequences of the New York battle here on Earth and still having to face the scientist Aldrich Killian and the Extremis technology, it is time to see the god of Thunder having to deal with events after the first meeting of the Avengers. In this sequence, without having to worry about introducing the main characters, director Alan Taylor has the chance to go deeper and explore several aspects. The script continues to explore the relationship between the brothers Thor and Loki, since when Thor hands over Loki to become a prisoner in Asgard and especially when Thor is forced to convince Loki to ally himself to avenge his mother and save the universe from the threat of Malekith. The provocations, the anger, the rivalry, the lack of confidence and the action carried out by the brothers moves the film in several crucial moments.Other characters have more space, specifically in the core of London, such as Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård). Another one with greater prominence is Frigga (Rene Russo), wife of Odin and mother of Thor, with a much bigger participation and with extreme importance for the unfolding of the plot, we even see its potential using a sword. Even Odin (Anthony Hopkins) also plays a major role. Natalie Portman has a fundamental role in the plot. The actress manages to do well in humorous scenes and finally reunites with Thor, whom she had been waiting for two years. Jane Foster has the chance to go to Asgard, meet the beloved's parents and be the key to a great threat to the universe. Chris Hemsworth, even more at ease in the character, concludes Thor's maturation, from inconsequential to hero (it is noted in the lines of his final scene). Meanwhile, Tom Hiddleston is flawless again in Loki's shoes.Even more at ease, sarcastic, unpredictable and probably the biggest highlight of the feature, taking a little of the highlight including the antagonist Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, just correct in the character. Once again the Asgardian warriors were misused, especially Sif (Jaimie Alexander). A mention was even made of the love triangle between her, Jane and Thor, but this sub-plot was simply left out.Other characters have more space, specifically in the core of London, such as Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård). Another one with greater prominence is Frigga (Rene Russo), wife of Odin and mother of Thor, with a much bigger participation and with extreme importance for the unfolding of the plot, we even see its potential using a sword. Even Odin (Anthony Hopkins) also plays a major role. Natalie Portman has a fundamental role in the plot.Well-designed action scenes. All the scenes that show the convergence between the galaxies through portals are well elaborated, in addition to great action scenes, such as the invasion of the Black Elves in their spaceships in Asgard that originated great sequences with the escape of Thor, Loki, Jane and his allies, thus disobeying Odin's express order. We also have the action sequences in the Dark World and even the final scenes in London (Greenwich) when the alignment of the universes was about to occur.On the technical side, production designer Charles Wood and photographer Kramer Morgenthau also did a great job, especially in rebuilding Asgard. Previously shown as a technological society, with a clean and futuristic design, but very artificial, being built almost entirely in computer graphics, it has modifications, especially in scenes with more closed plans. With a bigger budget in hand, the team can portray Asgard being a little more realistic, more medieval and more ""dirty"" in his look, giving the kingdom a more realistic look, giving the impression that people really live there. Even due to the threat presented, other kingdoms can be seen, unlike the first film. In addition to Asgard and Midgard (Earth), we see the dark world of Svartalfheim, the original home of the Black Elves, Vanaheim (home of the Hogun family, lived by Tadanobu Asano), and yet Jotunheim (home of the first giant ice giants) and others from the Nine Realms.Thor: The Dark World finally marks the establishment of Thor as a true hero, facing an imminent threat in a darker context, within the most magical and fantastical universe of the character, without leaving aside the humor, a hallmark of Marvel's productions . And there is an important post-credit scene for future Marvel films, with a character present in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" universe, which promises to be one of the most electrifying films to come.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If I were to sum up this movie in one word, it would be ""underwhelming"".The plot of the movie feels like a rehash of what we've already seen in the first Thor movie - Thor needs to save the world (or in this case, the universe) from a powerful enemy who threatens to destroy everything. The theme of family dynamics and loyalty is touched upon, but it doesn't really add anything new to the story. The movie tries to be epic, but it just ends up feeling tired and uninspired.The acting is fine, with Chris Hemsworth doing his best to carry the movie as Thor, but even he can't save it from its lackluster script. The supporting cast, including Natalie Portman and Tom Hiddleston, are also wasted in their roles. The characters are mostly forgettable, with the villain Malekith being particularly disappointing. He's supposed to be this menacing and powerful threat, but he just comes across as a generic bad guy with no real motivation.The pace of the movie is sluggish, with long stretches of exposition and action scenes that fail to engage. The dialog is clunky and full of exposition dumps, making it feel like the movie doesn't trust its audience to follow along.So, why would I rate this movie 5 out of 10? Well, it's not a complete disaster. The special effects are impressive, and there are a few moments that manage to be genuinely entertaining. But overall, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a lackluster and forgettable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's not terrible, but it's far from great. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might get some enjoyment out of it, but for everyone else, there are much better superhero movies out there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Many people consider this film the worst MCU flick, but honestly I just feel it's rather average. Due to being pressed for time and bad reception in independent groupings, Marvel struggled to make the release date for this film with its fast paced editing- and I feel oddly enough thats the films biggest downfall. It isn't a bad film in the slightest, but the editing throughout feels a bit rushed and the monotonous tone it gives throughout just gives the film a rather bland vibe. It could have easily been a strongly toned film, with its nightmarish dark imagery throughout, but it feels like Disney wasn't able to compile the film in the best way in time for it to reach the potential it had. That being said, I enjoyed the film for what it was. It was interesting to watch, and it takes its story very seriously, of which I found to be interesting- despite it being a much slower pace than the first. The acting is very well done, and the look of the film is incredible. Between the imagery, set design, and costumes- you will effortlessly be impressed by all the style of this film alone- which is brilliantly conceived. In the end, it's the editing that weighs this film down as a whole, making it glimmer instead of purely shining like it could have. It's far from bad, but it could have easily been a lot more, given some extra time and money.My Rating: 7.8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I spent the whole runtime waiting for some real excitement. In the end, I feel like I wasted my time. Sure, there are much worse movies I could've watched, but this was just boring. Plot - The first Thor movie suffered from being extremely rushed, this one suffers from being too slow. Most of the scenes could've been trimmed down or removed. This movie goes on far too long. The plot is dumb and there are many elements that could've been explained if this movie wanted to be more entertaining. Overall, this whole movie is formulaic and overlong. Characters - None of the characters are very interesting other than maybe Thor and Loki. All the acting is good, but the dialogue and the character actions aren't that great. A lot of the characters are actually pretty dumb, and many are severely underdeveloped, making the long runtime even worse. Effects - Most of the visual effects are convincing and very well done. The cinematography is pretty good - nothing fantastic. Sound Design - I don't think that this movie has any music. Maybe one or two scenes - but for the most part the only sounds are those of the characters talking, and whatever is happening in the scene. There's nothing wrong with this, but I just wanted to point it out. It also might have something to do with how boring this movie is. There are a lot of dull fight scenes that could've benefited from some dramatic music. Fight Scenes - The fight scenes may be well-choreographed, but they're boring.Logic - This movie is full of continuity errors and unexplained devices. It just makes the film that much more unwatchable.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

There was a lot of ""Star Wars"" kinda stuff, but Asgard has usually been described as having technology and medicine beyond our own, so it wasn't hokey. The only thing that I felt was hokey was the after-credits epilogue with The Collector, and considering a high percentage of Marvel movie fans aren't comics readers, it didn't upset most people. For the first time in the new wave of Marvel films it seemed like a cheaply thrown together scene, like a fan-made Star Trek parody, but when you consider how freaking insane the idea of The Collector is in comic book form, this was about as ""real"" as they could make it. And I believe the director admitted it was a last-minute shoot to get that in before next year's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", so while not being impressed, I was not surprised. Overall, highly recommended.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first Thor (2011) contained darker and serious themes concerning father son relationship, betrayal and in some places was painfully slow to watch. But this time, its gun blazing from the first scene and the pace remained consistent till the end credits !The best part of the film is that the writers/directors avoided the mistakes which they usually do while making a sequel to a hit movie.They tend to make story lines nostalgic and repeated, put in huge amounts of cash (which is not bad though :P) and try so hard in making the sequel perfect that the movie becomes bland and losses all its sheen in the process. One classic example is Speed -2. But thats not the case in Thor 2013. Storyline is kept basic but still entertaining, dialogs bit clichéd but not cheesy and action scenes were better and bigger but not confusing and complex (a la Transformers where you can't even track who is getting thrashed by whom!).All the major characters returned from the first film and each one performed up to expectations, Thor is more sleek, Jane is more charming, Erik more mad... but to me, the real star of the movie is Loki ! he somehow makes a scene more fun and engaging. Loki has risen in stature this time, especially after the events in New York. Everybody knows that he is shrewd and opportunistic but now he somehow gains a mystical respect which nobody shows but everybody feels for him, even the audience !This time, Thor has to not only save Asgard or Earth but the whole universe and the only person who can help him in his fight against the dark forces is Loki himself. The dynamics of brotherly love are evident between them but they still are enemies and this weird equation creates an exciting chemistry between the two.Watch this movie to see why sometimes saving universe can be fun !","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I recommend to see that movie.I also loved the avengers because there were all the heroes in the same movie. My favorite avengers are Iron man and obviously Thor, my favorite hero is Batman and my favorite super-hero is Superman because of their powers and their stories. I love action, science fiction and adventure movies. I'm happy because the Thor's movie success is huge. I would like to see more movies about Thor or any comics hero. Thor is amazing!

The first Thor movie was fine but now the second one is just for the money. I mean it's a marvel movie people will always go even though it might be terrible, they just want to see it because it's a marvel movie. There was not much action in the movie but when there's a fight scene it will be is full of special effects and spectacular so that kids love it. Also Loki is back in the plot, I personally think it's time to let the character go, he's always in the movie as a bad guy but they still trust him and they think he's going to be good again. The movie was just written to make money; it had very little to do with the previous films. It's becoming more of a series, it's just another episode; something changes between Loki and Thor and then they (or only Thor) kill or capture a bad guy. I also think they're completely missing the point, the whole universe is at risk but it's more important that Jane is fine then the whole universe being wiped out. The universe being at risk wasn't really important although I thought that was meant to be the point. For Thor what's so fun about a movie when the lead character is invincible and kills the bad guy in less than a minute. There's a whole movie about the wellbeing of one person who will eventually die and the lead character will still have to live a long time after she passes, but the one thing the movie: the risk of the destruction of the universe is a side-issue.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This time the filmmakers didn't fear going all the way with the fantasy aspect of Thor and that paid off big time. The production design of Asgard is spectacular. Alan Taylor is a better fit the Kenneth who could handle the Shakespearean part of Thor but i thought he was lacking in the action department, and what's with all those dutch angles!!! Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor and after seeing him in Rush I think that he is not just a movie-star but also a good actor with potentials to be great. As for the other actors, Tom Hiddleston as Loki shines in every scene that he is in, showing amazing emotional depth, especially after one of the movie's many twist. The rest of the cast are well suited for there roles and Kat Dennings is still annoying but cute. The bad guy is somewhat weak in my opinion especially if you consider the fact that he followed Loki as the main villain. In conclusion the movie is very good with amazing action and some genuinely funny moments...and speaking of funny prepare your self for one amazing cameo by an avenger. 8/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Slower than its predecessor and the darker tone adopted won't be to all tastes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5630807/?ref_=tt_urv","jimbo-53-186511","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26154754/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2020","Thousands of years ago The Dark Elves attempted to take control of the nine realms and plunge everything into darkness by using a deadly weapon known as Aether. Their attempts were unsuccessful as they were thwarted by the Asgard soldiers who were headed up by Odin's grandfather. In the present day, the dark elves are able to track down the Aether which has been embodied in scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who is acting as its human host. With the dark elves closing in Thor finds himself called in to action once again not only to save Jane, but also to save the nine realms from the dark elves..Replicating the quality of the first film was always going to be difficult as Kenneth Branagh (who was the surprise director of the first film) brought about pretty much every quality that one would come to expect in a superhero film. I did expect a slight drop in quality with this sequel truth be told, but Thor: The Dark World, sadly, for me, represented more than a slight drop in quality I'm afraid...There are 2 major problems with this film; the first problem is that it is comparatively slower paced than the first film (which is odd because both films are roughly the same length). It does take its time to get going and even when it does it just isn't as involving as the narrative in the first film - Thor being banished from Asgard and forced to live on Midgard (or Earth as its otherwise known) made for a much more humourous and endearing scenario which sadly isn't replicated in this film. The 'supposed' comic relief character here comes is Ian - a nerdy intern guy, but through a combination of poor acting and woeful dialogue he fails to be funny or make any positive impact on the film. The second problem lies with the darker tone which takes away all of the cheekiness that we saw in the first film; Thor had loads of good lines in the first film, but here he is only treated to the odd humourous line and most of the time these funny lines involve scenes with Loki. The darker tone would have worked better if the villains of the piece were developed better, but they are not making the film feel a little hollow at its centre.The performances from the main players very much reflect the material in comparison to the first film; toned down and not quite as good. Hemsworth was brilliant in the first film, but mostly because he was served better in that film. In this film, he mostly comes off as being stiff and uncomfortable. Skarsgard is crazy for most of the film which wasn't pleasant to watch and this wackiness didn't seem to serve much purpose in the film. Everyone else (performance wise) played out more or less the same as they did in the original film.In summary then director Alan Taylor has made a bit of a mess of this sequel; the darker tone takes away a lot of the things that made the original film work so well and with a padded out story and underdeveloped villains the film never has much of a spark or feeling of urgency about it which the original film had in abundance. I must admit to having a real sense of elation when I got to the end of Thor which I did not have at the end of Thor: The Dark World. This sequel is by no means a bad film, but at the same time it isn't in the same league as the first film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"9","/10","More Thor action this time around","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2932316/?ref_=tt_urv","Aaron1375","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1111192/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2013","I enjoyed the first Thor film more than I was expecting, but I enjoyed this one even more. This is probably due to the fact that Thor had all his godly powers throughout the entire film. In fact, the first film played out a lot like a second superhero film as many times in the sequel to a comic book character the superhero will lose his powers at some point. The second Superman with Christopher Reeves and Spider-man 2 are examples of this. This one simply had Thor with all his powers on display and more scenes in Asgard and a unique Earth setting of London rather than the standard New York that made me enjoy this one more the the previous film and a bit more than the third Ironman released earlier this year.The story has some strange race of beings called the Dark Elves being awoken by a strange event that could spell the end of all realms if the Dark Elves have their way. Thor's love interest Jane Foster, comes into contact with this strange power and is soon the target of Malekith, leader of the Dark Elves. Thor takes Jane to Asgard despite opposition from his father Odin, but this will prove a costly move as the elves invade Asgard. Soon Thor must work with his brother Loki to lure the elves into a trap and save not only Earth and Asgard, but all realms in the universe.Once again the action is great this time and there is a lot more of it. My favorite parts though involved the scenes with Loki and Thor's uneasy alliance. This was interesting and funny at the same time. Anthony Hopkins returns as Odin and does a superb job as he usually does and Jane Foster's friends return in this one too, though with varying degrees of success as both are merely used for comic relief here.So, overall, I enjoyed this sequel more than the first film. I liked the action, Thor and Loki's interactions and the settings and look of the film. There is also sure to be a sequel considering how this one ended. There was an extra scene after a few credits role by, but it seemed so out of place from the rest of the film. I know it is a lead in for the Guardians of the Galaxy film, this is probably due to the fact I am just not really familiar with that particular comic franchise. All in all, it was nice to see a movie as there really was nothing I was really interested in seeing since July. I needed some filler as there may not be another film I want to see until next April! So nice comic action for the end of the year!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think much like the first movie this one makes you want to see more of Asgard and their side of the universe. The dark elves were an impressive enemy and if we saw more of them I think they wouldve caused problems for modern day earth, I mean they essentially infilitrated Asgard and killed so many warriors they couldnt really do anything without the actions of Thors team. Unlike the first movie I think I liked them being in the modern day a little better, though the real reason I like this movie is for the dark elves they provided alot of violence and cool characters. Oh Loki is also one of my favorite marvel characters in general so thats why this movie gets 10/10, I feel like the thor movies are a bit serious for a casual rewatch for me but i still enjoy them.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The storyline was well put together by the director and the whole look and feel of the film is great. All of the actors put in great performances, especially Chris Hemsworth who plays Thor extremely well. The storyline follows on from the previous Thor and The Avengers, which was a great choice by the director, and I'm glad that they showed a different side to Loki. The only downside to the movie is that the director tried to compact so much information into one film, so you really do have to concentrate with what is going on, but that's not to say that it confusing or misguiding. If your a fan of the comics, you won't be disappointed, and if you don't know that much about Thor, you still be entertained and interested in the story that unfolds. Great Movie!Round-Up: I was a bit dubious about the director bringing back Natalie Portman, but once she goes back to Asgard, she reminded me of when she was in Star Wars, playing Princess Leah's mum. Anyway, I really can't see anyone else playing Thor but Chris Hemsworth who adds a certain type of cockiness and wit to the comic book hero. All of the directors are doing well with the Avengers franchise, but I must admit, I am waiting for a Hulk movie after seeing Mark Ruffalo playing the part well. In all, this is a movie that has something for everyone. With amazing action, storyline and humour, this is a movie not to be missed.Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $641millionI recommend this movie to people who are into comic book hero movies and who are fans of the Thor franchise. 8/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The IMDb rating is at a solid 7.2, but the written reviews are mostly panning the movie. And rightfully so. Thor 2 does little to improve from the last entry. While we have better visuals and more Loki, the character, plot devices, and comedic relieve are just as bad, if not worse. If it weren't for the enormous budget, the movie would have blew. I usually give some lenience towards plot devices. You can't let small parts of a movie ruin the entire experience. But crap were they awful here. I've rarely seen a film so contrived, so desperate to use characters that don't belong. But we need to have the brothers team up, and who would our Norse God be without a beautiful woman by his side? The Aether has no rhyme or reason to what it actually does, and the villains were store shelf. But none of the characters had enough time to develop beyond movie clichés.I disliked Kat Dennings in the first one. Now I hate her. She's a complete ditz who has no respect for the impossible events going on. She breaks tense moments with dollar-store lines, devoid of comedic creativity. But we also have some useless intern, and Dr. Erik Selvig. He's turned into ""movie crazy"", a man who acts delusional, but is really a misunderstood genius. Its a stupid and offensive plot point, made by imbeciles who don't know, nor care, about mental health. Thor's Girlfriend (it might as well be her name) still lacks any connection with Thor, and is such a bit player in the story. She's supposed to be a genius scientist, but everything she says is Hollywood gobbledegook. The only strength beyond the production values is Loki. Most of the good moments of the film revolve around him. He has the most personality, and is the only character to develop in any way. But his relationships still need fleshing out. I need more time to buy his love and hate for his family.Are you really that desperate for a time-waster? C'mon. There are better action movies out there. Thor: Dark World will soon be forgotten. I'd never recommend it, but there's worse I suppose.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thor The Dark World takes a new twist as well as following the story line that took place in the Avengers.The film really took the effects to the extreme and the special effects are like watching the comic book come to life on screen really well time and show amazing talent. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard all reprise their roles from the first movie and that's always good to see when you have the same cast return.But the plot for the film when you watch the film you understand why it was called The Dark World. It's good to see them mix humor with the story and they were clever with how to make the comedy, the drama is strong as well as each of the cast brings their best to the screen and of course the action is very well done as you see some of the most extreme fights in film What makes the film work is we get characters development that follows from The Avengers.The music in the film is superb with it helping telling the story of each scene for the film the action in the film is awesome and very well done plus you see how tough these characters are on their own.Again the Special effects are some of the most stunning I have seen in a film, the performance from the cast is a mix but they still deliver on the characters they bring to life and Marvel Fans will appreciate them for doing it.Thor The Dark World is a film that you have to watch it might not be highs of highs but it is still pure entertainment. With amazing special effects strong performances and a thrill ride you'll have a thundering good time I give Thor The Dark World an 8 out of 10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is far more ambitious than the original Thor, with a far more clever script. Tom Hiddleston can always be relied upon for solid villainy; he is appropriately used. Christopher Eccleston is a well known British actor who has impressed me in everything he has done since Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth. The dynamic between Thor and Jane Foster is less interesting than between Thor and Loki. The whole plot about how dark elves are trying to commandeer this protean ""Aether"" to somehow re-immerse the universe into ""dark matter"" probably had actual experts like Sean Carroll rolling their eyes. But who cares? A British stage actor plays a bad guy trying to destroy the universe, while the good guys try and stop him. This is a solid escapist film with lots of good actors having fun, and more than a fair share of witty moments. This film could have probably fallen short with inferior editing. I feel this stands as a legit film independent of the Avengers' juggernaut. Two other fantasy/sci-fi films also, IMHO, which far better then critical reviews were the Hobbit (lots of a abuse: why??) and, surprisingly, Oblivion. I finished this film very pleasantly surprised with how well it worked.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I loved the first Thor, it was methodical, developed the characters and dosed out the power of Thor and his foes in small and very impressive bites. This leaves you with a healthy understanding of just how powerful and dangerous this fictitious world is.This film dispenses with any sort of sense and throws a ton of visual effects at you hoping you'll be blinded enough to overlook the shoddy script. It didn't work :/. The story gives no depth to any characters, and the only saving grace is it didn't really weaken any established characters from the first film. I don't require much in the way of thought provoking content, but give me something. Action for action's sake is played... and so is the Thor title if they don't turn it around.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think that fans of the first Thor will definitely not be disappointed, it's a very enjoyable and action packed movie that answers all the questions from the first that were left unanswered, as well as building on and adding more scope to the world of Asgard. In comparison to some of Marvels previous work, it does take itself a little too seriously. There is comic relief there, but not as much as Iron Man or Captain America, there were times were it was borderline pretentious in just how dramatic it was dealing with the whole situation, when it's suppose to be simple fun. Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and the rest of the cast are back and as good as before. The chemistry Hemsworth shares with his two co-stars on screen is one of the strongest aspects of this film. I also really enjoyed Chris O'Dowd's cameo, one of the funniest parts.It manages to bring in a lot more complicated elements that the Marvel Universe has not previously showcased, making it both understandable and believable. Thor: The Dark World is a must see for all Marvel and Thor fans.When an alien enemy is looking to destroy Earth, Thor is the only one who can put a stop to him, while also rekindling his relationship with Jane. Best Performance: Tom Hiddleston","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I worried for the Marvel Phase 2 as a whole. Thor: The Dark World proved me wrong.Yes, it has its weaknesses. There is a scene where Thor and Loki are walking down the hall; Loki transforms them into a number of different characters. It serves no other purpose then amusing the children - adults will find the scene embarrassingly annoying. When a major character dies, leaving an impact on Thor, Odin and Loki, it felt rushed. And there were too many clues towards the somewhat forced twist at the end, which made the reveal obsolete.Also, it was a little too much of plot convenience that it was Jane who discovered the evil force Macguffin. And Selvig being a little craycray as an aftereffect from the Tessaract makes you wonder how Hawkeye fares these days.Other than that: it was all a great roller coaster ride. Especially the final fight, which was both personal and still had multiple worlds at stake. It also featured really fast paced interdimensional traveling that felt like a more crazy episode of Phineas and Ferb - but due to a good set-up never got you to loose the suspension of disbelief.So, without any (mentionable) spoilers... this is Thor: the Dark World for you. Epic and Awesome...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Before seeing this my wife and I watched Thor 1, thinking it would catch us up, but we both forgot about The Avengers, and looked at each other confused when Loki was brought to Odin in handcuffs. We also both had to think about what the characters meant when they talked about a god taking over Selvig's mind... Basically, the movie gives you zero help in remembering why things are the way they are, so I'd recommend watching Thor and Avengers first before checking this out.I loved the way the movie looked and flowed, but there were a lot of ""well it's a movie"" plot turns, and the plot itself seemed strait out of Start Trek: an alien race is dormant after being conquered and their power source taken away, the power source is found and awakens them, they seek to bring the universe to their status-quo. That being said, the art design was fantastic for the Dark Elves and for Asgard, kudos, and there were some seriously LOL moments that seem to be a trademark for Marvel to keep their movies out of the realism that DC is trying for.It was fun and enjoyable and again Marvels has a winner... but I would stress to the viewer, there is required viewing of at least the Avengers to know what the hell is going on.8 out of 10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","This film suggests Thor can't live without Loki and should really be saved for The Avengers' movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2909565/?ref_=tt_urv","toll-8","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17129003/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2013","Marvel Phase Two is fully underway now with the second instalment of the section coming in the form of Thor: The Dark World. Kenneth Brannagh has vacated the director's seat and Game of Thrones' Alan Taylor has replaced him with the principle cast all returning, including that scene stealing tycoon Tom Hiddleston.This time out Thor must reconcile with the un-too-happy Jane, who is fully aware he graced his presence on Earth during The Avengers (perhaps like the rest of the world she saw it in her local cinema) and enlist the help of brother Loki to stop the evil Maliketh who has threatened to destroy all nine realms of the universe. The plot is utter nonsense, like we expect from superhero films, but it lends itself to what director Taylor does best; epic battle sequences. Compared to its predecessor this is bigger, bolder and badder with Christopher Ecclestone bringing a darker baddie in the evil Lord Maliketh. Despite the obvious lift from the original this does however feel like a weaker movie. The action scenes are meatier (you expect nothing less from Taylor) but the story has given way because of this, something Brannagh was good at. It is as if the Thor series needs a cross between both directors to really bring through a better movie. Perhaps someone like Joss Whedon, I don't think he's too busy at the moment. Instead what we have with this sequel is an emotionless narrative that allows Loki to shine through once again. We can't help but wonder that if the character was omitted from the films that they would cease to be made. Hiddleston's appearance is briefer than previous outings but he still manages to bring the charm and humour that the first one also had. There is also an excellent and somewhat unusual performance, from Stellan Skarsgard who is a much different character to what we remember. He is also charged with bringing through the humour and via these two characters we are given a film that breaks up epic battles with comedic one liners and scenarios. This gives the film a frustratingly noticeable tonal shift throughout which eliminates any emotional impact the film may have had. Around the half way point a potentially emotional scene takes place but the choice of scenes that surround it fail to lead into and out of it. The editing makes it jumpy and there is little room to settle into one tone before jumping into another.In comic books superheroes are faced with a host of villains. Some are noteworthy and some are trash receptacle fodder. Unfortunately Marvel appears to have picked the latter of the two in their choice of Maliketh. His motives are never explored and his involvement adds little to the plot other than to bring Thor and Loki together.The plot is where the film is really let down. By the time the epic climax takes place (a well constructed battle in Greenwich) the story isn't up to speed and there must have been a scene or two cut that would have brought us emotionally to this level. It is all rather rushed with too many stories being nipped in order to gain more Loki. Even encounters with Jane are skimped on but I can't see this as an issue due to her being a highly unlikeable character. The problem with Thor is that without Loki the character has little going for him but with Loki plot strands are under developed or merely Macguffin's to bring Loki into the story. It makes us question as to whether Thor is really a strong enough character to hold his own movie in the way Tony Stark/Iron Man is. For me he isn't.Thor: The Dark World is a disappointment to the Marvel universe. It is probably slightly better than the original film but that was a weak instalment also. The tone throughout both films alters and it is as if no one really knows what to do with the character. There is suggestion a third movie will be on the way but if Loki isn't around it could fall flat on its face and if he is it may feel repetitive. Perhaps it is time for Thor to hang up the hammer until the Avengers come calling.Rating: 2.5 / 5Directing: The battle scenes are awesome but the emotional elements have little impact. Acting: Hemsworth is fine; Portman is flat so it is a good job Hiddleston is still on form.Script: I can't help but think the script has been altered throughout production.Cinematography: The film looks great (Asgaard especially) and the epic final battle is breathtaking.Score: Adds to the battle sequences.Editing: At times it is far too pacy and doesn't allow the quieter moments to sink in. Overall: Not one of Marvel's finest and raises the question of Thor's ability to carry an entire movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thor isn't my favorite character from the Marvel universe, as I feel Captain America and Iron Man have better character arches, but Thor does have his moments. This film retained the well-liked humor from the first film and added more set pieces to the film to its advantage. The special effects are great and we are still treated to the visual beauty of Asgard. The only part of the film I felt was weak was the forced romance between Thor and Jane. But luckily for the rating, I didn't care too much.Alan Taylor, taking over from Kenneth Branagh in the director's chair, directs a film regarding Thor in the aftermath of New York. In this particular film, Thor must team up with his brother and nemesis Loki to stop the Dark Elves who are led by the malicious Malekith from plunging the world into darkness and once again saving Earth and the Nine Realms.Like many Marvel films, the film has an incredible array of actors and actresses working on the film. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is mighty as ever. Tom Hiddleston provides some of the best humor with his witty dialogue as Loki. Natalie Portman is okay as Jane, but I felt her romance with Thor was forced and unrealistic. Stellan Skarsgaard makes a welcome return and my favorite scene involves him at Stonehenge acting quite weird. Christopher Eccleston actually makes for a solid villain. Finally, we get some brief, but effective supporting turns from Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, and Rene Russo.Overall, the Thor sequel pushes up the stakes even more as Thor and Loki must try to the save the universe yet again. I loved the humor, willingly provided by Loki. I also loved how the film is action-packed without sacrificing anything for the story. Towards the end, we have a great action scene involving the travel between many worlds, so that was quite fascinating to watch. The visual effects are also impressive as well. This is an incredible sequel, about on par with the first film. There are also several scenes to keep an eye out for in the post-credits. I rate this film 9/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Enjoyable! But Not as Good as Its Predecessor","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3224613/?ref_=tt_urv","caseynicholson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29348863/?ref_=tt_urv","22 April 2015","Let me begin by saying that I'm writing this review as part of my Marvel Cinematic Universe review series as I'm watching all ten of the MCU films in preparation for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" which is set to come out in a couple of weeks. That being the case, I was excited to watch ""Thor: The Dark World"" because of the fact that my memory of this movie was that I enjoyed it a lot more than I did the original ""Thor"" movie based on my experience of seeing each of the films in theaters upon their original release. When I watched the first ""Thor"" for this review series, I found that it had really grown on me. So ""The Dark World"" surely would grow on me too, right?Sadly, I found that the second installment in the Thunder God's franchise was not as much of an improvement over its origin story as I recalled. Whereas the first ""Thor"" gained ground in my estimation, ""The Dark World"" came across a bit weaker than when I saw it in the theater.Before moving on, let me quickly say that I nevertheless do like the film, and find it to be a strong movie overall. You'll see that I've given it 8/10 stars. I had given the first ""Thor"" 9/10 in this review series, so ""The Dark World"" is just barely less enjoyable based on those rankings.That said, Thor 2 has its ups and downs. On the positive side of things, I really enjoyed the basic plot of this movie. We get to see Thor going back and forth between Asgard and Earth, just as we did in the first film. The relationship between Thor and Jane Foster is developed, Loki, Odin and the other Asgardians play crucial roles, and the time spent on Earth is much better used than in the first film. I found the Earth scenes in the first film to be a bit contrived, and almost came across as sort of an archetype of the standard ""extra-terrestrials come to Earth and causes havoc"" type of storyline. In Thor 2, the Earth scenes are much more developed, with the film's final Earth battle proving to be a robust climax of the film.Where the film suffers, however, is its poor character development for its main antagonists. This stands out since said characters play such a critical part in the film, and also because they are basically the only significant new character additions in the film at all, as most of the characters have been carried over from the first movie. As such, it's easy to keep up with Thor, Jane, Loki, Odin, etc. But the villains have very little back story, and very little in terms of developing their characters as the plot moves along. None of this is to say that you won't be able to keep up or follow the storyline--it's simply to say that the storyline will seem a bit trivial because the villains are at one and the same time underdeveloped and yet also portrayed to be egregiously evil. That kind of lack of character development makes the story seem a bit hollow, in spite of the fact that it's nevertheless a strong plot overall.All that said, I would again give the film 8/10 stars. This is another strong showing for the MCU, and a great film that is fun for anyone who is into the comic book genre of movies. It's also significant in that it foreshadows the already announced ""Infinity War"" direction that the MCU is headed in by showcasing one of the Infinity Stones, the Aether as a major part of the storyline. In summary, ""The Dark World"" falls short of perfection, but it's nevertheless fun and entertaining overall, and significant in the larger narrative of the MCU.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Heroic and virtuous like the great Thor. Things progress thanks to Loki's inordinate greed and the evil plans of the usual villains.

First of all, Tom Hiddleston IS an amazing actor. Second, Loki himself is three-dimensional, unpredictable, and advanced character, and I am so intrigued because he is so DIFFERENT from other Marvel villains.

I loved it's fun mix of fantasy and real world adventure and thought Hemsworth made a noble and very likable hero. And now the Norse God turned superhero is back in his second solo adventure and a welcome return it is. Thor: The Dark World opens 5000 years earlier with an alignment of the planets being taken advantage of by the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) to unleash a weapon called The Aether which will convert all the worlds into dark matter where only the Dark Elves may exist. Thor's grandfather Bor (Tony Curran) defeats the invaders and they are assumed destroyed and The Aether is hidden away never to be found... or so Bor hoped. But, in the present, the worlds are aligning again and the long dormant Malekith and the remaining Dark Elves seek to destroy all once more and, as fate would have it, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) stumbles upon the hidden weapon and it is absorbed within her. Now hunted by Malekith, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) brings Jane to Asgard against Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) wishes and must somehow find a way to stop Malekith, banish The Aether and save the woman he loves and all the known worlds... and the only one who can help him is his devious step brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) imprisoned in Asgard's dungeons by Thor's own hand. This second solo adventure is this time directed by Game Of Thrones and Deadwood director Alan Taylor who creates a much grittier and down to Earth version of Asgard then the bright and magic kingdom-ish version we saw in the delightful first feature directed by Kenneth Branagh. It's still recognizable as Asgard and it blends perfectly with the first Thor but, we get to see far deeper into the city and into it's halls and pubs and get a more lived in and functional look at Thor's homeland. The tone of the film is also darker at times and that was a nice change from the upbeat first film and Avengers but, so not to get too dark or grim, the film is punctuated with a lot of fun and humorous sequences especially those involving Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), the latter's trip to Stonehenge being especially hilarious. I thought the humor and the darker story elements were blended just fine and there was plenty of action and strong drama throughout till the big free-for-all ending set in London where Thor and Malekith finally get to throw down. And the action and special effects do not disappoint, they are top notch as all the previous Marvel films. The budget is on screen in all aspects from sets to costumes to FX. Taylor gets good work from all the cast. There are some nice character moments in between the drama and destruction and all the actors are now very comfortable in their roles and work very well together. Hemsworth is once again a noble hero who has grow since his first visit and the battle in New York. He and Portman still have a nice chemistry together and I liked their scenes especially when Thor has to explain where he's been for two years. Dennings gets a bit more screen time and handles it well getting some of the bigger laughs and Hiddleston is once again scene stealing as Loki. It was also nice to see Rene Russo get a big scene and have a bit bigger part this time and Hopkins is still endearing as the weary but, majestic Odin. We also get some nice scenes with supporting characters Heimdall (Idris Elba), Sith (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (now Zachary Levi) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) but, those expecting expanded roles from this bunch will be disappointed. Newcomer to Thor's world Christopher Ecceleston, is OK as villain Malekith but, he really doesn't make a strong impression or stay with you after the film is over. To me his somewhat tepid villain is the film's only real stand out weak point. Taylor's interpretation of Don Payne and Robert Rodat's script is highlighted by a moody score by Brian May and some nice cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau. Overall, Thor: The Dark World is a very entertaining follow-up that gives us enough of the action, drama and suspense we are looking for and takes it in enough of a different direction to keep it fresh but, not straying too far to alienate us. It's not perfect, as stated the villain could have been stronger, there are a few slows spots here and there especially in the first half and earlier on we can tell there was a bit of editing to manage the running time but, for all the entertainment we get, those minor flaws can be overlooked. A fun and worthy sequel to both Thor and The Avengers and certainly less schizophrenic then the mixed bag that was Iron Man 3. As with all Marvel films stay through the entire credits for not one but, two additional sequences and keep an eye out for a couple of really fun cameos. Another solid bit of entertainment from Marvel and Disney.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This was an improvement from Thor 1 in almost every way. The story was your typical Superhero story but it was executed properly which made for a great viewing. The Marvel humor is also present thoroughly in this movie. They timed it rightly and it even made me laugh out loud during some moments. There were also nods to the Avengers universe here and there, which makes these movies all the more fun as it is all connected and what not. Marvel has certainly hit a Jackpot ever since they decided to do this from 2008.Almost all the cast from Thor 1 was back, which was good too see. Chris Hemsworth delivered a great performance as Thor yet again. His character development is good and you can see how much he has changed since Thor 1. BUT I'll have to say, the star of the show is LOKI. He just nails it every time he is on screen. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is probably one of the best casting decision ever. He is one of my favourite character of this Marvel Avengers universe. And the WTF/Awesome ending of this movie just made the wait to see him again a lot harder. The side characters are good too, whether it is for comic relief or other stuff. Mainly Darcy, she is funny and its good they kept her. The action sequences were really good and very entertaining. The CGI was nice and much improved from Thor 1. There was a lot more action too this time, and rightly paced too, which made the movie an entertaining experience through and through. As it is common with Marvel movies, be sure to check out the two after credits scene. I can't wait for Captain America: The winter soldier now. Must watch for any fan of the Marvel movies. 8.2/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I prefer to believe that Yorst hindered the work of Markus and McFeely, because they have a well known comic story to adapt and write the screenplay, but they delivered a story without context, development and sense of logic.
The acting was good, but the construction of the characters over the movie didn't make it possible to understand what was the meaning of that acting. With reservation for the performance of Tom Hiddleston, Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins that could get up a little bit of political critique, Marvel-standard and strength to the movie.
Alan Taylor is capable of conduct a plot and make some good material of it (as we could see in GoT over the years). So, we can not point fingers if the movie is a failed of screenplay or direction, but the cinematographic environment couldn't be created by the constant breaking of sequences and missing/weak spots.

Natalie Portman is back as Thor's earthly romantic interest, Jane Foster, which necessitates a slightly awkward part-explanation, part-avoidance of why Thor seemed to forget she existed during the events depicted in ""The Avengers,"" in which Jane did not appear. Coming up with a compelling story that is about 70% a continuation of ""Thor"" and 30% a continuation of ""The Avengers"" and fits into the larger, on-going MCU story line that is supposed to culminate somewhere down the road paved with Infinity Stones is a tall order, and the multiple writers don't quite pull it off. Neither, however, do they completely fumble, and Alan Taylor's serviceable direction as well as a solid cast most of whom we're familiar with do a good job of smoothing over the rough spots as much as possible. The cast is really the best feature -- Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are by now so comfortable with each other that it is easier that ever to believe these two were raised as brothers, it's good to see Portman again and Kat Dennings as Jane's sister is more of an asset to the story (and slightly less annoying) than she was in ""Thor,"" Rene Russo as Thor's mother gets more to do, and there are a few pleasant if minor additions to the human side of the story, including Jonathan Howard and Chris O'Dowd.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't spend as much time exploiting these strengths as it does on yet more universe-threatening, lazily conceived super-villains, the Dark Elves, and on fake science and fake legend about astronomical convergence. ""Iron Man 3,"" the first film in the MCU to follow ""The Avengers"" and the one immediately preceding this, played it smart and didn't pretend the universe was at stake, for the obvious reason that such monumental stakes would call for the involvement of all Avengers. This film is not so smart. Despite the high stakes, the film really doesn't go very far afield. After the globe-trotting qualities of the most of the MCU, this one feels studio-bound and more reliant than ever on computers to create any sense of scale.The fun thing about Thor as originally conceived was the supposition that what most people regard as Norse mythology was, in fact, based on powerful aliens whom the primitive humans would have perceived as gods. The first film got that; this film, rather than explore that motif in more depth or even play with it, opts instead for mumbo- jumbo about gravitational anomalies that helped ancient peoples build temples and what-not. It's meaningless drivel and a little insulting, both to ancient civilizations and audiences' intelligence. I'm all for suspending disbelief, but give us something worth suspending it for, not a grammar-school rehash of ""Chariots of the Gods.""This is still better than ""Iron Man 2"" and not really appreciably worse than ""The Incredible Hulk,"" which was more coherent but duller. It is, however, the first in the series that makes me wonder whether Marvel can really pull off its ambitious enterprise as consistently as it hopes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The villain is complete garbage as well, without any personality or depth. The finale is tensionless and you don't really feel anxious about the outcome what-so-ever. I'm also still somewhat annoyed at the portrayal of norse mythologi. The only thing saving this movie from being a disaster is Loki, who actually entertained me, and he worked way better as a side character than a main antagonist.

The first film had an amusing backstory for the main character. This installment is weighed down by an over-explanation of a convoluted plot. Some action scenes prove too fast for the viewer to enjoy or even appreciate, for the splendorous CGI worlds that the production's visual artists went to so much trouble imagining and realising were lost to choppily edited scenes of fighting. The main problem is a lack of tension in the story. Thor is not vulnerable enough for the audience to believe that he is not going to win the day. His character lacks dimension or even just nuance when he's expected to carry the whole film without much new backstory extended to him; it drags. That said, Tom Hiddleston, in wide-eyed mania, gave us an interesting villain with perfectly pronounced threats and a trace of unsettling sibilance. Altogether, it is an overwrought production-pounding music, incessant battle scenes, spacecraft kinetics-all to force audience distraction from its modest script.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thor was a thoroughly enjoyable comic book adaptation. Now, Thor: The Dark World has just been released and while it maintains some awesome action sequences and some humor to keep it going, it does lack some of the emotion that made its predecessor so good. Not by any means is Thor: The Dark World a bad film, quite the contrary, it is a very well made film and features some of the coolest action sequences we've seen in 2013. However, this sequel seems to dwell on the coattails of the original and never seems to fully stand on its own two legs. Featuring one awesome performance from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the rest of actors seem to fall beneath him and end up being lackluster compared to him. Chris Hemsworth does what he can with the role but there isn't too much more that he could do with the character of Thor that he didn't do in the original, so therefore, I can't fully put him at fault. The rest of the cast ends up being an afterthought when the end credits roll. The biggest failure of Thor: The Dark World is that it tries to best the original by adding more action and less story (something that sequels are infamous for). Now, while the action sequences are undeniably cool and entertaining, there isn't much more to it. The threat doesn't feel real in this outing and that brings the film down from where it could have been. With that being said, the bright side is that the action sequences are so well done and Hiddleston is outstanding as Loki, I can't fully disregard this film. As for the holiday season coming along, Thor: The Dark World is an awesome outing to take the family to. Other than that, it is pure eye candy and there isn't anything wrong with that.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I remember going through the whole Greek mythology in grade school and never could get into it. The other turn-off is the focus on yucking it up with the younger characters. Leave the goofy relationship material to television shows. Then there is the decision to turn the great Stellan Skarsgard (I remember him back in ""Hunt For Red October"") into a humiliating clown character. As an audience member, I was embarrassed for such a high brow film to stoop to such broad comedy gags.There is considerable amount of time spent on other planets to setup all the rivalries and bad guys. The film lacks any punch, as it goes through the confrontations, it all plays out like an extended stage opera. The characters are in their grandiose outfits making grandiose pronouncements. All against large backdrops (yes you can tell it's all CGI). Anthony Hopkins is getting on in his age and his performance lacks fire. Tom Hiddleston, the great baddie from The Avengers, is literally sitting on the sidelines for the whole film.About an hour into watching it on DVD for the second time (the first time I saw it in the theatre I fell asleep three times), I realised the main problem with this movie is the sappy music. The soundtrack is the most boring generic underscoring I have heard in a long time. The music lacks any stingers to grab the audience, no depth in it's arrangements. It is amazing how just one aspect of a film can help kill it. Even when things pick up in the third act as London is ground zero for the big alien invasion. The production values are definitely there (although the 170 million price tag seems a bit much). The direction and editing is also just there, no flare or real energy in the story's momentum.Even though it clocks in at 1 hour 52 minutes, I swear it felt over two hours. I would still recommend this minor installment in the Marvel family of films, but not if you're sleepy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thor getting on to London subways, the little conversations between characters like Darcy and Thor, Thor's nonchalantness after taking down a giant rock monster (""Anyone else?"") and the fact that the second half is essentially a buddy road trip movie between brother's who essentially hate each other. The best scene of the movie might just be the wake that the Asgardian's hold for fallen royalty. Between the sombre tone, the choreography and the grand light bearing cinematography, you get That is exactly how I would imagine this society sending off a royal figure.Unfortunately, for the most part, the movie is not really concerned with these moments. The movie has a lot of plot, and it thought the best solution for that would be to go straight through that plot like a bullet. This might be a symptom of this movie's troubled production (would not be the first for Marvel). This was originally meant to be directed by Patty Jenkins, but for reasons I don't think have been fully explored quit or was fired, leaving the project for Game of Thrones Alan Taylor director to complete. With the appreciated focus on fantastic settings and action sequences, this is certainly a smart choice (though I do miss the brightness of Kenneth Branagh's setting). When Jane says something to the effect of a device completely changing the laws of physics, it's essentially a wink to say that the action is about to get wacky. And thankfully it fulfils that promise, nabbing from video games like Portal in the best possible way.But in getting to that point the movie spits through a lot of its building blocks. Without comic knowledge I wouldn't really know what the aether was, and hints of B-plots (like a love triangle between Sif, Thor and Jane) are left on the cutting room floor. Within two minutes the movie goes from Thor and Jane having seen each other for the first time in two years to them both being in Asgard trying to get a alien power source out of her body. There's a bit missing in between those two pieces where the two just sit and around and talk. The Dark World is missing those parts of movies that we think are superfluous, but in reality add to mood, pacing and character.And the story's weird pacing becomes more of an issue when the new characters are so ill-defined or wasted. There are small things, like the fact that Selvig turns from a minor comic character in Thor and a tragic figure in The Avengers to an over the top, naked clown here. Stellan Skarsgård's performance almost makes it work, but then you remember that they only get rid of him in the first half of the plot so he can turn up for convenience sake in the second half. Also *SPOILER* whilst the second half after the death of Thor's mother shows the correct level of grim pathos for a movie called The Dark World, the first half forgets to make us care.Then there is the movie's most notable problem, one it keeps repeating but is exacerbated most here, is the movie's villain. Why spend so much time with a prologue on the Dark Elves if you are going to waste Christopher Eccleston and make Malekith so unmemorable a villain? In fact, Malekith is such a generic villain, with lack of clear motivation and no characterising beyond ""bad"", that that he has ironically become ""memorable"" again as the default example of Marvel's Villain problem (on television guys like Kingpin and Kilgrave have solved this problem). Thankfully the movie's second villain, Loki, again elevates some of the material by Tom Hiddleston's charm and the charm between his and Chris Hemsworth alone. In fact, a movie that is just those two and their relationship would have probably been among the highest of Marvel's properties. As it stands, it's a highlight amidst an otherwise mediocre film.Thor: The Dark World might not be the worst Marvel film, but it is certainly the most forgettable. At the time it seemed to demonstrate that the second film in a Marvel solo series would always be the worst. Thankfully, the next Marvel film would shatter that conception","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thus Thor must save her and the rest of the world from dark elves who seek to use the darkness to destroy the universe. The stakes are supposedly higher, but it never feels that way. Even in the final fight then it never feels like Thor is ever in any real peril. The dark elves just never appear as that much of a challenge in the film. Not only do they not pose a threat but they never appear as interesting characters either, even the leader of the Dark Elves Malketh doesn't get much attention. Whilst Ecclestons performance is impressive and the makeup design is interesting, the villain doesn't get any background. Malekth's sole motivation in the film is to destroy the universe. Why? Because he is evil! At least that's all we really get from him. Largely because the dark elves don't get that much screen time. More time seems to get put towards bringing back the fan favourite Loki to the film.This could be good if he were written in properly. But the problem is that he isn't. Loki was only written in after the success of the Avengers and doesn't really have any role to play. They try to justify his inclusion in the plot at times, but the truth is he is there for fan appeal alone. He's the kind of character who you could remove all of his scenes from the film and you'd still get a complete story regardless. Saying this, Loki does still have many enjoyable moments. He still has the same memorable wit people loved from the Avengers and Hiddelston does have quite a few scene stealing moments. Thor is still an enjoyable hero in this one. Though his story isn't as interesting. In the first we got to see his transition from a reckless soldier to a noble warrior to gain the worthiness of his hammer Monjir. But here he doesn't really progress at all. But for what he has to work with Hemsworth gives a good performance once again as the Norse god of thunder. His presence alone is one of great power and his delivery does make for some hilarious moments. On the downside many of the action scenes in the film are pretty forgettable. Largely because most of them don't feel particularly well choreographed. Most of the earlier fight scenes try to look like a big epic battle scene, but they never really feel that way. They'll always be in some interesting backdrops ranging from fantasy cities like Asgard to the populated city of London. But they will usually lack any real sense of excitement that we expect from the Marvel universe. Luckily the final fight does make up for this with a fight between Malketh and Thor stretching across several worlds. It makes little sense with the teleporting between worlds lacking any real sense of cohesive logic. But it still makes for both some cool visuals and funny moments.Out of the entirety of Marvel Phase 2, this is the weakest outing. It doesn't add anything original that we haven't already seen from the marvel franchise. In the end it's really nothing more than mindless action with a little bit of comedy thrown in. If that's all you want from a marvel film you might enjoy it. But if you're expecting the same charm and heroics of the rest of the marvel universe then you'll likely get let down.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

An uninspired story, formulaic dialogue, and a raft of meaningless characters conspire to make this the worst entry in the Avengers franchise. The last criticism is the most serious - for a film that sets itself up from the first as a battle of the ages between light and dark, the dark is disappointingly, well, opaque. Christopher Ecclestone's considerable talents are utterly wasted as the wooden, one-dimensional and frankly utterly uninteresting Malekith, and the lack of a genuinely characterful or menacing villain cripples the film entirely. He is an empty shell of a character, especially viewed against the beguiling mischievousness of Loki, and it makes the rest of the story, try as it might, a disappointingly run-of-the-mill blockbuster smash fest.The film generally hangs together as an overall effort - the visuals are OK, the acting reasonable, the story, bar some curious leaps even of in-world logic, and some predictably silly plot points, is solid enough for it to be not unwatchable. But there is no spark, nothing to generate enthusiasm, not enough meaningful drama to develop engagement and attachment. Unfortunately, therefore, it is utterly forgettable.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a shame as I quite like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and they've been consistent, but now the cracks are starting to show. There are only so many times we can see the same formula over and over again. This time, Thor deals with an alien invasion of earth and various other bland things happen. Thor The Dark World is a sequel to Thor, which wasn't a terrible film with its humour and character development, but it was a blockbuster built from anti-climaxes which devolved as it went along. This one is definitely worse and its contending with Iron Man 2 for the worst Marvel film to date. This is well acted up to a point, as Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins remain excellent. As usual, as an obscene amount of money is spent on these Marvel films, the special effects are excellent and you get the usual Marvel thrills and laughs, although in a more subdued way than normal. In a nutshell, TTDW is the Marvel formula done with far less effort.Another thing this suffers from are annoying human characters. Why on earth is an Oscar winner like Natalie Portman playing such a bland comic book girlfriend? None of the other characters are much fun either. It has a laughably bad villain who is some dark elf alien who not even Christopher Eccleston to make interesting. The action sequences are cardboard and lack any real dimension. They're just the same old stuff; plus haven't we seen enough of London getting destroyed in 2013 movies? In general, you don't feel most of the thrills and jokes and the story just goes the motions by half heartedly dumping crowd pleasing stuff such as jokes, fight scenes and special effects in there. When on earth, we get loads of annoying humans and when in space the film feels like a video game. TTDW isn't even a movie. It's a manufactured factory product coming off an assembly line, made purely for Marvel fanboys and Marvel fanboys alone. Lifeless and lacklustre, this effortless sequel takes the MCU to dark new places.4/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I always try to give the Thor films the benefit of the doubt, due to it's hard to sculpt premise, but The Dark World wasn't one of those films that needed to be made. Even though Alan Taylor handled most of the aspects better than the first Thor, while somewhat keeping the continuity alive, The Dark World is just utterly forgettable, and almost disposable. Taylor set up a few decent expositions, but due to the fast pace, nothing carried through, becoming underdeveloped, and thrown away, with the tones being here, there, and everywhere.Taylor did his best by trying to give everyone more to do, but everyone was just so bland! Our returning protagonist do the best with what they're given, but all of the side characters, especially the human side characters, are just throw away. The creative team spent no time building anyone up besides our three leads in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Tom Hiddleston. Chris Hemsworth returns once again as Thor, but there wasn't much added to his character. The writers spent too much time on trying to force the relationship between him and Natalie Portman, that ended up diminishing some of Thor's best qualities, to a certain extent. On the flip side, his relationship with Loki is captured great, being the best parts of the film. I wish I could say that Hemsworth carried the film, but he, himself said that he wasn't too crazy on it. Natalie Portman returns as Jane, just to take up time and space. The writers tried to make her a key piece to the narrative, but it did not pay off at all. I feel bad for Portman, because she's a very good actress; she just can't catch a break with these writers, writting her character. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, but he is questionably sidelined for most of the first half of the film, not having much to do at all. Even though I wasn't fond of him being put off to the side for the majority of the film, the writers gave him a nice grounded side to his character, while making a great impact to the film. The biggest issue I had with Malekith is, if you're going to have a great villain like Loki in the film before, you need to at least match the power, or out-do him, and Malekith is a flat out, laughable villain. His super underdeveloped motive is tremendously outplayed already. Christopher Eccleston tries way too hard to be a good villain, but he poses such a small threat, while just not fitting the scheme for Thor, or the MCU at that. Kurse on the other hand, definitely had the potential to be a decent villain, that poses and actual threat, but he was nothing but a disposable side character.The screenplay by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Robert Rodat, Don Payne & Christopher Yost, was the biggest downfall of the film. Most of their dialogue and jokes were forceful and bland, while they couldn't seem to find a tone to stick to.One of the best aspects of the film, was the action, backed up by the film wonderful effects. Out of all of the films so far, besides Marvel's: The Avengers, the action has been there, but not one of the highest points of the films; here, it's one of the main focuses, paying off pretty well by cutting down some dialogue scenes that could've been created.Overall, I came in HATING this film, but left somewhat enjoying it, and now seeing it just SLIGHTLY better than the first.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

What is it that makes people fall in love with those superheroes who are no more than embodiments of the American value-system? And, even more so, why are the bad guys always in business with (semi-)communists, (Arabian) terrorists or evil (Russian or Asian) scientists? The clichés are too much for me. Maybe it's because I'm European. But that doesn't explain why so many Europeans dig this franchise. So maybe it has nothing to do with all that and it's just plain old Hollywood: looking for the greatest common divisor to capitalize on, in other words the best commercial formula for the highest profit. When realizing this it isn't all too bad to watch those Marvel films, 'cause it's only Hollywood numbness and as a viewer you just need to lower yourself to that level. It then also becomes possible to measure those movies against each other. When doing so the pattern - for me - gets quite clear: the second phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy) is way better than the first one (which only had The Avengers that distinguished itself). I'm not anticipating any of the future Marvel films (at least 11 are in the running), but when seeking brainless entertainment, I suppose there's a lot worse out there.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie is average at best. The story is very bland and anticlimactic as you never really feel the result is ever in doubt. Yes, I know it's a Marvel movie, but with films like Spider-Man 2 (2004), Iron Man, X-Men First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past it's clear that Marvel can make a really great film when they want to. It just feels like the movie never really tries to make you question whether there is any really danger and seems like Marvel going through the motions expanding on it's catalogue. Having said that, there is just enough action and more than enough comedy to justify your ticket (and really, that's why we watch these isn't it?). Tom Hiddleston continues to be one of the more interesting actors in the Marvel films and he doesn't disappoint here. In my opinion, this is the least compelling Marvel film since Captain America and no where near as enjoyable as the first Thor film. You can pass on this one. Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

I appreciate the inclusion of Thor's love, Jane, but the other two had too much time and I don't think are interesting enough characters.The action scenes were short and none come anywhere near matching the opening fight scene with the frost giants in the first film.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) played their roles well but with a weak script it wasn't enough to save it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Want to remind that more than a superhero movie, The dark world seems a space-fantasy movie. This movie has much action, though I somehow managed to get bored at the end. The fact is that, just as Guardians of the galaxy, marvel space sci-fi overuses energy flares, beams and such... and that at the very end gets kinda annoying to me. Still, Thor: the dark world has enough humor, story, and good plot/action to overlook at this slight problem... I want to note down that toward the beginning we have a series of events that reminds deeply of the phenomenas described in the novel 'Roadside picnic' of the strugackij brothers, the original story that inspired Tarkovskij's eternal sci-fi classic, Stalker; therefore I really appreciated that maybe unwanted reference. Score is different than the first one, and I didn't like it that much.

Expertly crafted world building, only to present a contrived, arduous and over-extensive story that struggled to find any footing. Thor's electrifying mighty hammer ""meow meow"" was not enough to appease a sub-standard plot conforming to the typical ""save the world"" formula and absent of any character development. Fans of the MCU typically forget about this sequel, and it's not difficult to see why. Jane, in an endless search to find Thor again, coincidentally enters a realm which contains the Aether, a primordial entity withholding dark matter. She inadvertently consumes it, the Dark Elves want it back and Thor must save the Nine Realms again.Visually, the world of Asgard looked stunning. Clean beautiful shots of towering architecture, fully embracing its fantastical green screens which were hardly noticeable. In fact, the majority of the visual effects were excellently produced (aside from Marvel's eternal weakness, human CGI), particularly the designs of the Dark Elves spaceships as they recklessly invade Asgard. The returning cast all gave consistently good performances. Hemsworth, Portman and Hiddleston retain the original likability that we've all come to adore. Although Russo, Hopkins and Ecclestone were questionably underused. Costumes were fitting, production design detailed and a plethora of other technical aspects being fully functional. That's not The Dark World's problem.The inherent issue is with the unmemorable story that lacks any evolution for the characters involved. Thor remains the same from the start to the end. Loki is still mischievous without emanating any emotional conflict of vengeance. And Jane, unfortunately, subsides into a convenient plot device just so Thor has a reason to come back to Earth. The relationship between the two never progresses, and feels more forced than ever. And over half of the film is set on Asgard with the narrative progression becoming stagnant. Nothing happens.Then we come to the antagonist, Malekith. The accursed. Ruler of the Dark Elves, and one of the most powerful. Shame that he was completely wasted in this formulaic story. Seriously, the most underdeveloped pointless waste of a Marvel villain in the entire MCU. Ecclestone, a talented character actor, was pushed aside for Dennings' insufferably unfunny remarks, in an attempt to inject some humour that the original was apparently absent of. It just further cements the unmemorable qualities that The Dark World upholds.Whilst not necessarily a bad film, I mean it is watchable to an extent, it fails to live up to the quality of previous entries (minus 'Iron Man 2' and 'The Incredible Hulk'...). Leaving the film rotting in the dusty realm of Svartalfheim.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Exploring a darker side of space and making Thor a more serious character is indeed a very good idea, but one that was poorly executed. The film has plenty of jokes as usual, but at times it really struggles to be truly dark.

Jane was utterly useless in this film and shouldn't have even been in it, if you ask me. Thor was kind of back to some of his cockiness, but that wasn't a huge dealbreaker.

(**1/2)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3232714/?ref_=tt_urv","filmfanperspective","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60233126/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2015","It wasn't that long ago that I remember the deep feeling of appreciation for Marvel as they delivered on their promise. After all, ""The Avengers"" was the Hollywood rarity- a film that audiences were asked to be patient for, and for all intents and purposes, the hype was well-justified. Going forward, we know ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is coming in 2015, and ""The Avengers 3″ in 2018. These immense upcoming films will follow the same pattern as the first, in that a series of individual films will set up the events to culminate in the team-up. I'm fine with that, but I do require Marvel to maintain their focus with these solo efforts. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a very good looking movie that doesn't pay off in the most disappointing way- it doesn't respect its own audience, and thus becomes a huge missed opportunity for Marvel.If you've seen ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers"", you know that the 'Bifrost' and 'rainbow bridge' were destroyed, Loki (Hiddleston) is going back to Asgard and prison, and that Thor (Hemsworth) returned to Earth, but without visiting Jane Foster (Portman). These issues will need to be addressed in this film, and they are (mostly). After ""Thor"" made a big deal about the destruction of the Bifrost and its implications, nothing is said about how it was repaired in such short time (2 years). I suppose that is of little consequence in the big scheme of events. Loki still plots away in his Asgardian prison cell, apparently not humbled by his convincing defeat. He still feels entitled to a throne (any throne will do). The astrophysicist Jane Foster, as Heimdall (Elba) tells us in the first film, still searches for a way to reach Thor through the path of science. For as little time as they had together in the first film, clearly the Prince of Asgard and the Earth-bound, mortal scientist formed a strong connection- something this film doesn't spend enough time extrapolating. These characters will do anything for each other, but I've struggled to buy into their bond; after all, they haven't been on a single date, haven't shared their feelings or intentions to each other, and haven't shared a bed (that we're aware of). Other than a few longing glances, what is it about these two characters that make their actions believable or justified?Dr. Foster is working out of London in this film- luckily for her, that happens to be the EXACT location (Tanzania was apparently too remote) of a magnificent quantum space event is taking place. The 'Nine Realms' of the universe are all aligning at once, and this 'convergence' apparently allows for easy travel amongst the many branches of existence. As the movie tells us, an artifact of a sinister nature (of course) was hidden a long time ago during the last convergence, and wouldn't you know it- our favorite senator from Naboo (oops, wrong film) stumbles upon it. Literally.This artifact, designed by Malekith (Eccleston) of the ancient race of beings known as Dark Elves, looks exactly like angry Dimetapp to me. According to the movie, it's darkness as a weapon. So, Dr. Foster gets 'infected' by this substance, and becomes slightly dangerous to others. Except Thor. On top of that, the dormant Dark Elves are reawakened across the universe by Jane's interaction with the gooey Robitussin. I'm still confused by these things, but this film isn't interested in explaining away that kind of logic.Doesn't it seem like a grave misstep by the all-powerful Odin and the mighty Thor to have this weapon in the heart of their kingdom? Granted, Thor does have a plan to save her, but by then the Dark Elves have come a calling on Asgard, with technology that is at least 9,000 years old but makes the modern Asgardian defense seem obsolete. That perfectly encapsulates the problems with this movie; we've established a feasible, grounded-in-reality 'Thor-verse' to work with, and this film just craps all over those very rules. I also wondered where the entire population of Asgard was the first film gave us a bustling, populated kingdom, but when Dark Elves attacked, I only remember seeing soldiers and royalty. Did I miss something, or did the filmmakers get lazy?I should counter by saying that this isn't a bad film- it is earnest, and funny at times. It simply seems to have forgotten its audience as well as what made the other films in the 'Avengers' pantheon work, which is what bothers me. After sitting through five set-up films before ""The Avengers"", producer and Marvel film chief Kevin Feige should know better than to allow a film like this to go through- one that treats the established audience like amateurs. It's a rushed, heavily edited (it appears), logic-defying action spectacle that lacks the emotional resonance of the first film and defies the established logic we were used to. Is it possible that there is a better edition of this film out there, or that director Alan Taylor (of 'Game of Thrones' fame) had a grittier, longer version in mind? With the film clocking in at 111 minutes, and with rumors about studio-directed reshoots earlier this past year, I can't help but wonder if those interested in dollar signs saw a bleaker, longer film at first and got scared enough to ask for changes (or mandate changes). I'm clearly speculating, but if that's the case, shame on them. Shame on them anyways for giving us an inferior film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It doesn't stand out in my mind at all. It's a forgettable movie. I couldn't put my thumb on it before because I like the original. I love Thor. And yet Thor Part 2 is hard to watch.The biggest downfall is that it feels rushed. The pace of the movie is so fast. There is very little character building moments. It feels cheap with how rushed it is. It should have been a big deal for Jane to go to Asgard and meet the parents and the friends and Loki. Instead it was underplayed and quickly moved along. There was a quick comment and reaction before sweeping it all under the carpet of ""no big deal"". I felt robbed. They Made Jane foster into a random person along for the ride. Her character/role was useless. She was just the damsel in distress for the entire movie. Randomly there. No one cared about her option and she didn't add or give anything.It was nice to see more of the Asgard world and to dig deeper into the ralm by having the Dark Elves. As always it was nice to see Loki and his tricks. The movie was filmed with very dark colors and lighting. It added a very gloomy feel to it. Instead of setting the ""right"" mood it felt out of place.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","THOR: THE DARK WORLD... a boring title for a boring movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4771794/?ref_=tt_urv","staticstation1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65164901/?ref_=tt_urv","10 April 2019","It was around this time that I had become a massive fan of Thor, even making him my favourite among the Avengers. So, I was excited for this film because of that and because, from the trailers and marketing, we were going to get some incredible Thor action... Suffice it to say, this is probably the most forgettable film in the MCU, but still not a terrible film.
POSITIVES!
It was really in this film that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston knew the ins and outs of their respective characters. Hemsworth is a much better performer in this film bringing elements we saw in the first film and the grownup character we saw in The Avengers. Hiddleston is just a terrific performer and, as a character, has had a terrific growth. There are some very terrific visual effects when it comes to the entertaining action sequences involving Thor and his hammer, Mjölnir. There's the vastly engaging costume design in the returning characters but within those action sequences you have the background with its practical and character design. The sound within those sequences is all very strong and present. And another great score from Brian Tyler that really fits that character and world.
MIXED!
Now when it comes to the plot and story of the film, it would be a negative, but it revolves around what would later be known for building up to Infinity War. The reason it would be a negative is because the story is just dull. Made even more so by the actors and filmmakers involved. Moving to the art direction of the film, even though it is immaculate and terrifically built it adds to my thought process of the Thor franchise having a very inconsistent tone as this is a lot darker than the film prior.
NEGATIVES!
Let's start off with the writing of the film. Like I said, this film is perhaps the most forgettable entry in the MCU. Nothing about the entire story sticks with you after the viewing. That's why this is a very difficult movie to review. This film doesn't care about building any other character besides Thor and Loki. The antagonist of Malekith for instance is the worst villain in the MCU because audiences know nothing about him. Christopher Eccleston gives it his all in the role, but the writers don't care about him because he is not Thor or Loki. All the humour is mishandled. Thor's weak supporting cast is still that. The ""chemistry"" between Thor and Jane is non-existent and even Natalie Portman feels as if she doesn't care. I forgot to mention Kat Dennings in the first movie, but as the comedic character she is terrible. Moving onto directing. Patty Jenkins was meant to direct this, and she wanted to focus on the relationship between Thor and Jane and add to that Shakespearean tone that the first film set up. Taylor is known for Game of Thrones (and ruining Terminator even more) and this feels like an offbeat and uninteresting GOT episode.
CONCLUSION!
So, Thor: The Dark World (also a boring title) is an extremely mediocre. Although it has its impressive devices within the filmmaking process, it fails to capture what makes an MCU film fun and engaging. And instead aims for a darker approach that upsets the tone the MCU has cemented and goes against what the first Thor accomplished in tone and storytelling. In the moment the film can be enjoyable with its action sequences and where the film takes the characters of Thor and Loki, everything else, afterwards, falls flat in comparison.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart."" OMG!!! That's how bad it's gonna get. OK, so the dialogue is pretty awful - although there are a few fun one-liners. And the Norse god Thor is not my favourite super-hero - too much like ""The Lord Of The Rings"" meets ""Star Wars"".But I find it hard to resist any super-hero movie and Chris Hemsworth (the eponymous hammer-wheeling man from Asgard) went up in my opinion with his performance in ""Rush"", I'm always ready to view a movie with Natalie Portman (an actress with a Harvard psychology degree who delivers that line about ""the fabric of reality""), and I enjoyed seeing the scenes in my home city of London (although my friends in Greenwich will wonder why that was the centre of the convergence and a joke about Thor using the London Underground to return to Greenwich overlooks the fact that Greenwich is not actually served by the Underground). And the special effects are wonderful.Marvel movies have a habit of offering a teaser clip at the end of the credits and this time we are treated to two: one mid credits and one at the very end. So it is clear that this second outing for Thor in his own film will not be the last in the ever-growing universe of the Marvel film franchise","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The screenplay smears the surface of what it wanted to explore but never really tries to dig a little deeper. Visuals & action offer a slight improvement than before, Cinematography rightly aims for a darker tone, the narrative is finely paced while Brian Tyler once again chips in with a good score.Coming to the performances, the cast that was put together in the first film continues to play a relevant role in this one except for a new villain who isn't intimidating at all. While a few of them are given more to do with their characters, some still manage to come off as annoying and frankly, the best thing about this sequel is the chemistry between Hemsworth & Hiddleston as Thor & Loki, respectively, as both are quite charismatic in their given roles, especially Hiddleston.On an overall scale, Thor: The Dark World half-heartedly tries to delve into a darker territory yet is filled with sequences that'll prevent its viewers from taking it seriously. Every scene featuring Tom Hiddleston only lifts the whole story up as even the wit applied in those brief moments work out brilliantly in the film's favour. I guess most Marvel fans will probably be satisfied with it but I can't say the same for newcomers because despite being an enjoyable & entertaining ride for the masses, Thor: The Dark World still feels a bit hollow from the inside.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
