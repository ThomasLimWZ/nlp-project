"6","/10","It's a 6,5 and that's probably too much. Main problem: The PLOT.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6875848/?ref_=tt_urv","ThomDerd","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73053202/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2021","Marvel has spoiled us fans in the past. But this series is just not as good. Its not because of politics or of political correctness or of racial mentions; its because of the PLOT.Which kinda sucks. Inconsistent and at many times just pointless, the plot seems uninspired and forced, in order to make this series' story move forward.Here's a few: What exactly was Carly's main motivation? What makes the GRC so bad for Carly? Why don't they work more on the idea of the shield as a mantle? That could have been a great opportunity here.Why get into the power broker story arc in the first place and not further develop it?And why spend so much time in the political issues? Is that because the script is just non-existant? Maybe...
The dialogue at times is also incredibly stupid...which makes me wonder about the way marvel/disney approach their audience nowadays.Wandavision was not perfect but it was smart and well made with good dialogue and world building. But this one is more closer to a messy, character-lacking and backstory-missing series.Now why 6,5? 1-The action sequences are good and the start is impressive. Also there is a few more action sequences further on which are worth it. 2-Stan and Mackie are good action actors and look alright on screen, so its fun watching them and their chemistry is ok. 3-because i m a fan like most people here and i still like watching these stories and I appreciate the effort needed to get these done.I would just like this one to be better...
6,5/10 for the action.","553 out of 662 found this helpful.

I guess this is just a sneak peak of what marvel has planned for the future and i do hope it gets much better than this series.So I am willing to overlook the somewhat incredibly stupid dialogue moments and just go with it.I give it a 6 because it's bringing back the action and the avengers/captain america films mood.

We learn more about these two characters in the first episode than all the movies they're in combined! Anthony Mackie (The Falcon) and Sebastian Stan (The Winter Soldier) are both phenomenal here! If you didn't like this it's because you didn't want to because it's exactly what's been advertised in the trailers. It feels more like a movie than a tv show as it has the same look and feel of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I've enjoyed all the Marvel shows, some more than others, and this is definitely one of the better ones.

The visual effects are stunning, the chemistry between Bucky and Falcon is pretty nice to see and the fight scenes are on point.I really like to see more of Bucky and his internal struggles. He is such a badass and interesting character. Also the fight scenes from Bucky are so good that I had to watch them on repeat later on youtube.Now what ruins the show is the constant intention to smack us in the face with politics. I agree and support the movements but I prefer not to be constantly reminded of all that. I don't need all the TV to be a politically correct advertisement and statement from Disney. I am ok for some subliminar messages but every episode talking about it and centring everything around that is just annoying and takes away from the story. Also the constant dialog about the Black Lives mater movement seemed so cringe. The actors themselves seem to think it to be unnatural and strange. You could literally hear in their voice how unnatural it was for them to say the lines.For me it ruined the TV show.","75 out of 107 found this helpful.

This show will grab you and pull you into their world from the very first episode. You'll have so much fun watching this show that before you know it you'll have binged the entire season. Every episode is incredibly written. It had such high expectations and not only met those expectations but surpassed them.

I like that we see more drama and sorrow with Sam Wilson and Anthony Mackie has done awesome at exploring that. Sebastian Stan once again shows how great he is at expressing without words. The first scene in this newest episode was both heartbreaking and beautiful and I too my hat to him.I'm looking forward to the rest of the season and I am just confused by the reaction on here.

Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) turns down the shield but instead of retiring it, the authorities make American hero soldier John Walker (Wyatt Russell) the new Captain America. Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) can't understand why Falcon turned down the job. Meanwhile, the blip returnees are being marginalized by the world due to legalities and resource limitations. Karli Morgenthau leads a group of revolutionaries called Flag Smashers. Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) is hiding in the underworld of Madripoor.This is a six episode Marvel TV show and probably a limited series. It's meant to lead to a new Captain America movie with Sam Wilson. It's also doing a lot of other things and they are a mixed bag. First, this is about a black man taking over the symbol of American exceptionalism. It hits on that present-day issue hard. I do wonder if it could turn off some people who like the color red. I also do wonder if Falcon is walking that line correctly. In the end, the writers are obviously trying very hard with his climatic monologue. That speech goes on too long. It needs a rewrite and cut in half. What really hits home more is the museum exhibit of Isaiah Bradley. The other story lines are just as ripped from the headlines. John Walker is the cop who goes too far. Karli is some sort of Antifa. It's all a maelstrom of modern day politics. I can see this being off-putting but comic books have often tackled the politics of its days.There are undeniable problems with this show. I don't think Sharon Carter works in this role. There may be some rewriting going on and she struggles to go along the journey. Emily VanCamp is fine as Sharon but not the Sharon doing this premise. She is trying to be Hayley Atwell in Peggy Carter but that's not her. The other problem is Karli and her story. Her character needs help introducing her side and her people. The show simply doesn't have the time to fill out her story. The show is about six hours or about three Marvel movies. Even with that space, this show feels jammed together at times especially when a quarter is filled with cinematic action scenes. I have to think that the COVID disruption also caused some of the problems. At the end of the day, it does the main things well. Falcon and Winter Soldier are a good pairing. Falcon's journey to become Captain America is terrific and is given real world meaning.","25 out of 40 found this helpful.

The mediocre action sequences spattered throughout the series seem nothing more than a flimsy effort to keep the viewers tuning in every week so the writers can ram more simplistic preaching down their throat.Two solid characters and two decent actors totally wasted (along with several collective hours of viewing waiting for something half decent to happen).Any good series leaves the viewer wanting more. The Falcon perhaps should visit his friends in the richest country on Marvel's fictitious Earth, Wakanda and point out the famine and depravity that they are allowing to happen on their doorstep every day, rather than bleating the America hates black people message we've had rammed down our throats for the last year and are seeking escapism from.My suggestion is series 2 just be called 'The Falcon and Oprah' and be one long subjective and whiney interview where a repressed billionaire talks to the falcon about their respective mutual struggles in becoming the richest media personality in the world and a member of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.","12 out of 17 found this helpful.

Short yet so impactful.I'm shocked that people are giving 1-star reviews to the entire show because they didn't like a couple of scenes which demonstrated troubles faced by the black community - and the fact that Marvel's inclusion of these topics reduces many fans' enjoyment of the show... which is actually quite alarming.","78 out of 151 found this helpful.

Mackie and Stan have such great chemistry that just isn't at the forefront, it's just clumsily inserted here and there, just to tick the box. The dialogue is expositive, redundant. The show lacks direction. The light hearted back-and-fourths between Buck and Sam land flat, like the actors were led to believe they were in an entirely different context than what we see in the final cut. I'm seriously wondering if the director is at all familiar with the Marvel Universe, they should absolutely get someone else if there's ever a 2nd season.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

My initial objections to parts of it (the villain is hardly a threat) still remain with me, but stuff I liked then and still like are Mackie and Stan's comraderie. They have good energy and aren't over the top like Captain Marvel -- so there's always some danger and struggle for them. The second watching was rewarding and although I will definitely NOT be watching again certain other Marvel/Disney tv series, I like the actors and whole Captain America II grittiness. Even US Agent I think turns out to be an interesting character. Plus, you got to love Zemo and the Wakandans. Weak parts are still weak: Julia Louis-Dreyus' strange comic threat (a threat to all known comedy) and the whole Power Broker thing. Some people dislike the ""politics"" of the show -- that's what made Captain America 2 so good -- they're just channeling part of it here. It's sad that some people uncomfortable with talk about refugees and social justice, that some people are uncomfortable with discussion of blackness and inequality. The show does a good job tackling those issues -- by precisely giving us a new Captain America to speak about them. Sam Wilson is shaping up to be an inspiring captain. It's more than the shield. I'm hoping we will see a Season 2.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Interesting Ideas and Concepts, Too Much Filler","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8786950/?ref_=tt_urv","Reviews_of_the_Dead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tt_urv","8 January 2023","I'll be honest, my original thought was that I wasn't going to watch these Marvel series. There were a couple reasons I changed my mind. The first was that a website I saw had these as part of canon and I was intrigued to see where they were going to go with the overarching story now that Thanos is eliminated and who the new villain would be. The other is that I could feed my newborn daughter while watching these. Plus, they count as a movie on Letterboxd.For this show, we are seeing the world post-Endgame and with the void created by Captain America (Chris Evans). The shield was given to Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) aka The Falcon. He turns it over to the American government for them to decide what to do. They decide to create a new Captain America with John Walker (Wyatt Russell). He has always done the right thing, but with this newfound power, things aren't as simple as they used to be now that you can do more.Upset with Sam is Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) aka The Winter Soldier. He is still dealing with his demons when he was an assassin for Hydra. This become more complicated when there is a terrorist group that is fighting for what is right. They're led by Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman) who has gotten her hands on the super soldier serum.What I'll give credit to the show is taking everything that I've land out here and incorporated not only geo-political ideas, but also tackling ones closer to home like race. Falcon becoming black he discovers that Captain America wasn't the only super soldier. There was a Black man who did things for the government and then was cast aside. Bucky is upset with Sam for giving the shield over. They have an uneasy friendship there. Also the terrorists are not out for world dominance. They just want their people to be given the proper medical care and for their place. Their methods are the best though.Going along with the story concepts, the acting is good. I'm a fan of Mackie and Stan. Russell is good in this complicated character trying to step into Captain America's big shoes. Kellyman is good as our 'villain' along with her group. We also get appearances by Daniel Brühl and Emily VanCamp who are reprising roles. I'd also say that seeing Carl Lumbly, Georges St-Pierre and even Julia Louis-Dreyfus was good. This is well-made. They spent money so the CGI isn't bad. This isn't as heavy show on it, but it is still there. This had trouble keeping my interest, but I understand what they're doing and it works.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

They really went above and beyond.I love the two leads, they have great chemistry, it looks like it's going to be a great bromance.

Do keep in mind the show centers around side kicks (Falcon and Winter Solider), so my expectations were pretty low, but I was pleasantly surprised.Action is good. The story is solid and the production quality is on an HBO level.Would definitely recommend.If you're not into the comics, the show may not get you that excited as a stand alone piece of television.","27 out of 53 found this helpful.

No matter how realistic they may seem, all of the Marvel projects have dealt with problems from their sci-fi/fantasy world.

The jokes are forced, the camera work is inconsistent, and the editing has pacing issues. Overall, it comes out dull and boring.I also have a problem with the way they go about things as if it's trivial: e.g. The way the guy escapes from prison, it's shown as a 2 minute ""easy-peasy"" thing. It makes the show utterly unbelievable. MCU was strong in making things feel real, but the writers of this show simply brush off details -- the same way writers do on network shows. But this is not a network show, it's a premium show.Overall, it's a failure in both writing, directing, and editing. The only thing that saves it a bit is the chemistry of the two stars and some of the action. But as a story that stays in your head long after, well, it simply doesn't.","16 out of 29 found this helpful.

Yes it's a bit political, who cares? Not me? It's part of their character development, get over it. Stop complaining and downgrading the series because of showing racism on the big screen, that shows how much of a problem racism is if you go out your way to rate a series low because you feel uncomfortable. But overall the season is probably a 8/10, very good watch, if you are interested in character development and the emotional consequences of captain America leaving in endgame. Maybe other reviewers would see this if they actually watched it before rating a show that is incomplete. Also I think don't listen to reviews, give the show a try yourself, I realised long ago people rate shows or movies badly for obnoxious and arrogant reasons because they went into the movie or tv show with a bad mind set.","26 out of 53 found this helpful.

Comics always strive to bring people together. Why do we have to have a grumpy racist old man instead of someone who sees the inequalities but also sees hope and trys to instill it and while bringing awareness to problems ? And does not make new generations even more jaded and hateful. That is what comic books always were, balanced, bringing hope and equality. Not hate on basis of inequality.The staple of shows today seems to be that white men are inherently guilty of everything. Only they have to assume responsibility nobody else no matter what. Narrowminded people think they are ""bringing issues to light"" but this is only creating MUCH MORE DIVISION. I love the Marvel universe and comic book shows and movies and some are very balanced with story first, the underlying moral message below it. Here its the other way around and with no balance in sight.All in all, its quite a good show in many aspects but like too many shows today is too onesided, too politicized, woke and creating huge chasms between people instead of bringing them together.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

For today's standards (or really any standards so long as you don't change the definition), this borderline racist, I actually don't know what universe the people who are pushing this stuff live in.The whole painting terrorists in a favorable light is also ridiculous, if you kill a bunch of people who weren't really hurting you, you're in the wrong no matter how noble you think your cause is. I was all for robbing banks, but apparently that didn't make the characters virtuous enough at the eyes of the writer, had to go and kill a bunch of people as well.Bucky is ruined. I get the remorse and the depression, but really if I was forced at gunpoint to try and make a more wimpy and miserable character, I'm not sure I could. Such a great actor and such a great character - ruined. Even the arm sucks now.Capitain america: forced as hell - from a perfectly humble character going on to become the villain in the span of 3 short episodes. I haven't seen a lot of shows do a transition like this, this badly.I actually dig the falcon, the whole ""doesn't get any money and can't get a loan"" arc is completely ridiculous, but aside from that he seems like a balanced person. It's fairly weird to seem him go on fist fights and swing his wings at people every so often, the melee combat really doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but I guess that's just the falcon. I really do hope he doesn't get brainwashed into also blaming everything on white people.This last episode (s01e05) was the hardest to watch yet, more race bs, and ultimately just almost no progression (or didn't feel like it anyway). Imma keep watching because I have nothing better to do while I eat that one meal a week, but if loki turns out to be some more racist garbo or they also make all the characters all wimpy or they pull another ""super hero has no money and can't get a loan type"" level thing - I might just quit marvel entirely.I give it a 5 cuz the falcon is cool, Bucky's actor does a good job despite playing a horrible character, Zemo (and his arc) is dope as hell and so is the CGI.Honestly when I think about it they could just delete all the other stuff from the show and it would probably be better.Yeah, do a version of this where you're not trying to prove that you're virtuous because you believe in easy mainstream politics and you'll probably have me hooked, then I might reconsider docking from this bay I'm sailing. Otherwise this doesn't deserve my money and I'd be fine just not watching in the face of a lack of better options.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Balancing Act: 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' Navigates Legacy and Action with Mixed Success","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9726797/?ref_=tt_urv","random0banana","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42649678/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2024","In the grand tapestry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" emerges as a series that attempts to weave complex themes into the vibrant fabric of superhero action. It is a show that, much like its protagonists, grapples with the weight of legacy and the struggle to define one's identity in a world that is constantly shifting underfoot.The series picks up the narrative threads left dangling by ""Avengers: Endgame,"" with Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes facing the daunting task of stepping out from the shadow of Steve Rogers' Captain America. It is here that the series shines brightest, offering a nuanced portrayal of what it means to wield the shield in modern America.Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson is given the depth and space to evolve, his internal conflict palpable as he grapples with the mantle of Captain America. His performance is both grounded and soaring, capturing the essence of a man torn between duty and his own sense of self. Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes, meanwhile, provides a study in contrast, a man out of time trying to reconcile his past as the Winter Soldier with his desire for redemption.The action sequences are, as expected from a Marvel production, executed with precision and flair. They punctuate the narrative with the necessary adrenaline, yet never at the expense of character development. The choreography is intricate, the set pieces grand, and the visual effects seamlessly integrated, ensuring that the spectacle never overwhelms the story.However, in its ambition to address a multitude of themes, it occasionally loses focus, the narrative thread fraying at the edges. The pacing is uneven, with some episodes feeling overstuffed while others seem to tread water. The show's villains, the Flag Smashers, are conceptually intriguing but lack the depth and menace required to be truly compelling antagonists.Moreover, the series' attempt to juggle multiple character arcs sometimes results in a lack of sufficient development for its supporting cast. Characters like John Walker, the new Captain America, are introduced with great potential but are not given the room to fully explore their complexities. The show's exploration of trauma and its impact on veterans is a poignant touch, yet it feels like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into these psychological waters.""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" is a series that soars when it spreads its wings to explore the personal and political implications of its heroes' journey. It stumbles, however, when it tries to carry more thematic weight than its narrative structure can support. Despite its flaws, the series remains a bold and mostly successful entry into the Marvel canon, one that is not afraid to ask difficult questions even as it entertains. It is a testament to the enduring power of these characters and the world they inhabit, a world that continues to captivate and challenge its audience.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Thats why my rating started with a 10 going to a 1, rating it in the middle with a 5.PS can we look forward to episodes where the main character, the falcon, ends up with a smile or happy face? So far its just frowning and looking angry.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Their messages aren't always wrong, it's just unfitting. If they want to preach politics, then make documentaries or a series focused on that, or at least be subtle about it. I tuned in to watch action and superheroes fighting bad guys. Instead, I was distracted by its overt political speeches and subliminal messaging. It didn't feel like I was watching my childhood super heroes. I felt like I just learned about the political views of Disney's executives and their writers. People want to immerse themselves in the cinema to enjoy something beyond reality. It would be nice to have that, but it's just not the case anymore.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

It was nice to see Zemo back and John Walker was an excellent addition. Unfortunately the Flag Smashers are pretty lame. They remind me of henchmen from lesser action series. Their ""struggle"" was not even clearly defined. They say that they were oppressed, but we never saw any of that. You have to show rather than tell. Also, the subplot involving Sam's sister seems very forced. I get that the writers want to give Sam some problems, but think of a better and more realistic way. The moments in which race relations in America was brought up was hit or miss for me. Sometimes I was moved, but sometimes I was just rolling my eyes. Not because they weren't somewhat true, but because it wasn't in perspective. Partial truths presented as fact is lazy writing.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

What these people are referring to is two or three scenes in the entire show that have little to do with the narrative. Don't get me wrong I realise that Disney can be a little on the nose with their politics and equality but Captain America in the comics and movies has always been surrounded with politics and it's what makes his stories so great.

Mind-numbingly intricate character development, nonsensical political struggle, and TV filler. We don't merely see superheroes and villains knock each other around, we see them walking to the fighting destinations and talking incessantly to delay those confrontations. The same arguments replayed over several different episodes. I didn't want to watch Sam and Bucky fix a boat, or Sam apply for a bank loan, or Bucky talk in circles with a shrink. And, I doubt the post-blip politics of a war on terror over national borders or whatever could be more vaguely inconsequential. Sam's speech at the end was atrociously artificial--a supposedly moving speech to rally the common folk as engineered by Disney executives. The generic fanaticism of the Flag Smashers even worse.Even as movies released theatrically, the MCU has been a serial--a 20-plus-and-counting episodic series on bigger screens and with bigger budgets. Not necessarily a bad thing I think. After all, the first comic-book superhero movies were serials released in theatres: ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" (1941) and the Fleischer Studios ""Superman"" (1941 and thereafter) cartoon series. When the Superman and Batman feature-length blockbusters came in the 1970s and 1980s, they too became part of multi-film franchises. Imagine if instead of six episodes released one per week--seemingly just enough time for us to forget the last episode was the same thing--this were split into two or three theatrically-released movies instead. In that spirit, it's the worst MCU episode since ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008).""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" is all the more disappointing because it comes on the heels of the cleverly-reflexive ""WandaVision"" (2021). That's a show that understands and exploits its medium instead of suffering from it. A TV series about the magic of creating them. Even Wanda's grief-stricken retreat into nostalgia works better on the level of character interest. It's a show that ingeniously ended with shapeshifting in an empty theatre. Here, we're just supposed to get excited by a cameo from an actress who reminds us of a better TV series, I guess. Usually, the dichotomy isn't this simple, but ""WandaVision"" is smart, and this isn't.","100 out of 151 found this helpful.

She just didn't work. Her crew too. Just a really uninteresting ""bad guy"" group. They looked like production assistants who filled in for real actors. I can see what they were going for (a sort of grey zone, freedom fighting terrorists who were just misunderstood)... Disney does that a lot, that misunderstood ""bad"" guy fighting for a good cause type thing. Neat idea on paper, but in practice pretty boring and just executed poorly.I liked some of the themes and such, but it felt a bit forced and on the nose at times.

The flag smashers motto was pretty vague and they just looked like regular street teen thugs asking for a nice flogging. The stakes were never too high. Besides, it seems now every other jerk now has access to the super soldier serum, and surprisingly they are even able to give our superheroes some nice thrashing.

The show had a strong message on the treatment of black Americans. But its about a black man possibly taking over the shield for the first time in history, so its a very fitting subject. For those saying its too political, Its Captain America politics is the only reason he was created. The flag smashers were okay, I felt like they needed more to their motives. Some of the flag smashers story was deleted due to COVD. So perhaps their was a better story for them. That was def the weakest part of the show.Over all I really liked the show and cant wait to see what they do with the characters from here.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

This raised my hopes for next entry of the fourth phase of the MCU. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. There are well directed fighting scenes, creators touched many delicate topics, but characters are pretty average: no one really stand out. The spotlight is mainly on The Falcon, The Winter Soldier is just a supporting role, and honestly does not take much screen time. I wish screenwriters developed him deeper, telling more details about his past, and how he became the person that he is today. Unfortunately movies did not managed to do this properly, in my opinion. The show was the perfect opportunity to really exploit him at the maximum.The series treats many interesting topics, however sometimes I have to admit that is too political. The speech of Falcon on the last episode contains a few interesting points, but I did not like at all how he pictured Flag Smashers. Motives of the group are in some extents noble; the leader just wants the best for humanity after the blip, contrasting unfair decisions by the UN Congress. Still their actions most of the time are unjustified, so I would call them terrorists, without any regrets. Disney wanted to give a different perspective, but I was not convinced. They could definitely use some political background, but this feels forced.Titling this series just ""The Falcon"" would be fairer to be honest. It is a generic production that wanted to be something more, but cannot deliver. Action and editing are very neat, but nothing extraordinary. Marvel decided to play safe this time, once again a lost of opportunity to create something that would put some distance to similar productions.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Are you ready to watch a show that will belly laugh and also immerse you in an emotional ride of a lifetime? Well if so, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is the show for you! Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan return in iconic roles, delivering mind-blowing action choreography and creative new ways to show action like Marvel hasn't achieved before. This will definitely bring a smile to long time Marvel fans, and it will also be extremely enjoyable for first time Marvel viewers.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is set six months after the events of Avengers: Endgame, establishing the current status of Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Sam (aka the Falcon) is still completing missions fighting crime left and right. Bucky (aka the Winter Soldier), on the other hand, is lying very low. He is dealing with mental health issues, trying to make peace with himself and the world. When the terrifying villain Zemo makes his reappearance from the events of Captain America: Civil War, Bucky and Sam must team up and defeat this foe.In Captain America: Civil War, we get a taste of the Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan duo. Everyone loved it. Now to satisfy our lust for more, we have The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Their chemistry is outstanding. You laugh consistently throughout the show, making you want more and more. The visual effects and writing departments each deserve a lot of credit for the extremely creative route the show takes, demonstrating to the world what beautiful effects Marvel can produce.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is intense at times. A good portion of the show is pure action that some parents might not be comfortable with their younger children seeing. Some episodes contain mild cursing. The show does offer many morals and lessons. It explores themes such as teamwork, love and friendship. It also teaches the lesson that, even though you might have lost someone you love, they would have wanted you to move on and continue to live the life you want.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier soars higher than the Falcon does in the show, delivering plenty of great laughs and action-packed scenes. The show does contain intense action and cursing. Therefore, I give The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults. Every Friday a new episode releases on Disney+ starting March 19, 2021. Reviewed by Jude A., KIDS FIRST!","30 out of 88 found this helpful.

Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russel, and Erin Kellyman were amazing. Wyatt Russel did a little too good of a job at becoming a character to hate. It was great to see familiar faces and continue Steve's legacy, especially through Sam Wilson. The chemistry between Sam and Bucky really helped the show as a whole, making the entire show funny and emotional. It also hits some hard topics for America, something some would complain about, but was still needed for the show. I can't wait to see how Sam handles the mantle of Captain America in the future, as I know he'll be great.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

So, to see people carping about the Falcon and the Winter Soldier as being too political is more than a little annoying. Anyone who read Captain America comic books knows that politics were always part and parcel of his character. I remember reading issues during which he lectured facists about the flaws in their ideology while he delivered the smack-down.So if this show seems 'too political' to you, then you've missed the point entirely and are probably rooting for the wrong side.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Racial disparities were discussed in the comics. Plus, it's a fact of every day life for People of Color. Once you understand and acknowledge that, you'll feel less frustrated that it's represented in television and movies. Also, it's not inconceivable that Sam would need to go to the bank for a loan. The Avengers were a private organization funded by Stark, which in case you forgot, is dead. So, who exactly do you expect to be bankrolling Sam's lifestyle?? Now, I love the banter between Bucky and Sam. It's been good to see the growth in Bucky. I wish we could find out more about his time in Wakanda over these last 2 episodes. Zemo has been a funny piece of the storyline too. My only complaints are I hate fake Cap and I've never been a Sharon Carter fan. Otherwise, watch it and form your own opinions.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

The action scenes are awesome for the most part. There was some unclear action but not too much. The music is great, especially the CA: Winter Soldier and CA: Civil War themes. Composer Henry Jackman is too awesome.I originally said: I just wish it finished as strong as it started. The 5th episode was very anticlimactic. And while the finale had some great action scenes, the way the story and different sublots came together at the end was pretty clunky. It felt off.On second viewing I didn't feel that. And one thing I forgot to mention is how this series has multiple emotionally powerful scenes. One story told by a certain character brought me to tears, both times. And the conclusion of the character arcs are heartfelt and satisfying. (2 viewings, 4/23/2021, 9/26/2022)","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

Falcon and Winter's relationship feels shallow and forced which leaves the impression that the characters are shallow. MCU has built complex characters with emotional intelligence throughout all their movies, and this feels like an outlier. Having little soul, the story is mostly boring. The only interesting parts are the non-superhero scenes that talk to racial tensions. Those scenes have depth and realistic context which, in other MCU movies exists throughout the entire story and action scenes. In this story, depth is slid in between plot points like an afterthought. I have loved every MCU movie and WandaVision, but this one doesn't carry the energy of the others.

"7","/10","Slightly overstuffed and a little shaky in the pacing, but Stan and Mackie have a solid buddy dynamic and there is good positioning for Mackie as Captain America.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8995819/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","15 April 2023","Following the events of Endgame where Steve Rogers entrusted Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) with the shield and mantle of Captain America, Sam has yet to adopt the mantle and continues his missions under his current identity and eventually reluctantly retires the Shield and the Captain America name to the government for display in the Smithsonian. Meanwhile James ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) the former Winter Soldier has been pardoned for his assistance in fighting Thanos and tries to make amends with his troubled past and the people he wronged. When an anti-patriotism group known as the Flag Smashers lead by Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman) begin fighting against the Global Repatriation Council that is trying to forcefully relocate several ""Blip"" survivors, Bucky and Sam team up to try and stop the Flag Smashers and their violent activities across Europe. Meanwhile matters are further complicated by the emergence of John Walker (Wyatt Russell) as the new Government sponsored Captain America.Another standalone mini-series focusing on secondary characters in the MCU similar to Wandavision, much like Wandavision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier saw massive viewership and solid reviews from critics and audiences even if the pacing was sometimes subject to criticism. Malcolm Spellman pitched his take on a series focusing on Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson with Feige interested in exploring these characters due to their popularity with audiences in the Captain America films and the series would be used as a springboard to properly set-up Sam Wilson as Captain America following Endgame's retirement of Steve Rogers. While The Falcon and the Winter Soldier certainly feels big and epic falling in line with the level of quality seen in the Captain America films, it also feels like it's slightly more unwieldy and unfocused and would've worked better as a film than a series.To start off on a positive note Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie continue to be great as Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson respectively, and the show does a good job of setting up and exploring the void left in a world without Captain America and the weight that is placed on Sam's shoulders as a result. You really do get a sense of Sam's hesitance at adopting the Captain America mantle especially in a world that post Blip has reverted back to its worst aspects. We also get some solid follow-ups with Bucky Barnes who still carries the weight and guilt of his Winter Soldier days and the fact that both characters have a connection to Steve Rogers' Captain America with both having been best friends with him makes for a solid connecting point that allows for good character moments between the two. The action is really on point for a TV series with many of the action beats being just as good as presented in the Captain America films and there's a nice level of grit and impact to the action sequences in comparison to some of the more CGI heavy entries in the MCU.I think however despite the show having some really good ideas and a pair of charming an engaging leads, the story does feel its shift in writing from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely of the Captain America films to Malcolm Spellman in that while Spellman tries to manage a large ensemble in the same manner as Markus and McFeely, he doesn't balance the large ensemble as well with the narrative often feeling cluttered with a lot of points that don't feel as cohesive as they should. While I liked the idea of the morally conflicted setup that felt like a thematic continuation of ideas presented in Winter Soldier and Civil War, I often felt as though there were too many characters and tangents in the story that made the experience feel less streamlined than it should've been. This particularly shows in characters such as Erin Kellyman's Karli Morgenthau and Wyatt Russell's John Walker/Captain America who feel lost amongst the shuffle when considering other parts like Sam Wilson's family, former super solider Isaiah Bradley, a returning Zemo, and several other MCU tangents that not only bloat out the story, but really only serve to be launch points to other stories.I liked The Falcon and the Winter Soldier well-enough, but it's the kind of thing that feels like it should've been a movie instead of a series. With Wandavision, it felt like it used an episodic format to its advantage in being a meta commentary on sitcoms intertwined with a The Prisoner-esque mystery, but The Falcon and the Winter Soldier feels like a good story that's overstretched and overstuffed. Still enjoyable, but not without flaws.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The show has quite a lot of thematic resonance, taking the time to comment on several real-life issues that rarely come up in this sort of fare. In particular, its discussion of race and what it would mean for a black man to be Captain America in a country which is still rife with systemic racism is rather poignant. A few people I know don't like the show because it's 'boring', but what they mean is that it takes the time to slow down and focus on its characters. To me, that's the opposite of boring. In fact, that stuff is much more interesting and engaging than the action (which is still enjoyable). Accusations of it being 'too woke' are clearly made in bad faith, too. The show sets its stakes relatively early and roots them in its characters, which ultimately makes for a much more engrossing and satisfying experience. The action is entertaining and, for the most part, nicely practical, with the standouts being a couple of surprisingly painful showdowns. There are a few surprise characters here and there, including the oddly charismatic Zemo and the subversively violent John Walker, and the show is as well-made as any of its big-screen siblings. It's a really enjoyable series overall. 8/10.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

Every actor that goes 'woke' is dull, uncharismatic, and wooden (and usually not very good-looking either).The series was enjoyable up to a point, but with each episode I felt like I was watching a direct-to-video TV series (back when Blockbuster existed). Which actually kind of is, when I think about it.Episode 3 was the best, but it goes only downhill from there. The 'Falconsuit' did look amazing though.While watching, I got really tired of the diversity hires everywhere. That goes for the writers as well as the cast. If America idolizes the 'blonde haired blue eyed' folks as this show tells me, maybe there is a reason for it. Stop being generally subpar maybe, and produce something exceptional?Nobody says 'women and men'. It's 'men and women'. The f--k? Every potential love interest and side character of Bucky is a diversity hire. Cringe. Apropos to this, the dialogue ranges from decent, to cringe woke garbage.The subplot-which-sadly-isn't-a-subplot's main antagonist is another diversity hire. Not even in shape. Using a particular serum, which by the way isn't fully explained as to how exactly the antagonist gets ahold of it, is the only way they could make the fights somewhat believable. Antagonist's sidekicks are diversity hires too.Who needs the Avengers? Two Wakandan diversity hires with spears are all you need.They try to reverse-psychology-normalize the globalist NWO bullsh-t by having the antagonist spout that nonsense while trying to make the antagonist a sympathetic villain. It doesn't work.Don't really understand how the quality can drop so much compared to Infinity War. The format isn't THAT different compared to the big screen.The only, and I repeat the ONLY reason I even gave this a 6 is the goodwill I have remaining from Winter Soldier (which is excellent), and Infinity War (which is also really good). If this were a standalone production not tied to the MCU, I would rate this a 3 or less. Keep politics OUT of film or at the very least keep it subtle.I haven't seen WandaVision yet, but right now I'm thinking Marvel should stick with movies.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I loved all the MCU movies and now the tv series.Most of these 1 ratings are a bunch of super sensitive people with blinders on to the reality of what most of us have to deal with. Dont let these ignorant views stop you from watching a great show!!Why I always loved the comics like X-Men and MCU, the super heroes were judged by society because they were different or they were hunted down by groups like HYDRA because they were looking out for the little guys or could offer something great to the world that ppl like Hydra didn't want to see happening. Anyone saying this is turning political because of the stuff going on in the world, must not have been paying attention and once again...walking around with blinders on and just oblivious to the message and the world around them. SMDH. There is way more to the story than that but it includes a great message with some action! Take off your blinders...this is not new. Not in the shows and not in reality. Maybe for ya'll but not for a lot of us.Ne-ways...if you dont have blinders on.. dont miss out on a great show. If you do, keep on moving. You wont be missed.","11 out of 30 found this helpful.

The acting, especially from Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, was strong, bringing depth to their characters. The music added to the series' intensity, and the casting introduced compelling new additions to the MCU. Cinematography and action sequences were well-executed, delivering thrilling visuals. The directing maintained a good pace, but the writing occasionally faltered in balancing multiple storylines and character arcs. Its strength lies in exploring the complexities of the post-Endgame world and the legacy of Captain America, but it faced challenges in fully fleshing out certain plot threads and antagonists. Overall, it's a worthy addition to the Marvel universe.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It gets better so quickly but people are so impatient and leave their reviews without giving the show a second chance and letting it develop. The main 2 critiques I see are that the show is either ""boring and dull"" or ""not as good as WandaVision"", and yeah, the first episode was slow paced, but if you actually LET THE SHOW PROGRESS, than you'll see that it ramps up a ton and is completely action packed. As for the WandaVision argument, these are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT series about completely different characters. While WandaVision focused on the mystical side of the MCU, this show is meant to be grounded, and to show the problems that the people are facing. It's the whole reason the show is so political. Give the show a chance. I guarantee that if the people who left bad reviews off of the first episode actually watched 3 and 4, they'd definitely change their ratings.","9 out of 24 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A little memorable conflict","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8366766/?ref_=tt_urv","alekspredator87","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52780913/?ref_=tt_urv","24 July 2022","Marvel and its Cinematic Universe are trying out new formats - serial. The decision is still, in my opinion, ambiguous, but it was and is. And even if the first series ""Wanda / Vision"" proved to be worthy, then the ""Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" that followed clearly did not live up to expectations.We need to start with the fact that the minor characters of the previous projects about the Avengers and Captain America, having received the main roles in the new series, as if they were not ready to take these roles on themselves. It seems that the scriptwriters were not ready either, who plunged a couple of cronies into a changed world after the departure of the old heroes and society returning to normal after the Hulk's reverse click. However, it can be seen with the naked eye that the creators did not even try to work out this presented new world, showing how people could really live in it. Well, there is no elaboration of the world in the series, it appears to be some kind of cardboard.A frankly weak plot does not attract the viewer's attention. It's a little weak for a spy thriller. Attempts to uncover the seemingly important problems of racial discrimination for American society look vague. The creators show how Wilson faces this problem, which existed in the past when there was another super soldier. But he was black-skinned, which means, according to the writers, he was not worthy of becoming the new face of America, as Rogers once was. However, I want to note that Carl Lambley's performance as a black super soldier of the past is worthy of attention. His dialogue with the Falcon makes you feel the very problem of inequality. A worthy moment of the series.Baron Zemo is supposedly not Zemo at all, but his clone. There is no trace of the dangerous villain from the ""Confrontation"". And this is the problem of the series. The creators are sometimes ready to completely change the vector of the hero's development in favor of an easy and even comedic representation of the characters on the screen.The main antagonist, played by the pretty Erin Kelliman, does not inspire confidence. A young girl leads an army ready to fight for her ideas. No. I have no complaints about gender and age. I just generally don't believe in such a development of the plot because of the behavior of this girl. There is no core in it, and therefore people can hardly follow it.The whole conflict should be built on the idea that they are voiced somewhere in the middle of the series. Bruce Banner's reverse click brought back half of the planet's population. And life became unbearable. It's a great story to really reveal. There have been no missing people for five years. Those who stayed survived a terrible loss, learned to live without relatives, started other families, started a new life. And the sudden return confused all the cards. Here the scriptwriters would like to walk around, show a couple of examples how it can be. But they don't, concentrating on something else. Sadly.The project clearly loses in originality to the previous Marvel pictures. The current agenda for the American society is submitted, as for me, inarticulately. Various kinds of inequalities, problems of the poor and the rich. All this is there, but the attempt to show the work with these difficulties was not very convincing. Again, Marvel fans should take into account that the topics raised should not only be qualitatively disclosed, but also understandable outside the States. In the modern world of technology, these problems will not be news to people who have access to the Internet and, at least a little, represent various movements for the rights of certain people in North America. But the approach to the implementation of the original idea turned out to be weak.The series has become a regular passing project for me. Yes. He's not bad, watchable, but no more. We are used to seeing Marvel's much better work.6 out of 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The show has brought in other characters from the MCU which to me has added so much more excitement, you wonder where it will head next or who is going to tie in to it all.The combat action, different locations and the cleverly shot scenes all would point to this being a high budget, well produced TV show. Those saying Marvel are running out of money must be watching something different.The friction between Bucky&Sam and John Walker has created a complex storyline where it's not just 'heroes' teaming up to fight the bad guys, and the whole 'bad guy' thing is unclear too with the good motives behind the destruction. This has much more depth than I thought it would, expecting a corny action/comedy only following one storyline, I have been pleasantly surprised and look forward to every Friday.Only 9/10 because I wish the episodes were longer.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

Marvel didn't just throw it away because it is just a tv show. It has a quality of a movie and a great story. It has really well action sequences like in the movies. What I have said also applies to the visual effects. Character development was extremely good. We had seen many characters' changes throughout the series: Falcon, Bucky, John Walker, and more. Every episode was great on its own. Although, it did not make me feel excited about the next episode as it did in the Wanda Vision. There wasn't really much of a mystery in the series; that's why maybe I didn't get excited that much. I did not also fully understand the goal of Flag-Smashers. Like, they're talking about change and migrants all the time, but it would be better if they made it clear. It made an early ending, in my opinion. I would really like to watch more. There was also a Star Wars-like celebration at the end of the series. I didn't hate it, but I also wouldn't prefer it to be that similar. To sum up, this series changes many things for the MCU. It was also a great mini-series that you would probably have a lot of fun while watching. It also has some extreme scenes, but I do not want to give any spoilers.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So far in the MCU he hasn't been developed at all, but in this first episode we are starting to see some life in the character.

The only really annoying thing is how convenient they make everything to prop up the characters they want to & how they keep the other characters down with 2D character script writing ( though the overall message is good the way they got there has way too many flaws in the plot ).Looking forward to seeing The Falcon & of course the new Captain America ( you'll see who by watching the series as no spoilers from me ) in future Marvel movies as let's hope those scripts, plots & directors are of the higher quality that we have come to expect from the Marvel Universe films ( that are more believable in the characters that all seem much more real & authentic ).Overall though this TV show is definitely worth a watch, however let's hope all the series 2 that they might make all end up improving on the scripts.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The production quality is great and the banter is excellent. However, it's far too political. Kamal K's review on October 6, 2021 calls out a lot of the political issues in good detail, so I won't repeat them here. I'm not usually pedantic about story lines, but the political elements were distracting.You can't open a web browser, check your email, turn on the TV, or scroll through social media without being bombarded with politics. It's literally everywhere, every day. People want and deserve a break, and the MCU is a great source for that. I don't need my MCU content to contain political messages that challenge the issues of our times. I get that from 100 other sources every day, I don't need to hear it from fictional superheroes. This country is drowning in politics every day, from both sides. Give us a break and just let us enjoy bold, exciting, and altruistic superheroes who do amazing things for the benefit of everyone.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It continues a similar tone of Winter Solider in that it's a more serious entry in the MCU - another political thriller but with heavier sociopolitical themes. I think it has a lot to juggle and mostly sticks the landing in terms of its mission.The pros: the main characters. Both Sam and Bucky each have unique journeys post-Infinity Saga and they are very personal. They are both trying to find their place in this new world with unique struggles. Bucky doesn't know what to do with his time other than exact justice/revenge because all he really knows how to do is hunt. He needs to find something bigger to fight for and start the journey on living his own life. That said, the main focus is Sam. This show goes into race and what it means to have a black ""Captain America"". What does America stand for today? Should he even bother? - America has historically oppressed African Americans (enter Isiah Bradley). Or is the idea bigger than a country and that in of itself necessary to continue? I mostly really enjoyed the discussions surrounding this.The weaker part are the Flag Smashers. They do ok in setting up their motivations but never really hit the nail on the head. I like that they are to represent more of an ambiguous villain/antihero group with empathetic goals contrasted with the GRC which represents autonomous big brother dictating how the world how is gonna be. Who's the real villain? I liked the idea and theory of that conflict but how it was portrayed just didn't hit hard enough for me.All in all there was a lot of interesting sociopolitical commentary packed into this series. A lot of it hit but some of it didn't and those parts were kinda boring. Yes there's banter and chemistry between the leads to lighten the mood at times but this is mostly a political drama so if you're into that and liked the tone of Winter Solider and (most of) Civil War, you're gonna like this one - it's a Cap movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Throughout this there are some fairly explicit commentaries on racial divides in America and America's policies towards the outside world. Most of it is done very well aside from one ridiculously over-the-top speech in the final episode.Sam and Bucky just about carry the show as lead characters, but the best moments for me involve other characters such as John Walker, Isiah Bradley and one villain previously introduced in an MCU movie.The visuals as you can imagine are spectacular, with impressive looking effects and hyperkinetic action sequences. At times the cinematography made me feel a bit giddy but it is mostly very good and there are some memorable images involving the Captain America shield.Most performances were solid. Sabastian Stan and Anthony Mackie have a good chemistry, but some of the ""buddy"" banter between them in the early episodes feels quite forced. For me this is down to the material and not their performances. Stan is actually quite excellent in the more emotional scenes. Carl Lumbly has some brief but superb moments. Wyatt Russell, who quite scarily resembles both his mother and father, gives for me the most memorable performance of the show. My only disappointment was Erin Kellyman who doesn't really have a powerful enough presence for the role she is cast.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

Well not really. If someone takes this personally, good, because even my small voice should be heard.This show is literally the only one that directly deals with consequences of endgame that don't concern just an individual or a small pocket of broken MCU that is a result of the Avengers:Endgame (because universe is literally broken)In fact, it takes advantage of two characters that were always sidelined and put them in a big picture, on global scale of the current state of MCU.So reviews, saying the story is inconsistent are die hard fans that wanted Chris Evans, or some replica of him back in the show. And that's exactly what didn't happen, the way the community wanted.Hence review bombshelling. I am late for a party, however, despite some flaws and being overshadowed by blaze of characters which have no place in MCU anymore (actively and I am not talking about comics), it's very decent foundation and deals with topics, other recent MCU shows and movies are afraid to explore.Bottom it's worth watching and it's undeserving underrated, especially considering the quality of cast (Anthony and Sebastian rock-hard., but hey people want more of freakishly overrated and tiresome humor, such as Spiderman No Way Home, which I find to be utter mess)","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Though I'm not comparing this with Wandavision because it is made of a completely different material.We can see the journey of Sam Wilson from Falcon to Captain America which is the main base of this series and the directors and story writers are absolutely successful to make us believe why he deserves that shield. Bucky feels like a side character though(or actually he is), but we can connect with him emotionally just because of Sebestian Stan's outstanding performance. Hats off!Among the other cast members Daniel Brühl as Zemo outdid himself. The character of New Captain America is well developed and we can love that how nicely his character arc is completed with a delicate finishing touch. Wyatt Russell impressed us very much as a newcomer.The only reason why I can't tell this series perfect because of the unnecessarily fast screenplay and poor character development of the main anti hero Karli Morgenthau. We simply just can't emotionally connect with her.Last but not the least, the presentation by Marvel Studios about race discrimination and about political agendas on screen is quite actually admirable.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

As you'd expect from a Disney funded Marvel show, the production quality is impressive and the whine the scenes teams should be commended for their work.The story progresses slowly, but organically, with familiar faces returning to confront yet another conspiracy involving super soldiers, taking us to new locations around the world, further expanding the MCU. Unfortunately, the plot suffers from poor writing and (in only 6 episodes) fails to deliver on the initial promise. After an interesting build-up, the show seems to stall before rushing into a premature finale that lacks the drama and tension of the films which preceded it and the final ""reveal"" feels corny and unearned. There are even some truly cringe-worthy moments. To make matters worse, Bucky is relegated to the role of a sidekick and his partnership with Sam is sidelined.The writers also felt the need to keep reminding us that the Falcon is black, needlessly and repeatedly drawing attention to his race, making an issue of something which shouldn't be an issue, in a story where it's largely irrelevant.Chris Evans' portrayal of Steve Rogers was always going to be a hard act to follow, but there were glimpses of his inspirational charisma in some of Mackie's early dialogue, suggesting he could grow into the role. Sadly the story doesn't allow him to do so, but instead forces it onto him, presumably in a misguided attempt at virtue signaling.Overall, a disappointing continuation of a well loved franchise.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

However, Falcon and the Winter Soldier far exceeds WandaVision. The gravity of the show caught me off guard. While the MCU is usually a fairly formulaic ""good guys defeat bad guys"" movie with a good dose of comedy and occasional serious drama, this series represents a huge tonal shift compared to what I was used to. The MCU universe is typically portrayed as something of a picturesque reality where the good guys always triumph and everyone lives happily ever after. Leave it to Hollywood to not accurately represent their source material, and the comics, although they did have good defeats evil themes throughout, the comic writers were sure to write real-world problems into their comics, and that's something that was mostly notably absent in previous MCU entries.Starting largely with Captain America: Civil War, the heroes start having to face repercussions for their actions, and sometimes they're not always forces for good. This idea is represented tremendously in Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Although the heroes saved the day in Avengers: Endgame, there are real-world consequences to suddenly bringing back half of the planet's population after they were missing for five years. In those five years after the Snap, although they were bad, people that were otherwise enemies joined forces, and countries and their people joined together in grief over their lost loved ones and sought to rebuild the world and make it better. The Avengers bringing everyone back essentially returned everything back to the way it was before, and suddenly the same problems that people thought were gone are staring them in the face again: racism is a thing, countries hating each other is a thing again, and it's like the Snap and the five following years, along with all of the rebuilding that came during that time, never happened. The problems portrayed in this series are very reminiscent of real life, something that was lacking in previous MCU entries.The title of Captain America is one with a hugely complicated history, the Flag Smashers are supposed to be the bad guys but their intentions are, at their base, good, and things are very far from being perfect following the actions of the Avengers in Avengers: Endgame. There is so much grey area with morality in this series, I struggle with whether or not I should root for one character or another, and I love every second of it. I highly recommend this to people that enjoy the MCU and wouldn't mind quite a bit of realism poured into it for good measure.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Added many characters that had previously appeared in MCU movies, I don't think that was necessary. Some things in the story were rushed, and some were simply restarted. The series seems totally unnecessary to me, it brings nothing new, and the motives they explored were simply returned to where they were in time before the series. It looks like a worse sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier which to me personally is one of the best in MCU. This whole mini series reminds me of the side mission of a game.

Zemo was a welcome surprise however and I quite liked his character, however this was balanced out by Carly who I think is probably the worst villain to grace the MCU in terms of how badly acted she was, the character's mindset which didn't make a lot of sense and her accent which felt so out of place.In addition, the series felt too political at times and it seems like Marvel was trying to take this series in a 'woke' direction.

I say uneventful because as much as things happen...I can't recall what said things were. Some well dressed and well fed people stand around while a red headed girl with some freckles and a cockney accent talks about taking down the man. The fun Sam/Bucky chemistry is non existent for 3/4 of the series run. The biggest shame is how well Marvel has done so far with being somewhat political, but this is just heavy handed. They're searching for symbolism and things we can relate to, but to be honest after the past year I'd rather escape in the Milano to a far off place of the galaxy and forget this series ever happened.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Credits to all the casts for their dedicated time it paid off.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

If you are a true MCU fan then no doubt you will enjoy the show. Great characters with awesome storyline. Best thing is we will get to know Sam and Bucky more as we never saw other part of their life then just fighting the war. I love where the storyline is heading and can't wait for last 2 episodes. I don't judge the Negative reviews but hey everyone has got different taste. But people just can't expect it to be as hit as Infinity Saga, this is just a beginning of the next phase and this show fits very well there. Enjoy the show ;)","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the dynamics between the characters, I enjoyed the arcs each character had and I enjoyed the action.I really thought this show was good until the main antagonists showed up, the Flag Smashers.They just sucked, such boring one dimensional characters especially the leader of the group, Karli. The show tried its hardest to make Karli and the Flag Smashers seem like this group with a righteous cause but in the end, they came off as annoying with no real purpose besides being in the way of our main characters.Karli has gone down in my books as one of the most lamest villains in the MCU. She is one dimensional with no real character growth at all, she is the same person in the beginning till end. She's just a psychopath, an annoying psychopath at that. Also, WAY TOO OVERPOWERED.However, I did enjoy almost everything else. I liked the Isaiah Bradley stuff, The Zemo stuff and the John Walker stuff but I feel like they could have cut some stuff out. I liked Sharon Carter and I don't really mind what happened to her compared to everyone else but she was really pushed into this show where she didn't really need to be. The show really was trying to do too much in too little time.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Hard-hitting disputes regarding Racism, Immigration, Equality are being debated with utmost sincerity. Controversial? Yes to some degree yet it may well be considered the boldest representation belonging to Superhero Fraternity thus far!Earlier, I quite liked their relatively newer conceptions for 'WandaVision'. I found those to be audacious attempts to reinvigorate our beloved superhero figures! They had gone up a few notches on this occasion and created what looks to be a coalescence of Action, Drama, and Social Message altogether!A zealous undertaking that shows a different point of view upon concurrent happenings all around the globe. It may sound preachy at certain moments; therefore, some people will be in unison and others would be infuriated. However, one couldn't disavow writers' continuing efforts to raise real-world problems through celebrated comic-book heroes these days!Technically competent, this show starts right where we left off previously following the events of 'Endgame'. Falcon & Winter Soldier; both having ample opportunities to present their side of the story. By providing insights into their private lives and inner conflicts; the narrative lays down their unique characteristics more than anything else.Anthony Mackie as Falcon and Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes have given utter commitments to their respective roles. In the meantime making those characters their very own! The supporting cast has been pretty good as well. In particular; Wyatt Russell as John Walker, Daniel Brühl as Zemo shall be mentioned.Even with only Six episodes of 50 minutes duration each, it does become sluggish from time to time. Another big complaint lies within its inept writing on the chief antagonist 'Karli' played by Erin Kellyman. I find the emotional mainstay of this individual to be almost non-existent! As a result, we couldn't empathize with any of her reasons.Lastly, word of advice; for the avid followers of Comic-book movies, the broader topic here might seem irrelevant and forcibly conducted. Although if you don't mind social matters being taken up in Superhero tales; don't worry, you would be having a good enough time.","5 out of 20 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A buddy story with Sam and Bucky? Yes please","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6843132/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieWarfare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tt_urv","24 April 2021","The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (TFATWS) is the next in Marvel Disney+ TV shows. While the previous show, WandaVision, did something new with the Superhero genre, TFATWS aims to bring the Captain America movie style to a TV show format. The premise is ""Six months after being handed the mantle of Captain America at the end of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) teams up with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) in a worldwide adventure that tests their abilities and their patience"". So does this series live up to the mantle or drops the ""shield"" completely?Firstly, I like the idea of the series. Having a series focused on Sam and Bucky who for the most part in the MCU movies are just Captain America sidekicks as the main focus for the show is great. Also having the series revolve around the legacy of the shield and Captain America is an interesting idea. They also explore interesting themes such as racism, refugees and corrupt governments while still retaining the core elements of the MCU movies.Sam is the main focus in the show and his struggle with the legacy and the responsibility of the shield is a great story. Throughout the show we see him explore what it means for a black person to take up the mantle and what Captain America means to the people. By the final episode, seeing Sam fully come into terms with his role is very fulfilling. Bucky is the secondary protagonist and he is struggling with his past as the Winter Soldier and a world without his best friend Steve. There is an exploration of his trauma and him trying to do right to all the victims of his past which is a nice story for his character. By the final episode, he finally knows what he needs to do and it's quite sad yet satisfying. The best part of the show is the banter between these 2 and their buddy cop antics are absolute highlights in the series.Another highlight in this series is John Walker played magnificently by Wyatt Russell. He is the new Captain America that is chosen by the government. Wyatt manages to perfectly make him hateable and that is quite the testament to Wyatt's performance. He isn't an outright villain though and they do give him a fair amount of sympathetic qualities with a character arc of sort for him as well. Another great support character is Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) who has some great moments that add some weight to Sam's story. Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) returns from Captain America Civil War as a sort of wildcard for Sam and Bucky. His return is great as we get to see a more fun side to him while still being quite the manipulator. His interactions with both Sam and Bucky add another level of tension to the dynamic. Additionally, he wears his iconic costume from the comics which is nice even though it doesn't make much sense for him to do so. Daniel Bruhl single-handedly stole every scene he was in thanks to his amazing performance.The cinematography by P. J. Dillon feels very ""movie like"" and I didn't get the TV show feeling when watching the series. There are some parts in the series where the visuals are quite gorgeous with an example being episode 3 where they are in Madripoor. Henry Jackman who scored Captain America Winter Soldier and Civil War returns to score and while none of the soundtracks is memorable, it does a good job in representing the scene without being overly distracting. There are great action scenes that utilize the power of the super soldiers and the flying suit of Falcon. Some fights are quite brutal and very memorable.Nevertheless, I have some issues with this series and the biggest one being the slow pacing. There are a lot of moments where it feels like not much story progression is occurring. This is most noticeable in episode 5 where the majority of the episode is just a lot of sitting around. For a series that is only 6 episodes, it is quite weird that it can still drag like this. There is also a lot of moments during the series where it seems to be more focused on building future stories which are mildly distracting from the main story. The final episode also handles John's final story arc in a really weird way that just feels completely sudden and it also contains a very cringe resolution that doesn't fit the series.I also have an issue with the main villain Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman) who is the leader of an anti-patriotism group the Flag Smashers who contains some members with super-soldier serum. The motive of the group is fine and understandable as they want to have open national borders. The problem is the leader of the group Karli is just not believable. She is extremely bratty and murder crazed that I do not understand how people look up to her. The actress Erin is okay but her performance is constantly outweighed by the better antagonist of John Walker and everyone else. It also baffles me how they are somehow able to fight on par with Bucky when he has literal assassin, military training and a vibranium arm but okay. Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) returns but I have mixed feelings about her. She is a lot darker as a character and doesn't resemble who she was in the Captain America movies which are mildly jarring. Her still being on the run from the government despite all the other Cap supporters being pardon makes no logical sense. Despite being blipped, she is also somehow able to build a massive fortune and completely change her personality doesn't feel believable. However, she is a lot more interesting than just being Peggy 2.0 so there is that.Overall, the series doesn't land all its shots but it certainly delivers on the epic scope you expect from Marvel. It has mature social commentary, hilarious moments, thrilling action sequences and great chemistry between Anthony and Sebastian that just meshes together like a charm.

I also have to give credit to Marvel regarding their well written inclusion of race politics and our very own perception of the society we live in. It infuses the show with a lot of relatability and makes the journey of Sam Wilson all the more poignant. His last speech, however, seemed a little too preachy moralistic to me and even made me cringe a little. It is an odd speech considering the intention of the show to leave absolute light and absolute dark behind and show us a lot of grey area.I did enjoy seeing the growing relationship between Sam and Bucky, even though I feel that Bucky got the short end of the stick when it comes to character development. It is obvious that he is not treated as an equal in that regard, which led to a lackluster and rushed final scene that was wholly disappointing. On the plus side, all the other small scenes that he had over the course of the show keep confirming me that Sebastian Stan is a fantastic actor when he gets the right material.Daniel Brühl as Zemo is top notch, but Daniel Brühl as an actor is always top notch. I am not really into all the memes that have flooded the internet, though, and I think they slightly take away from the impact he is supposed to have on the strong convictions of Sam and Bucky.Karli Morgenthau and her Flag Smashers never really grabbed me. Their motivations seem very muddled and Karli as a character remains completely flat and one-dimensional. This might not be entirely the fault of the writers or the actors, because there was supposed to be a major sub plot that had to be removed due to current events in the real world. Regardless, they don't really work in this series as a relatable foil for the downtrodden people on the planet.Sharon Carter is... not Sharon Carter anymore. They completely changed her character from the movies and while that change might be understandable from a world-building perspective, it remains to be seen whether it leads to anything worthwhile when she shows up again in future Marvel projects.The big standout of this entire show is John Walker, played brilliantly by Wyatt Russell. Instead of giving him the lazy antagonistic role to Sam Wilson that everyone expected, the writers decided to make him an extremely interesting character. Capable but flawed, good intentions but questionable executions. He surpasses all the typical super hero and super villain tropes that we are used to by now and I can't applaud Wyatt Russell enough for the way he plays that character. He is the greatest takeaway from this show and I am looking forward to seeing him again in the future.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

And extremely important in the overall MCU arc with these particular characters.While the action bits are, as ever, extremely well done, for me it's the character relations and 'slower' build up bits which are best and most effective. And it certainly fleshes out these people.Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are superb, and inhabit these characters perfectly (as tbh they always have). And with excellent support from the excellent Daniel Bruhl who has more time to expand on Zemo, and Walker as the false Cap too.Only very slight gripe: Sharon Carter's character just doesn't fit with what we've seen before, but there MAY be something hidden there?Overall damn fine, first class. Steve is still 'my' Cap (Chris Evans is just impossible to follow), but that's not to denigrate in any way Anthony Mackie who IS excellent and is a superb actor and character, but I felt this in the books too - Steve is Cap, Sam is the Falcon - overall an excellent addition to the MCU. Deserves more, either by Film or series (and again tbh the tv gives more time to play with - I was sceptical at first but am now fully on board).Congrats to all involved.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

These characters divide fans and created some fun discussions online.The actions also were pretty good throughout, especially the opening scene on the plane in the desert. The cap shield was used a lot more in this series like a boomerang, which was fun.My problem was one of the small plot about the Power Broker.

Oh, how naive I was.The handover of the Captain America shield to Falcon at the end of Endgame was a touching moment, which has been utterly eviscerated and recontextualised in this series. Social and political commentary in movies and TV shows can work when done correctly with some nuance. However, following on with the current trend in modern Hollywood, the overt nature in which the talking points are inserted into the show; it brings the story to a grinding halt.Add to that heaps of plot contrivances, character assassinations and mind boggling motivations (*cough cough*, Karli), the writing was a mess. The problem with this being a Cinematic Universe is that there are established story beats that came before, which is completely glossed over by the team of writers tackling the work now.","19 out of 28 found this helpful.

Infinity War, Endgame especially collapses into navel gazing nonsense because the writers refused to connect the villain to any ideology that any person in reality actual has ever had. Unfortunately, the films also come across as grandiose and comic relief aside self-serious a lot of the time. The best MCU properties are either the one that embrace the silliness, ala Ant-Man, or the ones that root the story in a pretty clear allegory or metaphor for a real world social/political theme, ala Winter Soldier, Black Panther. Loki (the show) takes the first track, this show takes the second. The show is centered on two real world issue (transmuted into comic-ese) that add a fair amount of weight. The first is the refugee crisis and the second is the Black experience in America. I am glad such more real world material crops up in Marvel and I wish they did it more often. It is much more engaging seeing a Black man struggle with taking up Cap's shield than seeing Falcon chasing the time stone (or whatever MacGuffin)The show kept me guessing with its thriller plot; the show kept my heart warm with its strong character beats and pathos; and the show kept me on the edge of my seat in some of the best action scenes of the MCU. This is a great miniseries that should please most fans-silly reactionaries will complain about ""wokeness"" (whatever that means).Bucky fans-myself included-should be especially please because he's finally given a good story and Stan turns in his most complete performance here. I ended up watching this last of the TV series because the reception has been more mixed. But I saved the best for last.","11 out of 38 found this helpful.

While the series doesn't bring a whole not new to the MCU, its commentary on freedom and what is means to be black in America do help move the universe toward being a more fleshed-out and inclusive world. Bucky and Sam are both characters mostly reserved to the background up to this point so it is refreshing to see them get some real development into the true heroes we all knew they could be.The action looks incredible with CG that is on par with what we usually get from Marvel Studios. The costumes also look incredible! Marvel has truly embraced the look on the comics with Falcon's new suit and I can't wait to see it more in the future. The series defiantly leans more heavily into the typical Marvel formula than 'WandaVision' before that but is not without its charm.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sadly, this show was a massive disappointment. Instead of writing an entertaining comic based story like the MCU movies, the writers instead chose to lecture its audience with the writers' take on modern day politics and treat us to one of the most boring and poorly conceived super hero plots ever. The main villain Carly is mind numbingly bad/cringe. To make matters worse, Bucky and Sam are completely written out of character. I fell asleep during more than one episode.

At best, these long form stories go deeper than cinematic predecessors. At worst, they are anemic cash grabs to prop up a new streaming platform. They know that if they wrangle subscribers early on, and advertise content in the pipeline (releasing logos for shows they haven't even staffed yet) shareholder happiness awaits.Ain't nothing wrong with storytelling as a business, because good storytelling will never be scarce. However, the fact that we are seeing MCU characters inhabiting CW quality writing and production (at times) should be disconcerting. The MCU flourished through a volley of quality writing which persistently advertised future content without ever failing to deliver on IP expectations in the moment. Not once from 2008-2019 did we live in the future of the MCU, accepting whatever was in front of us. We were in the moment, with our characters.We have crossed over into an era of living for the future (now advertised to be much bigger in scope/characters than phases 1-3), in which there is little incentive to keep ""things"" great, because there are now enough ""things"" to keep busy.We are transitioning from being told stories to simply consuming content, the fine China swapped for paper plates. Passing the threshold of sustainability, it is clear that if the MCU magic does evaporate one day, it will take years of healthy returns before the makers acknowledge it.And you know what, they deserve all the money in the world for giving us a generation of high quality pop culture. I'm just not going to pay a monthly subscription to watch treasured characters from my 2010s fade away, and I hope they know there are many of us who feel that way, and us leaving heralds something more significant for viewership. I assume they are prepared to fill our void with young viewers, the young avengers in the pipeline.In tech-visionary style live unveilings, Kevin Feige and Co have advertised expansion, but it might be a Trojan horse for deflation if this teetering at the top turns to a tumble. The best days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and perhaps superhero-centric storytelling, could very well be behind us. After the inevitable post-pandemic rehash gets us to Thor 4, we will likely seek something new, as the world has changed.The pearl of TFATWS: The Isaiah Bradley story deserves main stage attn...","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Created by Malcolm Spellman.-
While WandaVision excelled at writing, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier excelled at action. I was a little trepidatious about the concept at first, but ultimately I really liked it! The Falcon & Winter Soldier combination worked better than I expected, especially since both characters have a connection to super soldiers.-
I think the most important aspect of the entire show was the discussion of race. Marvel is finally starting to understand what it means to be diverse, and while there is still a long way to go, this show pushed us a great deal towards what it looks like to be inclusive and understanding.-
In terms of the story itself, I was decently confused by all of the conflicting parties. If you were to ask me to recap this show in detail, I would struggle, but I could definitely tell you I was entertained. Although I never really questioned who would be Captain America after Endgame (it seemed like Sam was always the perfect fit), which made the show seem unnecessary in terms of the grand scheme of things.-
If I ever got bored or was irritated with any characters in this show (William Burnside, I'm looking at you), the final episode totally negated those feelings. The helicopter scene alone would warrant a decent rating, but there were also quite a few full circle moments (which I love) and wholesome moments too.-
Overall, there was great action, great characters, and I loved the tie back to the origin story of Captain America. I'm excited to see how this leads into future movies, especially if it includes more of this unconventional duo.-

Seriously, this New Captain America guy never would've made it in the movies, and I can see how Evans beat this actor out for the role. Every scene he's in is maddening, and not (just) because of how he's written.. Maybe this show would be better without him, but I still doubt it'd gain more than a point. Falcon, Bucky, Zemo, the Dora, Val, and Isaiah & his nephew (?) are outstanding. Even Sharon's new capacity is well done. Karli & friends are good. Everyone else, however, is trying way too hard to be a well-financed, bad-azz cosplayer.Even the closed captioning is a bust - it can't tell the difference between thunder and fireworks.And that, boys & girls, pretty much sums up the whole show.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The difficulty here is they are trying to push supporting actors into the fore during a lockdown, and in this short format they've chosen not to give each enough detail before the end of each episode. Before Phase 3 Marvel - a very simplified title - used to be really good at multiple delivery paths that all connected up; they didn't need to bog the films down with too much detail because they had side projects that filled you in. One Shots and shows like Agents of Shield or Agent Carter connected to the films. They might not have been great for everyone, but they supplied a more developed look at the Universe Marvel have created, and worked the time slot format allotted.Here, we have Sam Wilson dealing with his future, his family, his life. Bucky Barnes trying to shake off his past, his future and his life, all against the massive politics of a post Endgame world that seems far to political for a franchise that's more used to smashing aliens in the face and blowing stuff up, alongside shoehorning in real world issues that the writers probably read in the morning paper.Mackie, Stan and particularly Brühl do great work with what they're given, and Carl Lumbly is as captivating as always, yet the fact it only got one acting nod for the Emmy's - and even MCU stalwart Don Cheadle doesn't know why he got that - is more testament to the poor writing than the talent. It's an angry time and everyone is angry, but with so many threads, it's just not enjoyable. Erin Kellyman as Karli Morgenthau had all the backstory and knowledge to make a great villain, but they wasted that potential by saddling the story with so much extra political wrangling that she became another lost kid. While Wyatt Russell as John Walker manages to create the MCU's most hated character after barely any screen time! And bringing Emily VanCamp back as Sharon ""Like he said! Captain's orders!"" Carter, is a good nod to the Winter Soldier film, but it is so obvious what they're doing with her character they might as well include it in the credits.Ultimately, people will watch this as a tee up for Phase 4. They'll watch it because they love Mackie and Stan. And they'll feel let down by how you could condense it down to one episode ready for Captain America 4 and not feel you'd missed anything.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

An explanation for the motivations of the Flag Smashers.What I know for sure though, it's that neither Bucky Barnes not Sam Wilson have enough charisma or oomph to carry a show or a movie.

The character-driven show features exceptional dialogues and terrific performances from its leads, but the supporting cast steals the spotlight on several occasions, especially Daniel Brühl. The ""Black Captain America"" narrative and the subplot involving John Walker and a deep exploration of Cap's mantle are undoubtedly the most compelling, well-developed arcs of the whole series, though I appreciated every second spent with Sam dealing with his family issues and Bucky with his amends. However, the Morgenthau-led Flag Smashers fail to become more than just misunderstood, annoying antagonists, while Sharon Carter just feels like a completely out-of-place, unnecessary marketing strategy. Kari Skogland tries to keep every episode at a high level of quality, ultimately struggling with pacing issues and balance of storylines. In the end, she succeeds in leaving the viewers more emotionally attached to the (new) main heroes.""Rating: B-","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sam Wilson/Falcon(Anthony Mackie) & Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier(Sebastian Stan) reluctantly team up, to stop a new global threat.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a mind-blowing TV show. The Marvel Cinematic Universe knocks it out of the park, yet again! Director Kari Skogland, writer-creator Malcolm Spellman & Marvel head Kevin Feige have given this show all the ingredients, that has made the Marvel Cinematic Universe the most successful franchise ever. Each episode is better than the previous one & leaves you wanting more. Five episodes in & I'm waiting with bated breath, for the series finale. This show surpasses the previous Marvel Disney+ show, WandaVision(2021). The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are perfect. It's wonderful to see Sam & Bucky get significant character arcs, in their titular show. Anthony Mackie is outstanding as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Sebastian Stan is spectacular as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. Mackie & Stan share this effortless camaraderie, in all their scenes together. Wyatt Russell is brilliant as John Walker. Erin Kellyman is amazing as Karli Morgenthau. Daniel Bruhl is unforgettable as Baron Zemo. Emily VanCamp is perfect as Sharon Carter. Adepero Oduye is great as Sarah Wilson. The supporting cast is excellent. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a must watch for all Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. Now, I can't wait for the rest of the movies & shows left on Marvel's schedule, this year!","9 out of 32 found this helpful.

So high that if any other Marvel show makes one mistake it will be noticed. Unfortunately that is the case with Falcon and Winter Solider.Personally I love this show, but I do have some issues with the script.I don't care for some of the storyline they gave Sam. I don't believe that an Avenger wouldn't be able to get a loan. There is enough of a support system there from the other Avengers and especially Pepper Potts. Nope, that was forced and it was annoying. Also the whole Super Soldier bit.... Really? It was so stupid.Marvel you have always been great with your diversity so stop pandering and just let the characters thrive.So yeah I do have mixed feelings about the script, but Sam and Bucky are great together. I will let a lot of weak points slide because I just love the characters. I wasn't the biggest Bucky fan, probably never will be but man they are doing a good job with showing the trauma he carries for what he did. That softens me up a bit about him.I am looking forward to the show just getting better with each episode without turning into some social justice pandering. Like come on these are Avengers.

The storyline follows The Falcon as a reluctant hero that doesn't want to pick-up where Captain America left-off as a super hero. The Winter Soldier tries to encourage him but as The Falcon delays a new villain with ideas of his own emerges.This series was created by Malcolm Spellman (Empire) and stars Anthony Mackie (The Hurt Locker), Sebastian Stan (Black Swan), Erin Kellyman (The Green Knight), Daniel Brühl (Alienist) and Emily VanCamp (Revenge).The storyline for this is entertaining, action packed and worth following. Brühl's character was unpredictable, well written and very well delivered. I didn't love the way Mackie's character was written, but it fit within the plot and Mackie and Stan's chemistry was great making their performances worthwhile. There's some great cameos in this and they do a good job of intermittently injecting other parts of the Marvel universe into this movie. The conclusion to this is excellent and makes the series worth getting through.Overall this was a good, not great, series that is worth watching whether you're a die hard Marvel fan or not. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

By far the best thing about this season is Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan's chemistry as The Falcon and Bucky Barnes. Every scene the two shared together was fun to watch, and the arcs of both their respective characters developed in a meaningful manner that brought closure to the life-changing events in movies like Avengers: Endgame. Other characters I loved were Baron Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), a character who is far more interesting here than he ever has been, and even John Walker (Wyatt Russell) is also a fascinating character even though his arc feels a bit rushed near the end.The show also delves into the complicated political realm of today in the last two episodes, especially talking about The Falcon's identity as a Black man and what that means for someone trying to step into the shoes of Steve Rogers, and I thought the writers handled it as well as they could have in six episodes. However, when it comes to politics, there are some aspects that don't quite pan out; specifically the villain characters, known as the Flag Smashers. This group, as menacing as they may sound, has such a justified reason for existing that I never saw them as villains, yet the show always presents them as an entity to be destroyed. This seemed a bit short-sighted, and the show never seemed to know what to do with these characters, so they aren't given much of an ending.THE FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER is yet another bingeable and fun superhero show for those who want it that provides enough subtext to keep people looking for something deeper happy until the next MCU entry. It definitely isn't close to being the best project the MCU has churned out, but it is still definitely worth the watch to see how The Falcon and Bucky evolve into the next stage of their stories.

Although the beginning of this backloaded mini series did not catch my attention; ( I attribute that to it seeming like they just through action in my face). But as the plot progressed I grew to appreciate the cinematic action quality within a tv mini series.The additional elements that added to my enjoyment was:
1. Bootleg Cap:
My dislike for the 'next' Captain America, made other characters seem more interesting.2. He's not ' The Black Flacon' he is THE Flacon
Did Marvel effectively display race and ethical issues while steering it into a positive direction? All while giving hope to not only the black community but to those who believe in the peace that comes along with the persona of Captain America.Yes they did, Anthony Mackie shines in this mini series. Not only does it seem like he is the main attraction, his character gained the opportunity to display more of his personality within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Winter Solider shows some character growth and they used his character in a supporting.Verdict: Falcon and Winter Solider didn't wow me. The issues revolves around politics which may be viewed one way or another. But it does have some cinematic worthy action scenes, sufficient character growth, and a satisfactory story being told.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Without going much into the plot, the series takes place in what I call a PTSD Saga i.e. After the blip, war, and whatnot. The series primarily deals with the aftermath of the blip returnees and how the governments are handling the situation. We see a set of new characters straight out of comics, let's say all the patriots are here, with a few callbacks, as usual. A good ending regardless.The directing was good, the costumes were just too good, the chemistry between the characters and the comedic scenarios were on point. The premise was good and understandable but as the series progress, the characters let's just say were out of the role. The main antagonist and its team never felt a strong connection and their dialogues were pretty bad. An enjoyable watch.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

While Winter Soldier is at least slightly interesting with his programming and mysterious past, the Falcon is still an absolute joke. Both of them are tertiary heroes on the Marvel hierarchy so what made the creators think that anyone would want to watch an entire show about them? The first two episodes are borderline unwatchable as the protagonists mop about and preach ideas that ultimately amount to nothing while setting up the struggle that is hard to take seriously. Then things get kind of interesting.Zemo appears to save this miserable series as he instantly reenergizes the atmosphere with his charisma and impactful presence. As a result, the original characters stop being so pathetic and the plot goes from nonsense to somewhat watchable. However, my favorite part is this ""New Captain America"" who acts as a true capitalistic character in a capitalistic system. The machine needs a cog and no matter how sentimental or heartless it is, the memory of the old cog, Steve Rogers, will be forgotten. His cockiness, self-confidence and personal drive feel refreshing as he brings something new to Marvel.I wouldn't say you need to watch this series as it feels like a hollow cylinder stuffed with pretentiousness that acts as a filler without adding value to the big picture. From the protagonists and antagonists to the plot itself along with all the preaching, everything just feels so fake and soulless. They try to add substance and meaning to the plot but they overstuff it with political agenda and just can't seem to make it look authentic. If you got nothing to watch, then do check it out as there are some nice moments but in the end, its just another filler for the movies.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for more Tv Show and Movie reviews.","36 out of 59 found this helpful.

Circumstances have allowed me to sit on my thoughts on the show for a couple of weeks, and allow healthy bit of perspective to sit in.Unwilling to keep hold of a shield that he doesn't feel worthy of, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) hands it over to the Government. He and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) then start to investigate a terrorist organisation that is seeking to establish rights for refugees created by the return of the population, following the events of ""Endgame"". Their investigation has them turn to old friends, and enemies, for help before the government does the unthinkable, and choses a new Captain America themselves.Perhaps sensibly, ""Falcon"" doesn't try and do anything as inventive as ""Wandavision"" did. It's a much more traditional action 'buddy-cop' type story - though it does cleverly build on the narratives that have been running through the larger story for years. The action scenes, of which there is roughly one per episode are very well done though, and look as expensive and polished and anything we've seen in the movies. One of the themes that works well is bringing in the comics character of Isaiah Bradley, played by Carl Lumby, who tells his story as an African American who was forced to take the super soldier serum and survived, only to be imprisoned at tested on. His experiences juxtaposed against Sam's optimism are a good subplot.Less successful is the principle antagonists of the show, the terrorist organisation The Flag Smashers. Though Erin Kellyman is excellent, and it's great to hear any English accent other than a greater London/Estuary English one on a show of this scale, I don't feel I ever really got a handle on what their goal was. Daniel Bruhl though, is excellent as the returning Baron Zemo and though the show doesn't really offer any hint of it I really hope the MCU finds a way to use him again.If ""Wandavision"" was connecting tissue on the way to the next ""Doctor Strange"" film, ""Falcon"" feels like it opens up a range of stories and characters that can be used going forward.

The Isaiah stuff was the best part of the show and i'm glad we got to learn about it. The fighting was the laziest part of the show, hated how bucky lost almost every fight against humans with zero training, the serum jus made them strong, it didn't give them training so that was annoying all season. It was a lot of little things that kinda ruined every episode for me. Don't get me
started on the flag smashers.....worst product we've seen in the MCU, did not care one bit about them or karli. Overall it was mediocre with the exception of a couple episodes. It could have been amazing it taken more serious but excited for the future of our new cap.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The action was still top draw but I'm intrigued at what's already been teased about the characters back stories and personalities. Anthony Mackie is a really good actor and has the perfect charisma, swagger and arrogance for Falcon. However, he can now also develop more of his moral, patriotic and loyal side of his personality that we see glimpses of in the films. Winter Soldier is my favourite Marvel film because of the live action and not too much CGI and because of the Winter Soldier character. Sebastian Stan is a good actor and also now has the opportunity to show this off and develop the character like Makie. I can't wait for episode 2","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

Additionally, the emotional depth of the story is truly impressive, as the characters grapple with issues of identity, legacy, and responsibility.The performances of Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan as Sam and Bucky are outstanding, bringing nuance and complexity to their characters. The supporting cast is also fantastic, including Wyatt Russell as John Walker, the new Captain America, and Erin Kellyman as Karli Morgenthau, the leader of a radical group.Overall, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a must-watch for Marvel fans and newcomers alike.

The episode opens with a thrilling action sequence that is absolutely first rate, and lasts about 9 minutes of the roughly 44 minute runtime. Almost none of the rest of the episode contains any action at all, focusing instead on telling us more about the lives of Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier). This is not bad. It ranges from funny to touching stuff, but in comparison to the thrilling action at the beginning, it's more than a touch boring.But there is hope.

"7","/10","Thank God for Wyatt Russell and Carl Lumbly!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6873983/?ref_=tt_urv","benmundie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94551008/?ref_=tt_urv","2 May 2021","'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' is the second Disney+ show from Marvel Studios. Many characters reprised their roles from previous films with larger parts, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) both become titular characters, as oppose to supporting characters for Chris Evans' 'Steve Rogers'. We pick up with the characters in a post 'Avengers: Endgame' world; Sam has returned to the US Air Force and Bucky is just carrying on with life whilst trying to adjust to life after 'the Blip'.The chemistry between the two main characters carries every episode and leads to some great comedic moments. Making these two the star of there own show gives them some well needed development and takes their arcs to the next level. The standout performances come from Wyatt Russell and Carl Lumbly as 'John Walker' and 'Isaiah Bradley' respectively. John Walker is an exceptional secondary villain who becomes the new Captain America. One that was handpicked to take up the mantle despite not doing anything to deserve it. Whilst Isaiah Bradley is a black Captain America from the Second World War, who was imprisoned and experimented on to test the super soldier serum, just to finally be removed from all records and pronounced dead. These two are perfect mirrors of each other and display the theme of legacy that runs throughout the show.Henry Jackman (the composer) returns from the previous 'Captain America' films. His work is always exceptional but this time round he excels. He seamlessly brings scores back from previous movies, most notably 'The Winter Soldier' theme from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. The effects throughout are perfect and I don't think there is an over reliance on CGI like there has been in previous Marvel pictures. I love the comic accuracy of the show, from Falcon's new suit to Madripoor, but the best example is Daniel Bruhl's 'Baron Zemo'. He returns from 'Captain America: Civil War' and is absolutely fantastic. They finally embrace him being a 'Baron' like in the comics and they elevate his motives to the next level, with his hate of the Flag Smashers.The best episodes are; 1:2 ('The Star-Spangled Man'), 1:4 ('The World is Watching') and 1:5 ('Truth').However, my main issue is the main villains 'The Flag Smashers'. The head of this terrorism group is Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman) and they don't pose a threat to the protagonists in the slightest. The acting is solid from her, but the writing is quite inconsistent for the group and her motives don't really make sense. I think it would've benefited with John Walker as the main antagonist instead because his arc is undoubtedly more interesting than Morgenthau's. Also, it is really obvious that they had to scrap a subplot that was in the original script. The plot line was reportedly centred around a global pandemic and was removed as it too closely resembles the current issues in real life. This could've been a reason behind the Flag Smashers inconsistency as they play a big part in that subplot.Overall, I do think this show was an improvement on 'WandaVision' and nicely sets up future MCU titles that feature these characters. I can't wait to see where these characters go next and hope to see more of John Walker.8.5/10.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

But the ending doesn't make up for the beginning. Overall it's a good show but nothing special, neither of the leads are strong enough characters to be standalone in the early stages and they ruined a perfect villain in Zemo. The different take on the enemy group is a nice twist and led by a fresh lead villain which is appreciated, as is the new Cap figure, but nothing flows or gets you gripped at any point for the first half of the series. Plus Carter is an unwelcome and disappointing return. It could have been a whole lot better.People complaining about it being 'woke' are ridiculous, and it's barely political to call out a society's former and continued discrimination. This doesn't really enter the story until the latter episodes and all it does is add substance and context to some of the most important characters. Superhero stories are about good and evil, therefore morality within government structure is of course a valid route to go down. It's got to have some political leaning and it does this without aggressively pushing any movement other than combatting ignorance. Evidently fictional discrimination is perfect for some audiences but bringing real life into a universe increasingly becoming more in line with modern day contexts is too far.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Comics are always political","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6832480/?ref_=tt_urv","hotrobinproductions","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46169466/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2021","Just stared watching the show after waiting for the episodes. Just felt like I'd rather binge than to wait. Because Wanda vision was an issue regarding that. However this is a different caliber so I feel the story really delivers and doesn't necessarily leave anything open ended compared to Wanda vision. So watching this and taking it all in was very nice, like watching a very long movie... but with that said I'd like to address allot of these people regarding the politics... frankly I disagree with some of the political agendas the tv show is going for, but Just because a movie or show has political themes you shouldn't bash the thing, it's a different angle and you have to judge it as a movie accordingly. This show really delivers on angels without feeling cringey or forced. Look at the CW and how they handle politics and compare it to this and see what's worse... this is coming from a die hard dc fan. I love this show, it's solid, the issues I'd have with it are the main villain, story and plot just feel convoluted. However the action is probably the greatest from any tv show regarding superhero's. Very good action (daredevil I think is #1 with the action) show has issues, no denying that. But a 5/10 or lower is completely unnecessary as the show does deliver at least the basic things a show should deliver. And more. Solid marvel show, I prefer Wanda vision more but this is still solid. If anything it's a little over a 7/10 but I'll be lenient and give it a 8/10... that's ONLY if the finale blows me away. So far no episodes has really blown me away other than the one when ""captain"" does that insane gut wrenching thing at the end. But fingers crossed. If the finale is just average then I would give the show a 7/10 overall. If it's at least a 8/10 Or better I would finish rating this show at a 8/10 overall.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Unfortunately this was like sitting through a lecture on political agenda, it was tedious and and at times felt like you were getting beaten with a stick and being force fed left wing propaganda. The 'villains' were so bland that you have to question the casting director and wonder how they selected Karli as the main protagonist. Zemo & Captain America were pretty interesting to a point but they were overshadowed by the boring social commentary that even outweighed the action. It's actually really disappointing to write this, I'm hoping that Loki lightens things up a bit and the comic book escapism returns.","55 out of 97 found this helpful.

Unfortunately this gets mostly dropped after 2-3 episodes. Instead the storyline introduces more of the usual superhero-cringe gonzo that plagues most of the genre. I lost interest in the middle of episode 4 and it's unlikely that I will continue.The narrative is more conservative than WandaVision, but they are similar in that they both fall apart and back to the basic genre tropes in their second half.Performances are good, though Anthony Mackie tries to do the whole 6 episodes with just 1 facial expression.One thing that really bugged me in this one is the use of actors that do not even slightly attempt to speak like their role would demand to.Erin Kellyman speaks so broad british and this is so distracting from her role.Also, even german Daniel Brühl was not allowed to pronounce ""Dr. Nagel"" correctly. Why using german names at all, if you refuse to use them properly?Minor stuff, but still annoying.If you are looking for something fresh and innovative like WandaVision (though it did not hold its promise after mid-season!) then you will need to give this a pass.If you want a mediocre, gonzo supers-stuff narrative like from the nineties, but with the cgi-department from 2021, then give it a try.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Beloved fictional character ruined by real-world politics","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7061346/?ref_=tt_urv","rothangangte","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89378975/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2021","I loved Steve Rogers' character in the MCU. He appears to be a man of solid character who was not afraid to stand up to the man for what was right.He stood up for his childhood friend against the world and men who are ""basically gods"". He tried hard to make sure that friend does not commit heinous crimes: ""Bucky stop! You're gonna kill someone."" ""I don't wanna kill anyone, I don't like bullies..."" He appears to be a man who genuinely values human life.Cut to Sam Wilson. I'm not saying he should be like Steve. He shouldn't be; He should be Sam. Sam's character in the MCU has been really good so far. Yes, he has so far been in the shadow of Steve as Captain America. The way his character has been built up in the MCU so far, no one else is more appropriate and deserving of Captain America's shield.The main issue, I find with this series is the plot. The story appears forced towards identity politics especially in the last episodes. The writer have made it apparent and clear that Sam was reluctant to hurt the Flag Smashers not because they are human beings but because he sympathizes or empathizes with their cause / politics because he is in tribe ""Black"" and they are tribe ""Refugees"".This logic may work in real life for some with tribal mindset. But an MCU superhero? We have come to see our superheroes as beyond politics. Just because Sam Wilson is ""black"" in America, he could not rise to the character level and maturity of T'chala (at least the way he was portrayed in his one movie).Also, couldn't they have spent a few more dollars and made a proper costume for Sam? It looked loose and super cheap for Wakandan Tech.Since the series writer seems to be writing for Captain America 4, lets hope Sam isn't made to lift Mjolnir because of Affirmative Action.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was a big chance to give Winter soldier and Falcon more depth as characters and instead it went all in on the struggles of being a black super hero. It took the spotlight from the show, the subplots and the villain.Reading the news is a good way to make anybody depressed. Racism is just depressing and super hero shows is usually a good way to take a break from reality.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

And the ending of episode 4 was neat (but didn't have anything close to the impact on the last two episodes as it should have), and I guess the final episode was better than WandaVision's?Mackie and Stan do well with what they're given, too. The show is at its best when it feels like a buddy movie between them- they have good chemistry. Russell's character is also interesting, but they don't utilise him to his full potential.And I guess there's potential to do interesting things with some of these characters going forward?That's probably the most I can say when it comes to positives. For at least a good half of the series, I found it pretty tedious to get through. Lots of the action scenes were too ambitious for the show's budget (just give us one or two really great action setpieces rather than like 10 that range in quality from decent to inept). Episode 3 is the low point of the show- it's packed with really lame, poorly shot action and a plot that makes no sense (the worst of both worlds).The show looks pretty bland, and the editing is sometimes atrocious. Writing is disappointing too, and the pacing is strange. Sometimes things feel drawn out, and at other times, things happen too quickly.Probably more subjective but so many of the characters here I didn't like, too. I know Zemo is popular, but I didn't enjoy him here (nor did I in Civil War, really). The other villains are also among the worst antagonists I've seen in a Marvel film/show so far. Same goes for Sharon Carter... actually, I guess I dislike all the characters who are either villainous or morally grey? The show just doesn't handle those kinds of characters well at all.It might be my least favourite thing in the MCU so far, and while it's not bad to the point where I want to give up on any Marvel properties going forward (and it's not without some redeeming qualities that keep me from going lower score-wise), it was a pretty bland and disappointing series for me, in all honesty.","22 out of 35 found this helpful.

To neutrally review. As much as I love these two characters, their dynamic and the MCU, this series almost shattered my hopes for what lays ahead.The cast. I imagine it to be hard for the supporting cast to outshine Smacky especially with the script you've been given. No background story, no character development, literally nothing you can work with to make your (bad) character shine. Even Emily (Sharon Carter) felt a little out of place.The plot. I wonder why Kevin Feige greenlight this. The writers clearly struggled with the story and to me, not much felt right. I questioned the characters, their actions, and motives which I never did before.Bottom line: the series gives you so much input on Smacky's personalities. The life after. How they try to move forward and what their personal lives feel like. With that being said, I kind of missed a moment where Sam realizes, the shield actually belongs to Bucky. Why? Well, let's just face it, at the end of Endgame, Bucky sort of pushed Sam to go to Steve. I had the feeling that Bucky, although tired of fighting would've been better off with the shield. For the sake of redemption. Steve knew what Bucky's been through, what terrible things he has done. It would've been such an honor, coming from his best friend, that everything's forgiven and that it's time to shine for him.Wow, what a great series this could've been. Just the two of them, facing life and it's struggles. But Marvel gave us this instead. A terrible writing, a warmed-up story filmed half-hearted.I can't believe I'm saying this, but for once, I'm glad it's over and I really hope, they stick to their promise that this was a limited series only.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was well written, especially for all the difficulties that this series went through, it did well. I feel the chemistry between the actors who play Falcon and Winter Soldier was great. I want to share my concern about the negative reviews. I see some people are saying the plot. I get that because the story had to be changed due to similarities to the pandemic. However, the comments that it was too politically was outrageous. This is what I find interesting: if Falcon who is a black man shares his experience and what life would be like as a black person, it's political. On the other hand if Wanda Maximoff has relations with an inanimate object and her desires for it, that's wonderful storytelling. That's a great storyline. I am shock and appalled. They said the villian was not as strong. There have been several villians in the MCU who were not so strong but that did not mean the plot was weak.Here is Carly's mission in the series: she wanted to restore things the way it was during the blip. People were united as one people and one world without political borders. Her cause does get blurred. Her means of going about it was to attack the GRC(Global Reparation Comittee) because they were trying to figure out how to put all these displaced people back in home and fed. Unfortunately, people were not getting enough supplies and food. Remember when half the universe was destroyed people on planet Earth helped one another. Carly wanted it back that way. Also GRC was favoring one group over the other. The power broker gave Carly the means to get what she wanted. Carly needed to be stopped due to her insane tactics (not due to her goals). Can the Falcon and Winter Soldier stop her or will she succeed in destroying the GRC? Will Carly succeed in getting one world and one people again.The story arc for John Walker was amazing. He truly changed throughout the series. I loved Zimo in this series as well. He was the same Zimo in the Civil War, but he is more fleshed out in this series. The story, the characters and the action were fun and great.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Overall this shows pacing, action, acting and story is very strong however the finale is messy like wandavision. There is one character who felt like they were evil for the reason of being evil. Lead actors Stan and Mackie do an amazing job, Bruhl steals many scenes, Kellymen is a nice mcu addition as for Emily Vancamp she does the best she can with what is a underwritten small role.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Falcon and the Winter Soldier are probably two of the least interesting Marvel characters to me and I wasn't really looking forward to watching this show at all but since I'm a huge Marvel fan I need to watch everything. Also I knew that the Dora Milaje would make an appearance (even tho no Okoye, which I take personally) so that at least would (and did) rock.So imagine my surprise when I watched this show and found myself enjoying it immensely, not WandaVision-immensely but it had a solid plot, good actors, few but perfectly timed gags (I enjoy a villain with a sense of humor) and a few dialogues about race and racism that had been long overdue.For all the whiny crybabies stomping their little feet about how this show is ""too political"", it wasn't. There was no long discussion, no litany of legitimate allegations all of which could have been there. The show only scratched the surface of the problem and coming movies will hopefully take up and go on from here.All in all a surprisingly good show, didn't expect it but enjoyed it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

SERIOUSLY. I grew up with these comics. The Falcon was one of my favorites. #1 of his limited series hangs in my den. But the overpowering smell of blame, hate, and discontent in this series just makes me sad. There's just no subtlety involved in this project. Somehow we have to shoe-horn in some cops harassing Sam who is literally just standing there talking to someone. Really? The cops have to be bad guys so badly that it's come to this? That's just lazy writing to check someone's box.Production quality of the show is top-notch. Anthony Mackey is a beast, and is outstanding in nearly everything I've seen him in. Amazingly versatile and underused in the MCU. He can portray depth with just a look. Sabastian Stan plays great off of him, and I look forward to seeing more work from him.But the writing is just awful. It's so slanted and distorted that it hurts to watch. Black Female super soldier can commit murder, and she's a victim, male White non-super soldier commits murder, and he's a villain. And, it's an immediate message. There's no misunderstanding. It's really sort of shameful. The comics accomplished more and with much better quality messaging. It really broke my heart to see it.Sam was more brawny and tougher in the comics, but he and Cap set out to really champion what was right - regardless of the cost. Even when it meant calling out injustice in America. I loved it. This product is just more social pandering. A real lost opportunity.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The villain in this show was quite boring and dull. She was so unlikable. I liked Bucky and Sam. Their relationship was very special and perfect for such a short tv show. The new Captain America was so annoying, which was quite perfect for the show, because it was intended. He was very 3-dimensional at times. He had feelings, emotions and a friend, which made him human and somewhat understandable. Bucky got to grow as a character, which I enjoyed quite a bit as well. Making Sam the new Captain America, was the perfect choice. He is going to be so great. The best part about this show was probably Zemo. He was hilarious and interesting. I really enjoyed his character in this show.

It is written perfectly to today's world and the cinematography in every scene is amazing. One of the things people were more hyped to see was the chemistry between Sam Wilson and Bucky Barns. And honestly it doesn't disappoint for a moment. From the moment they hate working with each other till the point they trust each other and are close friends. Anthony Mackie is a amazing actor and he finally gets to step up in a major bigger role in the MCU. Sebastian Stan is great and delivers a lot of emotional moments along with Mackie. Daniel Bruel returns as Baron Zemo and gives a great and awsome performance, defently a good character who I believe we are yet to see more of him in the future. The show in general is fabulous for planting in the marvel universe a true image of today's world: racism, discrimination, world problems such as poverty and refuge. This series doesn't give answers to any of this but does hint that it's time to move forward and do better, just like Sam says in the final episode. The show does give a better view on how the U. S ""gives"" respect to it's veterans and how they prefer who's better for the image of the U. S. until finally Sam steps up and takes the mantality of Captain America. I can't wait foe Marvel to release more content similar to this show because at the end of the day, this is the kind of shows that interest people. Shows full of action that represent a good and realistic image of reality.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

First , I wasn't expecting a lot from it , But they did A great Job And I was quite Surprised , impressed and Amazed by the way the handled it , The Overall Tone , The Aspects they revisited and gave them More attention and Depth
✅Great Directing 🎬
✅Investing in the Characters That were not given Enough Focus in the previous Movies 👍
✅Quite Remarkable Character Development & Growth Providing the challenges they were facing That required Such a Strong determination
✅The characters' aspects and layers That were explored In Both Sam and Bucky By giving them Much more Space to Grow and to Explore , These were some of the Strongest & most defining , remarkable Aspects of the Show ❤
✅Zemo's Character was oneof the Remarkable Elements but I didn't like the way They concluded his short adventure , Even Though I know that he's not done yet with the Mcu ❤🔥
✅The Transformation That Sam Went Through this Experience was so Compelling and Satisfying 👌
✅Bringing Back the Captain america :""The winter soldier"" and ""Civil War "" Soundtracks 🎶 Achieved such a deep Emotional Effect and brought us back to some of the most memorable Moments by recreating them in a similar way and Circumnstances as well
✅And of course , there is Quite a Great Establishing and Set-up for more Exciting Things to Come 🔥❌I didn't like the unbalanced Pacing , Sometimes they get forward without proper , enough Set Up , and when the time comes to Push the Events forward , They Slow everything down like the fifth episode , That's the way I see it
❌There was clearly lots of Flaws and Weaknesses in the Script 😒 , Some Details were poorly set like the whole Power Broker Thing , The Flag Samshers didn't have enough Setting up ...
And the Quick jumps into Conclusions just like The Season Finale are the Very clear Example of many
*These were uncompelling and prosaic Elements That really decreased The Shows Quality
❌ There was a lot of superficiality and shallowness in dealing with some of the elements in the plot and that's on the Writers and The Director who were less resourcefull in certain detailsMy Final Rating : 7,5-8/10 ✅
*I really enjoyed this Experience and I'm liking the job that marvel is doing and I'm very optimistic about the future of The Mcu and looking forward to witness the Many Storylines that are set to be told in the next Chapters.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The six episode series develops the characters of Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson in satisfying ways and it makes for some brilliant moments. Add in the introduction of Wyatt Russell's character as well as returns of Zemo and Sharon Carter and this is the marvel we have come to know over the years. Some great action and the banter between our two leads are my favourite takeaways from the series, and the finale concluded the series in as satisfying way as possible. Although, I wasn't a massive fan of the Flag Smasher group, I thought they were too cheesy for me and cliche. And it shouldn't be compared to WandaVision as the two shows have separate narratives.

Action, check. Humour, check. Political? Well, yeah. Any series that dealing with a government, or ruling party, is by nature, political. How about being overly 'woke'? Well, the social concious is constantly evolving, changing. The idea of wokedness is overused and irrelevant. How about 'BLM'? Well, in the comics, there was a storyline where Sam Wilson becomes Capt. America, which happens decades ago. The Marvel Universe didn't end at Avengers: Endgame, it continues on. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, as other movies and series, like 'WandaVision', sets the groundwork for new movies and series. But, my review of the series? It's solid, but slightly preachy. Not as action packed, or as full of humour as earlier offerings, but it isn't supposed to be. It deals with politics, espionage, and intrigue. It deals with organizations, dark and known, trying to gain the upper hand in global affairs, not magical beings, aliens, or mutants. It should be watched for what it is, and not as we think it should be.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The stares, the judgment. And there's nothing I can do to change it. Yet, I'm still here. No super serum, no blond hair, or blue eyes. The only power I have is that I believe we can do better.""Marvel's second tv series in the MCU follows Sam Wilson allying himself with Bucky Barnes to embark on a series of international adventures to thwart the activities of the Flag-Smashers, an anti-patriotism terrorist cell. Over the course of their mission, they test their abilities and patience. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier had us all hyped up following the success of WandaVision. Maybe my hopes were too high, or maybe it's just the show, but in the end I felt letdown. That's not to say I didn't like the show because I did look forward to the new episode each week. It definitely has its issues with story, but it brings the action that we all love to see with each Marvel installment. Firstly, the acting is great. Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are quite fun together. They gained character development off of each other that couldn't be gained on their own. Fun jokes and disagreements are made along the way for our entertainment. We also get dramatic tension that questions both the characters and us as an audience on where we stand on the matter. It's a little strange to see Sam accepting everything at the end of Endgame and returning to a state of unwillingness, but I can understand even with the small period of time after which it takes place.When it comes to villains, this is where it becomes a little unstable. The Flag-Smashers were poorly written. Their motives were too surface level to see as an actual threat. Karli, the leader, felt very underdeveloped and could've been such a good antagonist. Part of this is because of plot taken out due to the pandemic, but still much more could've been done. John Walker is one of the more interesting antagonists in the MCU. Wyatt Russell plays him so well and good for him. Literally, I've never seen a character hated so much in the small amount of time we knew him within the first episode. His arc is good and I'm glad to see how unhinged they went.As for story, this is the root most of the problem. The story is good, but nothing special. This story isn't anything new or groundbreaking. Marvel likes to milk all they can out of each character or story from last installments, and this felt like one of the cases where ideas ran low but hyping it up made us all want more, not like we weren't going to complain about it though. Earlier I mentioned that some plot was taken out due to the pandemic, and the same happened to WandaVision. Another episode or two would've benefitted the series. The first episode took a slower approach, which I liked. But the next two episodes were still setting up which felt weird considering that was halfway through the series. The last three episodes go by fast and are better than the first half. Still, plot was missing. We were introduced to ideas that never reached a fair conclusion. The announcement of a potential second season does make sense in this case. With WandaVision there's not more to be said, but in the case of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier more could be added to reach a proper conclusion. I wouldn't mind seeing more because it's a fun show to watch. There's really good action, a fun duo centering it, and Zemo dancing in the club! In later episodes, I'm glad that Marvel took to serious topics and not ignore issues within the world today and spanning decades ago. Finally, the conclusion with Captain America is such a great choice and anyone who disagrees is wrong. The Falcon and the Winter Solider may have left me wanted I more, but I'll take what I can get.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

At one point, he's talking about race with his family, at another point, it's related to his integrity about not taking the shield, and then all of a sudden he's popping really forced jokes. I wish the show was more cohesive, but then again it's only 2 episodes in.The cameos may be a little bit forced, but for a starved MCU fan, this is great overall! (Kind of on the level of Age of Ultron) My only main criticism is that it's confusing about what the movie is mainly trying to convey, as there are some convoluted conversations about society, and a lot of seemingly unrelated side plots. I hope it gets better! I will probably watch it anyways.I just like to like things even if they're not perfect.","1 out of 13 found this helpful.

However by the 4th episode, I have started liking the character arcs, particularly the new Captain America (played by Wyatt Russel) and Sam(Anthony Mackie). Sam is the quintessential idealistic person having the humbleness, patience and foresight where the new Captain America (John Walker) is impatient and ambitious but feels underpowered among super soldier adversaries. Winter Soldier and Zemo are so-so in my opinion, but help to move the plot along. Can't help but feel that Zemo is there as the 'Loki' of this series.

A strong finish that will spark many future MCU projects, all while letting the audience find out just who Sam Wilson and James ""Bucky"" Barnes are at the core of their being.","1 out of 14 found this helpful.

We need to have a reason to care about what's happening. It can't just be nonstop fight scenes with no investment in either side of the fight. Politics are important. Motives are important. Backstories are important. For the people who don't care about the reasons the ""bad guys"" do what they do, well, I'd venture to guess you're not human enough to get it. Not all people we see as villains believe they're bad. Their actions might be harmful, but sometimes they believe they're on the right side. I think it's an important part of being a human. For all the super-humans in this show, there's enough humanity to keep me interested. And some really powerful messages to be had, if you can stop whining and listen.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

If they had cut this into three movies i think people would have loved it and would have praised it.I think some of the hate is because of the tv show format. But it feels exactly like winter soldier in terms of cinematography and in terms of action and how the story develops.I think this show fits perfectly with the MCU and fits much better than Wandavision which was weird.Great action, great banter between Winter soldier and falcon, great drama, great commentary, great ending.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Best Super Hero Series So Far","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6858398/?ref_=tt_urv","jerrycoliver","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20775394/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2021","It's not so common we nuance from super hero stuff. The rare exception being Christopher Nolan's Batman. However, the Captain America movies had very subtle character development and messaging which was clever and remarkably powerful. Falcon and the Winter Soldier, on the other hand, took it to the next level.It really is a series you have to commit to. You can't stop at just 2 episodes (episode 2 being the one most people stopped watching because they had a very stereotypical, unprovoked and blunt writing moment. Possibly the most cringy thing I've seen in a show in awhile.) But after that, the show goes right back to the slow burn of character arcs and storytelling.It basically starts a hero who represents the worst America has to offer and a character who is disillusioned about the country because of a common political belief among younger Americans. If people were disappointed with the ending, they clearly didn't read the comics from 1986 - 1994 like I did (aside from Werewolf Cap... it was a brilliant run.)What we see is Falcon, struggling from external pressures not step up into the roll of America's greatest hero. It's heavy cross to bare and additionally, he's encouraged to walk away because others feel the country doesn't represent people of his skin color. But those disappointed with the turn don't realize being a soldier, and representing the country isn't about race. It's about doing what's right regardless the pressure and burden. Protecting your fellow countrymen even when you disagree. Because doing what is right is rarely easy, and the sacrifice is never appreciated except by other who do the same.Anthony Mackie has been a standout actor for over a decade but hasn't gotten the praise he deserves because of hi nuanced soci-political commons over the years. But he's never been canceled, so we should be thankful. In this role, he really does put the best parts of himself in the character and the story and delivers a powerful message.America is different today than 1945 when Captain America was introduced. And we do need a new representative for American honor. Anthony Mackie is truly deserving of that character, and the story of this series is explanation of his struggles and why we should be grateful.After that US Agent is, for the most part, a representative of the beta-boy, priviliged, toxic male egotist that some stereotypically see most white people in the country to be. He's a difficult character to cheer for. But like the series on the whole, there's nuance. He certainly is the worst of what America can be, but his intentions are always good. There is satisfaction with turn. US Agent learns the error of his ways and doesn't just walk away and let others fight the battle. He does what every American has been raised to do. You made a mistake, you fall, get up, dust yourself off, and don't make that mistake again...carry on the fight.The ""Flag Smashers"" is a bit on-the-nose of the Antifa, but it's forgivable being that we never have seen a mob villain like it before. It was interesting, it was powerful and like we always say, a hero is only has strong as his villain. It did find it peculiar that Disney (of all companies) would choose to put those people in a bad light considering their affinity toward ""woke"" culture. But again, there is a turn even for them. In their (debatably) noble endeavor, they cross a line. (Now, in fairness, they basically started over the line when you consider that their crimes all had victims, just because we didn't see them doesn't mean they're not affect, but I digress.) Great villains always have a component to them that is honorable. You have to be able to see yourself in the villain and understand why they go too far. The audience should be able to recognize when things are bad in their actions. (This literally is where the term ""the moral of the story"" comes from.) So anyone who feels (and there are plenty I'm seeing) this was a sad ending and the ""bad guys won"" might want to do some introspection. The fact is, the Flag Smashers' mission was never put down or dismissed, just their actions (and some character's motives.) It's okay to support their mission, but you can't support their means.If you don't watch the whole thing and put it into context, you'll probably think it's too Ra-ra America or too Woke (weird huh? Both extremes can be extracted from the same show) But when you watch it in its entirety, you will see, unbelievably good storytelling, character development and a series that stands head and shoulders above other super heroes series.And just to be clear of the message they sending, I can break it down: The American Flag (represented by the shield in series) does not represent the government, it represents the American People.","6 out of 23 found this helpful.

There were too many shows and series coming out in the last few years that I got burnt out. I got Disney+ for some Star Wars content instead and started TFatWS on a whim, playing it in the background, but over time I started noticing how much I was drawn into the series.This is well-written and touches on subjects that are top of mind in the cultural zeitgeist. From Falcon not being able to secure a loan (I disagree with other user reviews: it's very easy for celebrities to still have money problems) to what it means for a black man to use the shield to the absolute fantastic bromance between Sam and Bucky, I was not expecting such a touching show. 8/10 would recommend.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The trailers hardly impressed me and the two protagonists never showed themselves to be a good duo. Your screen time together can be reduced to the few scenes from Civil War.After the first 2 episodes I wasn't convinced either. Falcon with his backstory & morals didn't itch at first and Bucky, who was my favorite of the two, seemed very grumpy and annoying to me.After Daniel Brühl's comeback as Baron Zemo, the series took a better & more entertaining direction with this three constellation.General always had one action scene from the series burned into my brain per episode. One of the Falcons helicopter chases, the truck fight and the shootout at the docks.I didn't care about the new Captain America and his partner until the end of episode 4. After that, the whole thing took a completely different turn.And I don't wanna forget the antagonists, who, strictly speaking, cannot be called antagonists, got a clever and understandable reason for their actions.I don't want to say anything more about the last 2 episodes, because they changed the average series for me into a real surprise hit from the MCU.Definitely consistent and runs better from episode to episode than Wanda Vision, which quietly couldn't pick me up again after episode 3.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

The show's focus is about Sam taking on the mantle of Captain America which he doesn't think he deserves. Bucky wants to know why he would pass on the title of Captain America. Well at the same time they must track down a New terrorist threat called the flag smashers. The government wanting someone to take the mantle of Captain America gets a new man for the job. The show follows a good written story but it is very political really going at it with the cops taking it to far.Anthony Mackie does a good job playing a Sam who doesn't think he deserves the mantle. Sebastian Stan does and excellent job playing his character as he tries to make up for the things he has done in the past and being mad that Sam won't take the mantle. Erin Kellyman plays the leader of the terrorist group the only problem is that she doesn't get enough time to explain her motives very well. And is underused a lot in this show. Wyatt Russell plays John Walker the Captain America the government wants. He does an good job playing the guy who it's trying to live up to the title of Captain America and then plays the man who wants revenge at all cost well also playing a man who thinks he has done nothing wrong and blame all of his problems on everyone else. Emily VanCamp comes back as Sharon Carter but this time she is more serious and smart. And Daniel Brühl comes back as Baron Zemo and you finally get to see how much of a smart villain this man is how he will do anything to complete his goals.Overall I think this was one of the best Marvel shows so far and that anyone should watch this.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The Falcon doesn't stand for the same principles and ideals that Cap stood for; the ideals that made this country great. Falcon might as well be wearing a BLM suit. Captain America was an icon that represented the purity of a true American; colorblind and just. Disney's Falcon is just a disgraceful re-imagining of Cap's values for the ""woke"" crowd and solely focused on race. I loved all three in the MCU movies ( Cap, WS and Falcon) but Disney will now used them as puppets for the far left and destroy the legacy that Stan Lee created.

It's the same boring fictional political drama carried over from Infinity War, Endgame, Civil War, etc. I'm so tired of superhero movies trying to be political dramas but just end up repeating the same shallow 'social commentary' that's been sanitized and recycled to death in hollywood.So many subplots and new characters all crammed together that nothing gets the proper development it needs. Often these new concepts are simplified down to just passing lines of dialogue in order to condense things rather than taking time to show us.For a show so short and almost constantly moving, I found myself checking my phone a lot waiting for things to get interesting again. Frankly, the whole plot surrounding the girl and her terrorist super-soldier group could've been cut. I've seen it before (in the Marvel universe too!) and it brought nothing new to the table.But where it concerns Bucky and Sam together it's great. All the actors do a great job, and Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie have just as much chemistry on screen as off screen.If you like Bucky Barnes and like watching Bucky Barnes beating people/things up like I do, then it'll be well worth the watch. If you're just looking for some good action, it'll give you that too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nice screen play and direction, interesting story, awesome action seens and the actors done great job, specially John Walker the new 'Captain America' and Zimo. But first time Marvel promoted communism and socialism in their content. As a die heart marvel fan I'm very upset and unhappy for that. John Walker the new cap was trying to protect his country from the terrorist group Flag Smashers. But Sam and Bucky were just trying to protect the terrorist group leader Karlie Morgen Thou. And how they were reacting like the government and John Walker was the main villain. John Walker asked them to team up and work together. But it seems like both Sam and Bucky are jealous of John Walker because the government give the cap's shield to John, not the two of them. So they decided not to cooperate with John and support Karlie's terrorist movement. And in the last seen the speech given by Sam is totally absurd and made no sense. But overall it's an engaging show, so we can enjoy it with family.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The best CGI-action combo I've ever seen in any show","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7343427/?ref_=tt_urv","Puroo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120321993/?ref_=tt_urv","14 September 2021","In the beginning I was a little sceptical from watching this, since all MCU fanboys were saying that this is the best superhero show ever (meanwhile Doom Patrol and The Boys are laughing in a corner), and we know exactly what their track record has been. So I was expecting this to be only good enough to be expanded into multiple seasons, and that it has only used BLM as a plot tool (I didn't know the context back then, so I was expecting it to be something around that). But now that I have seen it, it may not be as good as WandaVision or Loki, but it does what it was meant to do - Action.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is not very different from a Captain America movie, except there is a different Captain America this time around - John Walker. Falcon gave away Steve's shield to the US government and they in turn made Walker the new Captain America. Bucky is very upset because of this, since Captain's shield meant a lot to him. Meanwhile he is trying to get himself medical help to get rid of his PTSD. They both team up because Bucky wanted some adventure and together they go after an insurgent group called The Flag Smashers.The show, just like Black Widow and Captain Marvel, is extremely divisive. Either you will love it or you will hate it. There is nothing in between. I liked it for the CGI, action scenes and the sense of humour. The plot, however, was pretty generic. The cinematography also wasn't something really unique, although the CGI scenes really made it look good. The return of Baron Zemo was also pretty fun to watch. He as a character completely steals the show while he is in it. There is also Okoye, who wants to capture Zemo so that he can be put to trial for T'Chaka's murder. I don't really like watching the Wakandans and they feel a little out of place here, so that wasn't that much fun either (other than the fight scene between Okoye and John Walker).The last episode was one long action sequence, which was really fun to watch until Karli started to get shown as an important character. I really wanted her to die, since she was so annoying. The new Captain America was introduced in the last episode, and although the new Cap looks way cooler than the one we're used to seeing, it ruins the thing that made Captain America so much fun to see. Captain America is supposed to be one ordinary man with a shield. He only has a shield because his other arm is no less than a sword. But the new Captain America has wings, exhaust pipe and visors. That makes his shield absolutely useless.I'm pretty sure this will have a season 2, and I'm already really excited to watch it. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a fun show to watch. Overall it has the same advantages and disadvantages as a generic MCU movie. I really appreciate they made this, which now makes us care more about Sam and Bucky, who had until now only lived in Steve's shadow. Let's see what they will have to offer next.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

While many celebrate the return of their loved ones, it does mean that some people are put at a disadvantage. Refugees from all over the world had been welcomed into countries all over the planet. They got jobs that were no longer filled. Then, once the people who had disappeared came back, they were kicked out again. An unknown number of them have now formed the group the Flagsmashers. Are they revolutionaries? Or terrorists?This mini is driven by its politics, so I'll dive into that first. The MCU continues its shift into being more diverse. I've promised myself that, if at some point, it starts getting legitimately miscalculated, if it starts feeling like pandering, or it starts to just blindly demonize its opposition, I will immediately, and honestly, call it out. No, I'm not pretending that there's no way to do this wrong. It's just that they keep doing it right.With Steve Rogers gone, countless people feel the need for someone to to take up the mantle. Some believe that it should be Karli Morgenthau(Kellyman, doing a great job walking the line between charismatic enough that she could attract supporters and lead this movement, and yet with a sense that she might go too far in the name of her goals. Yet another in a long line of ""I agree with their point, but not with their methods"" villains, and I say keep 'em coming), leader of the aforementioned group. Then again, we do already know who he chose to be his successor: Sam(Mackie, full of empathy and heroism).However, he feels that the US would never accept a black man representing it as Captain America, and hands over the shield, expecting it to be part of the exhibit in the Smithsonian. So he is of course shocked to see that, without his input, someone has been appointed to take over the title. While it's no surprise that they went with someone white, you may not have expected just how much they humanise John Walker(Russell, who has inherited all of his famous father's charm, as well as his knack for playing someone we can't stand). Suffering from imposter syndrome, and with something of a dark side, there is so much more to him than the tool that he was intended to be. In some ways, he is his predecessor's twisted mirror image: a perfect soldier, and not necessarily a good man.While colorblind casting has its strengths, I really appreciate that this instead went for colour conscious. It is very clear throughout, that there are POC both in front of, and behind the camera. It never feels like a bunch of out of touch Caucasians, working from inaccurate stereotypes, the way a lot of media did, in the past. We see where Wilson grew up, meet his sister Sarah(Oduye, a great mother, very responsible), her kids, and see what the family dynamics are like. We also get some uncomfortable and unflinching(honestly really pushing the PG-13, well, TV-14, rating) looks into how African Americans are treated in the United States, and the sadly forgotten truth of just how bad it was before more recently. Some aspects of this are barely fiction, and are clearly very heavily based on actual events.Now for the other half of the title. Let's talk about Bucky(Stan, struggling with the evils of his past). He is one of the ways that this explores how the government lets down its veterans. His court-ordered therapist can relate to him because of her own service, yet doesn't claim to be that great at her current job. She insists that he tell her all the painful details of his frequent PTSD nightmares. That he makes amends. That kind of thing is already difficult for alcoholics following the 12 steps. Imagine having murdered people for decades, and trying to break that to the victims' family members. The fact that he did it under mind control doesn't change that these people are dead, and many of them wouldn't be, if he hadn't shot them. We already knew that he remembered all of them. And have seen him be confronted with someone related to one of his victims. This is the first time we really see him intentionally go out and tell these people the truth about their loved ones.It's hard for me to put into words how relieved I am they didn't try to shove all of this into one or two movies. And that this isn't a traditional 22 episode per season TV show, where every 7 minutes or so, it has to have something dramatic happen, so that the audience will stay through the commercial break. The 6 episodes of varying length, only available on Disney+ for streaming, give the material room to breathe, instead. Honestly, there are a lot of scenes that are all about plot and character, many that are just people talking. The dialogue is so well done in both writing and performance, and go into such interesting concepts.Of course, the appeal of this series is also partially the action scenes. They are indeed on the level of huge Hollywood blockbusters, as far as scope and budget go. The trailers did not give everything away. Considering the relatively limited amount of superpowers on display, it's remarkable that it never gets repetitive. The flying, mid air battles, entering and leaving planes and helicopters in mid flight, is all amazing to behold. It's like playing Just Cause 3, which, if you haven't, and you like this kind of action, you really should. There are some new gadgets and abilities on display and they're used to great effect. The shared continuity is still a massive strength of this franchise. This sees the return of Henry Jackman, who composed for The Winter Soldier and Civil War, and he uses some leitmotifs incredibly well.I recommend this to anyone who cares about the issues that it explores, and fans of the icons. 10/10.","10 out of 50 found this helpful.

The main villain was a bit weak etc and the story was a bit thin but it was still a good all round action series. The leads were good and the effects / production quality were all you'd expect from a marvel flick.If you've been holding off watching this because of all the 1-3, star ratings, hold off no more and get it watched.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I wished they had made it more than 6 episodes but what they did with the episodes we got were awesome! From how they started with Sam giving up the shield and regretting it, to him butting heads with Bucky, and then having to deal with a whole new Captain America was just good. Not only that but they dealt with his real life issues too. Bucky's story was so good too, diving deeper into his mind on how he's dealing with everyday life and trying to make amends was entertaining to watch. I'm not gonna spoil anything about the show, but I really recommend it to Marvel fans especially if you like the Captain America movies.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

It's got loads of political commentary here, but the real thrill is seeing Bucky and Sam kicking ass here and there trying to live up to Captain America's legacy.This isn't a show that requires -nth degree of MARVEL knowledge to enjoy: it's got the same levels of fun as an instalment in the Fast and the Furious movies, or any old fashioned Bruce Willis movie. It's dumb but proud fun; it tries to add some deep political commentary but it doesn't really need it to get its dramatic points across.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is fairly solid entertainment and it doesn't try to pretend to be high-art or anything.I give this show a 4/5 stars: or maybe even 3.5/5.

The action sequences are more than perfect, there's great humour, but they also know when to get a bit more serious.
We get to know more about Sam, about his family and past and how he's dealing with everything that happened; we also see a lot of Bucky and his traumatic past memories. The show really knows how to adress the heroes' mental health.

The second series in the mcu. I personally loved it more than Wandavision. It is more fast paced. Action packed. The action is gritty like the second and third Captain America movies. The series focusing on the two characters after dealing with Captain America stepping down with his role. And the aftermath with the blip that has a rebellion group planning an attack cause of the change with the world.Old enemies return with a fun surprise. And new characters are introduced like Walker (Wyatt Russell) who take the series into an interesting direction. Without giving spoilers to plot points and characters. Wyatt Russell did a great job with his role. And i am excited to see more adventures with Winter Soldier and the falcon. And where they may go in future mcu adaptation.The series did have a slow pacing with the last half of the season. Which could have been better developed with too many exposition on characters.Great cast ensemble. Exciting action sequences. And good story which could have been better. I am excited to see where these characters can go next.","6 out of 29 found this helpful.

A beautifully executed story about the legacy of captain america that asks you morally twisted questions surrounding the current circumstances in society. It shines a light on deep rooted societal and governmental injustice in a way that no other marvel project was able to carry out, which is also being expressed in the show itself, calling out the insufficient awareness of these issues in the previous movies. The mesmerising cinematography, brilliant script and magnificent camerawork make the audience feel the sadness, anger, disgust, relief, fear, pain, pride, integrity and love that the characters are experiencing. With breathtaking performances of anthony mackie, sebastian stan, wyatt russell, erin kellyman, carl lumbly and many many more, there is no doubt to say that this is by far one of the greatest creations marvel has ever made.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Political stuff are actually very important to me and I love the representation so I guess I have a different view from other people when it comes to it because for me it's not even a political stand but just human rights. A point that not many superheroes movies/series do which is having that grasp of reality. The villains for me got that Mr Robot vibe which I quote enjoyed.

Thus wrapping up the Disney+ aspect of the MCU Phase 4 slate for 2021. And so far, Falcon and the Winter Soldier is the best and most meaningful offering from Phase 4 of the MCU at the time of this writing.The show puts in the work and does a lot very well. It is profound and emotional on many levels as it tries to tackle both real problems, as well as MCU problems resulting from many years of storytelling which culminated the infinity saga in Endgame. Although it does not tackle all these problems perfectly, it does more than enough to tell a well-rounded story. A story where events occur within a coherent plot that carries forward both the MCU and the characters in the show in a genuine and meaningful way. This all allowed for real character growth as well as a richer universe which made an unexpected fourth Captain America movie with Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson as 'Cap' a reality. Not to mention Sam and Bucky are great frenemies.Overall, it's superb and a must watch for phase 4. Binge-watch it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Everything I wanted in the MCU. Realism","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6841245/?ref_=tt_urv","hfreinoso","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65697588/?ref_=tt_urv","23 April 2021","The Falcon and The Winter Soldier was in fact, the shows I was looking forward to the most. Out of all the MCU shows they announced, such as WandaVision, Loki, Ms. Marvel, etc. None of them have my interest at all except for this show. I was not too fond of WandaVision- or heck finished the show (which took a while). Call me a hack, but that show didn't do it for me plus, with that last episode, it went downhill from that. (It set up nothing for No Way Home, Loki and Dr. Strange 2) When they said it would be like a Russo brothers Winter Soldier and Civil War type of film (My favorite), it was precisely what I got from the show. Realism a human, grounded take on the world that it is today. That's what I like about films that are human grounded, such as Spider-Man 2, Superman, The Dark Knight, Soul films that take on a realistic take of the world today. Struggles and what makes us who we are. The Falcon and The Winter Soldier was that show. I knew when they got Kari Skogland, and we saw who Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes were, I knew I was going to dig this show. When they show who Sam Wilson and Bucky are. People don't know who Sam and Bucky are (all they know is Sam is the Falcon and Bucky is Steve's best friend); they know they are closely related to Captain America. And guess what? This show dwells deep with these characters, and it's perfect, and we finally get to see who they are.Sam Wilson, I thought, didn't deserve the shield, and Bucky did. But this show has proved me wrong. They were the whole front of the show, and it makes us love the part that SHOWS us that he was meant to be Captain America. I always knew who the powerbroker was, and I understood what Karli and the flag smashers wanted, and it is understandable instead of being a ruler or taking over the world type of person. John Walker was a mixed bag, and I liked Wyatt Russel as he did a fantastic job. However, the character was, in fact, a mix; he was NOT Captain America, but when he does at the last episode proves he can be a hero. John Walker was what the American government wanted versus what Sam Wilson was what we needed. This show tells us how the world would react if an African American were, in fact, Captain America as the character would reflect themselves on one person to another. And Isaiah Bradley the Black Captain America.I love this character, and this character was, in fact, the sad part of this show. It showed us the truth and what happened during his past and how people were like. This proving that everyone was a hero in the past, even if no one knows or even cares about it. This character got what he deserves at the end. A REAL HAPPY ending. All the show proves that the shield is all about a great human being. That is what Captain America stands for Hope and Strength to move on, and Sam Wilson could do that. A scene where Sam's nephew touches the shield. And that moment stuck with me; it's all about what it means and what it does for someone to pick up the shield and stand for Captain America. The show was great, and don't let many SJW people tell you to hate this show. And people hate that Trobe; however, unlike other films such as (Charles Angel, Black Christmas 2019... ew) this one proves to us what could happen and what others could bring out if we all had hoped on someone even if we can't believe in such things. But to me, this show wasn't perfect but was a show similar to The Winter Soldier. By far, for me, it is, in fact, better than WandaVision 10/10.","5 out of 23 found this helpful.

They are both helped by a new Captain America who doesn't fit Sam's thinking.Season 1:
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a new story for Sam Wilson who inherited from Steve Rogers in continuing the role of Captain America. However, rejection on the basis of Sam's unpreparedness leads to a replacement that is not worth it and seems narcissistic. The series brings adventures to Sam and Bucky in the face of new problems. The premise of the story of the series is very good. The series has many conflicts present. It's as if this conflict seems branching out but still related. Starting from the conflict experienced by the Sam family, the trauma problems experienced by Bucky to the problems with the new Captain America who could not replace the role of the previous Captain America. The series also brings to the atmosphere and post-Endgame conditions so that the emotions and conflicts that are present are so carried away in the sadness of a person's happiness. The series also introduces a new character who looks like he will be the successor to The Falcon. Also the presence of the story of Captain America Black which provides a further introduction to the conflict of the series. It's unfortunate to see the completion of this series that actually makes a lot of speeches, rather than epic fight action.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

For some reason, Marvel also thought it'd be worth their time to try and include some 'human' issues (not being able to pay rent etc.), which come off as patronising more than anything.The acting is rotten from the top down: besides the cringeworthy conflict of the two leads, characters like Zemo (Daniel Brühl) and Karli (Erin Kellyman) are prisoners to their restrictive scripting and personal range. I felt a bit for Wyatt Russell (the 'new' Captain America), as he wasn't entirely awful.The most laughable moment, I would argue, was Disney trying to devote some time in the show to understanding racism. Aside from one out-of-sync police scene early on, it's insultingly ironic that a company pumping films out of China wants to paint themselves as forward-thinking and facilitators of positive change.I persevered to the end, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it. Without a doubt this is one of Marvel's weaker efforts: a boring plot is par for the course, but in conjunction with the brutal acting and the laughable villains, this shouldn't have been green-lit to begin with.Even the Marvel shills have come to their senses, and this show has dropped below an 8 on IMDb; even so, it should really be less than half that.","16 out of 26 found this helpful.

But this series is just not as good. Its not because of politics or of political correctness or of racial mentions; its because of the PLOT.Which kinda sucks. Inconsistent and at many times just pointless, the plot seems uninspired and forced, in order to make this series' story move forward.Here's a few: What exactly was Carly's main motivation? What makes the GRC so bad for Carly? Why don't they work more on the idea of the shield as a mantle? That could have been a great opportunity here.Why get into the power broker story arc in the first place and not further develop it?And why spend so much time in the political issues? Is that because the script is just non-existant? Maybe... The dialogue at times is also incredibly stupid...which makes me wonder about the way marvel/disney approach their audience nowadays.Wandavision was not perfect but it was smart and well made with good dialogue and world building. But this one is more closer to a messy, character-lacking and backstory-missing series.Now why 6,5? 1-The action sequences are good and the start is impressive. Also there is a few more action sequences further on which are worth it. 2-Stan and Mackie are good action actors and look alright on screen, so its fun watching them and their chemistry is ok. 3-because i m a fan like most people here and i still like watching these stories and I appreciate the effort needed to get these done.","4 out of 19 found this helpful.

On top of that, he surrenders the shield that Steve Rogers/Captain America gives him to the United States government and they decide to replace Captain America with Army Ranger John Walker. Meanwhile, Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier is dealing with the trauma as well as consequences of being The Winter Soldier after being brainwashed by Hydra and is disappointed in Sam for giving up the shield to the government. When Bucky decides to join Sam on his hunt for the terrorist organization, it will put their skills to the test as well as their patience for one another. So first off, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon was fantastic to see again, making his performance in this my favorite out of all of his portrayals so far of the character and I was finally glad to see the long awaited backstory for his character. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier was great as well to see again, bringing us the trauma, the grief, and redemption arc for his character that we've waited so long to see. Daniel Brühl's Baron Zemo I was glad to see again since he is one of my favorite MCU villains and was finally glad to have a brief backstory for his character. Erin Kellyman as Karli Morgenthau I thought was a alright villain, although I get her reasons for being the villain, I felt some of her choices wasn't always the best and kind of sloppy, but overall it somehow worked. Wyatt Russell as John Walker/Captain America/U. S. Agent was perfect casting and I can't wait to see more of him. Overall, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a great addition to the MCU TV shows that make you wish there were more of it by the end. Rating 8/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a thriller worth watching, it's rich in character development and action","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7005710/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","6 June 2021","Right from the opening sequence you know exactly what kind of mini series this will be and I have to say The Falcon and the Winter Soldier met my expectations and those were high. If I would describe it I think I would say Jack Ryan with Marvel characters as it has that authenticity and focus on characters with a slow paced political thriller plot. Malcolm Spellman served as the showrunner for the mini series and I found the writing to be quite good and the focus on the world building and characters was appreciated. The world felt much more real and the writing is a big factor in that, I also like the themes that they go into, bringing up racism and stuff like that is needed. The tone is a mix of the original lighthearted but also dark in terms of Captain America: Winter Soldier and Civil War because the story feels like it could happen in the real world, there aren't any wizards nor aliens, and the only sci-fi element are the Super Soldier serum. The dialogue is perfect, I think the actors even improvised some lines, the execution is the most important and they succeed in that. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is six episodes of great drama and thriller worth watching. The ensemble cast is fairly big but everyone gets the screen time they need which fits the story, character development is the show's strong point.The fight choreography is at times similar to the previous Captain America movies which some might call lack of originality but I call it fan service, it's also nice to see the characters fight in the same ways. The fight and action sequences are extremely well done and super entertaining to watch, and they are there for the story which is a good thing and something some movies fail to do as they keep putting unnecessary action sequences. Super Soldiers is a joy to watch and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has a bunch of them, it doesn't get old though. The writers managed to make them human and not action figures.Falcon and Winter Soldier is played by Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, they got the leading roles and I have always believed that they could carry a movie or TV show without Captain America, the chemistry they share and how enjoyable they are together. You just smile when they're on the screen. It isn't really any spoilers that these two characters which didn't really like each other becomes friends throughout the TV series, their mutual friend wanted it to happen since they met. Being completely different from one and the other, their life look similar. Bucky trying to make amends after his long time as The Winter Soldier, whilst Sam Wilson have other trouble to take care of. The trouble they take care of makes them more human and made me care for them even more, I really never saw Falcon as a main character before but Anthony Mackie really went all in this time and showed how capable he is to run the show. Huge praise for them both and the writers that seem to care and understand the characters, and legacy of Captain America.Wyatt Russell portrays the new Captain America, John Walker. He does a terrific job with the performance, it's one of the best of the TV Series. Its easy to sympathize with him as he's a character with many flaws and so human, he's not the typical MCU character and the thing with this show is that many characters are flawed and could easily be found in our world. John Walker is easily one of the highlights in the show and I really hope Wyatt Russell gets another shot in the upcoming Captain America movie. Daniel Brühl reprises his role as Baron Zemo as the anti-villain as his previously appearance was in Captain America: Civil War where he was the villain of the story, I have always found him to be a great villain as his reasons are understandable and realistic. Daniel Brühl gets to do much more with the character here and it improves the character immensely as we get to know him on a more personal level which I'll say the same to the other villains of the story, the ""terrorist"" group called Flag Smashers which is led by Karli Morgenthau which is played by Erin Kellyman. Other returning or worth mentioning characters are Sharon Carter, Joaquin Torres and Sarah Wilson.Camera work and cinematography is superb, everything looks excellent. Kari Skogland served as the director for all 6 episodes and her talent shows in the visual storytelling and direction she gave. She also seem to love the source material. Sound editing and musical score is fantastic, everything sounds perfect. The music has that epic and heroic sound, inspired by the Captain America movies but ultimately it's own thing. Set pieces and locations are amazing, then there are locations like Madripoor that's absolutely stunning to look at. Production and art design, everything was perfect.","4 out of 21 found this helpful.

Anyone who isn't a fan of the political, social and racial commentary isn't fully appreciating the necessity of these to be addressed - both in universe and in real life. It is short sighted to only want one dimensional, good guy bad guy tropes, this gave complexity that was already being teased out through Civil War and the opening moments of Endgame.This series has given me a reason to care for this universe again. After decades and dozens of movies and content, it all became fatigued. I'm not a diehard Marvel fan, and I don't need to be to appreciate the movies for what they are- entertaining. That's all they are. And after such a long ride, I just couldn't care anymore, it had all been wrapped up in a bow, and I would have been content to leave it all with Thanos arc done. Why would I care about two minor characters? This treatment of the series made me care.Small bits of dialogue like a doctor asking how the avengers make money, discussing Sokovia, refugees and displacement, all that stuff is a reflection of our world now, that also needed to be addressed in-verse, and I think it was done well.And finally, addressing a BLACK Captain America. Whether people like it or not it needs to be addressed in this climate, and I'm sure looking through archives would clearly show how people doubted the choice of Mackie continuing the role. Showing the character's internal feelings and what ""the shield"" meant to people, that also spoke to how a lot of fans felt. Done very well.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

This isn't only a highly engaging action-adventure series about who will be the next Captain America, but it also offers an informed discussion about symbolism, race, American history, heroism & image. These ideas work their way naturally into the Captain America canon & it never feels forced. Sam & Bucky received a lot of overdue exploration. They proved themselves as tactful, well-rounded leading men capable of carrying the Captain's mantle further without Steve while maintaining his righteous legacy. Steve may be gone but I still sense his presence in these two. This series shows how truly human they are despite being superheroes.Some questions are left unanswered & a few new faces are kept mysterious. But hey, Marvel has lived up to their promises before & they'll surely branch out on those elements in later stories and be more relevant there.But last not the least, besides Anthony Mackie & Sebastian stan's chemistry, we also can see Excellent performances from Wyatt Russell as ""John Walker"" (he played his role soo DYNAMICALLY), Daniel Brühl as ""Zemo"" (especially his improvised dance), Emily VanCamp as ""Sharon Carter"" (her mysterious behaviour), Erin Kellyman as ""Karli Morgenthau"" (she was on total fire).I'm really satisfied I sat through this show. Its style and emotional weight are very in tune with the Captain America films and they're my personal favourites of the whole MCU. I believe Falcon and the Winter Soldier stands proudly beside its cinematic predecessors.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The racism displayed felt a bit forced and at times made me uncomfortable. I revised my last review because now I kind of see why people are mad. Marvel is all about fiction and fantasy, if someone wanted to see a movie about racism they would've specifically searched for one. Don't let that one thing prevent you from watching the show it was still amazing and very funny at times. I didn't think the villain was that bad but the ending felt rush, unfinished. I still think it's good and also I am African-American so I'm not just saying this to be biased.","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

"8","/10","I got what I expected, but now I need a movie about the Winter Soldier","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6876052/?ref_=tt_urv","Redred88","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128034340/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2021","So, for me the main advantages of this TV show are Bucky was especially great, he did justice to own character and played it amazing and it was good see him how he accepted his past, and I enjoyed him the whole show. And I had a similar pleasant impression of devilishly intelligent and charismatic Zemo. And yet I'm pleased by the rivalry-friendly dynamics between Bucky and Sam, it was fun. I also positively appreciate that this show has a huge number of references to other Marvel films. All in all, I was interested to watch, especially when I initially did not expect much from this TV series. But there are controversial points in this show: In my opinion, in the finale of the TV series, the creators went too far with politics - very classy, a lot of big words, high morals... This may remind some people of political agitation, and therefore cause unpleasant impressions. The creators of the show here should have been more careful. But it turned out what it turned out. In addition, there was a feeling that the storyline of the show was suddenly rewritten again, perhaps that is why some of the actions and reasoning of the antagonists-supersoldiers seemed to me ineffective and illogical, which prevented me from correctly perceiving their goal and somehow empathizing with them. And it seems to me that these antagonists-supersoldiers don't look like worthy enough opponents for Bucky and Sam, either in terms of skills or potentialities. So it's strange why Bucky and Sam, who are the Avengers who fought with Thanos ' army, and are really experienced, skilled fighters, took so long to deal with them. But I'm still not too disappointed, because I got what I originally wanted - I saw the Winter Soldier, because he's one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was just because of him that I waited and watched this show. However, this is not enough for me, I've been thinking for a long time that Bucky definitely deserves his own solo movie or TV series starring him, but unfortunately, he still doesn't have one. But the Winter Soldier has a reasons for his own solo movie: a dark, mysterious past and a complex, contradictory personality, which will allow you to create many interesting and instructive stories (brutality and showiness as in Captain America: The Winter Soldier is also welcome; what a magnificent battles there was between the Winter Soldier and original Cap Steve Rodgers. I'm still reviewing them). Especially if Marvel clearly plans to make solo film about Sam as the Captain America in the future, then it would be fair to make solo film about Bucky. But I'm worried because Bucky will probably be in those movies, but again only as the Captain America's sidekick, which means that a solo movie about the Winter Soldier is unlikely to ever be made. And I believe that Bucky can be not only the eternal sidekick of the Captain America, but also an independent character with his own personal story and various adventures. Well, hope springs eternal. And we'll have to wait and see what happens.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The great thing about this show is as America confronts her own origins and history the show attempts to parallel and understanding of that. If you cannot see the genius of the story and writing Or how the new Captain America embodies the Old American values then you're short sighted and narrow minded. It's not ""political"" it's topical storytelling. It is really well done. I may only be on episode 5 however I hope this series continues. Marvel is a monolith of a stories, if they don't incorporate topical narratives then they lose their credibility and potentially their audiences. Understanding the black story in America is an important story especially when one of the lead characters on this show, is black AND was entrusted by the true former Capt. America to carry his shield forward. Well done, to all the writers.Side note: Julia Louis Dreyfuss is one of my favorite actresses, comedic yes but allowing her to fulfill a strong role in this universe literally made my day!","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A bland show that reveals important facts about the activists of today","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6893337/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2021","The latest products from Marvel Studios have been some of their most unintentionally illuminating. WandaVision, their first Disney+ exclusive, showed us what sort of in-text behavior the Twitter stans will let slide (partly because the text in question does little to decry said behavior) when the themes/metaphors are somewhat poignant and, more importantly, the star of the show is really hot (which I can't dispute, since it's Elizabeth Olsen). The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, meanwhile, is the most relevant and revealing show they've ever made, for wholly unintended reasons.In its attempted parallels to the geopolitics of today, it reveals how sloppy the MCU writers' sense of continuity will get when there's lucrative commentary to be made (reminding me of HBO's Watchmen, which sacrificed its believability as a sequel for the sake of topical allegorizing and petty jabs at its own IP), while also exposing how susceptible we've become to what streaming sites and Instagram feeds will tell us about who's good, who's bad, and what the past looks like -- including periods we're old enough to have experienced and should be familiar with. In its short run, it shows exactly what's gone wrong in the world of fandom, and the world at large.First, let's talk about continuity versus trendy social commentary. Obviously, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier explores the aftermath of ""The Blip"", that moment in Avengers: Infinity War where Thanos erased half of all life on Earth, leading to five years of largely unseen disarray. The fact that this particular story takes place after any Avengers film is problematic enough, so we'll talk more about the Blip stuff later.For one, the show implies that a black man, namely the new Captain America candidate Sam ""Falcon"" Wilson (Anthony Mackie), wearing the American colors is a touchy prospect, given the unfortunate history of the country (that is, in real life and not so much within the MCU, though they do add a neglected black war hero to the mix), and that even a global super-celebrity like him must endure cartoonish police racism until a different officer points out who he is. It's not just that this seems ignorant of in-universe history and the existence of figures like the Iron Patriot; it's that this ignorance rubs off on the audience, effectively getting THEM to ignore OUR universe.Said fanboys will praise the show for ""finally"" giving us a piece of superhero media led by a person of color. It's bad enough to be unaware that today's comic-book cinema largely owes its existence to Blade (1998), but have they already forgotten Black Panther (2018) from this same canon? What about the fact that Wilson has financial struggles (which also doesn't seem wholly believable in the established timeline) and how this makes him more relatable than any other Marvel hero? Really, guys? I know there are too many Spider-Men to keep track of but surely we know better than to swallow this stuff uncritically?This lack of critical thinking is, in a nutshell, what's so fascinating about the response to TFATWS. Through very deliberate music choices, framing, and other shortcuts, the show makes it very clear we're supposed to ultimately admire the plight of the Flag Smashers -- a globalist, AntiFa-looking bunch of supersoldiers (apparently Erskine's serum wasn't all that tricky to replicate) who wish to return to the borderless ""utopia"" of The Blip -- while the new Captain America replacement John Walker (Wyatt Russell of Black Mirror), who's trying to stop them, is clearly a dick.But really, if you actually LOOK at the text, the worst thing Walker does isn't much more horrifying than the routine acts of the Flag Smashers or their leader Karli (Erin Kellyman). HER actions are meant to seem somewhat pardonable, as she's fighting against fascist government, the mistreatment of refugees, and I guess nationalism. Does that reading make sense if you actually analyze the sequence of events and what the character is objectively guilty of? Not especially, no.Still, the music and imagery insist we shall loathe entitled-white-guy John Walker and simply deem Karli to be a tragic, if misguided revolutionary, her actions rarely being framed as gruesomely as Walker's big kill (if ever). Thus, that's what the Twitter stans are rolling with, albeit disagreeing with the ""misguided"" part -- even this faintly negative attribute gets lost in the glorified presentation. (In other circles, this intent has clearly backfired, à la the New Guy meme and the supposedly-piggish Don from Captain Marvel, as Walker's being hailed as a wholesome good guy.)And to be honest with you, in the show's treatment of politics and activism, it seems like the opposite has happened: that the tweenagers and Twitter stans influenced the art, not the other way around. The commentary in this show is so naive, so bereft of real answers, and so proud of this fact (The Falcon declares it might be a good thing that he doesn't understand the complexities of why politicians can't just ""open all the borders"" or ""print more money"" or whatever) that it feels like a teenager who just learned one or two buzzwords wrote it. People who hate the series might think I'm stupid for agreeing that Karli is a realistic, believable figure, but I absolutely feel like someone like her would write The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and then insert herself into it kinda like this. I'm surprised she doesn't wind up making out with Bucky Barnes wearing tighty-whities.The show isn't even really saying ""AntiFa activists aren't terrorists, you guys"". It expressly rejects the label, yes, but we've already talked about why its intended message doesn't match its actual text or plot. Functionally, it is instead saying: ""AntiFa ARE terrorists but here's why that's good"". Whether our political youngsters have influenced the writing or Marvel is just pandering to them (by neither understanding their own world nor ours very well), TFATWS is indeed a product of the times.Was there anything I liked? Well, I do like Mackie as an actor and person, even if The Falcon was arguably done dirty here (there's a scene where he rejects black identitarianism, which I initially appreciated, but this turned out to be a part of an arc where he eventually ""knows better""). I enjoy his banter with Sebastian Stan as Bucky/The Winter Soldier, seeing the Dora Milaje was fun although their inclusion made little sense (given what we know of Wakanda), and Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) is still one of the better MCU antagonists, even if he's more cartoony here than in Captain America: Civil War -- the groundedness of which I now admire all the more. Watch that one instead tonight, or switch to Prime for some Invincible.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Great Mini Series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7657028/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","So yes better late then never but here is my review for The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, the second Disney+ series made by Marvel Studios and after the success of WandaVision there was big hype for this show and let's see if it delivers. The premise of the show sees Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes have to unite in order to take down a new group while dealing with personal issues that have defined their lives.Main Character
Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan as the lead characters are fantastic here and they have amazing chemistry together. I've always felt like Mackie has been underutilised in the MCU but he is given the spotlight here and he is great, you see how real life circumstances affect his performance and after the events of Endgame he is really struggling what his role exactly is as a hero and it is very effective. Stan has always been great and he gives a really strong performance here, there is so much emotion to the character of Bucky Barnes as he really tries to move on from his past as The Winter Soldier but it provides some stellar scenes and I love both of these characters and felt like they really moved up from supporting characters in the films to main characters here.Supporting Characters
Wyatt Russell plays John Walker and this guy is amazing, I mean the internet literally united to hate this character and that takes an incredibly skilled actor to do that. I actually felt like he was such an interesting and real character that had plenty of depth towards him and you see how he is really affected by the pressure of his new role. Daniel Bruhl is back as Zemo and he is probably my favourite part of the show, when he arrives on the screen the show just gains more life and energy to it with Bruhl clearly loving his role and allowing more freedom the he had in Captain America: Civil War. Emily VanCamp is also back as Sharon Carter and she is really good, they do some interesting things with her character and you see how the past 5 years that the character has had to go through has really affected her more then most. Carl Lumbley plays Isiah Bradley and wow this is such a strong performance, the emotion is ramped up ten fold when he is on screen and it feels appropriate due to the real life issues that are clear inspirations and he knocks it out of the park. Erin Kellyman plays Karli and I think she is okay, the MCU has sometimes had issues with antagonists and I think Kellyman does the best she can and really tries and it doesn't affect the role too much and more of the issue is the storytelling for her and her groups role.Story
The story is good, the dynamic between Sam and Bucky is really affective and I love how it develops as the show goes on and progresses very naturally. The show is also effective in showing the legacy of the shield of Captain America and how there is way more then we knew from the films. The show also manages to spend more time with the characters and find out more about there characters and ideals and that is only something this show can do. But there are a few issues and for me it was mainly to due with the villains The Flag Smashers, I think when they wrote them it sounded great on paper but it just wasn't as good as it should have been. The show needed to do more with them and make us actually care about them which they just missed here.Script
The script is really good, The MCU has always had a blend of humour and drama but this show does it ever so well. There is a nice amount of laughs and that is mainly due to the chemistry between the two leads. But the drama is really well done with some truly emotional scenes that are made really well and executed in a way to really make you care.Style
The style is good, in terms of the action scenes and the scale I thought it was really good. It at times feels like one of the films with action scenes that are huge in scale and feel like they slot in really well with the rest of the MCU. But I do think this show has a few issues with its pacing, there are only 6 episodes but I think it needed at least 8, there are a lot of story arcs going on here and not all of them have as much time dedicated to them as they really needed.Overall
Overall, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier is a great show that does a great job with its characters. This is just another great addition to The MCU and sets up some pretty exciting things for the future that may affect the TV and Film universes so give this one a watch.Rating - 8/10.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Very Solid Series in the MCU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6841416/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","23 April 2021","It's been very interesting watching where the Marvel Cinematic Universe has gone and is moving towards after the events of Avengers: Endgame. After being left the shield by Steve Rogers, I was very eager to see where Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes' story thread would lead. Unlike something like WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a much more conventional addition to the franchise. Thankfully, that wasn't a detriment. This series plays very much on the legacy that the shield has left in this universe and I thought that aspect held the show together from start to finish. There's a lot to praise about this series, but it's definitely not perfect. Here are my thoughts on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame and dealing with real-world issues, this series gets off to a slow start, in a good way. Giving us a new backstory for Sam and diving deeper into the mind of Bucky, we get some semblance of what really goes on in their lives, outside of the massive team films. With a new group called The Flagsmashers looming and the government appointing an unworthy man as the new Captain America, drama ensues. Between these two threats and many other characters/storylines throughout the series, I found myself glued to the screen for the majority of it. What this series suffers the most from, however, is the fact that it feels too much like a movie.Yes, I'm aware that the point of these new mini-series' from Marvel are meant to feel in continuity with the films, but this felt like a two to three-hour film that was stretched into six episodes. Yes, there is plenty going on in each episode, but some of the pacing felt slow at times in comparison to episodes like the finale. I'm not saying I need action every second, but I admit that the series felt like it took a few detours as it made its way to a conclusion. Still, most story threads come to a conclusion in the final episode and it all feels earned by the end. If for nothing else though, this duo is a blast to watch on-screen.Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan have always been great in these roles and their chemistry in films like Captain America: Civil War only ever elevated everything else around them. Not just their chemistry but their charisma as actors in general just radiates off the screen. Add performers like Erin Kellyman, Daniel Brühl, and Wyatt Russell, and the series just gets even better. Every single performance in this series is entirely committed and it shows. The series ends up roughly where most viewers will see it going, but it's done in a very satisfying way and I wish I had seen certain moments on the big screen. These series' are being made like movies, so it's upsetting that they can't be shown on the big screen, but that's another discussion.Overall, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier delivers on action, drama, and real-world issues being discussed on a regular basis. I loved watching this series very much, even if it felt a little slow at times. I could've easily seen this in theatres as a long film, but it also works as a series that slides right in after Avengers: Endgame. There are quite a few ideas here that I very curious to see evolve in future shows/movies. If you've followed this franchise for any period of time, I absolutely recommend checking this one out.","3 out of 19 found this helpful.

But I was immediately psyched to watch it! Bucky is one of my favorite Marvel characters because he's so close to Captain America and I can relate to his tortured past. I've always wanted to see more of The Falcon because he's such a normal dude AND a super hero.The content in the show relating to the black community and their struggles made me think a lot. I was annoyed for a moment because there is so much tension about this subject infusing our culture now. But the more I watch and listen and really try to understand what's being said the more I can sympathize. I know sometimes it feels like ""virtue signaling"" and ""race baiting"" and any other buzz word but if there are real people out there with real issues then we need to listen. I think that The Falcon and The Winter Soldier does a fantastic job presenting these issues. They're not pushing them at the expense of the story or the characters they're infusing the conversation with emotion that fits the situations and peoples.Overall I think this is an amazing and top quality show worthy of Disney and Marvel. I can't wait for the next episode!!!","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

I don't see how a Black man playing Captain America with all of America's flaws & systemic injustices could've just been glossed over without it feeling fake. Sam Wilson was sincere, reflective, and uplifting, while also addressing what becoming Cap meant to him, his family, and his community. Anthony Mackie delivered a very moving performance. I loved Falcon & Winter Soldier's relationship development, and getting sarcastic Bucky was a huge treat. It also checked all the fun Marvel big boxes with action and excitement.

I encounter many who, although respect and understand the difficulties faced by racial inequality and the history which comes with it, but don't really want to watch it depicted in shows they watch and refer to it as ""preachy"". These people aren't racist. They just can't identify, and so don't appreciate its depiction on screen.I did appreciate this show.

I'd say if you couldn't see that The Falcon and The Winter Soldier wouldn't become buddy-buddies by the end; then this must be the very first ""Odd Couple"" style show you've ever seen.If you're a fan of the MCU, I doubt you'll find too much wrong with this series; if you're not a big fan of the genre or curious about the MCU, I doubt this will also change your mind.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

Going into this with no knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ... I am not sure how this will work out. Going into this with not the biggest knowledge of the comic and its character history but being up to date with the movie world they created ... I know a little bit about that.So this follows what happened after Endgame - I'm assuming you know that or at least have read up on it. Or do not care really - but I will go from there and reference what happened at the end of that specific movie. At least in connection with this tv show. As you can see I take no spoilers really to an extreme and I care about people not getting more information than they bargained for ... talking about getting more than one is bargained for: That is true for the Falcon (not Black Falcon, racial issues will play a role here and I salute Marvel for tackling issues head on and with such grace, style and competence) ... who got the Shield from Captain America, but for some reason does not seem to want to keep it ... we will learn why ... and it is not something to be taken lightly either.It is also something that he can't just blur out when he sees Bucky ... who is quite mad that the Falcon seems to go against the will of the ... now Ex-Cap. So while the Falcon retires the Shield, the question is if the Shield is ready to retire? Or rather the goverment - are they ready? And this is the first of 6 episodes. A great mini series that will bring a few characters besides the two in the title.And the cool thing is they get mostly introduced at the end of each episode (true for Episodes 1-3 ... I guess you could say there is a character reveal at the end of episode 4). There are so many goodies in this show ... and some during the credits. Which as with Wandavision only get into play for Episodes 5 and 6. But in contrast to Wandavision the final episode only has one mid credit scene. But one that lays seeds for future storylines ... not a suprising one, but still a goodie too.It's not easy to stay ahead of people spoiling things, but you can do it. Just try to watch the shows and movies as they come along. Good action, good acting and some surprise fan favorite moments (dancing? Ok, why not) ...","4 out of 37 found this helpful.

The good thing about this series is the relevance that Falcon and Bucky have after having been only secondary characters and now they are given the opportunity to play a role within the MCU in this series that shows one of the consequences of the Blip. That is seen through the protagonists wanting to return to how everything was before the disappeared returned. What is most discussed here is about the Captain America mantle following the departure of Steve Rogers. Something quite strange regarding that topic and what happens next.

Time is a hot commodity and I wasn't keen to spend it on a 6 episode miniseries with only a 7.2 overall - there is so much good TV/movies these days so why spend it on something mediocre? Well, I must say that I found this miniseries to be much more than mediocre and regret not watching it sooner. There is definitely a heavy political undertone throughout the plot, so I personally believe that MANY people rated this low due to that, which unfortunately skews the overall rating. Such a shame, because it was quite enjoyable and not an accurate reflection of the overall series. Was it my favorite MCU story? No, but Marvel routinely hits things out of the park so it's a high bar. I'd still give this between a 7-8, but officially scored it an 8 to counterbalance some of the irrational ""1"" scores because of ""political wokeness"". If you are the type of person who can't stand to see political or social viewpoints who may differ from your own, then don't watch this. However, if you generally enjoy the Marvel recipe for success (action, emotion, and humor) and can enjoy plots regardless of the racial or political beliefs, then I'd highly recommend it.

It makes sense for what the Flag Smashers are fighting for, but it also makes you question the reality, and the extent to which they do, what they do.","2 out of 16 found this helpful.

The series from the beginning has some excellent fight scenes, spectacular effects, very good characters and a solid story to keep the audience awake.Every time an episode ends, you keep waiting more and more. This series is one more reason to miss Steve Roger being Captain America. In my opinion the development they gave to Bucky aka Winter Soldier was very poor. Both in the fight and development scenes it was seen that Bucky was a filler or sidekick for Sam to help him become Captain America.The Winter Soldier is one of the oldest, most iconic and highly experienced characters in combat who could have defeated everyone without Sam's help. The final episode was the only one that I found lazy or rushed, because they closed the story quickly and forcibly. There was not a spectacular fight for Bucky and neither for the villain of the series.But I recommend the series because it is the beginning of phase 4 to understand the events that are going to happen in the future.","2 out of 16 found this helpful.

But it doesn't. It manages to tell this really engaging story with a super prescient message interwoven in such an engaging way without making me feel like I needed to do tons of history homework to understand what people were even talking about.Marvel really has gotten this stuff down and their new forays into different series have so far been spectacular with both this and WandaVision knocking it out of the park.

I'm here to acknowledge the progress the MCU and Disney made in developing their characters and remind those comaplaining that the source material was HIGHLY political. Captain America started as pure propaganda. If you don't already know, look up Captain America #1 from 1941. His and the shield's story have kept up with the times as has the message. He was often at odds with his country. While it was fiction it was usually tied to reality. In the end he always fought for what was right, not what he was ordered to do or what was popular.So if you are here to blast the show, be honest. Let everyone know if it's because you don't understand Captain America or if you just want America to go back to the 1940's.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It does get slow at times but I guess the intention was to weave more humanity into the tale rather than a good ole punch-up every episode.I found episode #5 rather tedious, however, the previous four and the finale are paced just right and with enough traditional action to keep everyone happy.The premise of the story pits activists perceived as terrorists against the establishment ""good guys"", who, as it turns out, are many shades of grey within themselves, with personal battles going on alongside the action. The stage is definitely set for another series which looks as though it could go down a more recognised route to super hero adventure.Don't let negative reviews put you off watching. Give it a chance and decide for yourself whether or not to stick with it.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The protagonist of the story is not some dude with godly powers nor have an ambition to take over the world, but rather the dark history that certain people cannot accept and refuse to acknowledge, leading towards institutionalized racism that inspired the disenfranchised to strike back with the government, which literally has super soldiers and gods at their disposal.

"8","/10","My favorite MCU series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6856101/?ref_=tt_urv","BuckysGirl16","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37390470/?ref_=tt_urv","27 April 2021","As a fan of the MCU (and of Bucky Barnes especially), I really enjoyed this show. I really liked seeing the character development of both Sam and Bucky as individuals, and as friends. The show starts out with the struggles they face following the events of ""Avengers: Endgame,"" and into new struggles. While it still includes their hilarious rivalry from the films, it slowly shows them realizing that they have more in common than they realize, and they find a newfound respect for one another.I also liked that the show brought back a few forgotten characters from ""Captain America: Civil War;"" Helmut Zemo and Sharon Carter, and it was very interesting to see their character arcs as well. From showing a more funny and human side to the dark, disgruntled Zemo, to a more streetwise and embittered Sharon Carter, I was really intrigued to see how their characters had been faring since we last saw them in the franchise. Likewise, I thought it was great that the show addressed current issues in our world today, especially systemic racism through the character of Isaiah Bradley- a forgotten super-soldier, whose tragic story was erased from history.On the other hand, while I liked the way the show ended, I was disappointed that they never fully explained what happened to Steve Rogers, especially since he and Bucky never got the best closure that I was hoping for in ""Endgame."" Likewise, I wish they could have given Sharon Carter more redeeming qualities than they did at the show's end. The show did leave a few plot details unresolved, which I would have done differently, but otherwise it does leave Sam and Bucky on a more positive note, with them celebrating their victory with Sam's sister and nephews!","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Yes, but it sure is not as bad as some people are trying to make it. It is not the most subtle of shows, true, but come on, it is a MCU tv show not some Russian art movie ...
For me the show strengh has been the acting, the chemistry among the actors, the banter and the core idea. And I just loved Sebastian Stan, got to admit it.To me, the core idea of the show is about power - who has it really, how it can belong to one person or to a system, how it can corupt but not necesarily. And for an MCU show I think it does a good job at actually having a point.The show weakness was the villan... because we are supposed to believe that the person being the main villan managed to build this huge system but nothing in the story actually shows us that this is true ... it's a lot of tell instead of show, which is the opposite of good writing ... and the actress playing the villain is not all that convincing...
But I liked the set up for season 2 ... looks like a much better bad girl will take the main stage ...","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Falcon and Winter Soldier is great, it's a fun spy thriller.When I talked about the first episode, I hastily claimed Falcon and Winter Soldier is lighthearted. It's actually gritty like the Captain America sequels. Yeah, there's some humor mainly in the first half.Falcon and Winter Soldier fleshes out the characters like any good show should. We learn more about Sam mainly his family. Bucky is tormented by his past and he's trying to make up for his sins. Zemo returns from Captain America: Civil War and he's fleshed out more. The villain isn't another generic villain but I personally find her bland.Falcon and Winter Soldier is leisurely paced, it's fast sometimes. Episode 1 and Episode 5 are slow so some fans feel they're too slow. This show is really political so some fans are upset. The showrunner and most of the writers are black so it has a strong anti-racist message.The action scenes are great in fact this show begins with a huge action scene. Yes, it's really intense like any spy thriller. Episode 5 lacks action which is fine. Yes, the visuals are great mainly the cinematography.Overall, Falcon and Winter Soldier is a fun spy thriller. It's standard MCU but it's not another simple action show. I'm not a parent but I don't think young kids will enjoy it. I recommend Falcon and Winter Soldier to anyone who isn't tired of the MCU.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Racial Inequality & Refugee Crisis became the main themes. Falcon's refusal to take on the mantle took us on this journey to understand what it truly means to be Captain America. Bucky's struggle to come to terms with his Past was another big theme. This whole series was like a clash of ideologies, supplemented by great writing. The Two leads were amazing, and also Wyatt Russell as New Capt. America, Daniel Bruhl as Zemo And Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley stole the show. Isaiah's tragic story was so heartbreaking & essential to this plot. Kari Skogland expertly helms the series & the Action Scenes were top notch. Steve gave him the Shield but with this show Sam truly Earned it. The only con was that the show kind of pushed us to feel sympathy for the enemy group, which didn't work & some of the scenes in final episode were underwhelming. But still its one of the best Superhero Shows out there & Hopefully more seasons will come.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

In my rating system that means: entertaining, keeps my attention, not an awesome plot but not a bad one either.Then, after having watched it, I started watching it again. That never happens. I never watch a series twice in a row. That means something caught my eye in a way other series don't.It's not difficult to guess why I ended up loving the series. The interaction between the bionic gazing machine and goggleman is hilarious. It's a dynamic that elevates the otherwise mediocre plot.Before, I never cared much for the Falcon character. Honestly there isn't much to tell about him and actually there still isn't. As for the Winter Soldier: the movies never did much justice to his horrible background. On top of that I never had much need for the Captain America character to be revived in another form. Now, I would love to see more of them.Many people take offense to the racial storyline. Honestly I think there's a lot of soul gazing that has to be done here. Don't dismiss it as a theme that doesn't belong in Marvel. Racism is a real thing that needs to be addressed. But those who take the message in the movie as a way to make their wrongs right should also be aware that racism works both ways and doesn't justify every action...","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

A marvel movie told over 6 episodes!Highly recommended!","1 out of 13 found this helpful.

I liked Sam because he was always trying hard to do the right thing, but was eventually steered in a direction he didn't think he'd go. Then, I liked the way they addressed some of the complicated issues the world is dealing with now--the fact that there aren't any easy answers, but that we have to look at things differently than we have been. It kind of reminded me of Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, or Gregory Peck in To Kill A Mockingbird.

Captain America's best buddies getting invested in Europe. It's very watchable, because it matches current circumstances. But, honestly, weren't those days a lot better when Germany and France opposed America ? In the 2004 Iraq war ? I mean, do you want to see America's slick Shield in Eastern Europe (like in this mini series) now, after all this ? Still, I enjoyed the show. It's just that Europe is a value-vacuum these days. If you want to take this (great) franchise to Europe, then do it undercover. Like Bucky did in Captain America: Civil War. Just observing, not intervening. Don't get involved. Ironically, Bucky did understand that point while he was brain-washed, in that previous movie. Rogers should have left him in that state, for his own safety. It's a good series, but it would have been better as a spy series. Especially, if you move to Eastern Europe. You don't even know what's going on. The best you can hope for is, success, and next regret. Because you didn't know what was going on. In hindsight, I am surprised that this series is so watchable.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you wanted a black comic book character who is black only in skin tone, this show will disappoint. If you wanted the Falcon to be Malcolm X, you will also be let down. I think when we get some distance from current events people will realize how great a job they did on this show of not leaning too far either way. One of the strengths of MCU characters is how real the people behind the mask feel...and Disney delivers a really fleshed out backstory for Sam. It's more emotionally more akin to Captain America: Civil War than Captain America: The First Avenger. It's legitimately exploring what being a superhero/black/veteran/from a working family might look like; and exploring the path to recovery from trauma that Bucky has to walk in order to heal.","0 out of 10 found this helpful.

Or you simply just want to kill off them, hate them?For those who say this show is blank, character is one dimensional, you should think of these character situation, when you are under these character shoe, will you react like them?Please don't compare this show to Wandavision and any other show.I would say this is one of the rare show that dare to touch these sensitive question, and when people hate this show, it just show that this show has been a successful, because it touch on controversial issue that many people hate to talk about.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Marvel make hits. Kevin Feige knows his stuff!The series is a continuation of The Winter Soldier, while also being a chance to finally explore Sam Wilson, someone who I've felt was of very little consequence, until now.Each episode had me more or less jumping up and down on the couch.This series is expertly written and ties in perfectly with history.Now to all of the white supremacists complaining about this show being ""too political"", you guy's really need to do your homework; X-Men was based on the civil rights era - Malcolm X and MLK. Soooooooooo...
Isaiah's story within this is so apt, given how the US treats it's discarded war ""heroes"".Just look up charles jackson french, and how he died alone, penniless despite saving the majority of his squad from being captured by the Japanese: The man swam 6-8 hours pulling a raft of his squad, in order to circumvent capture. But I'm only hearing about this this morning, after being alive for 37 years. Odd that.Looking through the blatantly fake reviews for this show, I find it ironic that, obvious white supremacists are screaming their usual cries about ""too PC... too woke..."" completely unaware that they're outing themselves as white supremacists. These people are not characterised by their intelligence... otherwise they wouldn't have been talked into committing treason by the dumbest, least educated man on planet earth. If those terrorists who'd ""stormed the capitol"" had been black or brown, there'd have been hundreds, if not, thousands of dead ""terrorists"", but not when they're white. Why? Because the sky's the limit when you're white; you could even be president(even when you're beyond a stupid, incoherent mess of a failure).","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Very welcome surprise to see MMA legend Georges St. Pierre as the head bad guy, too.Anthony Mackie, as The Falcon, is easily the best thing in the show, and he adds a lot of depth and feeling to his performance, making a lot out of an otherwise forgettable script. It's nice to see him finally getting a starring role after paying his dues for so long in all those Marvel films.The Winter Soldier, on the other hand, is unfocused and unlikeable, seeming little like his role in the Captain America films, and alternating between being gloomily impotent and endlessly guilty and then engaging in light sit-com-like quips and awkward humour, which are ill-fitting in tone and poorly-judged, and don't add up to any recognizable personality. The writers have given us nothing to like in him.Every other character is similarly underdeveloped and dull. There's the usual forced diversity quotas and political messaging, though they are relatively subtle for 2021. But regardless, every white man on the show is, as usual, either flawed, weak or evil, and all minorities and women are wholesome, brave and good. It seems very likely the show is going to slide more strongly into racial politics as it goes along, but they did at least keep a loose rein on it for the first episode. My experience of modern television makes me doubt very much it will get any better from here, though.","17 out of 31 found this helpful.

The movies are fast paced, fun and not something to dwell on. Dont think about Thanos's weird plan, just roll with it. The Netflix marvel shows just barely acknowledged the events of the MCU even happened, and were successful for it. Falcon tries to do a deep dive on the blip and unblip, and its just territory not meant to be explored. They tried to frame it as a parallel to Israel-palestine, or syrian refugee resettlement, and then clumsily brought in issues of being black in america...but the infinity saga is really not built to meaningfully tackle these issues.The writing is really poor in the first few episodes as well, and that really doesnt help. Conversations seem to go nowhere. Falcon offers a pardon to a character for help, the character takes offense to using livelihood as a negotiating tactic. Falcon then relents and offers to try to get the pardon anyway, then the character says she doesnt want charity and will help in exchange. What was even the point?! There are so many examples of these small, pointless conversations that seem to waste time, early on. Individually theyre not that bad, but collectively it makes following the story pretty tiresome.The action set pieces are a cut above almost any TV series; especially when an aerial falcon is involved. I think that saves it from being too boring to watch, but its ultimately super forgettable.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was pretty dull and found it hard to get into. It seemed to suffer from the current spate of leftist woke idealisms. I don't have an issue with political issues in film/TV, but they didnt seem to know what exactly they were going for here, i think they tried to make a terrorist we should feel sympathetic towards, but i never did, and at the end when falcon scoops her up like some fallen jesus i just wasnt onboard. They opened a can of political worms which results in the last 10 minutes of the last episode literally being a lecture from falcon to which he gives no tangible solution to the issues they opened other than to 'try harder' or sometging generic like that. I feel this is another sign that its best to just pretend the MCU ended with endgame. End it on a high guys, dont start flogging dead horses.On a side note i also thought it was ridiculous that sam was able to fling caps sheild around and catch it better than cap did and hes not a super soldier nor does he have any sort of robotic arm, i mean caps sheild being able to boomerang back makes no sense anyways but at least it had the whole, 'he has super strength' argument to make it vaguely plausable for him to throw and catch like that.

While I liked parts of it, as others have mentioned in their reviews, I couldn't get past the political garbage they kept throwing in there. First of all, almost no one in this country would have a problem with a black Captain America because of the color of his skin. But, the movie implies that there are enough white supremacists in this country where they need to have some kind of blatant counter narrative to educate white folks. They dip back to the sins of the past and bring them forward as if this the same country as it was back then. Almost no one who would be watching this movie was alive back then. I was for the tail end, and we've moved past all of that, although the media and Hollywood keep doing their best to pull us back in to those times. They are the ones trying to divide us. Unfortunately, it looks like Hollywood and now Disney has bought into Critical Race Theory, so they must assume that all white people are oppressors, even if they are not aware of it, and thus need to be educated about their white privilege. That theory also says all minorities are oppressed and are victims, even if they are not aware of it or do not feel oppressed. Stop it Disney! Don't ruin your TV shows and movies.That being said, I don't think Sam should have been the heir to the Captain America shield and name, and it has nothing to do with the color of his skin. I don't think John Walker should have been either. I don't like the idea of a Captain America that has normal human powers. Bucky should have been the guy. He was the obvious and best choice. He's a super-soldier like Steve Rogers, he is from the same era, and like Sam, he was also Roger's friend (although for a lot longer). Thinking that a normal person could train and have the skills and reflexes necessary to handle that shield the way Rogers did takes away the mystique of Captain America. But, political correctness won the day. I guess being able to expertly fly some amazingly cool wings, being an exceptional ""mortal"" fighter, an outstanding person, and having a cool name like Falcon just wasn't enough.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

I couldn't feel for her cause whatsoever.Second, and this is the big one, the forced issue of being a black superhero and racism was also unbelievable. The fact Sam helped save half the universe AND IS BROKE is laughable. If LeBron can make millions playing a game, I'm pretty damn sure Sam would have been compensated accordingly, at least to the point of fixing up a super old fishing boat. This also suggests that Tony didn't care about his team and didn't have his accounting department set up some sort of salary while the Avengers were still together. To continue this thought, Pepper didn't take care of the heroes when they returned. I don't buy it at all.I rated this show low because it forced me out of fantasy and back into reality; but did so in an unconvincing and contrived way. I just watched a behind the scenes episode of this show, and to see the black writers and Anthony complain about how hard it is to be black in America-while being a part of the biggest franchise in the world-is the equivalent of spitting in the face of the general public. I mean, Anthony did a YouTube video of what he does in a day, and starts off in his huge steam shower. TF? I didn't even know those exist.I wish the movies and shows would continue to keep us in a fantasy world, so we can escape reality, rather than remind us that the human race is awful as a whole. Social media does more than an adequate enough job telling us how much hate there is in the world...now my favorite franchise is an extension of that.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It contains some serious scenes and some humour, but are muddled together in a way that makes little sense and can switch between these in the same scene, making it very confusing and hard to connect with the characters.As well as this, the show (I feel) is poorly written. It again just gives you a sense it doesn't know what direction to go in, and almost feels improvised at times. Furthermore, there are times in the show that just don't make sense, and is not explained how or why these things happened. I can only be attribute this to poor writing and lack of thought gone into it.The characters in the show also feel like a shell of what they were in the movies at times. I'm all for character development but they sometimes just feel completely out of character.Finally, the show got slightly political in one of the episodes, it was very obvious and not subtle at all. This inevitably ruins the immersion and feels like they are trying to shove their political opinion down your throat. Thankfully though, I have only seen this in one episode.Overall I was excited for this show, WandaVision was better in my opinion, I just hope it gets better from here.","21 out of 43 found this helpful.

There are some good action scenes but outside of those few scenes, nothing interesting happens. The show is very slow to develop, there is no chemistry between the leads and it feels like they were forced together. The two don't even meet in the first episode; when they meet in the second episode, they rush from ""you can't come along"" to ""we're partners and will do couples therapy"", despite only teaming up that same day. I could ignore the slow development and plot holes if there was an effort to be fun but there is none. I hear some compliment the ""representation"" in the show very highly but, once again, the show is boring. POSE is great show with lots of ""representation"" that is fun but Falcon and Winter Soldier is not. Simply having ""representation"" does not make up for lack of chemistry or interesting plot threads, you have to make an effort to write a good show. I know I'm ranting but I'm surprised at how highly this show is reviewed and do not understand. Maybe Marvel has done so well with its other properties up through endgame, that many people just default to thinking a marvel show is good without thinking about it. I'm disappointed marvel. This isn't a bad show, it's just boring.","23 out of 48 found this helpful.

I'm guessing most everyone started watching this for Winter Soldier and wanted to know how he's going to deal with PTSD, but the writers/directors ruined that with the awkward psychologist and all her talking telling us what's wrong with Bucky instead of showing, and you know, actually letting Sebastian act!And the dialogue! Oh my god the dialogue is so cringy! It's like they got new writers in here that don't know the shorthand these characters have developed over the last 10 years! The only highlight of each episode is the action, and that is very sparse. I thought Marvel promised us big budget action and that's why we're only getting 6 episodes. There's more action in a CBS procedural!Overall, kinda disappointed. From the previews (that higlighted most of the action) you'd think this is an action show but I don't know what they're trying to do here. A ""realistic"" look at everyday life after The Blip? Who the heck wants that when we had 2020?! And Bucky & Sam will never be ""normal"" people so making him go to a bank for a loan is ridiculous. Also, with all the racial drama it seems like the writers are trying to make our world collide with the Marvel universe, but this is not a CBS procedural! Who thinks a universe with aliens, androids and sorcerers would have the same problems we do?So far, this just doesn't feel like a Marvel product. Even WandaVision's craziness felt more like Marvel! I really hope this gets better (that is, that the writers found their groove before the last episode) and be a worthy entry into the Marvel universe.","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

The comparison with WV is the obvious one, but already at the second TV series from Marvel the quality has dropped a lot.From the trailer it seemed this could have been a cool mix of Captain America and a Mission Impossible, instead is just a lame story with the characters you know from the MCU.So starting from the story: it's lame even for MCU standards. General bad girl try to do what she thinks is good, but with bad means, so superhero is angry and has to stop her.Also half of the seriest is directed to the fact that the Falcon is black, in case you didn't see it yourself from the cover already, and is like the producers took the tweets from the BLM protests and put them directly in Falcon's mouth.Another big difference with respect to WV, is that in WV it's seems like the story is moving on at the end, so when you watch the next movies there will be something new you have to know. In this one instead all you need to know for future MCU movies could be summed up in 30 sec.I don't know how to end a review, so.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

But the overall experience and mood ...I don't now if its the directing, the writing, the general direction of the series, my own expectations after WandaVision, or the forcing direction of ""what this series has to be""; I really don't know. I only know that - as a whole - it is not believable, I feel like its not been taken seriously and at the same time way to serious for what could have been a really fun series.After watching all of it I am just sad for how awesome this almost could have been, and am hoping for a (better) second season, which is hopefully not only about the (from episode 3 on obvious) power broker ...","14 out of 27 found this helpful.

Zoom out again, then half way from zooming out immediately transition to a walk away shot which feels awkward like it was decided last minute to use that angle.

I think we were all so hopeful because we are so invested in Sam and Bucky, and the charm and gravitas of these two leads is undeniable. So while I still adore the primary actors and always will, and I appreciate how just their presence is making the show watchable, the series as a whole is what I consider to be a failure because they've gone into it without any real sense of direction or competent scripting. There are some sweet moments however, I found the first episode to be one of the best, and felt it may yet overcome the lack of story, but no, they went down the endlessly preaching road, the endlessly standing around talking about feelings road, which really is a cheap way of getting out of having a plot. The primary baddie, while to my eyes a very striking and beautiful young woman, is utterly tedious as a character. I can't count how many times I was bored to sobs and almost turned it off, most often when she was talking or doing anything at all really. Next time I think Marvel will have to take better care with their combination of writing and casting their bad guys. So often a superhero film bases much of its success on the gravitas of the baddie, and there is ZERO gravitas here. I like Zemo, I like Sam's sister, but without a real plot nearly every great actor here is wasted. Marvel also needs to consider - if we are going to preach politics non-stop, are we preaching to the choir? Preaching to the choir is boring for everybody. Most Marvel fans (I find) are already anti-racism/anti-evil, so why spend every single minute preaching our beliefs back at us? We're already on board with a black Cap, so just give us a rollicking adventure already! This is why Superheroes are so popular in the first place - the momentum of adventure! Such a waste of talent. Please, please Marvel, don't repeat the mistake in future. Go back to your roots, and let the good script and the story carry the day! Not all the standing around whining about things we are already aware of. This is supposed to be escapism at it's highest! Educate WHILE the plot is in motion, don't make us have to sit through lectures please. We can get that anywhere else in the world.","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

One, if you use a comma. The dialogue is painful and there are some serious logic flaws in most of the ""battle"" scenes. Marvel has also decided, since this show is obviously marketed toward the machismo-driven man audience, to throw in some tongue-in-cheek ""no homo""-type scenes. I've counted no less than four so far. Very disappointing compared to any other movie in the MCU, and especially when compared to the ingenuity and creativity seen in wandavision. Very disappointed so far.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

This never happens, it is quite dull and boring. I think even Gilmore Girls had more suspense and plot twists (although I never watched it).The only thing that made me sit through this was the longing for something better, which never came.

And the part where both Sam and Bucky received therapy in the cell and Bucky asked ""Why did you give up the shield?"", it was very sad... I detest the new captain america. Every time he made his appearances in the series, trust me, I am cursing and swearing inside, and I definitely enjoy watching the Dora Milaje kicking his ass in Ep 04.Likes: I like the banters/jokes between Bucky & Sam, and the concept of Winter Soldier serum resurfacing. Fight scenes are getting better at every episodes too.Dislikes:
WandaVision started off awkward for me at first, because I couldn't understand the reason for the black/white TV sitcom and couldn't see where it was going. But after watching further on, it finally made sense, sort of gave me an idea how things are going to evolve in future Phase 4 films. But for Falcon and the Winter Soldier, now that the series has finished, I honestly feel that it is still lacking in some ways, not up to my personal expectations. Nothing to anticipate, nothing to look forward to. Just entertaining enough to watch over the weekend.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Apparently ""super soldiers"" are supposed to be super strong and this should be a fairly central point of this entire show as stopping more super soldiers to be created is a main task of this show's protagonists. But super soldiers (i.e. Winter Soldier) get their asses kicked by non-super soldiers all the time (e.g. New Cap A holding his own against both Winter Soldier and Falcon, Thanos style, in ep 4).The show is also full of the same wokeness that has destroyed so many other potentially good shows and movies of late.

This is not true and every American should be proud of their country.

The show stars Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan as the titular characters coming to terms with the new world post blip. Following the reveal of the new Captain America a.k.a. John Walker played by Wyatt Russell, the crew is forced to work together to combat a wave of terrorism brought on by a radical group known as the Flag-Smashers. While WandaVision focused heavily on the fantastical side of the MCU, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a gritty action series that tries to recreate the themes present in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and even though the grounded nature of the series is a good change of pace, sadly the show does not recreate the same magic that was present in the aforementioned Captain America film.Now The Falcon and the Winter Soldier starts off promising enough, with an interesting premise and setting up of characters. Bucky Barnes remorse for his actions committed as the Winter Soldier was very intriguing and I liked the direction they were taking his character, however after the second episode he more so just becomes the stock hero type and while his arc does see a bit of a resolution at the very end of the show, it just doesn't feel as strong as it could have been. That notion of satisfactory achievement is the main issue I have with the show, it never felt like it lived up to its own potential. There are plenty of moments throughout the six episodes that could have been poignant and impactful but rather felt surface level and rather hollow. Take for example the show tackling social injustice in America; while that is a theme that would be fairly new to the MCU and something that could be quite enthralling, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier doesn't do a whole lot with it to make it as impactful as it could have been. I can appreciate the inclusion of those themes however they felt rather lacklustre and like the filmmakers weren't as invested in making those themes of race and relations anything more than superficial.Beyond that, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier suffers from a lot of downtime, where characters sort of meander about before the next action sequence, making for a series that felt a little boring at times. The only real character or story arc I was interested in, was the plotline with John Walker, as the introduction of a new Captain America and him trying to live up to Steve Rogers with only having a very casual understanding of the man. It was a storyline that felt fresh for the MCU and although I am not totally in love with what the writers did with the character at the end, he was easily a highlight for me during the series.All in all, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a series that is going to end up being quite forgettable in the grand schemes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While it does set up the next iteration of Captain America, I feel like the viewer could skip this whole series and easily figure out what's going on in the next MCU releases. With that, there are some interesting moments within the series, however, if you're a casual viewer I don't totally recommend this series even with it being a brisk mini-series of only six episodes. Although I was expecting to like this series more, I am excited to see what is in store for Falcon and Bucky Barnes as they transition into more of a central role within the universe. For now, though, The Falcon and the Winter Solider remains a series that could have been greater than what was presented and for that reason, I am giving it a 5.5/10.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Then the script was awkward and the direction of the 'U. S. Agent guy ended on a underwhelming note.

That's my main ""super-short-review"" for anyone who ask me about it. As a Marvel fan from the beginning (and a comic book reader way before the first Spider-Man movies) I'm not ashamed of considering myself a strong fan of mostly everything that the MCU brings to the big or the small screen and yes, I'm always going for it with excitement.Some movies and TV series are better and some are worst. This one is average in my opinion. It's not thaaat bad, it has some nice action moments and some interesting character development, but there's no ""wow"" factor at any point during the 6 episodes of its first and only season. We all kind of saw coming many of the so called cliff-hangers and I guess the plot itself is the main antagonist of the show. It doesn't follow a clear line, it doesn't have a clear purpose. Even those sort of ""bad guys"" are not that bad and they're not treated as such.It feels as some kind of ""in between"" two things so as entertaining as it is it doesn't really work strongly on its own.

You can get across deep messages without words but with actions and sequences if you're a talented writer, which is a skill they lacked.Whoever thought people watch super hero movies/shows to see them struggling with issues such as trying to get a bank loan or going to therapy, obviously don't understand why people like superheroes. Yes it might humanize them more, but it's also the things people typically watch these kinds of movies to escape from.The first two episodes are slow paced and not great. The middle two episodes actually had good pacing and character development. The second last episode slows to a crawl and the final episode does not deliver on all the possibilities the rest of the season had set up. Which just left me feeling disappointed and with unanswered questions.The main villain felt like they had a lot of potential but it was never delivered on. Same with other characters I won't mention so I don't spoil things.If you want to keep up to date with what's happening in the marvel universe everything meaningful that transpired in this show can be summed up into one sentence. So, it's really not worth the 5 hour runtime.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"3","/10","MCU's Shift to Television: Is it Working?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9039010/?ref_=tt_urv","sanadalsalt","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur87081876/?ref_=tt_urv","7 May 2023","This is my attempt at rewriting the given text:When I heard that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be scaled down to television and other personal screens for streaming, I feared that it would result in mind-numbingly intricate character development, nonsensical political struggles, and TV filler. However, the issue is not merely the endless talk and walking scenes that delay the confrontations between superheroes and villains, but also the repetitive arguments that replay across several episodes. Watching Sam and Bucky fixing a boat, Sam applying for a bank loan, or Bucky talking in circles with a shrink isn't what I wanted. Additionally, the post-blip politics of a war on terror over national borders or whatever seems to be inconsequential. Furthermore, Sam's speech at the end is atrociously artificial and engineered by Disney executives to rally the common people. The generic fanaticism of the Flag Smashers was even worse.Despite being released theatrically, the MCU has been a serial with over 20 episodic series on bigger screens and with bigger budgets. It's not necessarily a bad thing, considering that the first comic-book superhero movies were serials released in theaters like ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" (1941) and the Fleischer Studios ""Superman"" (1941 and thereafter) cartoon series. Even the Superman and Batman feature-length blockbusters became part of multi-film franchises in the 1970s and 1980s. If the series were split into two or three theatrically-released movies, it would have been better than six episodes released one per week, seemingly just enough time for us to forget the last episode was the same thing. In that spirit, it's the worst MCU episode since ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008).""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" is even more disappointing because it comes after the cleverly-reflexive ""WandaVision"" (2021), which understands and exploits its medium instead of suffering from it. ""WandaVision"" is a TV series about the magic of creating them, and even Wanda's grief-stricken retreat into nostalgia works better on the level of character interest. It ingeniously ended with shapeshifting in an empty theatre. In contrast, we're supposed to get excited by a cameo from an actress who reminds us of a better TV series. The acting was bland, the story tried to add too many characters that we were supposed to care about, and it had convoluted storylines with tons of plot holes and unanswered questions.Moreover, racial politics are littered throughout the show, often in ways that are preachy and puzzling. In one episode, Bucky takes Sam to meet Isaiah Bradley, a Super Soldier used by the US government during Vietnam to track down the Winter Soldier. Bradley was badly mistreated by the government following his service and is unwilling to help. After they leave, the cops pull up and start harassing Sam (somehow not recognizing the famous Avenger). The heavy-handed politics keep coming, unfortunately. The idea that Sam was passed over for the job of Captain America and it was given to a white dude who is clearly the World's Greatest Monster for taking the job permeates the show. By the end, when Sam decides to take the mantle of Captain America for himself, it's driven home over and over again that he's black and that this is somehow a Very Big Deal. This despite the numerous black superheroes that nobody has a problem with. If the discussion of race was left out of the equation entirely, nobody would bat an eye. We were already expecting Sam to become Captain America after Endgame, and nobody cared one way or another.After Sam beats the Flag Smashers and saves the GRC members with his super suit, he lays into the senators and global representatives, telling them.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has such an unrealistic plot and hollow characters. But the nail in the coffin is the pacing or the lack of. Nobody watches these films for politics or to watch someone struggle with his income, if we wanted that, there are plenty of great dramas out there. And if you want to make it about politics then you've got to have compentet writers to back it, The Winter Soldier(2014) was Marvel's best film, because it didn't rely on flashy effects and an estabilished universe, it wanted to set itself apart from it's peers and that why it's the film that I respect most in the MCU. Even the actors look bored in some scenes, can't say I blame them. The visual effects are the only departmant where this series doesn't fail but I'll take a good story with bad effects any day of the week.Story: 2/10

I loved the slow burn because it was obvious that it was going to big bada boom in a spectacular fashion. And by the end I couldn't get enough of it.But this one had the complete opposite effect. I ignored my misgivings towards who I consider to be the most boring, uninteresting Avenger (Falcon) and the equally boring ""babyface"" Winter Soldier (much better as a heel), and I went into this with an open mind. I was interested to see Zemo back because I'm a Bruhl fan, even Emily VC.Unfortunately that was not meant to be. By halfway through I was already feeling drowsy and was ready to turn it off. I'll spare you the spoilers, but too much uninteresting over-done drama that we've already seen too much of in the MCU.Whoever claims the first episode is action-packed is clearly watching something else. And who on earth did that awful CGI??I should've stuck with my original plan to wait until the entire series has aired so I can marathon it instead, and fast forward to the next episode if one got too bleh.Well, at least we still got Loki to look forward to.","15 out of 34 found this helpful.

They have played out the characters everyone fell in love with Marvel over (Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, etc) and instead of tapping into the vast Marvel Universe to bring in new characters they moved on to the bench players that no one really cares about. Most previous main Marvel characters are good protagonists and they have solid antagonists but with Falcon and Bucky being B rated characters it will be very difficult to really get into their story. Marvel writers need to go through the archive and read all the old comics again to get better ideas.","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

It seemed like a snap back to the avengers-style marvel generic stuff, and I think we weren't massive fans of this because WandaVision varied so much from a typical Marvel MCU film. Personally, I liked it, that's why I've given it 10, because no matter what I WILL probably rate this 9 or 10 by the end of the series. I would give ep.1 a 7, but that would've gone for WandaVision ep.1 as well so I don't know what to say. All I'm saying is if you want a good show for a Friday night, this is the one. It's the action packed marvel we all love! The fighting at the start was great, and I look forward to get more into the individuality of the two now Cap is out of the series, may he rest in peace.

After the first few episodes, it was apparent that the premise of the show has become very politically correct and woke. It's unfortunate that there is no originality to this series and they are jumping on the leftist bandwagon. Disney and the writers are basically saying it is okay to entertain all by compromising values and serve a purpose of trying to convert people to your thinking... not very Captain America-esque. Also, the theme that it is the government's responsibility to step in and take care of all of its people to the point where everyone is dependent on the government and under their control is not the American values many people were raised. Unfortunately, all of these storylines made up for the overall theme for the rest of the season. It did have potential to be a good show with an interesting storyline but unfortunate of the writers to push their narrative.... hopefully, we do not receive a second season.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

Maybe because until then the lack of logic and storytelling wasnt that obvious.It is quite irritating to see that they seemingly had all the money in the world, but just no real story to tell. High profile actors doing a amateur piece. If they had just cut episode 5 completely nobody would have noticed. There is so much more obvious weird stuff going on I dont want to go in to, there is just no way there will ever be a second season - having that said I realize they are actually considering it.

Instead of developing the characters and establishing the bad guy we had to watch Bucky and Sam fix a boat for half the show. Its a dang boat who freakin cares. Even without that stuff it would still suck. Its poorly written, The characters are 2d. They don't have depth. And bonus they had to make Sharron Carter a bad guy.

(if you can even call her that) has zero flashbacks to previous events in her life, 1,5 minutes to talk about her hardships in life and zero interaction with her fellow group members.The only redeeming qualities are:

The series starts with a bang, but fizzles out very quickly to a slow, boring and almost snail pace and I felt like I was watching so much setup, fan service and nostalgia that Disney+ forgot to make a TV series. This seems to be a problem with Disney+ series which include Wandavision or The Mandolorian, they're so busy hyping up the lore, canon for avid comic / book fans they forget their casual viewers lose out. This is why reviews seem to be divided, hardcore fans love it, casual viewers are like - meh! I feel other streaming networks are nailing the TV formula - maybe why that's why Star was introduced because they needed good 'already proven' TV franchises on the platform. .....this really needs to change, you can't use your properties like this, they'll need a good 'all-rounder' (that serves everyone!) film / TV show soon or else they'll be losing subscribers.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

I loved the Bucky and Sam dynamic, and Sam used to be my fourth favorite character in the MCU. I expected this to be a sitcom, which I guess led to me disliking it as much as I did, but it really should have been a true dramedy instead of a drama show. It should have followed the precedent that the MCU had set of an even balance of lightheartedness and seriousness, especially since Bucky and Sam's dynamic lends itself to comedy.Not to mention I was really sick of the politics and race stuff. If I'm going into it and expecting that, then fine. But it really wasn't necessary for this show. I was so bored and I hated it so much. Sam was a great supporting character before this show and I sincerely loved him until this show. The race politics felt forced the entire time - enough people wanted Sam to be the next Cap that he did end up becoming Cap. I used to be one of those people but now, I just...I wish there wasn't a Cap replacement. And then there was Karli and I cannot put into words how much I hated her. She was supposed to be sympathetic but there was really no good reason for me to sympathize with her or like her. She wasn't compelling, nor were any of the other Flag Smashers. Literally the only reason I watched this show all the way through was Zemo. I pray to God this show isn't necessary for the understanding of the MCU from this point forward because I will not watch this show any more.Again, keep in mind, I was looking forward to this show more than any other. Had it not been for Hawkeye, I would have given up on the MCU altogether. It should have been a sitcom.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

It's largely formulaic but acceptably so. Unfortunately the entertainment is often interrupted and corrupted by propaganda supporting critical race theory and an open and constantly stated hatred of Caucasians.There are many race baiting scenes, completely unnecessary to the overarching plot and ironically at odds with the show's own themes. Were the racial commentary to be excised the show would be stronger, but watching it many will come to the conclusion that Disney places more value on the radical left propaganda than anything else.Consequently you're given characters that aren't allowed to be defined as individuals; everything must be viewed in the context of race. When the original Captain America is referenced it's always about his blonde hair, blue eyes and pale skin. That takes precedence over the content of his character. Fans of the original comics will be disappointed.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

This show is another step down on the glory days of the MCU. Again, there have been multiple character assassinations. Bucky, Sam and Carter, they have not been the same, and their 'progression' if you wanna call it that, makes absolutely no sense. Walker was a nice addition though, I did not see that coming. Still he also got instantly wasted in the climax. The Villains of this show are a joke, foremost Karli, what a weak and stupid character. Her motives and actions make no sense at all. In the end even sam thinks she is not wrong in her doings which is insane. She killed a lot of people. It's hilarious. Even the action is bad, switching the powerlevels of the combatants constantly to keep it exciting, which it never was.RIP Falcon and the Winter soldier

Try harder, Marvel.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

First of all, that Hobbs and Shaw wannabe of a tv show falls really short. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, erg, they just don't click, I thought I saw a glimpse of something somewhere, but they just don't go well together.

Though in this case they ""eviled"" her up.Without going into spoilers, the power broker is almost exactly the same as shadow broker from video games Mass Effect trilogy (yes, even the name is similar). When a positive character became an underground boss. While the games actually keep the character on the good side of grey, the series simplified it to the simple good\bad scenario.That created a pleathora of plot holes, but never the less it was fun enough to watch.This show is better than other marvel shows, but all in all, even the beloved characters can't keep the show on the same level as Marvel movies, aside from few very notable exceptions, such as as Cpt. Marvel or Eternals.Wouldn't watch it twice, but once is good enough.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now, having watched the whole thing, the first episode was probably the best one.My main issue with this series is that it is not what I, as a fan, was promised. It's hard not to compare it to Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014) seeing as the creators of the show invited us to and it is also a continuation of the Cap trilogy, but the plot, the dialogue, the characters and even the fight scenes are not up to scratch.I found Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson so unbelievably dull that I can't even find something about him that somebody might like. He certainly is not strong enough to lead a series on his own, because, let's face it, this was 90% Falcon, 10% Winter Soldier. And it's a shame - I genuinely believe that Mackie gave his all to the role. The bad writing didn't help but maybe he just isn't the right kind of actor to lead something like this.Whereas I had total faith in Sebastian Stan and I used to think that Bucky was one of the most unique and interesting characters in the MCU but maybe the writers just forgot about him? There was so much potential there and they just didn't do it? Honestly, I feel cheated.I found Zemo quite pathetic, the Flagsmashers forgettable but US Agent was actually okay. I thought Wyatt Russel was the perfect fit for the role and there was such depth and duality to the character which made him a very believable antihero and one I'm actually excited to see more of in other projects.I won't go too much into the political aspect of the show but I'll go as far to say it was a mistake and I didn't like it. I think it was episode 2 where we caught a glimpse of where the story was going before COVID-19 hit and it was better, living up to the hype. It's a shame they had to change the storyline, and even more of a shame that they changed it how they did.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The other themes were the aftermath of the blip and refugees from this event as well as Bucky trying to get over his traumatic past.But honestly, the plot was really really boring. I'm not gonna lie, I only watched this show to understand what comes after - though as I realize now, most of this show is filler. I for one was never a fan of Captain America and also not too keen on his sidekicks, so really this show bored me a lot.Yeah, it was nothing special and only about the super serum again.

The only two episodes I enjoyed were written by Derek Kolstad (John Wick, Nobody). The show had a lot of potential but the plot was such a mess! The plot line was jumpy, as though written by an amateur.The few minutes Julia Louis-Dreyfus appeared on screen were some of the best. She's such a great actress that she can work magic with only a few words. Daniel Bruhl was also really good. I was excited to see Carl Lumbly. Unfortunately the best characters got the least screen time.It's sad when many shows fail when they tackle real and relevant issues. If the writing was better, if the plot was solid, if the villain was charismatic, if the hero was well defined, maybe then it could've been a good show.Netflix's Daredevil did such a great job (S1 & 3) setting up the hero, the villain, the anti-hero...sigh...

I think it should have stayed away from politics at least not to the extent it does, it makes it a bit boring at times with long scenes of straight dialogue. I think that the heroes are really great in this, especially falcon. His character has an extreme amount of development, whether its backstory, personality or his relationship with bucky. Bucky has only really got development with falcon as he has already been developed across previous movies. As far as villains...they ain't that good. I did actually quite enjoy the US agents character arc, albeit a bit predictable but it was fun. However, anything to do with Carly was just bland, her character is just plain dreadful with no emotion, no epically cool powers or any stand out features. Her motivations are somewhat understandable and suck. Also I don't know what it was but something about her annoyed me, in the wrong way though, maybe it was the accent or bad dialogue but she just seemed fake and everything she said literally turned into a motivational speak about the same exact thing time and time again. Oh and zemo is there also. The action is really strong, there is a bit too many cuts and weird camera angles that stop you from seeing some cool punches which is a bit annoying, if you do see it, it is good. Really the best part was the ending, perfectly sets up future movies/tv shows and has a great speech about BLM to top it off. Its pretty good overall so I would give it a 7/10, it's certainly better than wandavision IN MY OPINNION, don't take it personally!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This race baity and female supremacy combination is utter and total disaster.Fire the writers, or better yet: completely disband the screenwriter's guild of america because clearly, when they went on strike 15 years ago: something went very wrong at the negotiation tables.I watched 3 episodes of this 'black and white buddy' actionish flick and all I got was 3 hours of BLM, hateful on white males particularly, and MORE of the female supremacy BS.The actors aren't to blame, they just read the script. The script comes from the writers, and the writers follow the rules of the studio. So now we understand, why 'mickey mousing' the MCU with Disney ownership, would make Stan Lee rise from the grave just to eat you all in revenge.I'm checking out of the MCU now, phase 4 no longer interests me, and if anyone out there wants anything to change you better do the same and influence with your spending / viewship or lack thereof and encourage others to do the same who agree with you. Maybe after another billion dollar company goes bankrupt (they do own disneyland too and the revenues there are way down lately) we can see something the audience has the final word on instead of the owners.

But if it hadn't been for her, I'd have stopped watching this after the first two or three episodes.The socio-political racial inequality browbeating just became unbearable. The writers have carefully crafted into the storyline that the audience is supposed to take the same journey of ""realization"" as the Falcon character. His original reasons for not wanting to take on the Captain America mantle have nothing to do with injustice; he just feels as though the original Captain America shield belongs with its original bearer and that he is not that character. But as the story progresses, he is being told that the shield embodies social injustice and that he is not meant to have it because he's black.So now we are expected to apologize for not understanding the ""woke"" reason Falcon did not want to take the shield, just as Bucky did toward the close of the next to last episode.Are the writers going to make Falcon a super soldier or are we expected to believe he's just superhuman out of the box?...cue scene from ""The Winter Soldier"" where Steve Rogers is running laps near the Lincoln Memorial and Falcon can't match him. I had no problem with Falcon taking the Captain's shield but now I do since it's become a soapbox for politics. The Captain and the colors of his uniform embodied our Nation's sense of pride and victory in WWII and Falcon could have done that as well, but that storyline doesn't fit the progressive mold.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

All the way from Iron Man to Avengers: Endgame. I love all the films, and they have a certain magic to them when you watch them. I was excited to watch their first ever series, Wandavision. I was expecting something new and exciting, and it was ok, but wasn't great. I put this down mainly to not liking the characters as much perhaps. I was more excited to watch The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, as I knew it was going to be action packed and feature Zemo, one of my favourite villains. The first episode was terrible. They give us a magnificent, action packed opening, hint at an underlying storyline which I was excited to learn more about. Then the episode completely veers off into Sam's family background, and the rest of the episode revolves around an argument about a boat. What the hell. With very little going on in Bucky's world. Then at the end of the episode, we return to what I actually cared about and wanted to watch, which was the villain gang known as the Flagsmashers. Roll credits. Not much happened. Episode 2. Sam and Bucky randomly meet with no build up or real progression. Their stories don't intertwine, they just randomly appear together. Good action, boring villain, interesting characters. Then from episode 3 to 4, we have random bursts of bloody brutal violence that is completely unlike marvel and out of style. I thought these were kids shows? Bloody violence is not common in marvel films, but, here it is in a series. I personally liked the adult theme, but I wouldn't let my kids watch that. Episode 5, complete garbage. Repeat of episode 1 - great opening scene, rubbish filling about a meaningless boat. Maybe they ran out of ideas so decided to return to the pointless boat story? Oh and of course, the whole racial deal. I think the black super soldier puts it as 'a white folk shield'. Ok :/Overall, to sum everything up, I don't know what the hell is going on at marvel, and I don't think they even know. Their style changes so much throughout the series I think they forgot what they are best at doing? They must have lost a sense of their audience too, which is primarily children. Each episode feels different, like it doesn't fit as a whole, and don't get me started on the weird camera choices (I am a filmmaker myself). Oh and the boring villain who no one cares about. Did I mention that? Can we see more of John Walker maybe? Far more interesting. Let's hope Loki saves them, cause this is no good.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Not the best, but definitely entertaining.Nearly all of the bad reviews are clearly from white men (I am a white man FYI). They all complain this is propaganda, pushing an agenda, virtue signaling, anti-white and / or anti-men. While there are some moments that show race / gender issues, it's only a few and barely part of the show. It's just that it happens early in the season, so people get hung up right away.While I do agree the biggest such scene isn't very believable, it's super common for shows to force drama into the script. This is only a problem because it's includes a racial issue, even if it's a real issue people experience? You know what's more unbelievable? 99% of hero's in film being white men. Do you also complain about that?It's not even about the fact that there is a message that's a problem. These weak-minded people never take issue if the agenda is starving children or sex trafficking. But when the fictional antagonist shares their gender and skin color, they feel personally attacked. If you can't separate yourself from the racist acts, you might actually be racist. You should be able to see this kind of thing and just feel empathy without feeling attacked.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The stories that are told are not bad. Where this series failed is the number of stories that were being told. It seemed like they wanted to cram a ton of stuff into only 6 episodes. The series could have dropped the Sharon Carter portions of the series and left the audience wondering who she was. Bucky's redemption story was a great idea! Sam's character development was a great idea! Isaiah Bradley's story was a great idea! The problem is that the series tried to fit all of those great ideas into six episodes and the result was some very great stories being diluted down. I understand they are trying to set things up for the future movies yet to be released, but Marvel shot itself in the foot with this series.It wasn't an epic fail by any means. There are plenty of great moments. The final speech that Sam gives is moving; however, the series spent so much time trying to focus on other stories that his speech just felt like it was trying to get virtue points from the audience--when really his speech deserved more than that.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The timeline that they are constructing is something that we've never seen before. 23 movies so far, perfectly connected with a solid thread that keeps on getting more and more complex.WandaVision started a new era of mini TV-series that would keep on building up this thread, setting a very high level and creating nothing we've ever seen before in the superhero genre.Falcon and the Winter Soldier unfortunately doesn't keep up to the expectations, thought it's not completely bad. It's packed with good action scenes and the plot is solid, as something that we can expect from the MCU, but somehow weak.Nothing really relevant happens during these six episodes and the whole tone is built on something that you've seen before. Action movies with no depth. The characters are not super interesting and the acting is sometimes a bit bad.Can I watch an action series? Of course I can! Will it keep me entertained? Yes!

Amounting to little more than six hours of exposition, cringe-inducing attempts at humor, awful action sequences, and incoherent, muddled politics, it is a miniseries that exists for three reasons:1) To gain Disney+ subscribers2) To fill out contracts3) To set up future installmentsThe actors do their best, but being given trifling cutouts to work with largely hinders the performances, with Bucky in particular still being less of a character than a prop (on a relative note, Sebastian Stan is not good in this at all). The final two episodes have some decent beats, but they don't work as a satisfying payoff for me because I didn't care during the first four episodes in the first place.

I just wish he wasn't portrayed as cast out. It would have been nice if he has a good life even though he was never in the spotlight when he achieved all he did.BUT I DID NOT LIKE that little 16 year old girl that could kick everyone's butt. Lol It is hilarious. She took me right out of the show completely. I feel like I need to give her some milk and cookies before she does her algebra homework. It was HILARIOUS watching her fight grown men and throw them around. Oh and I don't care about super solider blah blah blah, WS also is one and he should have caught her and sent her back to high school.PLEASE MARVEL STOP FORCING BAD STORYTELLING AND CHARACTERS ON US. You are KILLING WHAT YOU BUILT.You want to write strong female characters take notes from Wonder Woman, ALL the star wars females, Jessica Jones, tons of WELL WRITTEN FEMALE characters.So far EVERY single marvel TV show has written CORNY FEMALE Villains that do not capture your attention for even one second.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't see a problem with that.But if you it, do it really. The ""Black Power"" part in the end is okay and far less cringe than in other films. But the whole issue about the refugees/displace people remains totally flat. This becomes obvious especially in the last episode when Sam tells the senator to leave the immigrants where they are and the senator asks him what will happen to all the people who have returned and who are the actual owners of these houses. Sam's reaction is like ""I don't know, who cares? Whatever, you are the politician, figure it out.""
This is just one example, but it shows well that they wanted to do something ""serious"" and ""political"" without thinking through it at all. After all, they wanted to keep the show as simple as possible. This is also shown by the fact that they didn't believe its audience to be able to follow more than one politician without getting confused. There's only one American politician (the old white man) who is spoken to as ""the senator"". But on the same time, he's leading the hearing by the military, the other hearing by the secret service and he's kind of the head of the UN.Overall, a flat storyline which would be okay if the show wouldn't take itself so super serious. Also, some character's actions don't make sense.But there are good action and fight scenes and some funny dialogues.5.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story has no depth. Too many holes, forced scenes, lifeless characters. They are like lifeless shadows with expensive outfits but cannot connect with the viewer's emotions.The action scenes are the highlight of this show. Perhaps this is the only positive thing compared to Wandavision, where everything is painted with CGI. I quite enjoy the action scenes. And Falcon's suit, too. Very interesting, eye-catching.Actually, the story of Falcon and WS could have been an interesting mountain where there were plots, spies and sacrifices, but it turned out to be just a pond behind the house.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Put together to hype something that will come later..
With weak villains and plot. At it's worst, it has predictable turns and events (specially for anyone experienced in story-telling and even more so for Comic book fans)... Almost everything that happens I saw coming, and I'm no genius.That aside, it has some very good action scenes, good character interactions (Falcon and Bucky more than anything) and character ""arc"".I specially liked the final ""speech"" and the way the character of ""Isaiah Bradley"" was addressed.As a whole, it helps pass the time.. but in no way feels like part of the ""big"" MCU, but more like an upgraded Agents of Shield.

When I saw there was a standalone series about him and Sam I was *really* excited, but watched the movies and all beforehand for context.This series had so much promise. I was also totally on board with the idea of Sam being the new Captain America but I wanted to see him struggling with the expectations and responsibilities of the role before fully embracing it. That would have done Sam justice, it would have been a great broadening of his character arc.The first Episode also teased us with the possibility that the series would seriously examine poor Bucky's PTSD and trauma from the years of torture and brainwashing he endured during his time as the Winter Soldier, and how he was trying to come to terms with everything. I wanted that, I trusted them to do it.... and they let us down on both counts.By Episode 3 it became obvious: the heavy-handed political messaging was more important than the plot, or developing and continuing the story of such beloved characters as Bucky and Sam.I already said that I was happy with the idea of Sam becoming the new Captain America- and I am. Steve passed him the shield, but I expected self-doubt and Sam being hesitant to take up the role. I wanted soul searching. That's fine. What we got instead was a plot centred around racial injustice.Sam is told he can't be Captain America because *oppression of Black people* and he will be aligning with the ""enemy"". Yeah- basically doing what Steve, one of his best and closest friends entrusted him to do will make same a certified race traitor.I seem to recall the role had *nothing* to do with race, and that Steve was picked because the man who developed the original Super Soldier foruma saw the goodness and kindness of his heart. He saw a man who would not be corrupted by power. THAT was the core message, its a universal one: those are are not corrupted by power and do not abuse power are the ones who deserve to wield it most.Not according to Disney. Now its your skin colour. That''s literally all that matters.This in turn leads to what in my mind is the most offensive line in the entire series, when Isaiah basicallly tells Bucky that he is not a victim. I get that Isaiah is bitter about what happened to him. He had reason to be: but Bucky was NOT the cause of that. They were both victims.Bucky was captured, tortured and brainwashed to make him a slave of HYDRA and a mindless killing machine: like Isaiah he had the Super- Soldier serum put into him without his consent or even knowledge.Unlike Isaiah though, Bucky was not able to return to what was left of his family. He had nobody left because he had been enslaved for twice as long, and during his time as the WS was entirely stripped of his agency and personhood, even his very identity.This could have been us two trauma victims and former servicemen who had both been betrayed by the very regimes which they had once served struggling to come to terms with their pain and brokenness. Isaiah and Bucky could actually have worked very well together, just because of their similar experiences.However, the writers made their meeting into an excrucuating forced speech about racial injustice. We're told that Bucky bascially can't be a victim because he's white, and that Isaiah has more in common with Sam (they have literally NOTHING in common) because they are both black.Then, just to make it even more painful, the police turn up when the two are bickering in the street outside Isaiah's house and engage in some profiling of Sam. We're led to believe that Sam is going to get into trouble for being black--- not Bucky though he's clearly recognizable as the former assassin with the conspicious metal arm.REALLY?So the cops are going to arrest Sam for being black and not the dude who literally went on a killing spree last him he was out loose in the streets of a major city before effectively disappearing for 7 years?Yup: the political messaging bludgeons you harder than being smacked with Bucky's Vibranium fist.I finished the series because..... 5 hours of Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie with banter, but it was such a huge disappointment in all areas.I absolutely hated what the writers did to Bucky in so many ways, and how they either forgot about his PTSD or failed to address it after Episode 1. The conclusion of that story arc was covered as an afterthought in like 30 seconds, when it deserved much longer.That is not representation of people with PTSD which one of the showrunners talked about. That is the worst kind of tokenism. The same showrunner also tried to suggest that Bucky's traumatic background, brainwashing and torture were some kind of ""excuse""- which is just... not what someone says when they're trying to be sensitive about mental health issues.Apparently, it has now been confirmed that Stan's character won't appear in the 4th Captain America movie at all, despite having been present in all of the previous 3, and despite the conclusion of the series suggesting that Bucky had formed a close bond of friendship not only Sam and Sam's family.Hardly a suprise: they know that Bucky is as popular as ever, and they'e worried he'll overshadow the ""first black Captain America""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
