Jason Statham takes on a giant shark from below what scientists thought was the bottom of the Marianas Trench. You know how it's going to end because Jason Statham doesn't ever lose. Even when faced with one or more enormous sharksGreat special effects cover for some sketchy acting - not that anyone watches these sorts of movies for acting - and some of the expected action movie tropes (like my personal favourite: someone getting killed gloating about their victory after they think the threat is over) in what is a fun film if you like giant creature movies and Jason Statham. One of those movies to not over-think.Definitely not a masterpiece, but definitely enjoyable.","23 out of 25 found this helpful.

All it takes is one click to see the only single review from the poster. Don't get me started on the moronic review from halil-92019: ""Playing computer games makes kids smarter?""This film had it's moments, but it was nothing spectacular. The best parts were the cinematography, visuals and directing. The story itself has been done so many times, making the shark prehistoric doesn't add anything to the imagination. The writers needed to up this a few levels and not rely on Statham (who was great as always) to bring in the moviegoers into the theater. The 103 min length felt a little long, but the pacing good enough to keep you interested, although it was missing that constant extra thrill and suspense I expected. Instead, I cringed at the cheesy 1 liners and poor attempt at humor - most executed at the wrong time.It's an honest deserving score of only 6/10 from me.","331 out of 493 found this helpful.

Mindset-wise if you go in thinking more along the lines of Deep Blue Sea rather than JAWS you'll probably have a good time. If you want serious, deep storylines and Oscar-caliber performances you probably should avoid it because this isn't it. Also on that note, why the hell would you go see this movie in the first place if you want that?This movie is just stupid fun with tons of funny moments. The comedy aspect of it actually caught me off guard. I expected a few funny moments here and there like most films of this ilk, but this is just straight up funny throughout. There are plenty of grandiose action sequences. A character you just flat out hate because he's such an atypical ass-hat and some beautiful CGI. The film itself is very well shot and I even had a hard time telling whether the FXs were practical or CGI in spots. They blended stuff together well. I thought the acting was solid for what this film is. It's about what I expected. Like anything, there were a few things here and there that could have been better. But, none of those things were enough to hinder my enjoyment of it. I personally would have liked to see it be a tad bit gorier. I think that might have pushed this up a notch especially with the type of story this. On the other hand, that's more of a preference than an actual hindrance type thing. This was exactly what I wanted out of a Summer Blockbuster style film. It's a fun theater-going experience. It's the type of movie you want to see on the big screen with a great sound system. What I would consider a perfect popcorn flick.My Rating: 7/10","263 out of 396 found this helpful.

The one liners that is supposed to make the audience laugh failed miserable and most of the time cringe worthy. The CGI is Sci-fi channel worthy at best.

Film today is at an all time low. Depressing, actually. I literally spent 40 dollars for a trip with my lady to see this. Unreal. They wonder why pirating has become such a problem.

It did look from the cover that it would be some kind of guilty pleasure fun, which was my ideal kind of film for the day.Apparently 'The Meg' had a lot of studio interference, meaning that what was initially intended (and from the sounds of it what was initially intended would have made it a much better film) was not seen in the film, and it shows in the final product. Wanted some guilty pleasure film, a kind of turn-the-brain-off-at-the-door sort of film. Instead, 'The Meg' turned out to be poorly written and mostly devoid of tension and fun, one where one is rooting for the shark than any of the human characters. Is it better than any of the shark-creature films from SyFy and The Asylum? Oh yes, so much better, now those are mostly abominations. That doesn't stop 'The Meg' from being potential unfulfilled. There are positives. 'The Meg' does start off reasonably well with a sense of unsettlement and the climactic scene is pretty entertaining. The best character, kid you not, is the shark which had personality and one that was not too scary or goofy. It's pretty decent visually, nicely shot in particular, the music fits well and Jason Statham brings charisma to his role and is believable in that aspect.On the other hand, the rest of the acting is a mess. Worst of all is a dreadful Bingbing Li, with a character that bores and annoys and approaching the character in a way that's completely wrong and out of kilter with everything else. None of the characters are well written, too bland to be interesting and too annoying with dumb decision making to be likeable. A few of them are completely unnecessary. Development is zero.Special effects are uneven, some times they are pretty good and at other times they look so artificial and like they were made in haste. The action scenes with the shark are too few and they are generally devoid of tension, scares and suspense, ruined by unintentional humour, tameness, stupid goofiness and lack of sense, even when taking it for what it is meant to be. The story is as shallow and predictable as can be, with the pace dulling significantly outside of the shark action and indicative of padding out the already overlong by 15-20 minute running time. Faring worst is the script, which is even more atrocious than Bingbing Li's acting, bad enough to warrant a paragraph of its own. Far too much talk, very clumsy attempts at humour (unintentional and the cringe-worthy intentional), a good deal of waffle some of which adds nothing, a lot of ridiculousness and implausibility, excessive sentimentality, muddled and clunky scientific exposition and some of it perplexes in terms of clarity too.In summary, has good things but ruined primarily by the script. 4/10 Bethany Cox","87 out of 131 found this helpful.

Is this a cheesy film? Of course. Is it as good as Jaws? Nobody is trying to accomplish such an absurdity.This is a story about a very courageous and heroic guy played by Statham who is called out on a rescue because he is the only man for the job. He also has to prove it to a bunch of scientists just once for them to realize ""oh yeah, this guy is the best"". And so he has to do some crazy rescue stunts, putting his life in danger over and over.The marine scientists have discovered a megalodon, which is basically a prehistoric shark that is 5 times the size of a great white (give or take). They have explored beyond the boundaries of where humans have ever been and these dinosaur-like sharks inhabit that depth of the trench. Now they have to contend with the shark(s).'The Meg' fits the bill for any creature feature film, but the bonus is Jason Statham. In my opinion, he alone raises the bar for this type of film at least a couple of levels beyond most of the generic movies and this is a refreshing take on the genre. A few of the characters are developed just enough to like. There is also a bit of comic relief and some shady characters too. All the ingredients are present and accounted for. This is an enjoyable ride, no concentration or deep thinking is necessary.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

At one point, it was anticlimactic but then a twist which renewed it's self.If you have seen other Jason Statham Movies, then you know what to expect. This is a bit different than his other roles - there is no fighting military or marital arts style.The movie has some cute moments, sad moments and a lot of suspense, beautiful graphics, dark comedy. There are a few moments of 'why would you do that?' or 'that's not how that works' but it is an enjoyable flick and I will watch it again.This is a break up from other shark attack movies, or movies like this. There are some characters (one in particular) that don't fit. There are even some stereotypical concepts from other movies incorporated that were a bit rushed. (Trying to stay away from spoilers)Character development was rushed and we get our typical back story of the hero's journey which makes up just about all movies and books, stories of overcoming odds.

Why would you preemptively turn away half your potential audience by taking a comical route with the trailers? It's meant to be a THRILLER not Sharknado. Why would you not give us terrifying scenes of being eaten/swallowed/pulled under, it's a SHARK movie, genre equals HORROR.

I read all five books that were out at the time in 5 days total. I was so excited for this movie. When I saw Jason Statham was cast as Jonas Taylor I was immediately bummed out. I like Jason Statham but we all know the type of movies he's in and I was really hoping that they would go more the route of Jaws and not the route of Piranha 3D. Make a really good film with great actors that just happened to have a shark. Then I saw the trailer and was even more disappointed. The tone of the movie was all Goofy. Even with all that I still was very excited and I dropped my expectations and just went into it expecting a type of action Blockbuster sequel quality movie. I have not been this disappointed in a long time. I'm not one of those people that's going to give a movie a one or a two when clearly a movie of this caliber is not that bad and that should be reserved for straight to Syfy 1 million dollar budget crapfests. Dont.listen to people who give it a one. Thats just false. However holy crap was this a huge let down. The CGI was actually pretty good in some parts and then other parts it wasn't at all. The film started off pretty good and there were quite a few changes in the characters in the story from the book which is expected. But once the shark got to the service it just went downhill. Statham actually wasn't that bad although I maintain my position that he was not the right guy for Jonas Taylor. Li Bingbing was absolutely atrocious. I haven't seen her in any other movies so it could have just been The eay it was written but her dialogue was horrible and it just seemed like she was acting which a movie shouldn't be like that. I love Rainn Wilson but again I didn't enjoy him in this movie. I thought the little girl was completely useless and I don't know why that character was even added. The actress was fine but the character itself was just ridiculous. Page had a couple parts where he was really good but his scenes were just silly. I really wanted to like this movie but the comedy just too much. I'm a firm believer and I've said this before and I'll say it every time that death should not be funny in movies like this. It's okay to have comedy in these movies if you have to but if someone is in a scenario where they're going to die or potentially going to die don't make it funny. My biggest issue with the movie is the fact that they were constantly in life or death situations and never seemed scared. There's a 70 foot shark that just flipped your boat over and you're on the turned over Hull and you're making jokes and you don't seem like you're in trouble at all. Without giving away spoilers there's somewhat of a Chase and they just act like it's no big deal. Even if you were going to go the route of over-the-top ridiculous action movie there's absolutely zero reason why the characters shouldn't be absolutely terrified. I wasn't a big fan of the end and although there were some funny parts and there where some really cool scenes I just in no way thought this movie was good. It doesn't take a lot to please me normally. I love dumbed down movies from time to time but this was just stupid and in no way believable and I just can't express how disappointed I am. I would really really really really was looking forward to this and even set my expectations lower than I wanted them to be and still came out shaking my head. I honestly think I shook my head through the entire movie and threw my hands in the air as if to say what the hell. I'm not going to tell people not to see it because I love the books and I love the author and I want to see the movie do well anyway. Maybe a sequel will be better but doubtful

I know it's a shark film and should know what to expect, but this was so predictable I had to tell my wife to keep quiet, as she was telling me what was going to happen next,every 5 minutes and every time she was correct !
There are some scenes that are almost a Jaws clone but there is none of the suspense or shock, so brilliantly delivered in the original Spielberg offering.
The worst part of the film for me, was the poor humour and one liners, relentlessly thrown about. One minute somebody's best friend, or father is killed, next minute everyone's having a giggle about some crap shark joke, seconds before the ship they are on, is about to be attacked. Too much corny humour and not enough suspense.

Sadly, no one does. So, in a story that's so clearly reminiscent of Jaws, an opportunity for a moment of self-aware fun is wasted. It's emblematic of the entire movie - all the pieces are in place for something entertaining to occur, but the payoff never comes. The Meg has all the ingredients needed for a summer blockbuster and then some. It features a megalodon, a 90-foot-long prehistoric mega-shark that also happens to be one of the most perfectly named animals ever, Jason Statham, one of the marquee action movie stars of our time, and Rainn Wilson, who gave us one of the funniest television characters of the past 20 years: Dwight Schrute on The Office.Take my money now. As Renee Zellweger says in Jerry Maguire, ""you had me at mega-shark."" Boasting this embarrassment of riches, the movie practically screams FUN. With all these assets at their disposal, it's easy to envision filmmakers bringing to life this concept's illustrious potential on the big screen. There could be actors hamming it up in a stupendously silly summer epic flooded with ridiculous one-liners and ""are they really doing this?"" moments. It could be glorious.There's just one problem: that's not what this movie is. Rather than lean into the absurdity and have a little fun, The Meg tries to sell a story about a tortured man of the sea who is now seeking revenge on the animal that attacked him (no, Herman Melville did not receive a screenwriting credit). The story is not affecting enough to elicit any noteworthy emotional responses, it's not smart enough to be scientifically sound and it's not over-the-top enough to reach a level of pure popcorn entertainment. Everything comes up short. Instead of a towering tidal wave, it brings only a gentle rolling tide.
 
Jason Statham plays the revenge-seeking seaman named Captain Ahab, erm, I mean, Jonas Taylor. After he was called crazy for believing that a giant unseen animal attacked his underwater vessel, he's summoned back into action by billionaire doofus, Morris (Wilson), who funds a deep-sea research facility. Morris needs Jonas to save his team of researchers, who are currently stranded at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, where they hoped to discover hidden marine life.The megalodon, or as his friends call him, the meg, eventually emerges from the depths and wreaks havoc on the facility and all sorts of fancy exploration vehicles because, apparently, megalodons love the taste of metal. The meg later swaggers his way over to Sanya Bay in China, where he can capture local swimmers and the film's producers can capture the foreign movie-viewing market. It takes 90 minutes of unnecessary scientific exposition to reach an enjoyable stretch. The plot revolves around a 90-foot prehistoric shark reappearing in 2018 - there's no reason to attempt to make any of this seem plausible. In addition to the superfluous fake science scenes, there's an insufferable amount of undeserved emotionality. Again, this story should focus on the giant shark, not half-hearted romances and pseudo-dramatic deaths. The eye-roll-worthy sentimentality clashes with the adjacent raucous action and silly jokes (yes, there are some of those, just not nearly enough). Weepy drama has no place here. This should be a zero-tears movie.It's hard to tell exactly what the filmmakers were going for; the goal should have been so obvious, but there's clearly uncertainty, which explains why the tone is so uneven. The result is a mixed bag with too much emphasis on the wrong elements. It's not quite a mega-disappointment, but it's definitely a missed opportunity.","70 out of 123 found this helpful.

And in some parts it was/is. Hell, I was and I am even okay with the cast. But I am totally sure the studio prevented it from all it could have been with its theatrical cut, that just plays it safe and makes the ""Movie Meg"" just a movie that you won't remember after a few days.And that is a shame and a waisted opportunity!I still give it 8 stars because I liked the cast, the music, the effects (they are not half as bad as some here are stating) and yes: I was entertained enough to like it. But I was all set to LOVE it, and that did not happen.Rough cuts and jumps and way to less of a thrill but more of a loud action vehicle.

It's definitely not the most amazing shark movie- but to be honest what shark movie is that good.Me personally I love shark movies. A lot of the time they are low production, bad storyline and terrible CGI. The meg however was better than a lot of movies. The actors weren't too bad, the meg wasn't very realistic (the CGI) but I guess it wasn't too bad. Out of all the shark movies I've watched this is probably in my top 4 best CGI shark movies. I liked the storyline, there definitely could've been improvements but I mean I'm no genius aha. There was definitely a range of emotions that I had throughout the movie- from nervous, sad and some funny parts.I would recommend watching it, even though it's not the best watching it once is worth it I'd say.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The stunning cinematography and impressive special effects bring the terrifying creature to life, making it a formidable foe for Jonas and his team.

The best thing about the movie was the lighthearted insistence on the female Asian slant in the casting and the background. Its about time, the female Asian lead guarantees that you will have to stay with this thing until its done, possibly again and again. Long after you get tired of everything else about the movie, and you will, you won't get tired of the beautiful Asian women scattered throughout, even singing an Asian version of ""Hey, Mickey"" at the end, which might be the next most compelling thing about the whole picture.""Jaws"" cannot be equaled. The picture understands this, and does not waste time trying. Worth the time just to watch how impossible it is for another killer shark movie to even approach the Spielberg miracle from 1975. Enjoy the Asian wedding girl's dog named ""Pippin"" in the water. Will Pippin become a snack? Did ""Pippin"" in Spielberg's movie? (I thought the Spielberg dog was named ""Pippet."")

An Oscar nominee?? It's a creature feature that's supposed to attract all audiences. Nothing we haven't seen already in other creature movies like anaconda, the piranha saga, other sharks... The idea was interesting, special effects are good and actors are not that bad like people are hating here. Everything is very under exploited, though. It could have been much, much better. Probably the studio wanted some PG movie and cut out all the good parts. But it's watchable on TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon like I'm doing right now. If you want a seriously bad movie you should try the other megalodon movie that came out at about the same time as this one.
One point to highlight is: why does everyone hate Chinese things? The main researcher is Chinese and he speaks in Chinese to his daughter who's also working in the platform, and everyone seems to hate that?? I found it refreshing to have a different female lead, and I'm not Chinese (not from the US either). She is not white, not an English native, chemistry with Statham is quite good, she's actually closer to his age than most dumb twenty something chicks that do nothing in his other movies, she is a single mom oceanographer for God's sake, and everyone hates her??

But for one thing, the casting of the film is way off, not one character comes off as convincing here. Jason Statham is as wooden and one dimensional as he always is, which is fine in an over the top silly action flick like Crank, but in a film adaptation of a book that's fairly scientific and straight laced, he just ruins it. There's no suspense, very few thrills and a MASSIVE over reliance on awful one liners that just get chucked at the screen at the most improper times. Seriously, there's a one liner thrown in seconds after every death, it so inappropriate and mis guided. Even in an out and out comedy, the jokes used in this film would fail to get a laugh, they're awful.The special effects are great and there are a couple of set pieces that are quite cool but take those out and all you're left with is another terrible Asylum movie. I'm only surprised there wasn't a giant 12 headed crocodile or a robotic Meg turning up for the finale.If you enjoy dross like Mega shark vs Crocasaurus or 5 headed shark attack, you'll probably enjoy this but for those of us looking for something a little more serious and competently made like Jaws or The Reef, avoid it like a disease.","126 out of 237 found this helpful.

Venturing down to find out they discover a prehistoric Megalodon that isn't all too friendly. Cue lots of cgi, shark movie cliches and terrible acting from Statham, but don't worry ladies he gets his top off.The Meg creators clearly watched the Scyfy channels entire back catalogue of shark movies because it actually manages to suffer with many of their crazy logistics.

"","","Some Flaws But Overall a Good Popcorn Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4283869/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","13 August 2018","The Meg (2018) *** (out of 4)Normally I start off my reviews with a description of the plot but is that really needed for a movie like THE MEG? Okay, a brief one. Jason Statham battles a prehistoric shark that is destroying everything in its path.THE MEG was released to a bit of controversy as a lot of people were upset that the studio decided to go for a PG-13 rating instead of a violent and gory R rating. With nearly $150-million on the line I can see why Warner would be nervous about releasing a R rated movie but at the same time I don't think movies can be judged on what they are rated. THE MEG isn't gory or ultra-violent so if that's what you're wanting then it's best to go somewhere else. If you just want a fun popcorn flick then the movie delivers.There's actually a bit more plot here than I'm giving the film credit for but there's no question the main goal was to see Stratham in a variety of scenes where he must go up against the shark. For the most part I thought the film worked well, although there were certainly some flaws with the picture including it not seeming to know what it wanted to be. The early scenes are rather dark and it seems as if the director wanted to build up tension. Then the film starts to add more laughs and one-liners and there's no doubt that the tone changes. I think one or the other would have been a lot better.With that being said, I think THE MEG delivers what you would expect it to and that's a lot of fun action scenes with the giant shark doing massive damage to things while the humans must find a way to stop it. There were several good scenes in the picture including an early rescue mission where three people are trapped on the ocean floor. I also thought the ending was quite good and there's no doubt that the action scenes were well-staged and fun.Stratham delivers what you would expect out of him. Hey, he's not Marlon Brando but he's not hired to do that kind of acting. I thought he was fun in the role and there's no question that he made it somewhat plausible that his character would be willing to battle this shark. Bingbing Li was good as well as Rainn Wilson, Page Kennedy and Cliff Curtis. The score was also nicely done and there's no doubt that the cinematography was top-notch.Having said that, I do wish there had been a bit more shark action. The shark looked extremely good and this is coming from someone who really isn't a fan of CGI. The effects were extremely good but I just wish we had gotten to see more of them.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

I love the action I thought it was thrilling and very cool. I thought the acting was ok I mean I did have a few laughs but that's about it. I love Jason Statham in movies like Fast and Furious saga, so It was cool to see him in this movie, he did a great job. The Jump scares really made me think that it was really happening it was just really well done that's all. And people do still believe that Meglodons still exist well I mean some people have seen strange sightings in 1940 and the latest in 2013 that's a far cry from when they were thought to be extinct 1.5 Billion years ago.

The Meg, on the other hand, is a formulaic, big-budget B-movie that fails to get the pulse pounding, despite it's prehistoric shark being three times as big as Bruce, Spielberg's iconic great white.Jason Statham stars as deep-sea rescue expert Jonas Taylor, who is brought to a high-tech facility to help save three scientists who have become trapped in a sub at the bottom of the sea after being attacked by something unseen. Jonas's mission results in the successful extraction of two of the boffins (one of whom is his ex-wife), but in doing so, he releases a very hungry Megalodon from the depths.Directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, National Treasure), The Meg is slick but completely vapid popcorn entertainment that proves that bigger isn't necessarily better. The plot offers few surprises and little in the way of imagination, and Statham is his usual stoic self, indistinguishable from any of his other movie roles. Bingbing Li adds a bit of glamour as pretty scentist Suyin (this is an American/Chinese co-production, so the film features plenty of Asian actors) and Rainn Wilson is fun as billionaire Morris (destined to become shark fodder), but most of the cast are forgettable. As far as the other stars are concerned - the Megs (for there are more than one) - they are fairly impressive CGI creations, but this being a 12A certificate, their attacks don't result in anything too graphic.As a big fan of shark movies, I had such high hopes when The Meg was first announced; what a shame that the finished film is so unremarkable and lacking in bite.","20 out of 32 found this helpful.

Though the tragic incident earned him a dismissal from service, what ultimately cost him his career, his marriage and any semblance of honor was his unsupported and incredulous claims of what caused it - an attack on his vessel by a mammoth, 70-foot sea creature, believed to be extinct for more than a million years .

Starring Jason Statham and directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, National Treasure), it is a satisfactory B-movie that never bores its audience.Five years after surviving an attack from what he claimed to be a giant prehistoric shark, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is recruited by a group of scientists to help rescue some of their trapped members from a sunken submarine. Upon discovering them at the bottom of the ocean, Jonas realises his claims were correct, as a 75 foot Megalodon shark, previously thought to be extinct, was responsible for the unfortunate fate of the scientists in their submersible.Fast paced and self aware, The Meg is fun popcorn entertainment that rarely wanes in its enjoyment factor. The plot is of course incredibly farfetched and silly but it does manage to elevate itself above the usual killer shark shlock like the Sharknado films and Deep Blue Sea. Thankfully, the film's main characters are given some decent development so that they are not simply chum for the shark to eat. Jason Statham once again plays himself - the tough British action hero, and naturally that's where most of the film's fun comes from. One noticeable gripe I had with this film was that it seems to have been tailored to meet the demands of Chinese audiences, likely to bring in a bigger box office draw. There were times where the film was emphasising Chinese settings that had little to no bearing on the plot. This became distracting at times and could have been edited out without changing too much of the film's narrative flow. Overall, The Meg is still a reasonable time passer if killer shark movies are one's guilty pleasure.I rate it 6/10","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Well, lets start off by saying the Meg is way better a movie than any shark related title from Asylum, the folks that brought us Sharknado. I know that isn't saying much, but I thought it should be said. The acting is alright - not amazing and not terrible, but alright. If you like Jason Statham, then you'll like him in this, and if you don't then the Meg probably won't change your mind. The effects look pretty good - I've seen better, and I've seen worse.

The film's lack of character development, along with less than stellar performances by the majority of the cast, ultimately hindered my ability to feel any remorse or sympathy for certain characters, nor did I develop any emotional connection with characters. Not all is grim; luckily, the film's lead, Jason Statham, delivered a very pleasant performance. Statham carried the film from the opening scene, all the way through until the end credits. Statham was a charismatic badass and stole every scene in which he was physically present, and without him, the film would have failed. And besides Shuya Sophia Cai's adorable Meiying, this is where the praise for performances end. Li Bingbing's addition was an obvious attempt to appeal to the foreign audience, and the rest of the supporting cast gave forgettable performances. It was plainly obvious certain characters were written for the sole purpose of having an action scene transpire by making costly decisions or for plot convenience. From a technical standpoint, The Meg (2018) was a fest for the eyes; the CGI and special effects were very crisp and believable, except for a shot near the end of the film involving the meg itself and Statum. The sound design was great, as it really brought the extinct titanic meg to life. The final positive of the film was it's consistent pacing; there were small amounts of the extended expedition, which ultimatly hurt the film's character development, and plenty of intense shark action. In conclusion, The Meg is nothing more of a shallow plot strung together with cool shark action scenes and unnecessary, poorly written characters. I would not recommend this film, especially after considering the fact that other, more enjoyable summer films, such as Mission Impossible: Fallout or even the lighthearted Teen Titans Go to the Movies, are other options for a trip to the movies.","82 out of 156 found this helpful.

After reading the first three ""Meg"" novels and part of the fourth, this movie which is based on the Steve Alten's books could have been all of that and more. I won't waste time worrying about what isn't in The Meg because it's better than I expected.The movie is very ""toned-down"" as many would-be critics will tell you, and I don't recall any profanity in it. That will disappoint a lot of moviegoers, but I found it refreshing. If I want to watch a GREAT shark flick, I'll pull up Jaws from my digital movie locker - or The Shallows, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Joe Dante's Piranha, The Blob (either one), Deep Blue Sea, Deep Rising, Humanoids from the Deep or one of my other 300 or so creature feature favorites when I'm in the mood for them. The Meg makes the cut and is satisfying in its own way. So what if it could have been rated PG in our world of Mortal Kombat and God of War. I still would've wanted to see it and would have liked it just as much - for the whole new world discovered in the ocean's depths and the beasties that dwell within it (much more impressive than those in the most recent Jurassic Park film, imo). And also for Jason Statham, Rainn Wilson, Cliff Curtis, Robert Taylor (Longmire!) and all of the Asian characters / actors (I liked all of them); and for the light moments and enough peril and suspense to thrill ten-year-olds who'll be seeing it (around the same age I was when I went to see Jaws).The one thing I really wished Warner Bros. and Gravity Pictures had included in their film is the way the first megalodon in Alten's ""Meg"" is transported from her world to ours. (I thought it was done much, much better in the book and would've earned an even higher score from this viewer.) Even so, I'll probably watch The Meg again as soon as I finish ""Hell's Aquarium"" (the fourth Meg novel). With luck it will still be in theaters.","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

This is definitely 'bad bad'.The Megalodon was a huge shark thought to be extinct. A research expedition into deeper levels of the ocean finds that ol' Meg is still alive. Megsy then decides to move away from these deeper ocean depths and invade the shallower depths of the sea which the expedition came from in search of human chow.This film contains the worst CGI since Escape From LA which just reinforces to me that this was made to make money and for no other reason. John Carpenter's film at least had the excuse of being made when CGI as we know it was in it's infancy.The CGI in The Meg was so bad that a scene that should have contained a huge jump scare looked so fake and artificial just before said scare that you just knew something was going to happen. And it did. And zero forks were given.This film also contains some of the worst most stereotypical and generic characters that I've ever seen- the cutesy little girl (far too irritating for her own good and deserves to become shark fodder), the edgy female scientist (tattoos, Lara Croft hair, probably a muff diver), the comedic black character (he makes Jovial Jemima look restrained. Time to send back your NAACP membership card, Page Kennedy).Rainn Wilson has a face for radio, not for film. ''Why has he been cast in such a role?'' I thought whilst watching this cinematic abortion. Then it hit me. His brash billionaire character who is in part responsible for bringing The Meg into our waters seems to be based on Elon Musk- someone else with a face for radio and a personality just as rancid.Jason Statham is a great action hero. That is until he opens his mouth and undoes all of his good work. I have a theory- the more dialogue Statham has to deliver in a film, the worse the film is.We get the obligatory scene of Jason just out of the shower and only wearing a towel. So what. A Google search for such fare is cheaper and more painfree than watching this movie.There are also some of the most awkward 'comedy' moments that I've ever seen. Lines that aren't funny and have never been funny being delivered completely ineptly.The film also changes gear and intent about two thirds of the way through. From being a suspense filled horror film (which it utterly fails at) the film then thinks it can master the 'Sharknado' sub-genre of 'oh so camp, tongue in cheek' horror movies (it can't even master this- some feat).The Meg feels like a really anaemic, formulaic and boring straight to video movie from the early 90's that has had millions thrown at it and given a theatrical release. It's out of time and out of place. A bit like the megalodon really.","31 out of 55 found this helpful.

While there he happens to witness first-hand a miniature submarine carrying a crew of three scientists as they explore the bottom of the ocean. All of a sudden, they are attacked by a huge creature which damages the sub and renders it incapable of returning to the surface. Realizing the immense difficulties that a rescue effort of this kind would entail one of the managers suggests the immediate hiring of a rescue diver by the name of ""Jonas Taylor"" (Jason Statham) who is residing in Thailand and was involved in a similar incident five years ago. Although he initially declines, he changes his mind when he is informed that his ex-wife ""Lori Taylor"" (Jessica McNamee) is one of the people in the mini-sub. What he doesn't know is that the giant shark swimming in the area just happens to be a megalodon which many people believe to have been extinct for over 2 million years-and it is very hungry. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that there have been a number of films featuring this extinct creature and that includes one that was released the exact same year titled ""Megalodon."" Having viewed both of them recently I can safely say that ""The Meg"" is definitely the better of the two. For starters, it wasn't apparently rushed into production and as a result didn't contain a multitude of basic errors prevalent in the other. Likewise, the budget wasn't nearly as limited which allowed for better CGI and a superior cast. That said, however, I must admit that it became a bit preposterous toward the end but even so it was still enjoyable for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The plot of the movie was very interesting and the storyline was well-written, even though it was simple and easy to understand. Sadly, the characters weren't very interesting nor well-developed. The filming locations of the movie were mainly inside or above the ocean and in submarines. The casting was just nice and their acting was descent. The opening scene of the movie was kinda unpredictable and very intense, but it wasn't really promising. The ending scene was definitely expected and the 3rd act was super (probably, the best part of that movie). The killcount of the movie was very simple, because most death scenes were done off-screen and nothing explicit was shown. However, it was an action-filled movie and there were some epic scenes. Moreover, the cinematography and the CGI effects of the movie were well edited and very realistic.

Was there anything about this movie that was redeemable? No, save your money.","28 out of 50 found this helpful.

While I appreciate using more Asian actors in films, the delivery of lines was awful. It seemed to me they were delivering several of the lines phonetically- emotionless acting. 
The plot was boring and predictable- even for a shark movie, and the nods to Jaws were a complete embarrassment. Do not attempt to pay homage to a complete classic with this piece of garbage.

Its been a while since there has been a decent shark movie out. With all of the stuff being churned out in mass production these days (the sharknado and sharktapus type stuff which I have unfortunately had to sit through as well lol) I was ready for something a little more ""full"" (acting/story line wise) so to speak. I was finally able to get that with The Meg, I didn't feel as though I wasted my money going to see it. I don't like when people post spoilers so I won't do that but if you are one of the types that loved the original Jaws movies and are not obsessed with only ""gore-fest"" type stuff then definitely give this one a chance! True that it is not over the top bloody, why is that such an important factor these days?? I am honestly surprised at all the negative reviews from people. I'm not sure what they were expecting and I know that there was a bit that had to be cut from the movie but it was definitely still a fun watch. One that I was able to take my kids to see. My daughter especially is obsessed with shark movies so we have seen them all... Every single one (and we have seen more than a few extremely bad ones i.e. sand sharks and ice sharks and more than I care to name) that have come out since and including the Jaws movies. This was a fun way to end summer vacation for all of us... Maybe my expectations were just lower due to all of the shark movies I have had to watch for my daughters sake over the past few years but I believe that also gives me a good perspective and an open mind. I think those that were disappointed had probably waited for and looked forward to this movie so much that they built up to many expectations mentally. It helps when you don't do that and just try and go into it open minded and don't overthink things. Just enjoy the ride!","49 out of 99 found this helpful.

But - do you know - as a brainless piece of popcorn entertainment, I quite enjoyed it!Jason Statham plays our hero Jonas Taylor. (Jonas? Surely some sly joke?). Jonas is drinking his life away in Thailand after being traumatised by an underwater rescue mission in which he was 90% successful. (Yeah, I know.... perfectionists.... hate 'em!). But he is needed again, since his cute ex-wife Lori (Jessica McNamee) is stuck at the bottom of the sea being terrorised by a terrifying creature: no, not Spongebob Square Pants... the titular prehistoric shark.Lori is working at an undersea research station - Mana One - off the coast of China, funded by the annoyingly brash billionaire Morris (Rainn Wilson, from ""The Office""), who you just HOPE HOPE HOPE will get munched at some point! Running the station (in the most shameless Hollywood/Chinese market crossover since ""The Great Wall"") is Zhang (Winston Chao) assisted by his cute daughter Suyin (played by the gloriously named and very talented Bingbing Li) and his even cuter granddaughter Meiying (Sophia Cai). The race is on to use their brains and Taylor's brawn to stop the monster from reaching the seaside resort of Sanya Bay for lunch. The action is, of course, absurd with so many near misses for Jonas from gnashing teeth that he could be The Meg's registered dentist. There is a really nice dynamic though built up between Jonas, his potential cross-cultural love interest Suyin and young Meiying. Suyin is a classic TimesUp heroine for 2018, with an assertive attitude and not remotely giving an inch to Statham's hero.But it's young Sophia as Meying who really steals lines and steals hearts with a truly charming performance, and would get my 'man of the match' were it not for... research assistant Jaxx (Australian model, Ruby Rose). She has an absolutely extraordinary look in this film. Chiselled and tattooed, she literally looks like she has stepped out of a Final Fantasy video game... and acts well too: the complete package.As referenced above, the Hollywood/Chinese crossover is quite striking in this film, with the Chinese beach location looking like Amity Island on steroids! (Cue the overweight Chinese kid as the Jaws ""Alex"" replacement... who knew that they also have 'Zoom' ice lollies in China!) Unusually for a mainstream Western film, a significant number of lines in the film are in Chinese with English subtitles.In the league table of shark movies, it is far nearer to ""Deep Blue Sea"" than it is to ""Jaws"", the reigning league champion, and all are far in excess of the ridiculous ""Sharknado"". But compared to ""Deep Blue Sea"", and even compared to ""Jaws"" - now, astonishingly, 43 years old! - it's a curiously bloodless concoction, presumably to guarantee it's 12A certificate. I have seen far bloodier and more violent 12A's, and if anything I think director Jon Turteltaub (""National Treasure"") rather overdid the sanitisation. It's not going to win many gongs at the Oscars, but it is a slice of movie fun nonetheless.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is only so much you can write and do with a shark movie, right? Jaws was iconic, Deep Blue Sea was interesting and this China/US collaboration was fine, but won't win any awards.To keep all types happy, we had Jason Statham doing what he does best: swimming. He was a member of the British Olympic Diving Team. Then we have a smattering of Asian actors, featuring Li BingBing (Zhongkui) and possibly the cutest and most 'precocious' eight year old girl (Li's movie daughter), played by 11 year old Shuya Sophia Cai, that I may have ever seen. Ruby Rose does a fine stint (last Xander Cage, XXX movie) and even the Asian Doctor from the TV Series Hawaii 5.O. Plus the kitchen sink.So all in all, a pretty good Friday Night Popcorn Movie. Give it a look. Not bad.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was remarkably not a lot of violence, the language was pretty clean and nothing sexual. We have three boys. We would let them watch it and we are pretty protective of what they watch. It would be a fun family night. I do not understand why everything thinks that all movies have to be some deep social commentary. Why cannot they just be fun? A break from reality? This movie fit that mold. We left in a better mood and enjoyed a fun date together. Something that we rarely do when we see movies these days. In my book; that makes this movie a 10.

Come on guys.It was funny (at times), great special effects, quite gory in fact. The main character Jonas (Jason Statham), I do have to say I was not that impressed with though, and was wondering if they could have done better, having said that I think the writers should have given him a stronger back story as it just was a bit weak. So I blame the writers as I know I have seen Jason in other movies that he was given a better character. It is a shame that 'Deep Blue Sea 2' (sequel to 'Deep Blue Sea', came out as well to compete.Which one did I prefer?

Having read the books in 10th grade Marine Biology 20 years ago, my expectations were guarded as I knew it would stray from the science to focus on the laughs and action, and I had been anticipating a movie more in line with Piranha then Jaws, but I am pleased to report my daughter and I left with smiles on our faces and anxious to see it again, hopefully in 3D next. It's fast pace storyline makes the two hour run time fly bye, and the movie is one of the few to find the perfect balance between comedy and scares. The latter half of the movie even throws a few Jaws references in for good measure appeasing the nostalgic fans. It doesn't waste too much time into delving into silly sub-plots trying to be more than it is with political undertones like the recent Jurrasic series have but keeps a dynamic enough cast to appeal to just about anyone. 
 The movie doesnt try to hide what it is, but rather embraces the absurdity of the premise and goes full throttle to becoming the summers most satisfying, if not most surprising, big scale movies in recent memory. Lots of toungue in cheek humor for the fan boys and great special effects, only thing Id wish they did was not hold back on the gore as much, though considering the nature of the target audience this can be forgiven. Hopefully sequels don't follow the overboard campiness of other surprise hits like Piranha 3D or settle for low budget fodder like Sharknado, the story line leaves a lot of room for exploration of the mythos and source material. Meg leaves the audience wanting to chomp back for more, hopefully its not a long wait for the sequel!","105 out of 241 found this helpful.

Maybe they're made to scare people off, or maybe it's based on the fact that these movies make a lot of money. The Meg is by far the most high-profile, effects driven shark movie since Jaws. No, the terribly awful Sharknado films do not count, and they are made for TV. Going back to this film, the previews marketed the film as a fun time and exhilarating ride. However, even though I can say that the movie was not terrible, it definitely wasn't much fun, and that is the major disappointment.As always, let us begin with the aspects of the film that were good. First off, we have Jason Statham as the lead role, which is an opportunity that he makes the most of. His character, Jonas Taylor, is a former rescue diver haunted by an incident in the past that resulted in the lives of two scientists. Living a quiet life in Thailand, he is recruited by Mana One, an ocean research facility, to rescue trapped members in a submarine that have been attacked by an unknown creature. His character develops as the movie progresses, going from a loner who wants to live a quiet life to a leader who places the lives of his crew mates above his own. Along with Statham, I also felt that Dwight K. Schrute (I mean Rainn Wilson) was entertaining as Dwight K. Schrute being a billionaire and fighting a prehistoric shark. Of course, the most important aspect of an action movie is the action, in which the film di not fail to deliver entirely. The effects were realistic CGI, which is an achievement considering that computerizing a 75 foot-long shark to fight props and submarines is a hard feat. We can thank the Chinese production companies that spent the money to make this film when a Hollywood-based probably wouldn't do so. However, even though the action sequences are intense, there are much fewer scenes than I would've preferred to see.This leads to the main weakness for this film: the lack of action sequences and fun. I care about quality more than anything, but when a film is marketed as a fun, action-packed adventure, that is the expectation that you go into the theater with. Unfortunately with The Meg, there is a lot more talking present. It ruins the pace of the film because the action will be interrupted multiple times by dialogue that, while relevant, is misplaced with the pacing. Also, the lead actress, Li Bingbing, did quite poorly when speaking English lines that it was distracting. When she spoke Mandarin, the scenes were well acted. It may be strange, but the same thing happens in Bollywood films. Since english is not the first and primary language for these actors, it is hard to speak and act it out properly in a movie.I went into the theater expecting to have a good time, but a good time is not exactly what happened. It wasn't a bad film because there was a clear objective for the characters as part of the plot and it wasn't cheesy. However, it wasn't fun or action-packed, which was seemingly the goal that the movie had in order to attract audiences. It certainly has, with over $460 million made across the globe at the moment. However, it definitely isn't worth viewing in theaters. I say, it may be worth your $2 renting it on Redbox, but only if you want to see Jason Statham and Dwight take on sharks.Rating wise, I would bestow this film 6 stars out of 10. No shark puns here.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Riddled with cliches, rip offs, and homages it delivers something unique in that it understands completely that it's not a serious film. Jon Turteltaub realizes that he directs a mediocre film at best and takes it and makes it something extraordinary. With plot holes, inconsistencies and poor editing the Meg brings something different to the table, it knows that it's just another bad monster movie but it takes that idea and turns it on its head. By understanding what viewers are expecting from something so dismal this film makes every moment special. Using meta humor and one-liners the cast of The Meg really brings this adventure to life. Now this is not a believable tale at all, there's no sense of plot or direction. However it is the perfect popcorn flick and is thoroughly enjoyable to experience in today's world of superheroes and dark, gritty adaptations.

Not bad, but not exactly great either.The positive aspects of this film were the graphics. Yes, computer generated graphical art is definitely capable of creating fancier looking monsters, but the way that the Meg was drawn suited this film. It was a dull grey with relatively yellow teeth. While whiter teeth could have been used to draw more attention to the deadliness of the Meg's jaws, the discolored, yellow teeth of the Meg made the monster look more feral.The downsides of this film were the overtly predictable plotlines and the poor acting. Yes, everyone knows that the plot would be centered around defeating the big bad shark, but the jump scares were just too predictable. It was clear from the beginning who would definitely survive and who would end up with who. The lackluster acting also does not help make the scenes any more believable. The scenes that were meant to be shocking and the scenes that were meant to be sorrowful ended up serving as fillers in between the various arcs of the plot.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you are a Jason Statham fan or enjoy science fiction action movies than The Meg is for you. Ridiculous how it sounds about this movie. The Meg is a lot of fun; it does take itself too seriously, and has some intense action sequences. Seeing Jason Statham battle against a megalodon shark is pure entertainment. This film could have been a whole lot worse with cheesy dialogue, bad acting, and terrible action/visual effects. Which this big budget film must have spent a lot on the visual effects and the suspenseful action. The plot follows Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) a rescue diver, when his attempt to save survivors on a failing submarine goes awry when something else attacks the sub. Years later, no one believes Jonas on what went on down there. Dr. Minway (Winston Chao) leads a research facility were they sent a small sub to go beneath the oceans cloud surface were an unknown ecosystem inhabits. And they come across a bigger threat that stops them. They will need the help from Jonas until they discover Megalodon. Which it comes to the surface.Cheesy as the plot sounds. When a group of researchers discover a new level beneath the oceans surface that is so deep. That undiscovered species inhabit. The film does build a little suspense when a group of researchers in a sub get stuck down below. Facing against a giant octopus and a big shark that can eat ships. The film does deliver on the action sequences. You can expect to see Jason Statham doing a lot of heroic diving into the ocean to save another from a giant shark. And seconds away from death when they are being grappled in with a shark inches away from them. Or a climatic battle with Statham and Li Bingbing driving those underwater subs trying to kill the shark in a cat and mouse battle. The film can be a little suspenseful. Especially, when you do not expect anything to jump out of the water at you. You can have the camera zooming in a character in the water. Or a character sticking their head in a dead shark's mouth and something happening that puts you on the edge of your seat. Also, there is a twist that is surprising and predictable but still builds the suspenseful moment. Jason Statham is an awesome actor. And an action star that always saves the day. Yes, he does so with this movie. A lot of him getting in his swimsuit and diving into the ocean to save someone. Li Bingbing was good too playing Dr. Minway's daughter. Were she is trying to stop the shark as well. Rainn Wilson was fun too playing the billionaire that funded the research facility. He delivers some fun lines. Ruby Rose was great playing an engineer expert. But she barely had anything to do when they were trying to stop the shark. Besides some close life and death situations. Overall, The Meg is a good science fiction horror film. The visual effects are good. There is a lot of action with Statham and his team trying to stop Meg. There are some suspenseful moments that makes you feel like something is about to happen. The film is better than I have expected. It is like Jaws on steroids serious than being like the stupid cheesy Sharknado movies.","18 out of 34 found this helpful.

It has some tension and some exciting moments, however when there's no action this is one dreadful film. Sometimes, it's even dreadful when there is some action. The writing and dialog are simply embarrassing. This isn't even Jason Statham at his best, whatever that may mean. There are moments that are just stupefying me dumb. They spent $1.3 billion to find out if the bottom of the ocean is really the bottom or a cloud? They don't stop to think how light might affect creatures that have never seen it before? They have no concerns about using a Land Rover on untouched terrain not knowing what they might run over? The director tries really hard to top the jaws famous beach scene, but fails at that and many other things as well.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

A giant, prehistoric shark.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9246216/?ref_=tt_urv","PCC0921","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur109135693/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2023","What I liked the most about the Meg (2018), was its goal to stay out of Sharknado (a made-for-TV film from 2013), territory and try to teeter closer to Jaws (1975), territory. For this review, I rewatched it again on a streaming service, but I did see it, during its initial run in the the theaters in 2018. This film has the right amount of comedy, mixed in with the terror-side of the story. Raine Wilson steals the show with the comedy lines. The Meg (2018), is nowhere near the silly-level of Sharknado. I'm not the biggest Jason Statham fan, but I like him in this film. It's also nice seeing Masi Oka back in something. He played Hiro Nakamura on the cult, hit TV show, Heroes (2006-2010). One time Batwoman, Ruby Rose, has a role in the film and very talented, Cliff Curtis, rounds out a pretty good cast. I do like Bingbing Li's performance as Suyin in this too.The plot is pretty basic and easy to follow, which helps you set aside, that aspect of the film and enjoy the crazy visuals on the screen. A volcano, has created a warm sea on the bottom of the ocean. A prehistoric megalodon, which evolved on the bottom of the ocean, for millions of years, in the warm sea, escapes its frigid, undersea barrier, when the volcano explodes and creates a path to the surface. This is where man meets megalodon. Jason Statham's disgraced Jonas Taylor, has to return to the job, that sent him away, when he has to rescue a submarine crew from the giant shark. After that, it's a fight for survival. There is plenty of backstory for the main characters, that keep the human part of the story going and the interactions between the characters in the plot, makes sense, while all this chaos is happening around them. I mean, come on. It's a movie about a giant shark. A giant, prehistoric shark.Considering the underwater technology made up for the film, is an indication, that the story takes place, slightly further into the future. This is another part of the science-fiction angle of the plot. Because of the very nature of the subject matter in this film, even with its 175 million dollar budget, it still gets automatically roped into the world of the B-movie film. For the exception of Jaws (1975), shark movies, these days, immediately get tagged this way. But, like the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s, maybe it will become a badge of honor someday. In the world of cult classics. There are many films appreciated more today, then they were at the time of their initial theatrical release. This film was very profitable, but was split on the critical side. That means people still went to see it, just for the mere spectacle of it all. It could achieve cult status someday.7.3 C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The non-Chinese actors had decent lines and acting especially Jason Statham;s Jonas Taylor, the great white savior (pun intended). HOWEVER, nearly ALL the CHINESAE LEADDS (and even the EXTRAS) had TERRIBLE LINES and HORRIBLE ACTING! It was like ""NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD"" whenever you heard (or even just saw) their acting! I know it was a U. S.-China co-production which means it: a) does not need to be imported under China's revenue-sharing quota system, and rights-holders including Warner and Flagship can earn 45% of gross revenues, rather than the 25% that foreign studios receive under revenue-sharing terms, and b) allows Gravity Pictures, which is owned by CMC, to handle the release, bypassing the two state-owned enterprises that release nearly all the quota films ergo: a) the Chinese setting, b) the token Chinese actors (and even extras) and b) (and mind you, this is coming from a Chinese reviewer) CRINGELY EXCESSIVE (for an English - speaking movie full of American characters) use of (Mandarin) Chinese dialog. I know the lead Chinese actress, Bingbing Li (who played Suyin, the shark expert), is famous in CHINESE movies, and I've no doubt she's a great actress in them, but as an ENGLISH speaking actress with at least this movie's lines, directing and acting? Yeah, no, NOT EVEN CLOSE! It was like watching those stereotypical fictional or real movies where some bimbo gets cast cuz she's sleeping with the director and/or is the producer / studio head's daughter / niece. And omigosh, every SECOND I saw or heard her character's Chinese daughter was CRINGE OVERLOAD! Suyin's father (Zhang) and his actor (Winston Chao) was the only 1/2 decent Chinese character and actor. Oh, wait, never mind, the actor's actually from TAIWAN, R. O. C. (the *real* Republic of China). Vithaya Pansringarm in a small role as a Thai boat captain was descent also. Oh, wait, never mind, he's actually from THAILAND. Ah, so, close! Nice try, China!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

For entertainment purposes you should either go realistic or fictional(Godzilla style). Like the cast mentioned in their interviews there is very little gore in the movie.

I can only assume there were many, many zeroes more than ""007"" involved in influencing his decision to take a role in this picture. A deep-sea submersible is under threat by a massive Megaladon Shark, long thought to be extinct, now lies at the bottom of the deepest trench in the Pacific with its crew trapped inside. With time running out, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is recruited to save the crew. As the movie progresses, we find out that Taylor had encountered the Shark long before and is a practitioner of the long lost art of Shark Punching. I wanted to like Jon Turteltaub's movie but The Meg is bad, but only rarely in the fun way. Maybe it would be better if they went full Camp, as in the Sharknado Franchise?Statham seems itching for some of his usual classic James Bond-style British Ass-kickery for which he is known, most of which is not on display. 
Rainn Wilson plays shifty billionaire who's financed a deep-sea exploration project. This is a Chinese production, taking place off the coast of Shanghai. Chinese star Li Bingbing has been enlisted to support Statham, her charismatic quality shining through a roughed-in character.The most important cast member, though, is of course the titular Massive Meg, a CGI creation who appears early and often.There are a few chuckle-worthy sight gags and the third act climax, involving a bunch of panicked beachgoers, which evokes Jaws in a knowing tribute, provides some legitimate thrills. Shark fans are likely to be interested, but be warned: It's clumsy and slow and lacks genuine scares.","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

The science was plausible unlike so many other shark movies. They didn't make the shark unrealistically large, that was the size of Megalodon. They even backup the claim of the strongest jaws with the photos of the an actual megalodon jaw bone where you can see the massive thickness of it. Give it the benefit of the doubt, or ""suspension of disbelief"" as it's called. There was a lot of good science shown without narrative, like the use of whale sounds to attract the shark.I liked the Morris character but he was not the typical villain. Jonas was the stereotypical hero wrongfully disgraced, but it works. Suyin is beautiful and I enjoyed the chinese aspects of it very much.I sense a lot of anti China xenophobia in the negative reviews. I love science fiction because it's about the unusual, and other cultures are a big part of that. I don't care that is partially driven by marketing to a huge chinese audience. Movies are big business, pretty much all the great movies are crass money grabs that happened to create good movies. If seeing the Chinese influence in the modern world upsets you, don't watch the movie and prepare to not watch a lot of movies.Bingbing li as Suylin is excellent and what do you know, she has a Chinese accent when speaking English and it's wonderful. The interaction with Jonas is fun. My least favorite characters were DJ and The Wall and I blame the writers. They don't ruin it and there are such folks in nearly every movie. Meiying was well done but approaching too cute.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jason Statham plays Jonas Taylor, disgraced professional rescue diver, who is dragged back for one more mission when an exploratory submersible containing his ex-wife is trapped deep in an undersea trench. Unfortunately, the mission has drawn the attention of a long thought extinct Megalodon who follows them to the surface and their state of the art scientific platform. The Stath isn't really suited to this role, not that he does anything particularly wrong (although a couple of scenes of him trying to have fun in Act One are a bit cringe worthy) it just feels like the character would be suited to warmer actor. His longstanding swimming skills were probably pretty useful to production though. The rest of the characters are all a bit generic, Rainn Wilson's Billionaire character in particular is well worn in the ""monster movie"" genre. The character I hated most though was Page Kennedy's comic relief character DJ. . awful cliché dialogue and weak gags.The effects of the film are pretty solid, the story is OK but generally is just finding repeated ways to knock a group of people who should know better than to be on the Ocean at all, into the water. Tonally is where the film lives or dies and in this case really struggles. I understand the decision to rejig the shoot to a more family friendly final product, particularly with the massive budget and lower the risk of failure - and in that regard I'm sure the studio are happy with the outcome. Personally, however, I'd rather have seen a gorier, horror version of the film that was originally planned - or at least one that was more enjoyable that the competent but rather generic one that was delivered.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A good man deeply misunderstood was blamed for making a tough decision, ends up being the only person to be turned to when there is a crisis. The plot started off well eniugh, but obviously a lot of happenings were forced, there is obvious plot armour, very obvious use of Chinese in this film and some subcultures mixed in (the kid and Pippin for example, which seems to frown upon spoiling children and focus on pets over humans).And of course, the main plot line has been used before but to avoid spoilers, let's say the presentation could have been much better. The way this Movie works is setting the foundation ( which is solid), before delving into tons of jump scares and irrelevant small details (the kid and the dog for example), which diverges the attention of the plot.To be honest, having tension is nice but if it is too much, the plot line will break (pun intended). Comedy was very well placed at the beginning but later there was virtually no comedy.Strong start, okay middle, weak finish. And by that I mean very weak, say a 2/10 finish.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

To be certain, it doesn't deserve any awards for originality. Jason Statham plays much the same character he played in Safe (2012), which isn't much different than many of his other roles. Much of the film seems familiar, but different and evocative of Ice Cube in 22 Jump Street extolling Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum to deliver the same thing as before. Although the settings, dramatic beats, tropes and characters seem familiar but different, the execution and delivery is satisfying. The movie takes great pains to be politically correct and socially relevant, to the point of seeming distracting at times. Rather than 28-year-old former Hong Kong Playboy model Qi Shu displaying her well-toned legs at every opportunity in Transporter (2002), Statham's love interest is age-appropriate, feminist-approved 45-year-old Bingbang Li, who displays her intellect, independence and maternal concern for her daughter. The cast is ethnically diverse and the minority players are given significant lines. There are even a couple of messages about ecology. Many recent films have failed because they put diversity, inclusion and political correctitude ahead of compelling drama. The political content and efforts to appease are a distraction which rob the movie of a couple of points on the ten-point scale, but the action scenes are well executed, the special effects (except for some water-soluble tattoos) are credible within the film's cosmos of reality, the performances are good. The film isn't cerebral or cathartic, but it delivers vicarious thrills, touches of humor and a few heart-warming moments.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The marketing for the movie reminded me of Deep Blue Sea and while I do enjoy that movie for its campy glory, I didn't need to see a lesser version in the theatre. But after seeing the first part of the movie, I was surprised that it was put together competently. The first thing that caught my eye was the CGI and that it was consistently good throughout. The movie obviously boasted a big budget and I'm happy to say it was put to good use. The long shots of the open water, the plant life, the underwater research station and the environment were all passable and I didn't see anything that was less than impressive.I'll have some further comments about the nature of the action later but what they decided to include in the movie also did the trick. The sharks are animated appropriately, and they are at least threatening throughout the run time. It helps that you have an experienced action movie star like Jason Statham in the lead to add a little bit of credibility at the forefront, but I think the Meg cleared the bar they set for themselves. The movie definitely makes you nervous but they balance it with a few well-placed moments of levity. I'm going to also add a small disclaimer for safety, if you need complete realism from your action, this is not one of those movies so take heed of that going into the theatre.What I have to say about the cast is a bit of a mixed bag. Jason Statham was the right guy to lead this movie. Jonas Taylor is a very Statham character and Jason is one of the best in the business at this type of movie (action/thriller that borders being campy). Jason's guilty of coasting a bit on his natural charisma, but he's a more than capable lead for The Meg. Bingbing Li is decent as Suyin, her dialogue is a little forced with her accent and her part seesaws into being cliche but she does what she can with what she's given. I also thought they made a good choice deciding to cast Rainn Wilson as Morris, he would be an all too easy to peg character if they had gone with more traditional casting. But he shines through with his ability to be funny and at least brings in some doubt to who Morris is with his performance. They brought in some recognizable actors to fill in the supporting cast including: Cliff Curtis, Ruby Rose, Masi Oka and Page Kennedy. There isn't a bad performance among them, but they also aren't given much screen time. I would describe them as suffering from their characters being underdeveloped. I also like Robert Taylor normally, but his character was so annoying that I couldn't enjoy his acting choices.The trailer for The Meg advertised a movie that could have been the right kind of crazy. While the movie isn't devoid of tension and there are moments where you're afraid for the characters, this movie was too content to play in the shallow end instead of venturing out into deeper into the violent nature of the premise. I understand the studio's decision to keep it in PG-13 territory, its a safer investment and it will reach a larger audience. But that decision also prevents The Meg from living up to its true potential. This is supposed to be a prehistoric shark that is bigger and more violent than anything living in the ocean today and considering the subject matter, it comes off tame compared to other R rated shark movies. I don't need to see something on the level of the Piranha franchise, but this is too safe. I was disappointed that Eli Roth was considered to direct but dropped out, not because I'm a huge fan of his (I'm more down the middle on his output) but a filmmaker of his style would have pushed the envelope to make this movie memorable.I have a few minor complaints about other parts of The Meg. Despite both Jason Statham and Bingbing Li turning in decent performances, they have very little romantic chemistry and their budding relationship feels forced. The movie is obviously focused on playing toward the international market and they aren't exactly subtle about it. Some of the dialogue is corny and there were a few character decisions that were uneven (they couldn't seem to decide how big of a jerk they wanted to make Morris, there are scenes where he's laid-back or compassionate and then others where he's a gigantic tool). Also, while the ending finally had that dose of unbelievable action that I had been hoping for, it was too little too late for me.A common closing thought for some of my reviews is that if you saw something you liked in the marketing, you'll probably like the movie. The Meg might be the exception to the rule. My friend left the theatre disappointed with the movie because he wanted something off-the-wall bonkers from this premise (which didn't happen). I went in with low expectations and walked away pleasantly surprised even if I can't highly recommend the Meg to everyone. If you want to see a shark movie with a decent cast, some capably filmed action and a few scenes that will scare you without going overboard, The Meg might be for you. If you're expecting an exploitation movie or a campy thriller, you're going to be disappointed.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"7","/10","After 20 years of development hell, The Meg faces off against Jason Statham in this playfully fun shark film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9236178/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","3 August 2023","At the Mana One research facility off the coast of China, Dr. Zhang (Winston Chao) along with his daughter Suyin (Li Bingbing) are researching the Mariana Trench with their research being financed by Jack Morris (Rainn Wilson). When an exploratory dive lead by Lori Taylor (Jessica McNamee) discovers a deeper section of the trench, the Lori and the crew end up stranded when something attacks their sub. With time running out Dr. Zhang and Mac (Cliff Curtis) go to Thailand and bring in former rescue diver and Lori's ex-husband Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) who quit following a tragedy on a nuclear submarine where he claimed something attacked it but was met with disbelief. Jonas reluctantly takes up the assignment and it isn't long before Jonas' story is confirmed to be true and an ancient predator known as the Megalodon or Meg is unleashed upon the world.The Meg is the long in development adaptation of Steve Alten's 1997 novel Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror. The Meg is notable for its lengthy development cycle that began in 1996 before the book was even published and went through a rotation of different studios and production teams. Initially started at Disney's Hollywood Pictures label, development stalled on the film following the underperformance of Deep Rising as well as Warner Bros.' own shark film Deep Blue Sea beating Meg to development with the rights reverting back to Alten. Using the internet to keep Meg in the presence of fans' minds, none other than Guillermo Del Toro was able to set up the film at New Line Cinema with Jan De Bont slated to direct only for New Line to get nervous about the $100 million budget and once again development stalled. The film finally gain traction in 2015 as an international co-production between Warner Bros. And Chinese based company Gravity Pictures and following a minor hiccup with Eli Roth being replaced with Jon Turteltaub, the film became a sleeper hit overindexing in the United States and making over $500 million worldwide. Much like the novel it's based on, The Meg doesn't have any higher aspirations than taking a giant prehistoric shark and letting it run rampant and for my money it doesn't do it half-bad.What makes The Meg work so well in my opinion is in its fairly light tone and a solid cast of likable characters. Jason Statham although a departure from Taylor's depiction in the book makes the role his own and really showcases that cocky, arrogant, smartass side of himself that he's put to such good use in things like his collaborations with Guy Ritchie that first gained him recognition. We also have some solid performers making up the rest of the cast such as Robert Taylor, Rainn Wilson, Cliff Curtis, and Ruby Rose and while they're playing pretty standard characters for this kind of big summer monster movie, they're allowed to give more presence and likability to their performances and characters in comparison to other similar films (such as Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom which came out that same year but was way less fun). We also get some fun work from Li Binging as Suyin and Sophia Cai as Meiying Zhang with some genuinely amusing moments between them and Statham's character. In terms of effects work the movie just looks beautiful. The Mana One research station looks high tech with lots of bright colors that really pop and even the underwater photography is put to good use with some clear visuals (both in the CGI heavy sub sequences and lower tech sequences) and the filmmakers create some really fun setpieces using the Meg and the actors. It also helps that there's no really unlikable characters in the film and you actually care about whether they live or die. The one disappointment is that while there is plenty of bloody shark fun to be had, because of the PG-13 rating a major sequence set in Sanya Bay feels way cleaner than it should be and the meg feels like it's a bit too restrained during that scene. Luckily despite that one disappointing aspect, the rest of the movie delivers including an entertainingly over the top climax.The Meg is a simple movie with a simple promise: Jason Statham versus a giant shark. The Meg delivers on all the fronts it plays on and serves as fun escapist entertainment that isn't afraid to be anymore than it is. While I'm sure many of us wish this had gone as far as that Piranha remake in terms of feeding frenzies, there was virtually no chance that would happen and this was the best we could've hoped for.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Meg. So here we have a film about a shark, but not just any shark, we're talking about a Megladon, only the biggest shark that ever lived. Trouble is it lived thousands of years ago and isn't supposed to be around now, only someone neglected to tell the shark. In The Meg we have a film of two halves, firstly is the science stuff, the people who are investigating on behalf of the population of the world, boldly going further in their search for answers. The second half of the film is your classic shark chasing man movie, which even in these days of much improved special effects never quite gave us that feeling we had when the citizens of Amity Island were being terroized by a great white. Having said that this film was very watchable. We were given a good cast of characters that interacted well. Jason Statham played the brooding hero, combine that with your money making obnoxious billionaire, throw in a cute 8 year old and a Yorkshire terrier and you get a fair couple of hours entertainment. There were a couple of moments that made me jump but the rating is only a 12A so it was never going to live up to the promise of a gory shark attack film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has a nice tune to its name. From it you can guess it'll be about open water with the huge fish... yes fish. The movie carries the same simplicity of the title into the creature. Instead of the awe inspiring myth of a monster's name, you get a giant oversized fish. Although the movie has a category of ""Horror"" attached to it, the movie felt very short on scary. There are no terrorizing scenes or surprises in the movie. Better yet, there are no dramatic scream/death. Back to the fish vs monster; everyone, especially the main character, Jason Statham, are not afraid of the creature. Although there is a simple explanation, (the meg is defined as a huge shark, people know what a shark is, how it behaves, and human have firepower, what's to fear), everyone accepts death and reality, so move on?This brings to a good feature though. The character felt very realistic. Ever seen a horror movie where people say, ""lets split up, so the monster can't get us,"" or so, well this movie has the exact opposite. Each action the people fighting against the Meg are simple and straight forward. Although some actions have little thought into the process, the movie carried the simple tune of, ""we're taking responsibility"" and ""look forward"". Hell YES! Love this.Enough of the long oversights, here are some quick ratings on the movie:CGI is not horrible. The use of buffering was good, they did real good work on the MEG, but less attempts on the smaller sharks, which looks really dumb.Visual lighting is horrible. Some movies you say, man it's too dark I can't see anything. Well this one, it's so bright it's unreal. You can see everything, which lessen the thriller of things. Finally concept. Good character decision making, but fast movie pace lead little time for caring or knowing each character.The movie receives a 7/10, pretty good and worth to see once. The movie is tuned very low for the younger audiences, so they'll have a blast! Oh yeah, it's an action movie. Stab stab, punch, boom! If you see it as a horror film, it'll be 4.5/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

My wife and I started our Friday night by watching ""La La Land"", but this widely acclaimed multiple Oscar winner and alleged masterpiece bored and irritated me from the very first moments. I was so pleased that my wife kept falling asleep (not sure if she was also bored, or just tired) and eventually told me I could watch something else. I went straight for ""The Meg"", and - yes - I do prefer this dumb and shlocky piece of shark-horror over pretentious and fake feelgood musicals! The moto of director Jon Turteltaub and his crew must have been: ""if we are going over the top, we might as well do it properly! Why make another movie about a dull 15ft Great White shark if you can also work with a prehistoric 70ft Megalodon!? So far, this extinct species of mega-shark only appeared in cheap and insignificant B-movies so far, produced by The Asylum or other moron companies, but this is the Meg's very first stardom role in a hyper-expensive summer blockbuster, with a stellar cast and based on a profitable series of novels by Steve Alten. Quite frankly, I don't fathom all the hatred against ""The Meg"". Nobody honestly expected to see the most qualitative and tense shark thriller since ""Jaws"", right? Obviously, the script is heavily flawed. The characters do and say the dumbest things at the most inappropriate moments, but isn't that mandatory in pulpy monster flicks? Some roles, notably Rain Wilson, are walking & talking stereotypes, but simply every ""Jaws"" clone requires an ignorant authority figure. Call me crazy, but I enjoy brainless popcorn movies where people are shouting stuff like ""There's something down here"" or ""Everybody out of the water"", especially since most of the other summer blockbusters nowadays are either Marvel Superhero movies or Transformer spin-offs. The humongous shark, the special effects and the underwater set designs look impressive, which I reckon is normal regarding the enormous budget of the film, but still. Jason Statham remains, hands down, the most awesome and plausible action hero of this decade. He even keeps his cool when he's halfway vanished into the throat of a shark, but please don't ask him to flirt with a Cantonese beauty, because that looks embarrassing.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And there will be the ""Jurassic Park Effect"" as well - ( ""Megalodon"" ) further conning people into seeing this in Theaters and wasting their money and time.

Meg has been in production for over 20 years and although the film doesn't really feel like it's worth that long of a wait, it feels like the producers threw up their hands and just decided to make a goofy action movie. In that regard, Meg is actually a lot of fun! It feels very fast paced and goes very fast in general. All the Meg is about is Jason Statham fighting a giant shark, which is very awesome. Jason Statham is very very good in this role, probably the best he's ever been. Statham really is the star of the movie and not the giant shark, but he's so badass and awesome in this movie that I really didn't mind if he had more focus than the shark. Although the film is mostly fun and doesn't take itself seriously, some moments are quite thrilling and exciting, and many deaths were genuinely unexpected and shocking. The special effects are also very good and it helps a lot when the shark and other CGI effects all look close to real life. I think if I had one minor complaint, it would be that the film has too many differences to the novel, so much so that it probably could've had nothing to do with the book and be completely fine. One thing about the novel is that it's EXTREMELY gory and violent, in fact it's one of the most bloody and disgusting books I've ever read. The megalodon in the novel goes on an absolute killing spree with guts and intestines everywhere, and seeing a PG-13 version of Meg without the gore is kinda off putting. It would be like watching a PG-13 Deadpool; on it's own it might be okay but it'll be very weird for fans who know the violence and dark style of the original source material. It is kinda a bummer to wait 20 years for a Meg movie and only for it to be a lighthearted action film instead of the brooding disgusting horror the book was, BUT on its own as a movie, Meg is pretty entertaining and definitely worth a watch in IMAX or 3D! Just don't have the novel in mind because you might be disappointed.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I watched it at home, my wife decided to skip. I was in the mood for easy entertainment, she wasn't.To its credit the monster, the shark commonly known as Megalodon, really did live in our oceans at one time, estimated to have gone extinct around 2.5 to 3.5 million years ago. Possibly because Great White sharks were eating the young Megalodons before they could get large enough to defend themselves. Their fossils indicate they could get up to 60 feet long, very large but a bit smaller than those in this movie.The premise here is a very wealthy man is investing in deep ocean exploration and an exploratory punching through a deep boundary layer allows a few Megs to come up into the general oceans. Some of the team are trapped and an experienced rescuer is coaxed out of retirement when he learns his ex-wife is one of them.Jason Statham is Jonas Taylor. The name is a play on the Biblical Jonah who was, according to the account, swallowed by a big fish. Here Jonas has to lead a team to not only rescue those stranded but also to kill the Megs.So, when you watch a movie like this you don't expect it to be high art, you don't expect it to be without a few ""goofs"", you only expect it to be entertaining and it is. The production values are high, including cinematography and sound. And the acting is appropriate for the subject.I was entertained!

Hell, he'd know what I mean). You don't even have to watch the trailer to know what you're in for - just look at the poster and decide if you might be morally offended by the sometimes dodgy acting.Movie summery: Perfect stoner movie. I watched this sober, but still came out feeling a little stoned. Nevertheless, I will be returning online better prepared. In one review I read ""extremely unconvincing""! And ""storyline"" and so on and ""CGI"" and so on and ""want money back"" yada yada barf... The reviews are pretty depressing to scan over, actually. You have to assume - or hope - it's kids in that ""nah - would never happen like that"" phase. Pics or didn't happen memes. That mindset is kinda like when you hit about age 4, and realise The Wile E. Coyote would begin plummeting toward Earth * long before realising* he's already ran off the cliff edge. And you rolled your eyes and criticised it, up until about 6 when you finally realise how silly you were being over a cartoon TO BE ENJOYED FOR WHAT IT IS. It isn't trying to be, or compete with anything else. It's simply silly fun done to a standard.I mean if you just straight up hate the movie, that's fine. But, what were you expecting? Don't get into the whole acting/cinematography spiel after you've seen that poster and willingly payed to see it. That's bad foresight, hindsight and you really shouldn't be reviewing such films, let alone see them.I loved it. I genuinely thought it was quite funny, and of course super cheesy in some parts (especially for the Chinese audience), and purposefully overblown cheesy in others - which is cool. It's what I wanted. And I do love my serious acting and gorgeous cinematography too, but there's a place for it, humour and cheese.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I liked a few parts but most of it was pretty bad. First of all, the attempts at humor were laughable, but not in a good way. Nearly every joke was just plain old stupid and made my roll my eyes. Everyone else was laughing, so maybe its just me, but then again I heard them all saying ""this is really scary"" so I have a feeling I wasn't in the smartest or seasoned theater group. While some of the action scenes were passable but many were just so terribly filmed and choreographed it didn't catch the eye or even sometimes not allowing you to have a sense of whats actually going on. That sucks because the action was the only reason I went. The film even mentions 2 battleships, which honestly would have been awesome but the finale they chose was just kind of lame, was hoping for a Piranha 3D beach sequence, but what I got just made me say.... meh.... It was also MUCH longer that it needed to be. A very long intro combined with several false endings, meaning you think its over but its not. It ended up being another 'continually checking the time, Peter Jackson's King Kong' experience. I just wanted it to be over and go home and be upset I spent 8 dollars on this borderline piece of trash.

'The Meg' poses a real 'thinker' of a conversation piece in, 'Who would win out of a fight between a prehistoric, giant shark and Jason Statham?' Actually, it's not much of a brainteaser - I think we all know that it would take more than an aquatic, hungry dinosaur to stop 'The Stath.' But it's still fun to watch the fight go down.Yes, our very own British hardman Jason Statham plays, er, well kind of the same character he always does, but with one important twist - this time he's in the water! Anyway, he's a diver (sort of) who rescues people. Then he loses a load of people to Davey Jones' Locker and retired. Then a load of other people get stuck at the bottom of the ocean and - guess what - he's the only bald man who can get them out of their watery grave. And then a giant shark starts eating people.Come on... you've seen the posters and the marketing for this movie. What are you expecting? Something deep and meaningful with great dialogue and moving character arcs that question the very nature of human existence? No, if you're thinking about watching this then you basically like daft, fun B-movie-esque films which are just there to entertain. And entertain you this will.The Stath is the only real character you'll care about, however fans of the American 'Office' will probably recognise Rainn Wilson, as the billionaire who owns the ocean base most of the action centres around. The other characters are - predictably - there to, quite literally, dangle themselves in the path of rows of huge teeth.Before I watched 'The Meg' I did see a lot of other reviews mention how it was a bit 'tonally' all over the place. Now, I do have to agree. The film is at its best when it's not taking itself seriously and knows that it's just a daft (and yet epic) B-movie of a monster. However, there are parts where it does try to exceed its reach and inject some heavy drama into the action. This just feels a bit forced and could have been taken out so that the audience just either laughs OR cries, rather than trying to work the two in together.It's basically a B-movie with a budget that's been (cleverly?) marketed as an A-list outing. And it seems to have worked. It's great fun and hopefully there are schools more aquatic terrors for The Stath to punch squarely in the face. Leave the logical part of your brain at the door and just enjoy this for what it is.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What this is not is a serious and realistic horror movie in the vein of Jaws. What it is however is a tongue in cheek family friendly cgi shark movie full of action.
The plot is quite straightforward. A deep water exploration team is investigating the ocean floor as they believe there are even greater depths than there first appears. 
The exploration team are attacked by something unknown and Jason Statham who may have been attacked by the same creature in the past, is encouraged to come out of retirement to come to their rescue. The scene where he is talked back out of retirement and the ensuing cliches is all you need to know about the tone of the movie. Jason Statham knowingly smirks delivering a few of his lines so there is no doubt this isnt to be taken seriously.
This is a very self aware movie that plays for laughs and sends itself up with dialogue which shows that everyone knows how silly the premise is. 
The remainder of the movie is a cat and mouse game between The Meg and the crew once the shark has left its natural habitat and escaped into open waters. 
There are some great action scenes and there is not much dead space between them, its not a boring movie. 
The cast do well with the script and there is a balance between Asian and American actors as this was a joint production. 
The movie is similar to the Sharknado cannon albeit more realistic and with far better production values. 
There are a few good jump scares but there is very little to genuinely scare anyone, very little gore but there are a few deaths along the way.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It really was a decent watch, aside from a few flaws and nagging questions.Performance wise, Jason Statham is Jason Statham. He never goes above and beyond, he just delivers his usual performance. Which isn't bad, since one can imagine if he didn't take the role, the Rock would have, and TBH, it probably would have been a better choice than Skyscraper, but at least Statham is more likable onscreen than the Rock. Rainn Wilson is ok, but unbelievable as a billionaire, but once again, he delivers exactly the performance you expect. The weak link had to be Bingbing Li. Terrible actress, can't stand the ones from Mainland China, they cannot act. I mean, she is not the best China has to offer, I'm sure of it. She reminds me of a lot of Hollywood legacy actresses like Laura Dern and Gwyneth Paltrow who are only in the business through their parents or connections and cannot act. The little girl saves the entire movie, she had the best part of all, shockingly.The special effects and cinematography are average, nothing groundbreaking. It's serviceable. The dialogue was great, the plot was so-so. This team goes from researchers who happen upon a giant shark during an exploration mission to trying to take this thing on themselves, which is a tad ridiculous. Why would any government ignore them? They're researchers with a billionaire on board and another prominent Chinese man in charge, forgot exactly who he was, but their call would have been taken seriously. The notion they would try to take on this shark by themselves is insane, they would have sent word out to the military in person along with video and pictures. Other than that bit of preposterousness, it was enjoyable, you just had to shut off your brain for a bit.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

Story is usual and we have seen many times and one can surely predict what is next and what is end. Then you nothing find new in story line. In presentation, some scenes are really watchable on big screen. Tension and horror feeling at two or three times. But this is not sufficient to satisfy the movie watching. The story must have strong to stick you at your seat until last end. At one point we realised that the movie is finishing now but then in next few moments the story restarting again with appearance a second shark! Like stretching story unnecessarily long. These points will really disappointing you. At acting side Jason Statham is as always he is in such action movies, like plain face, a little anger hide on face and body is eager to make any unbelievable action. Ruby rose has a wasted role here with none of action whereas she played remarkable role in XXX Return of Xander cage and John Wick: Chapter 2. Why she doing such role? Bingbing Lee only looking good but not fitted in action scenes as her slim body, she is miscast. There is now a days a trend that TV series actors and actress are doing main roles in many Hollywood movies. Want of talents in Hollywood? Anyway, other casting is just okay. I really don't want to see a sequel of MEG without a good storyline. However, camerawork of sea is excellent. Underwater shooting is also marvellous.

The Chinese actors were pointless, other than to fulfill the propaganda goal of the mainland Communists ('We're nice and friendly... nevermind what we're doing in the East China Sea')Another unnecessary addition is the latest 'it' boy, Ruby Rose. Amazingly, s/he 'designed the high tech platform and everything in it.' Why do studios insist on pretending that memorizing intelligent-sounding lines is convincing when uttered from someone who's sole skill is changing their 'edgy' hair style from job to job.Stratham isn't bad in this. Clearly he's trying to branch out from the characters he's typically played, and this is a good start. It's just a shame that the writing and directing were sub-standard.Special effects: Not bad. The platform lab was a bit too Aqua Man and overdone. The shark was believable. And the underwater scenes were good.One big annoyance is the number of people falling into the water just as the Meg charges. Totally useless and unnecessary.The ONLY plus to wasting two hours is that it cost me $3 through Redbox.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The Meg and The Shallows are the two shark movies I come back to again and again, for very different reasons. While The Shallows is the story of one girl trying to survive the attack of one shark by herself, The Meg is the big action blockbuster with tons of CGI thrown at us: The Meg looks amazing, especially when watching in 4K Dolby Vision. The underwater facility, little submarine speed boats and of course the shark amaze me every time with how good they look. The movie obviously checks every possible box (drunk hero, revenge plot, reckless hero, stupid rich guy, explosions, sea monsters, ex wife, little child, beach scene etc.) that you might yawn while reading this list of generic shark movie items, but The Meg is well paced, less stupid than Jaws and has a good cast (especially Shuya Sophia Cai as the little daughter is amazing: Finally a kid in an action horror movie which does not scream all the time but actually can talk and act!), so that you can enjoy a nice shark evening without rolling your eyes too much.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Horrible one-dimensional characters, unimaginative cinematography, and a story so surface level it's an insult to the ground floor are only a few of the problems this bottom-feeding film has. This film is incredibly lazy and relies entirely on special effects to carry its paper-thin plot and horrifically uninteresting characters through a mind-numbing two hours.One fundamental flaw that one will notice immediately is the tone, as it's nothing like the trailer advertises. The trailer makes the film seem a lot more wink-wink than it actually is, but there's hardly an ounce of fun to be had in the film aside from a stupid gag with a dog, akin to a certain laughable scene from Independence Day. Most of the film is played straight for the most part, and it's not nearly as over-the-top as a shark movie needs to be nowadays. I mean seriously, you either have to go big or go home, so either go the stupid schlockfest route like Sharknado, or go for more of a serious Jaws approach. The movie is somewhere in the middle and rather than feeling unique it feels like an ungodly chimera that needs to be taken out of its misery. There are many scenes that drag on far too long with people talking and nothing really happening, and since the movie isn't very serious there is never any suspense throughout it.There's also the issue of the violence being toned down by the studio. Jon Turteltaub apparently had to cut many gory moments out of the movie to secure a PG-13 rating for marketing purposes, to which even he was disappointed. What results is a very mild-mannered shark flick that constantly feels like it pulls its punches. Though I'm sure this film toed the lines of the PG-13 rating, it doesn't feel like it, as there's not much to be invested in and the result is low-impact violence that isn't worth its weight in beans.There's a bunch of characters in the movie and none of them have any depth besides trying to be a certain basic template for just about anyone to relate to. The diversity hire aspect is also apparent to an excessive extent here, with some hilariously ironic stereotyping to boot, such as nerdy Asians and a black man who can't swim. There's a clear goal here of getting into China's wallets with some mild marketing to less-profitable minority groups that's only thinly veiled by dumb, likely polarizing humor, given how easily offended radical liberals, i.e. the target demographic, tend to be at immature humor nowadays.I felt the sound design was awful. I was bored out of my mind during what was intended to be the thrilling climax of the film, and it instead felt like a Coldplay music video. The music was not suspenseful or memorable, and dipped between the grating noise and soothing ambience on a whim with a motley crew of instruments all tossed together in a quantity over quality sort of fashion. There are moments in which the music sounds fine, and other moments in which it sounds completely lacking in confidence and desperate to be more grandiose than it truly is. The score wasn't even the problem though, as I found myself crippled with the cringe of the movie being book-ended with a Thai version of ""Hey Mickey"" just out of nowhere. It left me with an empty feeling inside, of which I would need weeks of counseling to reverse. The applause from the audience rang out like explosions in my brain, leaving me scared and disoriented. The CGI blood on the screen gave me a temporary case of PTSD.The name is also incredibly stupid. I get that the book is called 'Meg,' but that's even worse. The Meg that immediately comes to just about anyone's mind is Meg Griffin from Family Guy, and I don't think I need to explain further why that's an issue. Megalodon is also an incredible title, and is in fact what Mastodon used as a song title one time, and it didn't make people cringe, so that's probably a better route to take.The Meg isn't stupid enough to be entertaining, nor is it self-aware enough to be charming, and it most certainly isn't shot well enough to be exciting. This is a terrible shark film, and it's not like I'm too harsh on the genre either. I'd recommend Deep Blue Sea and Sharknado for dumb fun, and Jaws for a more serious horror film. This movie is basically all the worst elements of the countless shark films that came before it. It barely attempts to cover up its flaws, and as a result just feels like a clear bait-and-switch meant to keep audiences in their seats long enough that they can't get a refund.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

"","","Go ahead--it's not Jaws, but it is big fun like its megashark star.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4275886/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv","9 August 2018","""It's not about the people you lose; it's about the ones you save.""That mantra for The Meg is repeated by more than one character and serves as the heaviest philosophy in an otherwise B movie with technology and Steven Spielberg on its mind. Because its hero Jonas (Jason Statham), as in Jonah and the Whale, has been responsible for losses while saving others, that two-edged declaration dogs him with those who don't believe he fought a pre-historic megashark about 75 feet long and lived to tell about it.Meg is short for Megalodon, a shark seriously bigger than Jaws and at least as angry or predatory or plain Hollywood agitated. Scientists going deep under find a world preserved from time, but one that could harbor bad actors like antediluvian Meg. What follows is a series of set pieces about encounters with Meg, each one an anticlimax if it weren't for the next shark attack.Jonas is a credible hero, sullen and smart with a regulated beard Statham must pay a fortune to have the same every day. One of his memorable features is an outsized body built to make women silly and men cringe in envy. It is, however his surly terseness, be he Transformer or here as disconsolate diver, that makes me come back to the actor gleefully every time. He's not as naughty as he might be, but to keep the ratings in family range, he swears barely well enough.Director Jon Turteltaub keeps the action going fluidly, if not mechanically, as he and his team of writers make sure there are enough cases of tears over family or Jonas's loves while he Ahab-like goes after the whale. Clichés abound, especially when they introduce an 8 year old for sassy remarks and loveable mien. While nothing here compares with Steven Spielberg's masterful, and by comparison minimalist, Jaws, writer Dean Georgaris and his team, adapting from Steve Alten's novel, now and then evoke Jaws' terror while not coming close to its suspense.A beach scene, with many more delicacies swimming and floating than Spielberg has, is a veritable reverse sushi for Meg. The usual child and dog, this time a cute Pekinese, are prominent as are bikini-clad teens ripe for the mashing. The amount of technology and number of modern diving boats alone distance this film from the more primitive Jaws so many decades ago.The Meg is a fun formulaic summer movie with the ability to make you hesitate to go in the water. I'd say you're safe except I can't guarantee there aren't other Megaladons released from deep under. Have fun the rest of your summer, which was just made more exciting by good ol' Meg.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

So the movie finally arrived in theatres, and although I wasn't completely dreading it, I just didn't have very high hopes...I mean it's Jason Statham facing off against a giant, prehistoric shark, who can possibly take that seriously? Well...and I can't believe I'm actually going to type this sentence, but: this movie kinda rocks, sure it's still Jason Statham facing off against a giant, prehistoric shark, but it you're expecting something along the levels of 'Two Headed Shark Attack' you might be pleasantly surprised. Although the movie does have a good sense of humour, it never once makes fun of it's own plot and with just some suspension-of-disbelief, the science behind the discovery of this creature isn't completely unjustifiable either. Jason Statham carries the movie perfectly as lead character Jason Taylor, bringing a true likeability to the character and even offering depth to him in the appropriate moments. The side characters are all ridiculously likeable as well; I'm not going to emphasis too many specifics here, but there isn't a single character here who you desperately want to see killed off. Even some of the more villainous characters show strong moments of redemption and we feel sad when some of them are eaten. The only other character I do want to specifically mention is young Sophia Cai, playing the part of Suyin's daughter, Meiying. This little girl does the unthinkable: she is a child actor in a sci-fi/horror movie - one who actually has a hell of a lot of screen time - who never once gets annoying, you actually want this little girl to make it out alive, and I don't think I've ever seen that in this kind of movie. The action here is very intense as well, and even though you can kinda figure out for yourself who's going to die and who isn't, it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat with some great special effects, choreography and even some effective jump scares...yeah, I watched 'The Nun', 'The First Purge' and 'The Meg' back-to-back and it's THE MEG who finally made me flinch. Overall, I loved this movie, I loved the acting, I liked the story and most importantly: it kept my interest throughout it's almost 2 hour running time. It's a movie that surpassed my expectations and that I totally recommend seeing in theatres, and please do, because there are six more novels in 'The Meg' series and I now totally want to see those books made into films as well.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So going in my expectations weren't all that high.Turns out even that was overly optimistic. As has already been said here many times, this movie was just a small cut above one of those cheesy SyFy movies on cable. A very small cut above. Considering it's budget that's pretty pathetic.There was no real plot to speak of, the storyline jumped all over the place and it seemed that the director kept changing his mind about this being a comedy or an action movie. Maybe that's why it failed miserably at both.The characters were totally unlikable and unsympathetic. I honestly didn't care if they all died, with some I was hoping it would be soon. And they were just caricatures of people you've seen in a dozen other movies in the past; the token black guy who was supposed to be comic relief and wasn't. The concerned and sensitive boss who just wanted everyone to be ok. The evil rich industrialist who we were all supposed to hate because Hollywood really hates rich industrialists even though they're all rich too. And of course you have to have the angry, edgy man-hating female scientist, what would a modern action movie be without her? Btw; for the actress portraying this character, whose name escapes me at the moment; if you find it necessary to cover yourself with that many tattoos in an attempt to express yourself then you may want to thing about taking a communications course, or even a writing course because you're seriously lacking in some psychological aspect that allows we humans to communicate and express ourselves...without turning our bodies into a billboard. And another thing; for God's sake eat a pizza, or a cheeseburger, or something!The acting in this movie was horrible, the three Asian actors turned in some of the worst acting performances I can remember seeing, anywhere. The little Asian girl was such a terrible actor that I couldn't believe the lead didn't turn around to the director during his scene with her and demand they get someone who could you know...actually act! God she was awful, they all were.Finally, I think this movie should get the prize for characters doing the most abysmally stupid things possible. Time after time one of them did something that no intelligent person would even consider. Gee, there's a giant shark in the water somewhere around here, so why don't I just tread water here in the ocean after falling off the boat and chat with my friends. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?? People off the street wouldn't do the stupid stuff these people did, repeatedly, and these dolts were supposed to be trained scientists. It was an insult to the intelligence of anyone watching the movie.This is nothing but a badly written, badly directed, and horribly acted attempt to cash in on some popular books and the low IQ's of the average movie goers these days. Don't bother.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Acting seems to have taken a back seat with most Asian actors not taking up the mantle of good acting rather unbalanced and 1d . Jason Statham has done an convincing job of playing the protagonist. Rainn Wilson brings in some humour (although its tough place to bring humour). I watched this movie with low expectations but was truly surprised how good it turned out to be. there are characters connecting together,love,hatred,sacrifice and of course some shark aggression.

But don't get me wrong, this movie is nowhere close to The Jaws.There's a reason why The Jaws got 8 on IMDB (at the time of writing this review). And that's purely to do with magical film-making and a job well done by actors as well as the rest of the crew. The Jaws has everything a film-maker needs to learn about building on the concept, developing and utilizing the movie characters properly and tapping the right nerves of the viewer. This is why I was deeply saddened after watching The Meg. Because we aren't living in an era where ""the obvious"" can't be spotted. This is an era of an audience whose expectations have soared high in the recent years. And this is where The Meg fails. The concept is good, undoubtedly. But just imagine for a moment. What if you didn't know what exactly the movie was all about, what if the title didn't reveal much and what if you just couldn't see the reason for explorers of the sea disappearing in the movie (think ""A Quiet Place"" which is a 2018 movie). Now that would've been a movie worth watching. But well, The Meg doesn't utilize the potential thrilling/suspense aspect of the story and reveals the sea monster too soon. Now if that weren't enough, what disturbed me the most were the portions where you don't see any shock on part of characters who witnessed their colleague or a friend die in the movie. I mean, death in itself is devastating and knowing that someone you know was with you moments back before they died, that's bound to be shocking for any normal human being. But the movie miserably fails to capture these emotions. And most of the actors too didn't do justice to their roles. Special mention to Bingbing Li and Page Kennedy who played Suyin and DJ in the movie. Bingbing Li is in her 40s and she looks amazing for her age. But as an actor, I just couldn't connect with her character Suyin. Because, the intensity with which she spoke throughout the movie, it was as though she was fighting or having an argument with someone. And as for Page Kennedy who played DJ? Well, the expression-less face just did it for me.So a 6/10 solely for the special effects and well, being a Jason Statham fan, I just can't give it 5 which is what it actually deserved. The Meg is a one time watch movie that had the potential of being an amazing cinematic experience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yes the movie premise especially the second half was a bit similar to the 1975 Jaws movie, but the special effects here were obviously a lot better now. Now from the angle of a movie where the shark was the main focus, this one did not disappoint in term of scaring us especially during the scenes where Megalodon was chasing its victim(s). It certainly made my wife and some of the audience screamed most of the time whenever it appeared. Problem was the movie was rated PG-13 which made it felt a bit lighter than I would have expected for a shark attacks movie.The movie felt a bit light to my opinion as it was not entirely scaring or thrilling us nonstop. Throughout the 113 minutes duration, some of the time the movie gave us occasional brief funny moment. I believe it was the aim of director Jon Turteltaub to make the movie not too dark or heavy. Every now and then there would be some light humor that quite cheered us. But it did make the appearance of Megalodon felt not frequently enough to my opinion.The movie also had quite a large cast in the supporting roles such but the one person who stood out from the rest was to my opinion the young newcomer Shuya Sophia as Meiying (Suyin's daughter). I personally thought she stole the show with her adorable comments and actions as a smart 8 year old girl. Seeing this movie in a large studio with Dolby Atmos sound system was very satisfying as it gave the terror felt more so with the very huge shark on screen. Plus of course the sound effects were also very good. The movie did not have any mid or post end credit scene, unless you just want to enjoy listening to the song ""Mickey"". Overall this was a movie purely for fun. It was to give us some kind of nice adventure with very big shark chasing human. It was not as completely scary and suspenseful from beginning till the end like Jaws or a survival movie with great acting like The Shallows. It was a summer movie with good special effects and something that would give you fun for almost 2 hours, though it might have probably been a lot enjoyable had the Megalodon was given larger screen time to scare us more. But anyway, if you are looking for something like this, want to see Statham fight a giant prehistoric shark and do not mind the so-so plot, then you surely could enjoy this movie. However, be warned that if you prefer your movies to be very logical or you want a very nonstop action, then this might not fully satisfy you.

The Meg is somewhere in between. The effects are okay, sometimes you clearly see the effects other times they look okay.There's enough action to enjoy it but naturally being a flick for the whole family there's no gore attached, a thing you would have normally with a shark movie.Acting is no problem but it do has it flows between scene's you think, really. The moent with the child seeing the shark through glass is the moment I liked most.Ideal to watch on a rainy sunday afternoon, there's action, scary moments and some humor here and there and of course the predictable moments who's going to be eaten. But after all, not bad.

This could have been a blockbuster in the right hands but it needed a tighter script and a better supporting cast. Thankfully the entire film is held together by Jason Statham who never fails to disappoint. Rain Wilson is also great in his Billionaire role but he is under used and later disposed of which is a missed opportunity with any sequels.The weakest part of the film is some of the supporting cast with the nonsensical female engineer/hacker ""Jaxx"" played by the bizarre looking Ruby Rose and the masculine looking Jessica McNamee as Statham's ex ""Lori"". The gorgeous Binbing Li thankfully provides someone to look at but again they missed an opportunity to fully flesh out the romance between her and Statham and you are only left with possibilities. The half-British, half-Chinese Shuya Sophia Cai does a good job as the young girl, as she never gets in the way or out-thinks the adults in the room, something too many other movies are ruined by.This movie does not take itself seriously and that is a good thing, you get over the top action scenes with witty one-liners and Jason Statham doing what he does best. If you are an action movie fan and no matter how bad you think this film is going in, you will find it hard not to smile at various parts throughout the film. This is not winning any awards anytime soon but call it a guilty pleasure.......the Meg is so bad it's good.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

As a major shark nerd, and fan of the book, it means a lot to watch sharks on the big screen that aren't wretched CGI. Are the visual effects flawless, no. But they're pretty good considering we're talking about enormous prehistoric sharks. While not 100% accurate with the book, you have to accept that there will always be some creative freedoms and changes made during that process. Nonetheless, with a sequel on the way I'm convinced they'll be incorporating even more from the series of novels than this time around. It's just a shame that the flick was so heavily saturated with clichés and cheesiness, although I am guilty of enjoying some of the ""dad joke"" humor. Statham, Rainn Wilson, and Cliff Curtis are great, as was a smaller role by Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, but most of the other characters were just meh. Of you have a remote at the ready, it can be just the right amount of fun.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

First and foremost this movie wasn't the best and way far from bad like I saw some people say. Now because People are to far right or left minded in their opinion I'm writing this. The movie has a decent story line it's pretty solid because I don't know what other story they could put to do battle with a Meg. Is it far fetched at time? Sure but you know what? It's a movie not a ""lets see how realistic we can make it."" Could it really happen with some of the effect and stunt Statham does? Perhaps but not likely. The acting is solid and no complaints there. Effects? Awesome and had some nice visuals. But if your wondering if you should sit down and watch it I say yes I was actually a little more surprised and thought it was better than I thought. Its is almost like a modern day Jaws. I basically came on here to say it did not ""suck"" like some say. Some people think all movies need to be a masterpiece / 10 stars to be worth a watch. pfffff I gave it a seven because it's a above average movie and I might watch it again when it come to DVD.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I know I'm wrong to compare this film to Jaws but honestly what else has there been to compare it too?To be fair let's start with the negatives and end with the positives. Negatives -
The story is silly, 
It feels rushed, 
The predictable actions of the shark are unrealistic.Positives -
The action is top notch and in places does keep you on the edge of your seat, 
The effects are as you would expect are great.So honestly a very mixed bag. Doesn't have the same suspense as Jaws because far too much is squeezed in but still worth watch. Rating 6 out of 10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a sickness I have. I can't get enough of ferocious creatures treating fictional idiots as their all-you-can-eat buffet.Sadly, the Meg, while not exactly awful, is lacking in the writing department.Even a decent cast cannot save it. Statham is fine with his roguish, Bruce Willis-h presence. The delightful Bingbing Li is an interesting female co-protagonist. Rainn Wilson can be funny, Cliff Curtis solid...However, the characters are so uniformly vanilla, blandly noble and ready to deliver non-abrasive quips, they are incredibly boring - starting with the hero, whom the movie and the other characters spend an inordinate amount of time shilling. Even those who initially Wrongly Distrust Him™ are singing his praise before we are halfway through.You need variety, conflict, arcs. Remember blunt, aggressive sea wolf Quint giving his companions a hard time in Jaws? Alan Grant in Jurassic Park starting off as a child hater (and being stuck protecting two kids for most of the movie)? Ian Malcolm, the keen scientist with ""a deplorable excess of personality""? The well-sketched marines in Aliens and the tension between them and supercilious, unexperienced Gorman? The difference between gruff, blue-collar Parker and icy, smug Ash in Alien?Another mistake is the way the movie tries to escalate the tension. It works better if the situation gets more and more personal, like in Jaws, where the shark is initially a generic threat to Amity, then in the last act the leads are fighting for their lives on a sinking boat. In The Meg we start with the main characters being directly in danger in the first two acts, then the goal becomes stopping the giant shark before it attacks a beach full of swimmers. It's exactly backwards! We don't care about nameless people, they're just extras! We care about the main characters... or we would if they had been better written.5/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Which I guess is similar to this, but without Jason Statham and a rather smaller budget. Now since I haven't seen the ""cheaper"" version, I can't tell you how much fun it is. Asylum has done some interesting movies to say the least. Mostly copying the concept and not the whole (Hollywood) movie it is based on.Back to this, which is a whole lot of fun, even though they went the PG-13 route. I have to admit I was skeptical at first, but there is still violence, there is still death and there is even blood. So the bar on what can be shown might have been moved anyway. This might have been R-rated decades ago. It doesn't make much sense and there might be a touch too much drama and a weird love story patched on it, but overall it is what it is - you can't blame the movie if you don't like it is what I'm getting at. Watch it at own ""peril""","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

So big (25m!), in fact, that it's a prehistoric Megalodon. It's pretty much the same premise as 'Piranha' - which begs the question - why did this film require three writers?!? Needless to say, there's not much plot, other than Jonas (Statham) trying to save people from sunken submersibles, that keep getting attacked by the ""Meg"".Now, for such a ridiculous idea, it's played quite earnestly throughout, especially with romantic interest Suyin (Li), her Dad (Chao), Jonas' friend Mac (Curtis), and to a lesser degree, Morris (Wilson), the billionaire who's bankrolling the oilrig-turned-marine-science-lab. Definitely could've done with more tongue-in-cheek-ness - although Suyin's daughter Meiying (Cai) steals all her scenes. Ruby Rose & Page Kennedy are mostly wasted. Main gripe - needed more deaths! If you're watching a film about a giant shark (which doesn't appear for first 30min), you want to see 20+ people getting eaten. Not sure it even cracks 10... All that being said, there's a few jumps, some laughs and it definitely doesn't overstay it's welcome. Not as kitchy as it could've been, but certainly no 'Jaws' or 'Deep Blue Sea'.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

And it's everything you expect. The previews are great but there really isn't much past them. In fact, this movie is too PG-13 for a movie about killer sharks. Also, it's like many movies these days that are catering to the new Chinese movie market, which is fine and most people probably aren't even aware of this. The young girl is adorable. The effects are ok. There are a few laughs but ultimately it doesn't matter who the actors are because the sharks should take centre stage, and they don't seem to get enough screen time, at least not for my liking. Go watch The Shallows instead, or Deep Blue Sea or better yet the first 3 Jaws movies.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

So in honor of the tradition of Hollywood shark movies to come out, this is a no-brainer.The Meg is about a group of scientists wanting Jason Statham to rescue his ex wife and team from the ocean depths from unknown aquatic life. He does rescue her, along with this girl's Chinese mother, and then his ex wife is forgotten about the rest of the movie and focuses on this love thing between Jason Statham and the Chinese woman.And why wouldn't she love him? He plunges into the water to save her from a giant shark without any repercussions because, well, he's Jason Statham. In fact, you can even say this movie is Jaws with Jason Statham catering more to the Chinese audiences.The Meg is pretty much just a big, dumb shark movie and nothing more. It's entertaining, worth a watch, but it's nothing that will stay with you. Meghan really enjoyed it, and I guess that's all that matters. Just don't think too hard on it and you might have a good time.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

During the entire screening, no one seemed invested in the movie. No one seemed to care, because the movie didn't care. This is the epitome of brain dead entertainment. It's bizarrely written, with poor delivery by mostly every actor except Statham. The pandering to the Chinese film market is as apparent as any Michael Bay Transformers movie. There are so many stupid lines in this film, whether they're supposed to be badass (""When it's man versus meg, it's slaughter), hafl-assed social commentary (""They kill the sharks, just so they can have a bowl of soup""), or expositional dumping. None of the characters except from Statham make any sense. Rainn Wilson's billionaire character has funded this incredibly expensive underwater research facility, yet has no idea what they're studying at the start of the movie. Characters come and go, each one more forgettable than the last. There's a significant amount of stereotypes for ""comedic effect"" and a plethora of cheap product placement (closeups on Rainn Wilson's Nike shoes at the beginning of the film, and a really awkward scene based around Coca-Cola). While it sounds like I'm bashing this terrible movie, it is actually a lot of fun. The Meg is the type of movie you watch when you're bored and literally have nothing else to do. It's a tension-less, bloodless shark movie that's been sanitized to high hell to fit a PG-13 rating, and has some of the stupidest crap I've ever seen in a mainstream blockbuster, but there's a certain enjoyment to be had in it. It's like eating a bag of Funyuns. You know you're eating junk, but it just kind of tastes good.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The characters were constantly annoying and somewhat abhorrent especially the token black guy which was especially bad. A lot of the humor fell pretty flat most of the time but Statham remained a constant decent protagonist. When the shark is sparingly shown the CGI was very well done and it looks fantastic, but for once again being the main spectacle we barely get to see him it seems like. Instead we see many different useless scenes and attempts at tone shifts into more emotional aspects of the ridiculous characters . Also the violence and brutality was definitely toned down for this PG-13 cut and I think this movie would've benefited vastly from the original R-rated cut that was turned down by the studios. The finale worked solidly and was decently satisfying but overall this was at best a good yet utterly ridiculous short film that doesn't really separate itself from anything That's come before. The production value was very solid but for 150 million I would hope it would be. I definitely enjoyed the mana one underwater station lighting and design as well as some vast colorful underwater set pieces. I still think as far as new age shark films go that The Shallows and 47 meters down were slightly better. If you're a fan of sharks and just plain ridiculous spectacles, see this, just know what you're getting into and don't expect Jaws.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The action is good and the special effects of the shark are fantastic. The Meg has some amazingly good visuals of a megga shark on the rampage. The Meg is a modern day Jaws movie, and is just as good - if not better - than the original Jaws. The Meg is perfect for an easy Sunday afternoon or evening watch.

So much so, that SyFy channel can't stop filling their air times with ridiculous films that throw any excuse for mega beasts munching on airheaded characters who look good. Despite some famous movie sticking out in the television about the prehistoric predator of the deep, the big screen is calling for a film of its own in hopes of drawing crowds back to the welcoming halls of the theater. Based on the book series I recently saw in Barnes and Noble, the Meg is here to try and entertain. Yours truly is back to share some thoughts as he reviews: 
Movie: The Meg (2018)Director:
 Jon Turteltaub
Writers:
 Dean Georgaris (screenplay by), Jon Hoeber (screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Jason Statham, Bingbing Li, Rainn Wilson 
LIKES: Animation: CGI companies can make just about anything these days, including a 75 foot shark with a ferocious appetite. The Meg has some awesome design in bringing the beast to life, capturing the grainy, rough texture of the hide and making its swims delightfully fluid. This shark moves beautifully in its hunt for humans. The Characters: Most of these movies fail to bring the full talent of actors out, often resorting to making the characters glamorized fish food that we root to actually be eaten (some exceptions of course). The Meg though, their cast has more to their mettle, recruiting a bunch of dynamic actors to portray scientists that have a little more to their skill set than looking good. With this team, I was able to actually invest into the human characters and once more root for the team to find a way to solve the problem. And while the acting is not Oscar worthy, the dialogue, writing and delivery have been grounded to be enjoyed and not scoffed at. The Story: Again, most of these films hold very little in terms of quality story, only designed to maximize the blood and kills. The Meg though, takes a step back to the storytelling roots and actually does a nice job of balancing the kills with a purpose for the carnage. From how the shark came into the modern world to side stories portraying character flaws, this film had surprising amounts of detail to actually give a reason to the movie. Don't freak out though, there are still plenty of superficial carnage scenes to tickle your fancy, but for those like me who like balance, this movie gets better props. In addition, there are some twists to help add some bite to adventure. The Pace; A movie like this can sometimes drag, especially if you hate these types of films and you were dragged in to going by friends. Again, the Meg succeeds in this journey of keeping the film moving, the adrenaline pumping, and the laughs/carnage keeping pace. The film has enough action and close shaves to keep you on your toes, which plays to the nature of this genre. The Nostalgia: The Meg does have a lot of individuality, yet it is also packed with countless references to the shark movies that came before. The movie has plenty to offer, and the shark movie fans should have no problem picking up the Easter eggs submerged in the Megalodon infested waters. Nice job adding this layer of fun guys. DISLIKES: Over the top moments: The whole movie is ridiculous, I understand that and will accept it, but even suspending reality goes only so far. A giant shark movie sometimes goes too far and hits those eye rolling moments that sort of diverge from the path of balance it was achieving. Some of the structural integrity inconsistencies and speed of our humans are a few examples, but hey that's a shark movie. Plot Holes: The movie did a nice job of putting a story on board, but the movie does have some gaps that even for the ridiculous tale shouldn't have been skipped. It goes with the opening scene more than anything and with it, sort of diverges from the explanation they gave, sort of undermining the semi-logical conclusion they had. Again, a small dislike, but a noticeable one that is a bit annoying to me. Predictable: Even worse than the holes and the ridiculous level, comes the predictable plot that this genre suffers from. The Meg has more obvious foreshadowing than the theme music of Jaws, and with it comes some suspense being tempered away. While secondary characters are kind of the group to bet on for surviving vs dying, the rest of the cast has their paths blazed from the start. You'll be able to predict most of everything, though a few twists managed to spice a few things up. I'm still looking for that Jaws like quality, but The Meg does get points for trying. The uneven character spacing: I love Deep Blue Sea, because the characters had narrow misses, epic survival strategies, and the gradual picking off of the groups. It allows for more suspense, pulling you into the game of cat and mouse, or in this case shark and human. The Meg started out this way, but then succumbed to munch fest and lost the structured plot to the demands of carnage. It's not the worst case I have seen, but it was disappointing to see that build up sort of fizzle out, though I must admit it did happen in the later part of the film so kudos. 
The VERDICT: 
 Let's be honest, The Meg is a ridiculous movie that many will agree is a pure popcorn eating flick. Surprisingly though, the movie has improved on its storytelling abilities, and finds a balance between the superficial and deeper aspects of the film. Still, the shark movie is very entertaining, with a good pace, suspenseful action, some well-timed laughs, and nostalgia to get you into all the adventures to come. Yet, the film still suffers from some of the stereotypical faults of this genre, which takes away from the strengths of the movie. If you are the fan of this genre, then please hit a local theater to check it out, but otherwise hold off until it swims into television/streaming waters. My scores: Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Prehistoric Shark is supposed to be very huge but we do not get that feeling barring few scenes here and there. From acting perspective Jason Statham's character could have been played by any other actor, and other characters don't make much impact either.

He manages to rescue some of the survivors but loses some of his team when the sub is 'attacked' by an unknown creature. Five years later when an exploration vessel, piloted by Jonas's ex-wife is similarly attacked and stranded he is called in to lead the rescue. He is flown to the oceanic research facility his ex is based and leads the rescue. It looks as if things will be okay but something has followed them from the depths... a magalodon! That is an eighty foot shark thought to have been extinct for millennia. The crew of the station will have to find a way to kill the shark before it can become a threat to anything in the water.I went into this with mixed expectations; on the one hand Jason Statham movies are almost always fun and on the other the concept seemed like an inferior 'Jaws'... both of these expectations turned out to be true; it is fun but certainly more than a little cliché. Statham impressed as Taylor, and the rest of the cast were solid enough; notably Li Bingbing as Suyin. The film does start well; the rescue mission is fairly exciting and first glimpses of the megalodon are impressive... the clichés begin just as everybody things they are safe. Several scenes will remind viewers of similar ones in 'Jaws'; and make them remember just how great that film was in comparison to this (and every other shark attack movie). On the plus side the effects were pretty good and there is no material that is likely to offend anybody... it isn't even particularly gory. Overall I wouldn't call this a must see but it is fun enough if you are a fan of Jason Statham or like shark movies.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's because of this that it starts to outstay its welcome perhaps sooner than you'd expect, becoming quite repetitive and boring during its second act especially. Somehow, it manages to push past this problem for a brief window when it decides to get somewhat sillier than before - finally letting the 'Stath' go mono a mono with the eponymous 'Meg' - and it manages to provide those overtly tongue-in-cheek pleasures it feels as though it's been aching to provide since its opening moments. Still, it's not quite a schlocky 'syfy channel' shark movie-of-the-week, since there are several moments that have a little more heart than you'd think and its big-budget has clearly been put to good use (the cinematography and CGI are both generally really impressive), and I don't think it was ever even intended to be a throw-away, 'so bad it's good' affair, just one that appeals to the widest possible market. This all means that more attention seems to have been paid to the plot's distinctly science-fiction set-up and that there are even some standard but appreciated themes - such as 'man (or science) versus nature' and the more character-focused 'lives lost versus lives saved' - that allow for a feeling of competence, if not exactly passion, to ring throughout the picture. Sadly, though, Statham is perhaps the worst (by which I mean least cohesive) core player for quite some time. He seems to be in a different flick to the others, one that's just as hammy as his line-delivery, but at least he's having fun. Surprisingly, so are we (for the most part). 6/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, The Meg tried to tow the line between cheesy fun and a self-serious tone.

I like Jason Statham, but he just isn't given enough of the crazy stunts and moments that would make this movie more fun.

About 10 minutes into the movie, we are acquainted with the menacing creature. The action scenes build up quite well to showcase increasing destructive power of the Meg, albeit with some predictable deaths and corny character interactions. The cast is likeable, so the movie does not really drag or lose tension, except the beach attack moments, which feels too derivative from the iconic JAWS, without the suspense, but with lots of over-reacting extras screaming, scrambling. In those scenes, the Meg seems to have run out of art production budget and/or the director took a lunch break. The beach wide crisis feels messy, and lack focus. Fortunately, the scene was brief, and viewers are quickly directed to the main crew's storyline, and soon treated with the final grand slam between our hero and the Meg.The Meg is an engaging, fun 2-hour trip at the theatre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You know what you get, and it requires close to zero brain activity to watch it.Jaws is my favorite shark movie of all time. It's not easy to beat that, and The Meg certainly does not. There has been several ""real"" monsters movies after Jaws though, and I think The Meg is one of the better ones.They never manage to capture the charm of 1970s movies, which often moves along in a slower pace, and with more subtle clues and such. Nothing is subtle about the Meg, it's high speed from (more or les) the beginning.It's still very entertaining though, and is a nice movie to watch if you want something easy for the brain. I like it, and I've seen it several times since its release. I went glass half full on the rating, I really think it's more of a 6.5/10 than a 6/10 movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In an age of po-faced blockbusters, The Meg may not reinvent the wheel, but it provides a fun and frivolous time out at the movies which is sometimes all we really need.3 Pippins out of 5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With a completely ridiculous premise that seems sent from the heavens to guarantee an entertaining viewing experience, the film plants itself firmly with its lead performance by Jason Statham, but doesn't have enough of the mayhem, carnage, or action that you'd expect from a film about a giant, prehistoric shark.""The Meg"" starts slowly, with an opening 45 minutes of what can only be described as setup - it is an agonizing buildup that isn't necessarily boring, but doesn't add anything fresh to the monster movie genre. You have Jason Statham in the lead, who is always charismatic and irresistibly watchable, and luckily, he does make the first half of the film somewhat palatable, what with his many daring rescues and antihero persona. However, what the movie has in personality it lacks in entertainment.The majority of the first half of the movie consists of people sitting in rooms and talking about the giant shark that's on the loose. And let's be honest: No one wants to see that. If you're watching ""The Meg,"" you want to actually see the big shark in action! And this movie doesn't really deliver that. Sure, there are some set-pieces with the shark that are somewhat fun, but everything feels generic and neutered. This is a movie that is trying to be goofy fun, but lacks any over the top sequences that could really take it over the edge and deliver that camp to the audience. To be perfectly honest, I can barely remember any notable action scenes. Also, the shark stays hidden for most of the film, no doubt due to its relatively small budget, which also does the movie no favors.""The Meg"" is small scale in almost every way, which deprives the shark from doing anything remotely interesting. When the final 15 minutes or so finally happen, you do get some of the stuff you expected, which is to say, you see the shark on the loose in populated areas. But before that, the shark is only terrorizing a small cast of characters, which leads to equally small set-pieces, giving the film an overall cheap feeling.Honestly, I wasn't a fan of this film, which is a shame because I am a fan of Jason Statham. All I wanted to see was an insane movie about a man being forced to fight head-to-head with a big shark, and the movie barely even delivers on that premise. You can probably have some fun with this movie if you saw open your head and leave your brain far away from the screen, but for me, ""The Meg"" dished up a lack of thrills that you'd expect from this kind of monster movie. This fish is definitely under-cooked!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In modern times. The premise is as preposterous as it sounds. At least Jaws (1975) 'could' be true. This feels like a corporate movie made to make money, there is zero creativity for this film, just a whole lot of money thrown at it. It also feels like it was made for the Chinese who like American movies market. It has such broad appeal it is boring. Jason Statham annoying. The rest of the cast are totally forgettable. On the positive side the special effects and technical aspects are near-perfect. The pace is also fast and keeps you entertained. For a mindless film it works but as a society haven't we moved on from this yet? Give me some depth and entertainment.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

We had no thoughts that this would be the next Jaws or super gory since it was rated PG13. We were greatly surprised at how much we both genuinely like it. It was fun with great lines in my opinion. Yes it was predictable but these kinds of movies usually are. Being a parent I was thankful that even though it's rated PG13 there were not curse words slathered everywhere. So it was a good family film too. Which I get why that may make people mad. Scary shark movies aren't supposed to be family friendly. They are supposed to be horrifying with blood and guts everywhere. But this wasn't that.

"7","/10","A tale of deep sea terror.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4291673/?ref_=tt_urv","kevinxirau","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27881178/?ref_=tt_urv","18 August 2018","There is little doubt that one of the most terrifying creatures that ever lived on Earth was the Megalodon, an enormous, whale-eating shark whose name literally means ""big tooth"". Steve Alten knew this very well when he wrote his acclaimed series ""The Meg"", though it surprisingly took a while for the prehistoric sea monster to make it to the big screen. In this tale of deep sea terror, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is called to rescue a team of scientists from the same creature he encountered years before only for the situation to escalate as the Megalodon sets its sights on a nearby population. In a world of shark films that take things to ridiculous extremes (i.e. Mega Shark vs, Sharktopus, and Sharknado), it's refreshing to see a brand new shark movie that takes a more serious turn. The cinematography and effects are sufficiently executed in showing just how gigantic and frightening the Megalodon is when on the prowl; it certainly unnerved me a little (though not nearly as much as my mother, who was hilariously jumping and screaming. LOL!). There's also a good amount of scientific explanations of how this could all happen, allowing for a sense of reality to an otherwise standard monster movie plot. I'm proud to say the cast holds up nicely. All the characters, Statham included, are well-acted, have believable chemistry, and just downright likable, which makes the perils they're in and any deaths all the more effective. While the film is largely serious and tense, there are some sprinkles of humor that for the most part got a chuckle out of me, serviceably lightening things up, and there's a romantic subplot that I found cute and charming. Another nice touch was the film dabbling into social commentary, particularly man's strained relationship with the ocean, which is much appreciated.In short, the Meg is a film guaranteed to bring both thrills and chills. I highly recommend watching it on the big screen if only to make the scale of the shark feel more impactful. I heard there are some differences between it and the novel, so if you're a purist I don't know how you will react to this. As for me, definitely one of the best shark movies out there. Just don't blame me if you find yourself too scared to go into the ocean after watching this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Let's be honest people, The Meg is a terrible film.
Yes there's the creepy scare factor and it's tense, yes CGI did a great job at making things look real and also the Meg shark was a more interesting shark than jaws, but apart from that this movie is lame, implausible, cheesy and dumb.
The inclusion of inappropriate humour, characters you want to choke to death, daft dialogue and an illogical first act, this movie unsurprisingly scored more sins than other movies of this type.
I am sure the creators spent more time on the special effects than developing then script and organising the plot. The problem was the use of humour didn't work it just took away any built up tension and engagement. I have to add the opening twenty minutes is visually good with the innovative tech and crew, the budget they had on full display, but with terrible editing and cutting. There wasn't much on the background of the characters other than Statham and the use the researchers barely knew much also didn't send for any help. This really sucked and the whole plot at defeating a shark, with a lack of development and research, really sucked also.
Some of the acting in this is 1/10. I think the chinese, New Zealanders or whoever messed up this entire movie especially the beach scene where they're all floating in the water with rings like it's compulsory and then told it's safe after thirty people have got eaten, just woeful and succeeds in taking the realism and genuine efforts away from the film.
When your making a film like this with this kind of budget everyone should have been including Jason way more committed. This should done way better not rushed just carefully planned. It's not all about what pleases your eyes. Not when how sexy Jason is or they hot girl with the tattoos. What gets in the way of the film being enjoyable and entertaining is not that it's going to be compared to other films of the same genre, but how all of the above from the dialogue to the ridiculousness.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I like Jason, I liked all of the actors in the movie and thought they did a fine job. Listen, I've been watching summer disaster movies since the 70s, it's part of summer. We had that movie with Dwayne Johnson which was terrible, at least this had decent acting and a way better script. It's also much more visually exciting than Dwight's move. Even though a good part of the movie is filmed underwater we had great visuals. My one big disappointed was that Jason wasn't shirtless enough and I wish it would have been a bit more gory. It was plenty exciting and the ending wasn't disappointing even though it was predictable. For the type of movie it is, it's good but it does make me appreciate Jaws more but we can't have that same experience of Jaws again audiences have become too jaded. It's fun, exciting, thrilling. Just enjoy it and don't overthink it. It's a good excuse to escape the heat, have some candy, popcorn and sody pop and enjoy.","16 out of 36 found this helpful.

If you have followed the track record of these types of films you will probably realize that there isn't many that are very good. I would say after ""Jaws"" there are only three that are even worth a look and no ""Sharknado"" isn't one of them. In 1999, I read a novel about a megalodon shark called ""Meg"" and while the book was just ok, I was excited that on the cover it said ""Soon to be a major motion picture"". I thought a movie about a 100-foot shark might have some potential, but to my disappointment ""Meg"" turned out to be one of those films projects that never seemed to get off the ground and many of the straight to video movies about megalodons were horrible and laughable. Now in 2018, it has finally been adapted and is called ""The Meg"", but which group will it fall with? The shark movies that are good but still nowhere near ""Jaws"" or the ones that are about as entertaining as fish chum. Action star Jason Statham stars as Jonas Taylor, a rescue diver who had a tragic incident while saving scientist in a damaged sub. He is forced to leave two of his friends and co-rescuers when his vessel is attacked and he realizes that if he goes back, he and the 11 men saved would parish. Taylor claims a giant creature attacked them but nobody believes him and thinks he was suffering from delusions caused by pressure sickness. Years later a research team with a high-tech facility are charting a new trench in the ocean that might be one of the deepest parts of the ocean. When the first sub is attacked and damaged, a rescue mission is started and some team members feel like Taylor is the best man for the job despite his going in seclusion in Thailand. When they inform him that his ex-wife is one of the people in the sub he agrees and during the rescue his theory is proven correct as the researchers discover an actual megalodon shark alive and dangerous. Taylor is able to save the sub but their breach of the deep trench opens a gateway for the shark to come up to the surface and wreak havoc above. ""The Meg"" is pure popcorn entertainment, so you really have to take it with a level of understanding that it won't blow you away with a deep story, original plot twist or unique characters. The truth is we have seen them all in other shark movies and other popcorn flicks as well. The one different aspect is this shark is huge... monstrous even and the actions scenes with it are not bad but not jaw dropping. The movie is something I wish I could tell you is so much more but in fact it is pretty run of the mill for a creature feature or action film. Statham is a solid action star but he isn't the most charismatic in film either. He handles his role about as well as you would like him to but doesn't add any dimension that will make his character or the movie extra special like a great leading man can do. Most of the characters in the film are your typical types that popcorn films supply. They are either dropping jokes to make the audience chuckle or they are there to invoke some emotion either good or bad. Most especially stereotypical is Rainn Wilson who plays the research teams financier and supplies most of the films one-liners and even turns out to be a bit of a snit. The two cast members I enjoyed the most was onscreen mother and daughter played by Li Bingbing & Shuya Sophia Cai. They are the most enjoyable characters and bring a good amount of personality when they are on the screen. The CGI effects aren't bad and there are some scenes that are very well done, so I'll say it's a good enough reason to give this film a try. There is also a couple of witty nods to ""Jaws"" that will please fans. The worse thing about the film is its atrocious and even down right stupid ending. I won't spoil it but if the guys with Myth Busters hated the fact that it is actually impossible to blow up an air tank (see ""Jaws""), they will howl with laughter with what does the megalodon in. It really is a hard pill to swallow. So after 19 years of waiting, I won't say that I was disappointed with this film but I know its not going to go down as one of my favorite shark movies. It has some moments but overall it is just your typical summer popcorn flick with enough entertainment value to enjoy it but not call it a must see. I suppose my final grade is a bit too kind because it is a shark movie, but I just really have a soft spot for them thanks to ""Jaws"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Your typical action star but lacks any kind of acting range.The most egregious problem, for me anyway, is the violation of even the most basic physics. Here you have a creature that has evolved to live at 11km depth but can also reach the surface (it would be dead almost immediately due to the laws of physics). It also travels at over 500mph in some scenes based on the locations travelled from and to.

Sick of idiots shouting ""BOTS!"" anytime reviews don't agree with their extreme opinions on something. These people are paranoid narcissists. They should not be given access to the internet.But I digress...The movie was a summer blockbuster through-and-through, and it was quite enjoyable just taken as-is. It's easy to see wasted potential/missed opportunity, but it is what it is. A summer movie made for teens, and enjoyable as that (despite my being older, I can still remember what it was like to be one 😉).The acting was fine. No Oscars in the future for The Meg, but there's charisma to spare with this cast. 
The effects didn't make me cringe like almost every other shark movie out there. It doesn't feel like they over do it with the shark, but also doesn't seem like they make excuses not to show it to save money on the production. When you do see it, it looks good, ominous, and believable. 
There's plenty of armrest gripping tension in many scenes to keep you engaged, though not much in the way of payoff when someone does eat it (or gets eaten, as the case may be). There's little depth beyond the trench they're exploring, but is anyone expecting that here? I would hope not. 
Some of the humor is definitely forced (the hair joke... He knows EXACTLY what happened to her hair, but the question tees up her comeback so.... You'll know it when you see it. SMH), but for the most part it's digestible and serves it's purpose as a palate cleanser between the tense momentsI think that all-in-all the movie succeeds at being exactly what it set out to be, and while it did have some potential to be something more, I have the feeling that they would've failed if they went for it. It would've taken some exceptional talent to realize it, and no-offense, that talent wasn't on board for this film.I would recommend this when you're looking for something light and fun. Probably best enjoyed with some friends on the night before a trip to the beach, maybe?
Oh yeah, to all the people comparing this to Jaws: STOP! Not every shark movie needs to be compared to Jaws. There will never be another Jaws, and if there were, it wouldn't be about a shark. Jaws was special because it was a first for its type and a masterpiece by one of the greatest directors of all time, made all the more amazing by having to work creatively around technical problems that no one predicted and then released in just the right era and perfect time of year. A confluence of factors that is just not going to happen twice, even if they try to force it.""Alien"" is more like Jaws than you should expect any shark movie made since or in the future to be.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Let's face it, nearly every shark movie since Jaws has been a downer. Given there are enjoyable ones, but there are way too many onces who have failed miserably, so why go and see one now? Well the fact that they've chosen a Megalodon this time instead of an ordinary Great White was pretty interesting I thought, and Jason Statham is always an entertaining watch so I went to see it anyways...leaving the theatre I was still underwhelmed.I was promised a fun and entertaining shark movie that knows what it is and has fun with it, so I was prepared for that. I didn't expect any oscar winning performances, I didn't expect a masterclass thrill ride, I just wanted to have some fun. Yet still they managed to dissapoint me.The best thing about this movie is Jason Statham by far, he's a likable presence and is great in being a badass. Sure he plays pretty much the same character over and over but he's entertaining in these roles so I don't mind. The CGI is fine, I wouldn't say that it's mindblowing but neither was it terrible. The first act did have an alright build-up, they don't show the shark for a while to build up some anticipation which I was all for!That's pretty all the positive news I can give. This movie, although not trying to be good, has some serious problems. All the characters are extremely hollow, don't expect some great character development, litteraly everyone on screen (except for Jason) is just someone to be eaten. The acting is fine overall however there's one actrice who was really bad at times, but for the rest it was alright. The events that happen in the movie can be seen coming at you from miles away, a lot of clichés are used guys and however I can accept some of them...the things that happen in the finale where just too much for me and I almost started rooting for the shark as a result. My biggest complaint however was the lack of ""fun"". This movie really tries to be serious and emotional at times, but because we care so little for the characters, it fails miserably. When one character gives a speech right before dying (yes we have that of course), this person suddenly starts apologizing for things that happened in the past, but this was never even brought up in the movie, so why bring it up now when it litteraly means nothing to us? It's moments like this that just sink this movie way too deep.Is it a terrible movie? No.
Is it a masterpiece like Jaws? NO.
Did I have as much fun with it as I had with Sharknado? No, and that's pretty sad.It's definitely not a must-see.
I give it a 6/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

the movie was beautiful and definitely a movie that should be watched in the cinema when you are out of sight and if you buy it as a dvd and watch it on TV you will not like it frankly i think you will not like it.okay I have to admit until the last time I watched without being bored but I enjoyed it very much but when the movie was over I thought about how the TV would be.The subject was a little weak, only the effects and the shark chasing the people were nice.

Turteltaub did a good job knowing his place, not going over the top, trying to compete with titles like Jaws. They had a high budget of one hundred & thirty million dollars, and did the bare minimum utilizating the money. Everything was decently balanced during the first act, but once the second act hit, they overstuffed the narrative with over the top, forceful action, that really took me out of the movie, almost completely.The general consumer, looking for a basic, fast paced, summer time shark movie, with a well known action based actor, would most likely enjoy this movie. Other than that, it's just an unoriginal, coperate cash grab, that had more than a few miss steps. The main issue I had with this film, it should've been rated R. The Meg definitely would've benefited from being more gory & a little more vulgar with their dialogue.The characters and acting pretty much sucked all around. Jason Statham basically plays himself, and that is usually good enough. The romance part to his character they tried to add was so pointless, and beyond unnecessary. Rainn Wilson is supposed to be the comedic relief of the movie, and for the most part, his dialogue was pretty cringey, and not that funny. As for the other NINE supporting characters, they were all super forgettable.
Overall, I'm a huge sucker for any type of shark movie, so I didn't completely hate this movie. This scheme is so overused, that you can never expect a masterpiece anymore, and for that reason, I'd say avoid this flick, unless you're like me, and love shark movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The shark terrorises the crew as they attempt to battle it.A long time on the books project, this US-Chinese co-production seems to have a budget as big as the shark, but is still massively left in the shade by the vastly superior JAWS (1975), despite its tongue-in-cheek jokey dialogue. Nevertheless THE MEG is still superior to the dreadful spate of SHARKNADO type of low budget disasters. Naturally it is more than peppered with cliches and references to JAWS, implausible and over the top macho action and set pieces in what is otherwise just an expensive B movie.

Now, you might argue it's more or less Jaws with a bigger shark, and you'd be right, but Jaws, while not the masterpiece so many say it is, is like Tolstoy compared to this. The characters are cardboard and sometimes played by actors who seem to believe that's all that's required of their performance. (To be fair, some of the actors don't seem like English is their first language, so perhaps that's why they are so wooden, but it doesn't excuse the others, like the pinch-faced Ruby Rose.)But there's so much more. Obviously the production design is trying to be on par with Jurassic Park and similar SFX movies with thin stories but lots of CGI. Sometimes it comes close. But all that isn't enough if you don't care about the people and the story is dumb on top of it.Case in point, after fighting and seemingly defeating the Meg in what are heavily shark infested waters, one of the crew's lunkheaded blue-collar lugs decides to engage in some idiotic grabass that results in a crewmember being tossed overboard and -- no surprise -- eaten. Okay, but later when he is enraged and scolding others, there's no self-awareness his part in the disaster, which ultimately leads to the capsizing of the ship and the loss of even more life. Instead, all the blame is heaped on the Elon Musk-type rich guy because, you know, the formula these days says they're always to blame.No, this is just a simple minded adrenaline rush where people yell and scream a lot with absolutely no sense of anything except the moment. In this respect, it's a lot like Deep Blue Sea, another mindless SFX misadventure with sharks. But at least Samuel L. Jackson had the good sense to get out of that story earlier.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Big ambitions... just don't translate here. Sort of just sits there treading water, never really going full tilt with its prehistoric shark. It should have made for silly, in a way over-the-top fodder, but it felt half-baked. Caught between wanting to have fun at its own expense, yet undermining the threat of the ordeal when it tries to go serious. Which isn't too often.Instead the Meg can feel secondary to the light-weight, and awkwardly blunt character dramas and banter, especially early on, but when they decide to deliver what everybody came for. All I got was the same repetitive pattern occurring on a loop; a dangerous predicament, close call rescue, self-sacrifice and a lot splashing about (or better put constantly falling from boats into) the ocean. Now repeat. Sadly I found little tension, or excitement derived from these set-pieces, which would cut-away when you think it was going to deliver something big and causing everything to come to a grinding halt. However Jason Statham throws himself into the role (quite literally) making for a likeable, if brazen heroine which this toothless premise and execution sorely lacked.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Acquainted friends know that I am a swimming enthusiast, I am crazy about water, so I will not miss this underwater adventured movie.First to say the visual effect, one of the highlights of this film. It can be seen that the crew is working hard, and the underwater world is really eye-attracking. As I was several lucky movie-goers who was able to see premiere, I cannot choose the seat and 3rd Raw is rather dizzy for CMAX screen.
Since China and America are co productions, Chinese actors must be indispensable. In recent years, many Chinese actors have been involved in Hollywood movies. They are being used as tools to make box-office, only to play some unimportant supportung roles. But this time, Li Bingbing didn't let the audience down, at least not let me down. From the lines, the pronunciation is absolutely well trained, although still sounds like Chinese people speak English, it is fluent and very natural, better than not young and light people. In addition, it is reported that she is very afraid of water, but in the underwater shots she performed confident and calm and her swimming skill seems quite professional.When it comes to actors, I'd like to comment on Jason Statham alone, and I've always thought that an action actor can only fight but not actually acting. But Jason Statham completely subverted my previous understanding. The upper body of strong muscle can be fully compared with Olivier Giroud and other athletes. While young Statham was professional diving member of British team, yet it was a little bit pity that he didn't do a difficult diving posture in this film. Perhaps, we lost a perfect diver. Fortunately, we are able to see his beautiful underwater acting.This film contained twists and turns plot, there are laughers and there are screams of the audience as well. Adults need to be carefully considered whether to take children or not.In a word, it is a masterpiece of Sino US co production. It is beyond expectation and worth watching in an IMAX screen.","39 out of 102 found this helpful.

Filmed in the seas off China with a largely Chinese cast, it delivers what monster movie fans expect: an escalating series of disposable extras being disposed of. Jason and the scientists are in constant peril, but we sort of know who will make it to the end of the movie - and who won't. Jason flashes his pecs in a shower scene, which for some fans is already worth the price of admission.21st century CGI delivers a much better shark than Stephen Spielberg was able to muster in 1975. But JAWS had a screenplay which was original back then (from Peter Benchley's best-selling novel) but has gone stale with repetition. Despite its recycled script, THE MEG has terrific pace and some seriously jumpy moments. Yes, it's hoary old hokum, but it's hugely enjoyable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Overall I enjoyed it, in a guilty pleasure sort of way. The action is over-the-top and Jason Statham does a good job as the lead. Perfect mindless summer movie fun right there. But there were several things about this movie I wasn't fond of: 
****Very Minor SPOILER BELOW****-Inconsistent CGI shark. Some scenes it looks great, in others the CGI is pretty terrible. -The sharks behavior is ridiculous. Worse than that shark in Jaws 4 that swam from New England to the Caribbean because it wanted revenge. Here the Meg sticks around our characters for no reason at all WHEN IT LITERALLY HAS THE ENTIRE OCEAN TO SWIM IN. At times they made it seem like a regular shark (attracted to movement or lights) but other times it was just portrayed as a psycho killing machine. Wouldn't a 75 foot shark just go find and eat some whales? Instead of going after like one puny human at a time? Hell at one point the shark goes after a little dog. It would be like if a lion went around eating ants, it's an inefficient food source that takes way to much energy for too little return. -The forced romance between Jason Statham and the Chinese scientist was weak. Their banter was annoying instead of cute. And the little girl scenes served no purpose at all. -This movie does what many movies are doing these days: Chinese pandering. The chinese scientist speak fluent english but at times switches to what I think is mandarin to talk to her father or daughter (both of whom also speak english fluently.) I know China is a huge market but do they really need to try to shoehorn in extra chinese stuff to make it more appealing to that market? This movie is not as bad as say The Cloverfield Paradox or Skyscraper, but still, it was annoying. If I was a chinese moviegoer I would be offended by such obvious pandering. -Too many fake outs where you think the shark has eaten someone or something only to find it just missed them and the camera angle the movie used was just misleading. This is a cheap trick, I consider it about as lame as jump scares.-Rainn Wilson (who I generally like) plays a weird billionaire guy who kind of seemed like the answer to the question ""What if Dwight Schrute became a billionaire?"" His action in this movie show him to be one of the dumbest characters in any movie ever. After he leaves the research station to pursue the shark, the sequence that follows is more like a shark hunt feature one of the 3 stooges. It was so dumb.-None of the character show fear or shock. No matter how crazy or traumatic things are they still engage in ""witty"" banter and jokes. (Please note the quote indicate that the banter and jokes are not actually witty.)Wow, so I've got this huge list of complaints and I'm still awarding a 6? Yes because the movie was stupid, yet fun. Like if sharknado had a good budget and decent actors. Recommended to: Moviegoers able to switch off their brains and people who are just naturally dumb.Not recommended to: People that can't overlook illogical behavior and marine biologists who know things about sharks.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In my humble opinion, a heavier lean in to the finite details found in science fiction often, and a darker spin on character development - where the characters are not simply dramatic for the sake of noise, but rather, allowing the absence of drama to fill a dark chasm of its own suspense, would have greatly benefited the outcomes in this film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is a film which doesn't take itself too seriously and mainly gets by on the charisma of Statham. The supporting cast are ok, however some of the characters are annoying and the attempted humour fell a bit flat for me. The Meg itself is obviously CGI but not offensive CGI so doesn't distract from the film. There are some thrilling sequences and the film passes by quite quickly.

Since then the genre has become a Hollywood favorite among audiences of cinema. Some honorable mentions are The Shallows and 47 Meters Down. While films like these may not be legendary by Hollywood standards (Jaws being the exception), they certainly make for great times at the movies. That being said, films like these are looked down upon for often being impractical in their presentation. If people are expecting to find realism in a film about unusually large sharks menacingly perusing helpless swimmers and sailors on boats they can easily turn over, they are looking for it in the wrong kind of film. This movie is visually stunning. Megalodon himself is larger than life to the point where he can't fit in the entire projection screen. It's direction and cinematography deserve recognition for the results are jaw dropping, or in Megalodon's case jaw crunching. Like all shark thrillers, this film's suspenseful entertainment value is primarily what it has going for it. Where it unfortunately lacks in introducing a cast of strong characters, it succeeds with providing audiences with enough jump scares and terrifying action sequences to satisfy their expectations. To repeat, any audience viewers hoping to find realism in The Meg's story, action, character decisions or the resolution for that matter, look for it somewhere else. Realism will never exist in creature horror films. Go watch The Meg with a positive state of mind, shut the brain off, enjoy what good it has to offer and remember what all the people involved in the project intended for it to be from the beginning which is a fun, exciting man vs. prehistoric beast flick that may leave beach visitors and boat travelers hesitant about going back out into the ocean again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nothing spectacular but alot of B-movie fun. FUN is the main ingredient here in The Meg.Actually a feelgood 90's style adventure with humour & exciting sense of wonder of the deep blue sea & it's mysteries.Jason Statham is now, pretty much an action legend & he's awesome here.Meg was way better than most big budget creature features lately like Jurassic world or the Pacific rim films & some Marvel & DC films in my opinion!!!I liked The Meg as it was exactly what i thought it was going to be but actually abit better with a nice little cast of characters i liked & a top lead role by the Awesome tough action hero Jason Statham.The Meg shark looked good, really good c.g.i & not cheap looking like most big budget movies & the detail was excellent on that shark & the action scenes was very intense & exciting in that summer Horror fun kinda way & also some nice little nods to the greatest Shark movie of all time, the Classic Jaws & it's sequels!!!I like most grew up watching & loving & being terrified by Jaws so this was a fun modern big budget summer shark movie & it did just that lots of fun with scary moments & comedy kinda like the excellent Lake Placid (1999) meg had that old school monster horror comedy mix up & it works perfectly & Statham is great here & he's having fun as well as doing lots of action he's actually funny here & a good tough action hero as always.There's nothing too violent or bloody so it's a fun adventure for the family too!!!Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor really is great i think this could be his best character yet? Jonas is a true hero, a good man who will always do the right thing when needed & would always put himself at risk to save you!!! He's a great movie character & i wish there was men like that out there for real? Maybe there is? Jonas really is a tough hero with balls of steel lol he will go face to face with anything even a 75ft megalodon!!! A real action hero.Yes just sit back & enjoy this big fun Action Horror comedy adventure movie, that's a thrilling monster movie & big budget B-movie & could sit nicely next to flicks like Godzilla,Deep Blue Sea, Anaconda,Lake Placid,Jurassic park films & others.Lots of big budget popcorn blockbuster fun, nothing more & nothing less.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film director had to work with a mechanical shark that always broke down, frustrating him and his crew for days. He had to resort for a great amount of time to a hidden great white shark lurking underneath the surface to create the suspense ""Jaws"" is noted for.The producers of ""The Meg"" had no such such problems with mechanical sharks and pleasure boats entering into frame. Today's computers have taken all the ""fun"" out of making shark movies. But ""Meg"" promises to be a rollicking good time as far as witnessing carnage showing a mammoth beast unleashed from a deep layer of warm ocean water causing havoc above the surface. Volumes have been written on ""Meg,"" but the opinion of this reviewer is don't expect deep philosophical insights or memorable monologues of the USS Indianapolis in WW2. This pix is simply a feast for the eye--even though green screening the beast is so evident in many hair-raising scenes. Think of John Huston's ""Moby Dick"" and you've got strong parallels between the two. Just buckle up for a frothy ride and maybe you'll like the results.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's got a giant shark, of course, it's got a big-name action star (Jason Statham), and it's got the big action scenes and special effects to match. The plot is something rather familiar; a giant shark thought to have been extinct emerges from the depths of the ocean and causes mass destruction. The trouble is that it doesn't do anything to stand out from the ocean of other blockbusters out there, but at least it's better than the thousands of Jaws rip-offs out there. In that respect, it's good enough to be memorable but also not bad enough to be memorable. However, it has a simple, predictable plot, but it has good visual effects and good action scenes. The shark particularly and all the high-tech facilities in the movie look good. That's all a movie like this needs. But for that matter, why not just watch Jaws?The thing that this movie will likely best be known for is the fact that it was the most successful movie thus far to be a co-production between an American studio and a Chinese studio. With the amount of movies Hollywood blockbusters have been making over there lately, that's something that could very well become a trend as studios try to tap into both of the world's two largest markets.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

By the time the show started the theatre was packed with people of all walks and ages. I had set the bar low based upon previews. I figured all the best gags would have been spoiled in the trailers and we would enjoy a couple surprise kitsch lines whiling away the hour and fifty three minutes. I was wrong. This movie actually has you on the edge of your seat right from the start. Opening scenes establish Stathoms background and the dangers of the deep. This isn't academy award fodder but the culmination of years of fun blockbuster style entertainment. It is directed by Jon Turtletaub who's last theatre work was Last Vegas 2013 and Sorcerers Apprentice 2010 then National Treasure series the latest one over ten years ago in 2007. This is better. He has us rooting for the good guys early on and when their in peril your paying attention. Riann Wilson of The Office plays an interesting character along with solid popcorn performances by Bingbing Li, Cliff Curtis and Winston Chao (Bingbing characters father) an actor who I think we will see a lot more of in North American box office. On that note, the now in her early thirties Ruby Rose whom I only began to notice in the John Wick movies is striking on screen. She does her assigned job here handling decent lines, I hope she will continue to evolve beyond the exotic character appearances to take on more demanding roles. I think she could hold an audience as a lead with a little 'less is more Steve McQueen' polish. The film pays homage to Jaws several times with familiar names, scenes and dialogue if you pay attention. Rainn was interviewed on late night tv and said everyone's goal was to make the second best shark movie of all time, and they did just that. These sorts of movies are what they are and this one's worth a theatre big screen if you can.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Meg isn't an amazing movie. It isn't marvel. It isn't a Blockbuster.
I really enjoyed it I was dubious after the trailer, showed all these implausible bits. But the movie tied then together. There's reasonable chemistry. There good action bits. I even jumped once or twice.

A huge portion of the changes are due to the fact that the book is sciency, and the movie is ""stupid summer blockbuster fun"" mixed with kissing the PRC's sphincter orifice. Yes, this movie was made in China, so it had to be changed to suit that regime's sensibilities, and to not annoy Winnie the Pooh. Thus, the heroes are mostly Chinese, except for the one Australian to be the ""White BadAss.""
Other changes are more blatant: the Japanese research scientist who was building a giant preserve and observational facility in California is now a dot-com scumbag business doofus who bought and build an oil rig somewhere in the Indian Ocean.From there, it goes downhill.That said, if you were to just look at this as completely unrelated to the series of novels that supposedly inspired the movie, and just look at it as dumb fodder movie, it is still a disappointing outing, with references and concepts that were 20 years out of date at the time the movie was made, with cliche's from the 1990s underwater movies like Leviathan, DeepStar 6, and Abyss, badly meshed with Jurassic Park movie troupes.The only thing I can really say anything favorable about is that the submarines that look like bubbles with wing-frames around them look pretty cool.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Stath (a.k.a. action star Jason Statham) stars as Jonas Taylor, a deep-sea rescue expert who has the death of friends & co-workers on his conscience. So he's turned to drink and seclusion, naturally. Still, he's the best chance to rescue some of the scientists from a massive underwater research base near Chinese waters. The culprit in the movie is the ""Meg"", short for Megalodon, an ENORMOUS prehistoric (and supposedly extinct) species of shark.You get what you expect with this kind of entertainment. Somehow sharks as animal antagonists always lend themselves to the cheesiest kind of movies (and special effects) imaginable. This is no different, really, despite the hefty Hollywood production values and the location shooting in New Zealand. You have standard-issue characters, some of whom are so excessively idiotic that you keep rooting for the monster to devour them. You have a VERY cliched script, full of bad, cornball dialogue.The film could have worked as sort of a grand-scale goof on such material, but as it is, the filmmakers, led by Jon Turteltaub (""National Treasure""), actually take themselves pretty seriously for a while. It's only near the end when they completely give in to true over the top nonsense, as the Meg finds a ton of brain dead expendable extras upon which to snack. Still, this movie IS entertaining: slickly made stuff that does manage to generate some great near-miss thrills. And the special effects here are actually not quite as terrible as you would think. But the movie probably would have kicked a little more ass had it not been neutered in the end in order to get a PG-13 rating (and therefore attempt to maximize profit).For the most part, The Stath does what he usually does, although he gets some opportunities to try some real acting. Bingbing Li is an enticing leading lady. Cliff Curtis (no stranger to aquatic creature features, having done ""Deep Rising"" previously) is typically solid as one of the smarter supporting characters, Winston Chao is good as Li's egghead father, and Shuya Sophia Cai is appealing as her daughter. Rainn ""Dwight Schrute"" Wilson has his moments as an unsubtle, obnoxious billionaire who you just KNOW is going to turn out to be truly odious.Enjoyable for what it is, but absolutely nothing special, it may still put a goofy smile on some peoples' faces.Six out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot is thin and predictable, the characters are bland and stereotypical, and the dialogue is cheesy and cringeworthy. The movie wastes the talents of Jason Statham, who plays a deep-sea rescue diver who has to save the day from a giant prehistoric shark called the Megalodon. Statham does his best to deliver some action and humor, but he is surrounded by a cast of forgettable and annoying characters, such as the egomaniacal billionaire (Rainn Wilson), the edgy tech genius (Ruby Rose), and the wacky comic relief (Page Kennedy). The only character that has some personality is the shark itself, which seems to have more intelligence and charisma than the human protagonists.The movie also fails to deliver on the genre thrills that it promises. The Meg is neither scary nor exciting, as the shark attacks are mostly bloodless and tame, thanks to the PG-13 rating. The movie does not have the tension or suspense of Jaws, nor the campy fun of Sharknado. The movie tries to balance between being serious and being silly, but ends up being neither. The movie also lacks any sense of originality or creativity, as it borrows heavily from other shark movies and monster movies, without adding anything new or interesting. The movie is full of cliches and tropes, such as the false jump scares, the heroic sacrifices, and the obligatory beach massacre.The Meg is a movie that should have been either more realistic or more ridiculous, but instead it is a bland and boring mess that does not satisfy anyone. The movie is not worth diving in, unless you want to waste two hours of your life watching a mediocre shark movie that has nothing to offer. The Meg is a huge disappointment for fans of Jason Statham, shark movies, and good cinema in general.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a movie it is unremarkable and only a bit fun. Actually, it's even less entertaining comparing to the Alten's summer trashy book as director doesn't quite achieve the execution. Movie feels like a missed opportunity because director doesn't deliver on anything that he promises (action/thriller/horror). The action scenes are very basic and predictable. Basically, movie doesn't push the envelope nearly as far as you will probably expecting. Not to mention it's dripping trite subplots and underdeveloped (and mostly irritating) characters. It's almost laughable as to how dumb most of these characters are, especially it's hard not to think as Li Bingbing's character makes some really questionable decisions given the fact that she is a single parent and the movie leans into that fact pretty heavily. Ultimately, ""The Meg"" sounds like it has all of the ingredients to make for an awesome shark movie, including Jason Statham (and wide international cast) plus a budget that actually means this big shark can be brought to life proper, yet the movie fails in almost every department, except CGI.Rating: 5+ (Average)","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Using the mix of real science and prehistoric monsters and good storytelling as a thriller in visual form would have been the stuff of nightmares.

The film is a by-the-numbers, almost tongue-in-cheek, nature-gone-wild adventure full of threatening sharks and all of the standard human characters (a reclusive pro haunted by his past, an idealist, a capitalist, a little kid, a couple of wise-cracking chums (in both senses of the word), geek-chic techie, etc). The script is mostly quips with a bit of exposition and some strained character development, and there are a lot of improbable, last-minute rescues. I didn't find the giant shark very interesting (a huge shark and a large boat looks about the same as a big shark and a small boat) and found the film's mix of action and humour awkward (especially Page Kennedy's constant shtick), with the tension constantly being undercut by comic-relief. The rest of the cast is fine (for what's expected of them), and Jason Statham is a good as always (playing essentially the same role as always). The film is about what you'd expect from a 'Jurassic Park meets Jaws', youth-oriented CGI-thriller: transiently entertaining but neither memorably good nor bad.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, they run into trouble (in the form of a giant, thought-to-be-extinct megalodon) and are stranded. A rescue is attempted and is successful. But on the way back to the surface, our band of interpret heroes / explorers is followed. What do you think it could be?My quick review of The Meg - Big dumb fun (quite a bit of it actually), but little else.My main problem is that just about every aspect of The Meg is predictable. Plot twists, character backstories, romance angles, the fate of Rainn Wilson's Morris - there are very few surprises. The most predictable thing, however, is (even though it's painfully obvious, I feel compelled to say SPOILER WARNING) the second meg. With at least 45 minutes of runtime left, who didn't see that coming? END SPOILER WARNING.I""m not overly familiar with Bingbing Li, but I want to see more. She's a legitimate bright spot in The Meg. As for Jason Statham, he's Jason Statham. You get what you expect. Rainn Wilson has some good moments (I especially enjoyed the Shark Week bit), but ultimately, he wears out his welcome and I wanted to see his character die. And could Sophia Cai be anymore cute? What a little actress!Special effects were hit or miss. Some of the meg close-ups were obviously CGI. However, the scene with the giant squid, for example, looked fantastic to me. Set design was nice. The underwater station looked appropriately ""cool"".5/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a U.S./chinese co-production that felt like a breath of fresh air in it's approach as it's closer to old B monster movies than most contemporary films in the subgenre. Obviously it's a big budget film and it doesn't belong to the department of silly movies with the likes of Piranha 3DD, but it isn't Jaws or Jurassic Park either (while obviously having taken notes from them).It's dumb in-the-water, out-of-the-water fun. I read a Jason Statham interview recently where he said that it was fun for once to be in a movie where he isn't running with a gun in his hand. I really liked Statham in this one as it felt like we got more out of him than usually, there's some genuine sweetness to his character here.The film has fared well at box-offices, you could probably even call it a surprise hit. For me, this is the kind of film I need to be in a certain free spirited mood to enjoy. I can't get myself to award it more than three stars out of five but I'd say that the movie does go to the recommendable territory.

I was hoping for a summer action-packed thriller, but instead this was a very boring and slow science fiction type movie. The acting was pretty bad also.

We then go to ""Shanghai, China, 5 Years Later"", where 200 mi. off the coast the Mana One Research Station is on the verge of scientific breakthrough, finding yet deeper ocean floors with new eco-systems never seen before. It's not long before something big, something really big is stirring up the pot. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of questions: this is the latest movie from director Jon Turteltaub, whose previous film was ""Last Vegas"". But more importantly, this is a joint US-Sino production, with Gravity Pictures as the Chinese partner. This movie is clearly aimed at the Chinese market with Chinese start Li Bingbing in one of the lead roles, and other Chinese performers also in the movie. Some of the non-action scenes are just cringe-inducing to watch, you can practically hear the director yell ""and... ACTION"". One of the great things of ""Jaws"", the gold standard of shark movies, is that the narrative matters a lot, and as it relates to the action, less is more. ""Jaws"" is outright terrifying. ""The Meg"" exactly 180 degree away from that. Why the CGI pictures at times are impressive, you never feel scared or worried, because the megalodon is never believable in the first place (75 ft, meaning 3 to 4 times the size of the great white in ""Jaws""). In other words, this is ""jaws on steroids"", but without the thrills. I have to say, I was really disappointed with this movie.""The Meg"" opened wide this past weekend and vastly over-performed at the box office ($45 mill, instead of the projected $25 mill). It will be interesting to see how it does next weekend, now that the word is out that this is a so-so movie. The (discount) Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great.

Among the crew is Morris (Rainn Wilson), the ex partner of Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), a renegade diver who may be the only one with the expertise to save them, leading a team of Marine experts, in what becomes a race against time against the Magadaloon, a giant sea mammal that sees humans as the ultimate prey.While the magic of the big screen may be designed to absorb the spectacular and the bombastic, especially with all the modern amenities that come with present day theatres, I've developed a nose for sniffing out the wheat from the chaff. I've got to sense something really going on beneath the surface to venture out to a cinema to see it, and alas, on its theatrical release, The Meg just failed to do this. Now I've caught up with it on Netflix, and while it's fine as a distraction piece, I think I made the right decision where to catch it.Jason Statham has always had a real 'take him or leave him' effect on me (although he was one of the main components of Snatch) and his inability to really create a solid type of genre staple really doesn't help, and so he never made it any more appealing. And that leaves us with the film itself, which is aesthetically pleasing, with some spectacular underwater visuals, shark effects and action sequences, but with wooden characters you never really care about, a stale, predictable script and a mounting sense of preposterousness, that's to be expected, but is nonetheless an issue.I'm glad I took my time getting round to this overlong, overblown but underwhelming Jaws tribute act. I've just learned a sequel's in the works. Heaven help us.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It stars Jason Statham, Li Bingbing, Ruby Rose from Orange is the New Black and John Wick Chapter 2, Rainn Wilson from The Office, Jessica McNamee, and Cliff Curtis.In 1997, Disney bought the rights for The Meg novel and was planning to adapt it into a film. After two failed attempts, the rights went back to Steve Alten, the author in 1999. New Line Cinema obtained the rights to The Meg in 2005, and planned on making a movie, however due to not having enough money, the rights reverted back again to Alten. Finally, in 2013, Warner Brothers acquired the rights to all seven of The Meg books.Scientists are exploring the bottom of the ocean, when they get trapped in their submarine. The team on land, seek out the help of Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), a rescuer, who has claimed before that something was in the water. They soon find out his claims were correct, when they encounter The Meg, a 75 foot long shark. A battle ensues between man and shark, while the action heats up.At the box-office, the movie made more money than originally projected. This is most likely due to the action and it being a little similar to another franchise.In the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World movies, the dinosaurs try to eat people, and in The Meg, the shark tries to eat people. Resulting in lots of action from beginning to end.The cinematography underwater looked real, while in fact it was all computer generated. All the action unfortunately leaves little room for character development. The Meg isn't as good as the Jurassic films but it's still a fun movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

'Jaws' obvsiouly nailed it and is considered the benchmark for all future shark movies, 'Deep Blue Sea' put in an above average showing back in the 90s, but ever since and in-between there have been a real void of good ones. I would call 'The Meg' above average, but still nothing game-changing or overly memorable in any way. It was a fen enough ride, but it played by the rules far too much to be anything special or memorable. The best thing this movie had going for it was the sheer size of the shark, and it did an excellent job of making sure the audience knew just how big this thing was. It also would be very hard to come out of this film feeling cheated, the shark makes an abundance of appearances. My problem with the film was that it all felt very predictable. Every character who you foresaw dying at the start did, and very character you foresaw living also did. There were no twists or shocking moments whatsoever in the film. When Jason Statham is chosen to be the one who goes in the water you can pretty much skip to the next scene because he is untouchable.I really liked the inclusion of Rainn Wilson in this film. He was probably the only member of the cast who managed to connect with me that I could get out any joy out of. The rest of the cast are very forgettable. I did enjoy 'The Meg' to a certain extent (I wouldn't have minded 20 minutes being cut out of it though to be fair) but I certainly wouldn't recommend people rush out to see it. There are far better films on offer.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What really ruined it for me was the heartlessness of it. Ill try to explain.The movie just has no vision or point; Its ""fun"" but if you only understood the word technically. Its weird cause theres scenes and moments that DID have a genuine feeling or idea that didnt feel like it was put together by an alien.Tone/mood moves around from lighthearted to dark an grotesque at random uneven intervals, weird shifts that cemented a feeling that, well, these people dont know what they're doing. Aparently there was a lot of studio interference, so that could explain stuff. But aside from that part, something else that really bugged me was that the megalodon stops acting like a giant predator fish. Theres a whole segment in the middle where it has a chance to do crazy damage! But instead the shark just. Stops.It basically starts acting like a normal shark movie and it feels like forced suspense. Things that logically would've happened already just, wont happen, cause, the script said so.It happens in silly pop corn fluff, i get it, suspension of disbelief is really necessary in this kind of movie. All this negative stuff just keeps piling up, and this is stuff thats in the heart of the experience, i cant ignore it. Characters are fine on their own. Some even have some really nice scenes, but overall, they arent given a lot to do, so a lot of characters deaths dont really resonate. And the ones that were suppoused to be satisfying felt tasteless or like nothing at all.Technically its good, its competent, its an expensive hollywood film that everythi g by the numbers well. Anything less than this would just be ridiculous. Im just dissapointed. This could have been really good fun, I wanted it to be fun. But it was just an artificial and boring mess.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In relation to the other shark movies this is done with really good special effects but I missed some original ideas. I mean all the rescue scenes we saw already in the last ones.Some turns and twists you see coming before but the director Jon Tourtletaub made a good job anyway. I liked Jason Stratham even if he is playing without great emotions. The Computer Generated Imagery saved in my opinion this thriller.If you liked this you may check out Deep Blue Sea with Samuel Jackson. Then of course don't miss the very first Jaws from director Steven Spielberg.It stays an average action thriller 5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a dumb shark movie with some good effects but the best bits depend on the inherent humour and repartee of the cast. Statham, in particular, is funny, sweet and sexy, all at the same time. Bingbing Li has a good presence and you feel a chemistry between them. That's true throughout the cast. The friendship of the characters are very apparent and that adds greatly to the loss. Some of the humour is brilliant. I won't spoil but the Finding Nemo quote had the cinema in hysterics. The little girl was cute but never annoying. The little visual jokes worked well and could bring me to watch it again, just to spot them. The submarines were cool, in a sort of 60s sci-fi sense. I loved the names of them, but that's just the geek in me. 
The cinematography in the early scenes, the underwater and deep sea stuff, was visually stunning. When the sub dropped the lights in the deep sea trench to reveal the multitude of weird creatures was superbly done. The twist when they caught the Meg was obvious but the way it was played for laughs made up for this, a bit.
I have to admit, I went to see this movie because I'd already seen the movies I wanted too. But it was a big surprise. Not just a dumb shark movie but a nicely crafted piece of work, carried by some rather good actors playing genuinely nice characters.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Humans do science, science releases monster, humans try to survive and battle monster. All you have to do then is sprinkle in some feelings and drama, add some special effects, and set it in an isolated location. Jason Statham is moody and dangerous central character, charged with saving the scientists from a Megalodon. This film isn't much to write home about, you've probably seen a similar film just with different monsters or cast members. There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours rather than endure the film, but after you've watched it you probably won't watch it again for a while, if at all. My opinion is that this is just average, middle-of-the-road, brainless escapism; there isn't much which stands out as exceptional - 5 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For this reason, much of the action is a mess of underwater CGI with unclear action and lots of cages, submersibles and boats flying around, above and below.With more Hollywood movies being Chinese funded, we are now seeing Chinese locations and actors shoehorned into plots. And for a film like The Meg, it's fine for exotic locations and makes little difference being mainly water based, but it chucked in some appalling actors whose English was weak and generally just seemed a bit random casting-wise.Statham is phoning it in with a hilarious quasi-american accent and takes ages to show up after the opening scene. But when he eventually gets going, he's fun, charismatic, and yes, he takes his top off lots.The supporting cast are all fairly meh, with maybe Ruby Rose being one of the stand out supporting actors, if only for her supremely 90s hair that gives the whole movie a very vintage B Movie vibe.With John Turteltaub directing I had higher hopes for this movie as I love the National Treasure Films. But it does have it's plus sides. For one, the score is Harry Gregson Williams, whose soundtrack elevates this film massively.There are actually a couple of good action sequences and fun moments. The humour doesn't always land, but the Meg is definitely not taking itself seriously and is obviously referencing those 90s B Movies like Deep Blue Sea and Deep Rising, rather than thinking it's making the next Jaws.The biggest problem with the film is it's reluctance to kill off people. When there's quite a large ensemble of largely disposable and forgettable supporting actors, surprisingly few people die. And it's obviously dialled down the gore to appeal to kids.And that's the problem - this film could have been awesome if it had embraced the 80s / 90s B Movie violence and focused on cool kills and crazy violent set pieces. But instead it opts for people leaping on and off boats and nearly being grabbed by the outlandishly massive shark. It's heavy on CG and feels like a wasted opportunity for practical effects.At 2 hours long this film is best enjoyed on the tv at home dual-screening with snacks.Its not the 3 star disaster most are saying, nor is it 8 star awesome. It's just 6 star yeah that'll pass two hours and is just OK.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They're many, they're egregious, and they're consistently front and center. The biggest flaw for me is its truly terrible script; it's like the screenwriters weren't even trying here. (At one point we see a character simply grunt a response to another during an exchange, as though the screenwriters were too disinterested to write a line of dialogue.) The movie's other weaknesses include the occasionally spotty CGI and some head-scratching science.With all of that said, however, I still had fun with ""The Meg."" (The title refers to a prehistoric shark called megalodon, which our protagonists inadvertently release from a newly discovered deep-sea trench.) I'd rate it a 6 out of 10 because it was a fun enough summertime monster movie. It's clunky stuff, but it's passably enjoyable lowbrow entertainment for fans of creature features.I like Jason Statham too. (This is the first film I've seen him in since 2004's ""Cellular."") He certainly isn't a bad actor, even if his lines in this film should have had him inwardly cringing. He's got presence and charisma.I'm not sure I would actually recommend ""The Meg,"" but I didn't hate it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I watched the movie last night and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had gone to watch the film after reading the reviews here and for once even I had decided to drop the plan and save my money for an another film after seeing 2 stars in a row.Most people here have taken it out on this film because they probably set the ""Jaws"" or ""Jurassic Park"" as the benchmark here. I haven't watched Jaws and the only movie that I was expecting this film to do better than or atleast be at par with is ""Deep Blue Sea"". I have watched deep blue sea around 4 times now and I love that film. When I saw the rating of that film which is 5.8, I decided to watch this film and this further reinforced my belief that ratings many a times betray our individual liking of a movie.Most people are complaining about the misplaced humour in this film but even that didn't turn me off, the reason being that story of the film is engaging,there are no dull moments and shark scenes are on the money and amount of Gore has nothing to do with the thrill the Gigantic Shark(s) in the movie managed to create. I do admit that this film could have been better if the characters were shown gripped with fear and the chaos that could have emerged if the underwater establishment was shown falling apart, but despite all its flaws and for what its worth, it most definitely is a one time watch.

Strangely enough, the last Statham film I'd seen in theatres, Mechanic Resurrection, also had him running to Thailand after the opening scene. Funny coincidence. Anyway, after an exploration through the bottom of the Mariana's Trench goes awry, Taylor is pulled right back in to rescue the explorers, and winds up becoming the ace in the hole for the scientists and explorers of the underwater research facility,'Mana One' when the Meg gets out and becomes the new terror of the sea.Despite some fun sequences and some decent visuals (especially underwater), The Meg is a half-baked end to the summer blockbuster season. I think part of the problem is its PG-13 rating. This could have been the Piranha 3D of shark films, especially where the beach sequence is concerned (which could have one-upped the Spring Break massacre scene in the Piranha remake if only the creators and the financiers behind The Meg were willing to go all the way).Alas, what we got was a relatively tame film in the veins of Jurassic World with a moderate body count and some of the dumbest, most hilariously idiotic helicopter pilots I've witnessed onscreen in quite a long time. It also has a middle-of-the-runtime twist that feels implausible and weak that I won't spoil for you, but you'll know it when you see it, because it only reinforces the implausibility of what had already gone on, and stretches it well into unbelievable territory.No matter. I laughed. I was entertained, and that's what's really important, right?

I've read reviews where they just tear this thing apart, saying how unscientific and inaccurate this film is. 
This is a film where you leave your baggage at the door on your way in. 
Don't take it seriously and just enjoy the ride. 
The special effects are actually very good, and it builds tension. There's also a few jump scares that had me jumping from my seat. 
I actually like to think that perhaps the Megolodon still swims the deepest parts of our ocean. This movie brings it to the surface in a fabulous way!
I call it 'popcorn rntertainment' because that's exactly what it is. 
Accept it for what it is, and I guarantee you'll have as much fun as I did. 
I'll be heading back to see it again. 
The Megolodon lives!!!
Cheers.

"5","/10","Could have been Jaws for a new generation.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4463099/?ref_=tt_urv","starcrowq3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5455940/?ref_=tt_urv","17 November 2018","Im a fan of Steve Altens books which this movie is based on. I went to the cinema almost knowing what to expect, but still hoping for it not to be true. But the only things this movie has incommon with the books is it's name, character names and small bits and pieces of the first books story. And that's all to be honest. This movie by it's name and what it's based on could have been a real cult classic if done right. It should have been aimed to be a modern Jaws like horror, action, thriller mix. Instead it seems like the studio chickened out to be frank, and went the opposite direction which made it feel flat, uninspired and more of a comedy.
The source material is so great, because it has great characters and scary situations that's stuff of nightmares. Here they are sadly missing all of it! Like the main characters struggles from being at the top to hit rock bottom and then come back out of life crisis in dozens to be our hero. Not our perfect hero, but a tough almost at the brink of a breakdown hero. His way of making icecold decisions when life is at stake to rise up from the grave is so sadly missing here it's sad. Also his partner Mac's story is like written for an actor to aim for an Oscar award much like the Quint character in Jaws. if nailed to the teeth that is. In the movie these characters feels like Disney versions. And oboy they do all kind of stupid decisions, which makes it feel so rushed it's unbelievable and pure stupid. In the books everybody working around the MEG is on top of their respected line of duty. Here they feel like they wanted to be sharkfood. And when somebody dies we just move on as nothing has happened, could work if we the audience could feel the desperation of the characters needing to rush on without looking back untill it's over. But here we really don't feel anything both toward the victims or their friends. Because they are soulless !
And let's talk about the main story, the MEG here without spoilers. Here it's so over done so it never ever gets scary! In the book it feels like it balance between thriller suspence to pure gore. It's both haunting and nervwrecking. But in the movie you feel nothing at all, nothing at all! And that's just silly in my opinion. Jaws from 1975 feels even today scarier then this. Even if you see it as an popcorn action adventure movie it's just not enjoyable. As a Steve Alten fan, it doesnt matter if im glad for Steve that this was made finaly, when the finished product is so far from his work.
Sometimes it's better to let it be if not done correctly in my honest opinion. Pushing something just to be made, is just not good. And i hope he feels the same honestly, so he get them to not do the same mistake for his other books.
Did the PG rating end up being too important? Well then you didnt believe in the source material to begin with!
So to some good points instead. I liked the look of the first 30mins of the movie. The underwater lab looked pretty good aswell as some of the under water scenes. The shark looked great in some scenes but really bad in others. I didnt mind that the MEG didnt follow the look as in the books. But then again it wouldent have made it worse if it did, as it has it's purpose both scientific aswell as making it's whereabouts known iconic. So maybe a missed oppertunity again?
All in all this movie is lacking alot of suspence and get's pretty boring because of it. It never builds up a momentum enough for anything exciting or scary through out the movie. Jason Statham does what he can, but feels cheesy at times but he does it okeyish. The others are so over the top or one-dimensional it feels like bad acting, meanwhile it could have just been bad directing or writing?
I give this movie 5 stars just because it's not the worst movie in history, and i got to eat some popcorn atleast.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I expected the movie to be cheesy and went in like looking for a fun, nonsensical time. However, there are some unexpected chase scenes and revelations from the characters. Of course, the movie falls to stereotyping frequently and most of the time, the plot is just plain ridiculous. But that is all to be expected of a movie like this. I've read THE MEG novel and found the movie to be a lot goofier, but it still had the same summer action fun. Ultimately, if you enjoy senseless action with a dash of character development and can swallow some stereotypes, you will enjoy THE MEG!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Meg starts well, laying the necessary suspense foundations so that you have the necessary interest not to abandon the film halfway through. Statham is an action star, it's clear that we won't ask him for the performance of his life. Still, he manages to deliver the charisma of a hero. The performances of the rest of the cast are quite flat, some of them carrying the banner of victim of the monster from the beginning.The script doesn't worry about many logical things, it just delivers aquatic suspense, a couple of decent CGI images and we stop counting.After this, you have to admit that it almost worked for them. While The Meg isn't a good movie, I don't think it's a failure either. There are entertaining parts, there are scenes that amaze you and in the end, that is the purpose of the film. The most notable thing could be the soundtrack, which always fits the scenes it wants to complement.Anyway, this is a Sunday afternoon movie, so you don't have to pay so much attention to it and start planning for the next week.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With the help of Jonas played by Jason Statham, he must rescue the scientists from the deep waters as well as kill the megalodon before it reaches the shore.I went into this movie blindly and I found I was...a bit divisive towards it. There are good qualities as well as bad, obviously. One thing I liked about it was that it was on the more silly side. Yes, this movie was pretty campy and B-grade, (despite the multi-million dollar budget) but they know it and embrace it. The look of the sharks tend to resemble the ones from Jaws, which seems to be a stylistic choice, and I like it. I found the characters surprisingly entertaining and likable. Jason Statham, for example plays a fearful man who has a habit of leaving at the wrong time. I also really liked the chemistry between the characters.Of course, I do have my problems with this movie, given its rating. The movie seems to divide itself in two parts, which I found to be a bit lazy through a writing perspective. I know I sound like I'm nitpicking, but I can only say this without spoiling it. Another problem I have is towards the third act. I don't like how there's a large chunk of time that's focused on small, minor characters. It just feels like that's a bit of a time-water for the most part. I do understand that they want to give side characters some time in the spotlight, but they really do spend too much time on them in the long-run.Despite my criticisms, I still had a mostly good time watching it, and I feel like shark movie enthusiasts would too.6/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Meg is not the film they either read on the page or filmed as a course of grisly schlock entertainment. This was meant to be a proper schlocker, a bloodletting monster of the deep on the loose picture, sadly the suits at the helm didn't see that as a viable money making exercise and had this cut to be a ""12"" friendly bums on theatre seats cash grabber. Shame on them.What we get is a run of the mill creature feature that although once viewed does not leave a lasting impression (was anyone really hoping for that anyway?), but is kind of fun in that time filling sort of way. It runs through the modern day creature feature playbook 101. So off we go with the hero having a troubled backstory, a money made funder out of his depth, ladies with life quandaries, a man who can't swim working in the middle of the ocean! and on we go. Throw in some quite awfully scripted dialogue and it's cheese sarnie time.Statham is nearly always a good watch - in the muscle bound action hero kind of way - though you see the cracks between what the film was meant to be and what it ended up as. For you see that The Stath comes off as taking it all too seriously, which in this released cut is ridiculous. He's surrounded by no mark actors, though no short supply of beauty (Bingbing Li socko gorgeous/Ruby Rose hard sexy) and the narrative feeds us all the pointers of exactly where this will end up. There's a couple of nifty fun homages to Jaws, some decent suspense scenes, and the cinematography (Tom Stern) is pin sharp and pleasurable.Best bet to enjoy this is to know it's a ""12"" rated friendly piece, to understand it has ultimately ended up as a same old same old monster movie. It's a million miles away from the class of Jaws, and lacks the tongue in cheek knowing of Deep Blue Sea, but it fills a gap in that undemanding time wasting way. 5/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

1.CGI was used to often and as expected, was off. In one scene the mouth is big enough to take down a whale, in another scene the mouth was not too much bigger than Jaws(which was 25ft not 75ft like Meg). In some scenes the CGI was just a par above Sharknado. Deep Blue or Shallow Water did much much better effects with a portion of the budget. It is sad that a movie made 43 years ago has a more realistic shark.2. Acting, Statham plays the EXACT same role and emotions whether it is Transporter, Crank or Two Stocked Barrels. You get what you get. BingBing Li went to Kristen Stewart/Kneau Reaves school of acting, had the same face at beginning of movie, when she is talking technical jargon or when daughter in danger or almost dying....no change or ability to show emotions. 3. Director: I will avoid this director. When people have someone close to them killed by a prehistoric shark, they do not make stupid one-liners two scenes later which actually is only an hour after the death. Just because it was probably two weeks between the scenes in filming, director and actors have to remember that someone just died and I should be showing anger or sadness not making a one-liner about someone's hair. Next point, no one ever really seemed scared regardless of situation.4. Writing: A shark taking down 50ft whales and yachts would not notice, care, or see a human. No one reports or posts on social media that they saw a prehistoric shark? No one calls for backup? No one says 'let's get off the water? How do people mostly with phd's not know basics of science? Writing/screenplay just all over the place.In end, I watched a big-budget Sharknado.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I had fun watching this. It's not quite the usual Jason Statham movie, which is a good thing because it's nice to be reminded that he CAN be more than Big Dumb Fun Action Hero #3, but it's also not a huge departure as he still gets to do the Statham Scowl and he still gets to be the Action Hero Guy. I do kinda wish I'd been able to go see it at the cinema, but I'm not that financial...The supporting cast are decent enough, and I really appreciate that the Token Black Guy wasn't the first guy to die. I ALSO thought they did a pretty damn good job on the shark, tbh. Granted, it wasn't particularly true to life for how a Meg would actually look and behave, but it was still pretty true to how most Big Sharks would behave, it was still fast and cunning, and it was still pretty intimidating.It's also a FAR better shark movie than Black Demon or The Requin, so there's that.All in all it's probably never going to go down as a classic of cinema history, but it's a lot of fun if you let it be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This isn't a film to sit and analyse. This isn't a film to give any amount of time to review properly. Instead, it's to be enjoyed as the dumb monster movie without the added weight of all that nonsense Oscars-stuff like character arcs and plot it wants to be. Since this film has been in development since 1996, maybe it's feeling like my granddad and is just too damn old to care anymore.Since this is a Chinese co-production (one of the six (no, seriously, six!) production companies is based in China), the film attempts to woo the ever-growing market - the main female character is played by the Asian film-award winning Li Bingbing and the shark goes on the climactic hunt at Sanya Bay. That's not to say it's a bad thing, but this film seemed to do it so well compared to other recent attempts to get a big Hollywood-like Chinese film industry off the ground (The Great Wall comes to mind).If you start watching it expecting it to be (or think it wants to be) the next Jaws, Deep Blue Sea or Sharknado, you're going to be bitterly disappointed. When all is said and done, The Meg is a refreshingly unpretentious and polished B-movie offering good campy fun to those who seek that and only that.Best Quote: ""I CAN'T SWIM!

A lot of things about it are bad, the dialogue, the story, the characters... BUT enjoyable because they are bad in a good way. The movie knows nobody will take it seriously so instead of going on the comedy side, it goes towards the cheesiness route. Does it make any sense?One-liners, Jason Statham playing himself, cute kid, wrong exploration experiment, stupid billionaire, the movie checks all the marks. And it does so in a fun way. I actually didn't want the movie to end. It felt like the stakes weren't higher enough and they escalated at every moment but never quite reached the global threat.Even the first part of the movie where you don't see the megalodon is intense. Don't compare it with other movies. Watch it for the shark and for the badass troubled hero.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When these expectations are cleared away, then the movie becomes much more enjoyable.Story: The story is simple, but very convoluted. There is no relation to the initial incident and the mega shark later. The story lines are full of stereotypes. For example, the movie has only one black actor, and the role talks a lot and also scared by everything easy, and the role is also someone more suitable to serve rather than lead (think about butler and not Shaft!). This is in alignment with the general opinion of that country.Cinematic: Nice! Movie is well filmed, actions are all well choreographed, and sequences are well defined. Color is amazing! Every aspect of the cinematic is well done.Actors: That's the only good thing about this movie, except the cinematic, Jason & Bing Bing saved the movie. Jason showed is common acting, as a man of action. While, Bing Bing's acting was very measured and well done, she's avoided common things that many actress in that do to please the men. Of course, she could not have sex in that movie, the country folks wouldn't like it, but they hinted it. Anyway, I'm a big fan of these two actors and they didn't disappoint.In conclusion, good action movie, but watch it with a filter glass so that you can ignore all the nuisances that come with a movie from there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Apparently, the gory scenes were cut to make it ""suitable for children"" (a disturbing notion in itself). I view this as the Hollywood crowd trying to grab a bit more cash while reducing the potential quality - and ironically the potential revenue - of this movie.That being said, the story is a bit flimsy and the dialogue is rather weak but it is not entirely clear if this is due to certain scenes having been cut. I feel sorry for the actors involved that it turned out this way. Still, the movie is enjoyable and I would certainly recommend watching it as long as you don't expect this to be the next Jaws.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It also incorporates bits and pieces of other genres and water films. The result is an effective updating of the Jaws legacy. The hero, Jason Statham, is carloads of crazy brave, and of course, there is always the romantic interest; in this case a very brave Asian woman with a child. One scene with the child was reminiscent of The Shining, when the little boy is cycling down the isolated hall. You know something bad is going to happen.And that is the problem of the film. Despite great action sequences, you already know who is going to live, and who will be potentially killed off. You know the hero, his love interest and the child will survive. This is not a spoiler; you will guess this in the first ten minutes of the film. It is this predictability that limits the effectiveness of the movie.The arrogance of wealthy Chinese getting married on a yacht is particularly annoying as well. People are getting killed, and they are worried about some spoiled little mutt. I was rooting for Meg to destroy their yacht and eat all the people on it.All in all, an entertaining flick, particularly if you are able to see it in IMAX with the full special-effects seats that make you part of the action (not advised for older adults with any back issues). A fun date movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Aside from the rest of the lack of realism in this movie (deep sea dwelling creatures surviving at surface levels) sharks are always portrayed as monstrous killing machines. The shark would no longer have an appetite after that. It would be resting and digesting these enormous meals instead of tearing through the ocean destroying boats and attacking anything in sight. I thought the CGI and the shark were really breathtaking overall. I was really disappointed they made it into an unrealistic killing machine. At some point, please get animal behavior right. As a side note, the acting could have been much better.

The Indian version had a lots of blurs cuts and beeps but still it was entertaining. Jason Stathom is good and so is the rest of the cast. CGI was at par with any popular CGI movie and it also had some really scary moments. Overall tone though was retained to be light which was good in a way. No doubt it could have been better in lots of aspects. Could have given 7 but compensating for the haters lesser scores.","17 out of 42 found this helpful.

When a deep sea dive into the Marianas Trench goes awry, Taylor is called in to rescue the stranded crew, which just so happens to include his ex-wife. Reluctant at first, (as a result of a rescue mission five years prior in which two men were left to die) Taylor soon discovers a Megalodon to be responsible for the attack on the submersible. Originally attached to direct the film was horror maestro Eli Roth, who dropped out of the project due to creative differences. Roth, best known for his schlock horror flick Hostel (2005), is a filmmaker notorious for depicting hyper violence on screen, and yet The Meg features barely any gore at all. Instead, victims of the Megalodon are comedically swallowed whole; a far cry from Quint's brutal demise in Jaws (1975) or any of the ridiculously gruesome deaths in B movie excellence Deep Blue Sea (1999). Whereas The Meg doesn't have the riotous gore of Deep Blue Sea or the heightened suspense of Jaws, it proudly sits more comfortably within the league of low budget shark movies you'd find on the Syfy channel, except with a much larger budget backing it and an A list star front and centre. Statham is, as always, a likable screen presence and the supporting cast are all completely serviceable, but not particularly memorable. The Meg knows exactly what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything different. It's certainly cheesy, but it's without a doubt a lot of super-sized fun. There are five installments in Atlens Meg series, (including a prequel novella) meaning there is plenty of source material to provide the basis for a film franchise in the same vein as the ever hilarious Sharknado series (2013-2018), which concludes this year with its hotly anticipated sixth installment. Although there isn't anything new to be found within The Meg, it is still an enjoyable watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I took it for what it was, a loose rendition of a book. The main basics were there and yes, I am very easily entertained. The original book was published 21 years ago and concepts of it have changed; if Steve Alten had written it now, would the story be more like the present book or more like the movie? The answer is unknown. I'm happy that the book has such a great following, yet my love of the book is the reason why I wanted to see the movie... I wanted to see the Megalodon come to life before my eyes. The movie did just that, and it was amazing and scary and fun to watch. My head was still reeling from seeing the Megalodon come to cinematic life.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If it's something intellectual that you're after, then your choice should be ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" or ""Capernaum"".As for ""Mickey"", I recognized it because ""Weird Al"" Yankovic spoofed Toni Basil's original song (his version was ""Ricky"", about ""I Love Lucy"").","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was never bored during the film, but it's just not going to be memorable because it was not over the top or stupid enough to be remembered. I'm not saying it has to be like Sharknado, but it would have benefited with more cheese and insane action. I liked Jason Statham as Jonas, even though he's a generic action hero. Bingbing Li is terrible though, she has no emotion in her lines and is extremely flat. She was included to pander to the Chinese and Asian market.The CGI is really good, and the action is exciting, so I would recommend you to watch this, the story is shallow but expected. It just could have been so much better if it didn't take itself so seriously. One other complaint is that it should have been rated R, there was hardly any violence and it had a good setup for a bloody finale, but since it was PG-13 we missed out big time. Way better than Jurrasic World Fallen Kingdom..","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jonas is played by Jason Statham, I'm not a fan of him to honest, I find his tough guy roles very one dimensional. Meg is a stupid looking shark that roars (drrrr!) and the CGI effects are far from special, in fact this silly film is nothing more than a glorified Sci-Fi Channel flick.

It's not even overly silly (well, until the third act), and while it's sometimes tongue in cheek with its references and humour, it keeps a consistent tone throughout that allows for chuckles and suspense. The cast are all entertaining, too. Saying that, it is very generic stuff that's quickly forgettable and the fact that Jason Statham is just Jason Statham sort of takes away from some of the believability.

"7","/10","Jason Statham vs. Megalodon","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4289380/?ref_=tt_urv","Condemned-Soul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24275317/?ref_=tt_urv","17 August 2018","Jason Statham stars in this genre hybrid of science fiction, action, and horror, which is the perfect vehicle for someone of Statham's calibre. He commands the screen with his usual gruff charm, performing typically heroic feats that is expected based on his filmography history and stunt performer tendencies, while stepping above his lesser-known stars as they amiably contribute in his shadow. 'The Meg' delivers the cheese in bite-sized chunks, never threatening to engulf the film in waves of B-movie nostalgia and never hindering sequences that step over the plausibility line; and therefore not hurting the experience. The film's budget and rating mean the megalodon never dares to run amok through an understandable fear of falling foul of box office expectations and younger audiences' stomachs. Jon Turteltaub oversees proceedings with a measured eye, instilling enough suspense within a series of fun set-pieces to offset any deficiencies in character drama.It's been a long time coming to see a believable 75-foot prehistoric shark on film outside of documentary recreations or low-budget shockers generating cheap versions or enlarging stock footage, and so 'The Meg' - with its reported £150 million budget - earns crowd awes at the sheer size of the monster in this film: a shark sporting a jaw size that could swallow you whole, and teeth as large as your hand. The director perfectly captures fleeting glimpses in the early stages to keep audiences eagerly awaiting the moment its full size is visible, and then once it is completely revealed, the cinematography is expertly done to show the appropriate scale of the beast. Whether it's a large fin protruding from the water, an overhead shot showing it swimming underneath oblivious holidaymakers at the beach, or snapping away ferociously at the star with a fantastic angle on its overall mass against a human, the visual effects are top quality.Overall, 'The Meg' is worth watching. It is nothing memorable that necessarily warrants repeat viewings, but its simple story lays the foundations for many taut shark attacks, close shaves, and near escapes for the cast. The music score is effective, the visual effects are strong, and the B-movie thrills are confidently assembled. There's some science to back up the reasons of the supposedly extinct shark's sudden re-emergence into history books, but the main draw of this sci-fi horror is basic and compelling: How will action star Jason Statham defeat a megalodon? That alone is worth the price of admission. 7.5/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I really feel that people were taking this film way too seriously. It was fun, entertaining, & worth every penny. I had anticipated it's release for months. As I huge fan of Alten's books I could not wait any longer. I saw it twice in theatres & have watched it many more times at home. The entire family has gotten a lot of enjoyment out of The Meg. I am impatiently awaiting the 4K release with deleted scenes and hopefully a gag reel. Ruby Rose was impressive. Stathom and Wilson were on pointy with their performances. It's a movie about an enormous prehistoric shark that ascends from the ocean's floor to wreak havoc on anyone it comes in contact with. How could that not make for a fun time at the movies?

A lover of the Jaws franchise, I immensely enjoyed this action-packed thriller. Jon Turteltaub's work is right up there with Spielberg's in the way of three important elements:
 
1. Excitement
2. Nervous tension
3. Humor
 
Three research scientists are stranded in a submarine in the deep--below 11 meters. Jason Statham (Jonas) is approached for his expertise in rescue missions, and because he is only one in three who have attempted and survived one at that depth; five years earlier, Jonas saved all but one passenger on his ship in a similar situation. Now, Jonas is busy living and drinking the life in Thailand, and living with survivor's guilt, so he is reluctant to have any part of this assignment.
 
Until he learns that this mission involves his ex-wife. Until he hears the cries of the three scientists.
 
The Meg doesn't hesitate to propel us into action sequences right from the start. The rush of adventure is high and heart-stomping. One of my favorite scenes is the moment we get our first close-up of the prehistoric shark. Little girl Meiying ( Sophia Cai ) is playing in the underground facility when the shark pulls itself all the way up to the glass--you get a full picture of its face, and the magnitude of it is captivating!
 
There are plenty of moments with the Meg, something I appreciate, both up close moments--you know, the expected jump scares--as well as distant shots of its fin fishtailing (yes, I said it) through the ocean in swiftly nearing proximity to a large cast of characters.
 
To offset some of the intense moments, we get wordplay between several of the characters, creating fun endearing moments that build on the dynamics of multiple relationships.
 
Bonus: Meiying is super precious and wonderful to watch in her interactions with her mom and Jonas, eliciting lots of smiles and tender laughter.","13 out of 31 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A would-be underwater ""Jurassic World"" that revitalizes the US-China film deal","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4458687/?ref_=tt_urv","FelipeCarrillo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61617922/?ref_=tt_urv","14 November 2018","Diving into the deep sea, Warner Bros. and Gravity Pictures release their latest Hollywood's big seasonal blockbuster. A prehistoric monster that is madly swallowing millions dollars because of three keystones: the first, of course, is the commercial hook a gigantic shark means in any cinema in any country around the world; the second, the ""great cultural diversification"" among the crew and cast in, from afar, an American-bodied mega-production, still, however, according to the box office results, it was enough for Chinese audiences to reward it with a boffo gross; and finally, Jason Statham, who claims his action-hero crown after kicking hundreds of asses as ""Deckard Shaw"" from longtime ""Fast & Furious"" film series and ""Rick Ford"" from Paul Feig's ""Spy,"" two fabulous scowling characters that makes him an unfailing A-list movie star in the States. Pulling the gimmicks together wisely and promoting them worldwide freshly and genuinely, there was no doubt they were being cooking a powerful smash hit up, satisfying the less stringent moviegoer's guilty pleasures via an unapologetically over-the-top American blockbuster that never attempts to go above and beyond what it really is: a thoroughgoing popcorn finisher for the most flamboyant, unprejudiced film season of the year, B-movie entertainment of overwhelming visual magnitudes by dint of magnanimous visual effects, with charismatic enough characters to make up for the screenwriting inconsistency and dizzyingly clumsy narrative growing exponentially as the movie runs. Go and buy your ticket, then your snacks, lay back and relax, shut your brain off and get in the malevolent jaws of this B-movie giant-shark crowd-pleaser floating above Michael Bay's film style.Erich Hoeber, Jon Hoeber and Dean Georgaris, adapting freely ""Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror,"" the first of a sci-fi novel series from American writer Steve Alten, pen a script devoid of any iota of soundness. With an artificially effective opening, the material is moderately convincing for non-connoisseurs, of course, until sanity fades and Hollywood spectacle take its place. This film is simply a big-budget 2 hour-long action/adventure exercise that wants you to have a blast, only that.In ""The Meg,"" the situations are absurd and ludicrous, tightening storytelling to a minimum; so, the first minutes in, hands up! The fun has started. It becomes pointless to analyze the script of a brainless big-budget film of this kind, where overly ambitious entertainment comes first. Picking up some defending animal and environmental welfare messages along this chaotic amalgam, it also deals with one moral dilemma put on the main character and a few underdeveloped political questions that come up to only be devoured by rogue waves. By and large, it's little more than an inanely gaiety, senselessly thrilling survival ride.Strategic business or not, it severely differs from the adventure found on the pages written by the New York Times Bestselling author, swapping blood-filled attacks and raw scenarios for lighter sequences and humorous deaths which are as frustrating as amusing. Posters and official trailer as evidence to say much of the story takes place far away from shore, a matter commercial advertisements kept hidden at all cost and shattered the hopes of many for a giant-sized ""Piranha 3-D,"" for an in-your-face big-budget splatterfest. The provocative savagery betokened from opening sequence takes place just in the last quarter of its running length, savagery quickly transmuting gracefulness. The long-gestating screen adaptation works out quite well this way; however, it once again exposes the growing studio tendency to attract a broader mass of viewers via ""unjust misleading advertising;"" just to be clear, this isn't as serious as ""Crimson Peak,"" ""Spring Breakers"" or ""Suicide Squad"" marketing cases, because they only embraced the movie's fun and self-effacing tone, counterbalancing it with bold action and horror elements and putting them into the trailer. This time, despite drowning many fans who dreamed of an R-rated version, it shocked box office analysts. They're going to swim even quicker; get ready for a new franchise.Statham's Jonas Taylor has an offbeat hero design for today's action genre, as they try to put on the usual layers of rudeness and heartlessness a few drops of morality and psychology that provide an insufficient yet favorable substance all over this delightful mess. There is no shortage of the habitual heroism that allows him to get minimally hurt from impossible feats; even so, the most unbelievable feature about this character is, just like his last two best roles, the ability to get rid of the prototype for a few seconds. In sum, Taylor is light years away from Ethan Hunt, but he could neither be sitting next to The Rock's Mitch Buchannon. Moreover, Jason Statham handles the movie excellently. The actor has been known for carrying his projects off, thus, his presence alone makes the viewer keep interested and invested if you even know who is going to die. Classic over-the-top action moments, hilarious one-liners and gratuitous shirtless scenes making up a fantastic popcorn film are also there.This is a calculatedly produced, sold piece of entertainment and China also gets a good slice, it's called Bingbing Li. Suyin, a single mother who doesn't hesitate to do the unthinkable to save the lives of his crew, is the utter blend between warrior and damsel in distress, she portrays a self-contained woman with gusto and infuses just the right amount of romance and melodrama. Matching powerful female empowerment and diversity growing in all the American filmmaking fields, it's good to see two titles starring foreign actors topping the box office charts in the US and China (""Crazy Asians Rich"" and ""The Meg"") and a couple of others with dissimilar dividends ( ""A Simple Favor,"" ""Searching"" and ""Mile 22""). These kinds of co-productions are the first steps that open new ways for audiences willing to expand their modern cinematic bias, a plan about to take off.Here there is only one ""antagonist"" - from the prey-predator point of view, - however, the script toys with a kind of villain, an object more than a subject of little value for the plot, he's the perfect target to say witless jokes and catching the movie's cause-and-effect morality. Rainn Wilson holds the character up over an hour, a business-hungry billionaire whose funding has built the oceanic research station called Mana One; his helicopter arrival, wearing Nike Air shoes, speaks volumes. His character is just the guy who gets what gives, an insignificant addition that could have gone unnoticed if it hadn't been for Wilson's endeavor.There is no denying Warner deftly crafts its pictures. This sumptuous C.G.I. fanfare could be the finest you'll see in a movie theater from a killer big fish blockbuster. Grant Major's production design is gargantuan, concordant with its gigantic budget ($130 million), creating a visual magnificence that propels and defends its nature: big, dumb action film.""Changeling"" Oscar-nominated cinematographer Tom Stern, who also worked in Clint Eastwood's Academy Award-winning ""American Sniper,"" provides truly gorgeous frames for modern Hollywood scene, of course, the portentous 100-tonne prehistoric shark is useful to get this freshness. On the face of it, perhaps ""The Meg"" typifies American summer blockbuster, but even so, Stern gives it a special push, an arresting digital will. The ocean, imposing and immeasurable, is quite reserved along the first act, focusing on introducing the ultra-modern underwater research facility where much of the story takes place fluently; however, accompanied by a couple of huge surprises, this is the perfect insinuation for a new franchise; just to be clear, this shark isn't the only creature down there. Finishing the second act and halfway the third, the sharp teeth see the light of day, i.e., we finally got what we're waiting for, and, such a tremendous ride!. The whole art department does a fantastic job, especially the editing and art department, because without them in the equation, all of those millions would never have fallen so quickly into Warner Bros's jaw.The Herculean set-pieces are compelled by Harry Gregson-Williams' soundtrack, mixing environmental and suspenseful compositions that are assembled with popular hits and '80s-'90s classics such as the Thai version of ""Hey Mickey"" by Toni Basil or ""Beyond the Sea"" by Bobby Darin, which endows it that nonchalant feeling, that PG-13 the executives have decided to embrace.Unfortunately, the cinematic suspense is fair to middling, keeping in mind this vital ingredient must be handled masterfully in a film about, you know, a Megalodon. Setting aside Steven Spielberg's mandatory, unavoidable reference, it demonstrates careless tension building in the very first glance of the monster, the deaths aren't entirely imaginative and the encounters are far from memorable. This doesn't mean there is no iota of tension, there is, especially in the first act of the film, but Statham's heroism and Bingbing Li's bravery manage to save this key role.
""The Meg"" by Jon Turteltaub is a late-summer playfully over-the-top blast. We're not witnessing this year's revolutionary event movie, we're in front of a dumb actioner that brings US-China co-production deals back up- something Matt Damon's ""The Great Wall"" couldn't achieve -due to its unbelievable profitability and shocking- for good -mixed response from the critics. Seriously, Turteltaub's Statham vs big fish storytelling doesn't need a closer look, save your strength. This is pure popcorn entertainment and it's one of this year's finest. Take the bait, turn off your brain and let this monumental profit-driven shark open wide its jaws and try, just try, devour you for nearly two hours.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Also tension was missing especially when the Meg attacks swimmers at a very crowded beach.There did come a time when I thought this was over, but it wasn't. Stay tuned and you will find out why.Still the photography, pacing and many stunts kept me engaged. I was entertained.Notables: Jessica McNamee as Lori, Jonas' former wife; Winston Chao as Zhang, the director of the underwater facility; Bingbing Li as Suyin daughter of Zhang and love interest for Jonas; Rainn Wilson as Morris, the billionaire who funds this underwater research; Cliff Curtis as Mac, a friend of Jonas; Robert Taylor as Doctor Heller; and Masi Oka as Toshi (formerly Max on Hawaii 5-0 so now we know where he went, and he did very good.)More tension and music would have gone a long way to being a classic. Not to be. (7/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Not much.
Language: No.
Rating: B","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That was 120 minutes I will never get back again; I should sue the producers of that show for the cost of that time, plus the cost of the rental. When I can state with confidence that Jason Statham was the best actor in the entire show, it must be understood that I am not knocking Jason... The storyline is as pathetic and nonsensical as any movie I would be able to come up with while doing shrooms and quaaludes at the same time. I feel bad for the little girl, as she will be stained from having this movie on the list of things she did, but she was the second best actor in the movie. The only redemption would have been if everyone in the movie would have been eaten by the shark - in the opening scene. Roll the credits. Save us all.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I mean, no knock on Jason Statham, but can you really expect a critically-acclaimed film with him attached as the star? So, I'm not entirely sure what people were expecting. The ultra-low reviews are uncalled for. This is a fun film with lots of humor, jump scares, etc. and it leaves you with that same pit-in-the-stomach fear (endless, bottomless black sea that can hide anything until it's upon you) that most films of this genre do. The acting here is adequate. I think the producers were smart to include Asian cast members to appeal to the Asian market. They are all excellent and bring an almost ""Godzilla"" - like element to the film. The CGI and special effects are decent enough. That technology has come a long way and you've got to be particularly knit-picky to even notice it. The story is a little lacking, but apparently sone of it was made-up on the fly. In the end, you get a half-decent Jason Statham movie about a big-a** shark. I watched it with my son, and in spite of our shared apprehension, we enjoyed it. We laughed, we jumped; there was one point my son pulled his legs up on the couch... Worth the watch if you're into the concept. Just don't expect too much.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They are attacked by an unknown creature and he's forced to abandon two of his own men. He gets blamed by Dr. Heller from his team and withdraws into drinking in Thailand. Five years later, he is recruited to lead another underwater rescue. Billionaire Jack Morris (Rainn Wilson) has funded a deep water research to go beyond the deepest depths. Suyin Zhang (Li Bingbing) and her father lead the mission off the coast of China. Their submersible with three crew members are trapped after a creature attack.The first half is an underwater adventure. It's nothing great but at least, it's watchable. The second half has the movie and the shark coming to the surface. It rambles around and it stumbles to its cheesy finish. It would have been vastly better to make the whole movie about the deep water rescue mission and end the movie with the hot water jet escape. That's not to say the first half is any great filmmaking. The station is far too glossy and there are too many questionable issues. When Morris complained about the elevator, I'd rather have that type of dirty grime. It gives the movie inherent tension as if the station is ready to fall apart. All the hi-tech gloss works against that idea. Once the sharks get to the surface, their size is hard to gauge. There is one scene where the shark bites the station which shows the size but it's all lost when there is only the fin. This is half an ok movie and half a bad B-movie. It adds up to a rather flawed blockbuster.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The rewriting of the book and the insertion of Chinese locations and actors has completely ruined it. Maybe the Chinese enjoy this pandering trash, but I don't.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The Meg (2018) is fun to watch, and even though it sounds like those bad shark movies like Sharknado (2013), it is well made with Jason Statham being great in the leading role. Plus, there are effective jumps from the Megalodon.Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor was great to watch in the action sequences involving him going up against a Megalodon, along with him having a past that connects to an incident he had after seeing one of these kinds of sharks. Li Bingbing as Suyin was good; she has experience in piloting a submersible vehicle, good chemistry with the main character, and she also had good scenes involving a Megalodon. The rest of the cast including Cliff Curtis, Rainn Wilson, Winston Chao, Ruby Rose, and Page Kennedy were all good in the movie, especially child actor Shuya Sophia Cai as Suyin's daughter who was likable and gave a reliable performance.The Megalodon shark looked good and had beneficial effects on it, so it feels real when it starts attacking the main characters who explored the Mariana Trench. The shark had a design to differentiate between other sharks, and it had some effective jump scares with it appearing out of nowhere or making out of nowhere attacks to eat someone or flip a boat. There are a lot of shots of the main shark where it shows how big it is compared to other marine life or regular humans, which was cool to see on how it is to scale compared to other sharks.The action sequences or chase sequences were suspenseful, fun, and cool to watch seeing how practical the stunts were having Jason Statham do them. The stunts are well done, and the way everything is shot was visually pleasing, along with the good cinematography in general for the entire movie. One of the major things that was an issue was that the tone of the movie would go back and forth between knowing what it is and having funny comedy moments, and taking itself seriously when I think it should have stayed on the self-aware side. Going back and forth between tones but sometimes it can balance being funny and taking it seriously well for certain moments in the movie.The movie The Meg (2018) is not perfect, and it might have slight issues, but it is fun to watch, and you can tell how much effort was put into the movie to make it an exciting time watching. Good acting, good shark, beneficial effects, with good cinematography, and action/chase sequences. Little issue on tone of the movie, but it has a fun third act climax with good suspense and jump scares that I can see affecting people; fans of Jason Statham and shark movies will have an enjoyable time with this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Seems to not have had much of a build-up of suspense, which is one of the things that made great shark movies, such as Jaws and The Shallows, go down as good flicks over all. I even found Deep Blue Sea to be somewhat unpredictable for it's time, but very entertaining. The Meg doesn't compare - the script is simply not as fun, entertaining, or suspenseful at all.The acting wasn't so great either, even Jason Statham gave a wooden performance. I personally enjoyed Rainn Wilson's performance best, as his character seemed to be the most interesting.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That trailer and the rest of the marketing set this up to be an over the top campy fun b-movie with a bigger budget. And I believe that it was going to be at one point, but from what Jason Statham himself has said, the studio cut it back and tried to make it more accessible.So once again a big studio plays it safe and makes a perfectly acceptable movie when it could've been something better. This movie plays out pretty much how you expect it to. There are a few moments that show hints of the more campy version in some of the action sequences, but it never quite reaches the heights it could have. And this movie relies too heavily on character and plot stuff when it really doesn't need to. I just want some crazy giant shark action and that's it. Everything else around it is unnecessary.It's not all bad though. The action sequences were really entertaining. Jason Statham is badass as always and he's fun to watch. Rainn Wilson brings more of the humor and fun whenever he's there. So overall this is an entertaining movie but didn't live up to the one all the marketing pointed to. If you like dumb shark movies then this is for you. If you were expecting something more campy and subversive like I was, then you'll be slightly disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Something big enough to destroy a new submarine.I'm happy I've watched this movie on the big screen. On the silver screen, the Megalodon (hence the title ""The Meg"") was even more impressive. But that's the only thing that can be said about this film. Every film with a shark as the main subject that suddenly transforms into a psychopathic, bloodthirsty hunter, is of course mercilessly compared to the film of all films ""Jaws"". A milestone in this genre and unbeatable. Give ""The Shallows"" and ""47 Meters down"" a chance and you'll notice that you watch it rather apathetic without any sense of tension. If you want to stand out in the shark genre, you can throw in some tornadoes so sharks move around in a strange way. By air that is. In case of ""The Meg"", they brought in a prehistoric shark who managed to swim through a sort of natural barrier in the ocean. If you want to exceed ""Jaws"", you make it all even bigger and more impressive. But apart from the gigantic dimensions of ""The Meg"", this film was nowhere truly gigantic.I was looking forward to seeing ""The Meg"", even though I knew it would be a fiercely exaggerated and brainless spectacle. The fact that Jason Statham plays in it was good enough for me to give it a try. You never get bored with Statham. And it's always fun to see him kick someone's ass. I was curious to see how he would handle this giant shark. That was the first thing I was disappointed with. It looked as if they had made a serious Statham out of him. No dry humor and witty one-liners. All the familiar humor gone. And probably they also threatened to wash his mouth out with soap every time he would start to swear and say the ""F"" word. Statham the deep-sea diver who's pining away somewhere in an Asian bar because he's feeling guilty about abandoning his former crew on the bottom of the ocean. And afterward, there's also something romantic between him and the Chinese oceanographer Suyin (Bingbing Li). And he also takes care of the lovely daughter Meiying (Sophia Cai). Can it be cornier?Yes, it can be even cornier when the giant shark also starts to behave civilized. Admit it. Don't you think such a mega-shark is constantly hungry? So when he ends up near an overcrowded beach with an immense amount of young people splashing in the salty water, wouldn't you expect a bloodbath with an unprecedented number of torn teenage bodies? It's not that I look forward to such a scene, but you expect that a little bit anyway. Again this was a disappointing feature. I even began to doubt the proper functioning of the natural radar system of this giant shark. And furthermore, there was only one moment I almost jumped out of my skin when an innocent young whale bumped into a window. That says a lot about the eeriness of this movie.Isn't that what you want to see while watching a movie like this? The increasing tension and the redeeming end in which the endangered characters kill that vicious animal. You sigh with relief as you see the dismembered carcass of the shark sink to the bottom of the ocean. And you feel sorry for the attacked victims. In this film, it's the other way around. I almost cheered the moment the most annoying character in the film saw the giant, razor-sharp teeth of the shark in close-up. In fact, I hoped that ""The Meg"" could somehow return to its natural habitat, after which mankind would finally realize not to break the rules of Mother Nature every time. And that final fight was like the battle between Achab and Moby-Dick.All in all, this wasn't really worth a visit to the cinema. I'm already glad they made a mistake at the candy stand and gave back too much cash, so the candy me and my wife bought was almost for free. The popcorn tasted twice as good during this popcorn film. And mind you, not because of the movie. It had nothing to do with that. In retrospect, ""The meg"" was a mega disappointment.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's definitely not the worst film I've ever seen and I didn't feel the need to turn it off because it made me cringe, so in that respect it succeeded. However making a film that is a cross between the incredibly dull 'Abyss' (1989) and the worst of the franchise, 'Jaws: The Revenge (4)' (1987) was never going to be a good idea.It's very predictable. And not that well acted. Jason Statham in particular is very bad. He's a proper eyebrow actor. I've written in my notes -""We're gonna need a bigger action star!""because, he just doesn't have the presence that the likes of Bruce Willis, Tom Hardy and even Arnie do.I struggle with Rainn Wilson as an actor too. There's something about him that just jars with me. It's like he's always 'on'.And Mr Zhang, played by Winston Chao can't act for toffee. The others were okay, but you couldn't say anything more than that.It's also not that well directed. The pace is weird, bits are rushed while others are slow and ""Artsy"". One minute they say ""Let's go here"" and within seconds they have arrived and the next is a long panoramic shot of the ocean.Some of my other notes include -""Captain! There be whales here!""
And -
""There's always a bigger fish!""because it's just that sort of film, where all you can do is take the p!ss out of it.A film like this can never compare to the original and best 'Jaws' with its Two chord cello soundtrack, but if we hadn't seen that one, then maybe this would have been more passable.Not the worst, but by no means the best.402.22/1000.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There's is nowhere to go with the script it was all expected. And yeah it's a chinese sci-fi movie in which hollywood actors has appeared.As a Jason Statham fan i enjoyed the movie as he was fitting for the macho character he is expected to portrait. Killing a meg with a fishing spear, that only he can do. lol. Beacuse of the charm and macho effect that Jason brings in he can even kill godzilla or king kong and i will accept it. There are only few actors who can portrait such heroic act like Keanu with his pencil and Bruce Willis with a revolver in his hand. All the characters where pure cliche. And acting was poor as well. A billionaire played by Rainn who starts a billion dollar project only looking for profit. A kid who knows everything about a modern submarine. A female lead actress who instantly find a crush over the hero. Man it felt, the animated Meg acted and had expressions better than Li bingbing. Director wasted no time in bringing the monsters from underneath as it was all seen and executed decades before in Jaws movie. There was no way to better the Jaws effect. You get lots of screen time with the meg that was actually cool to watch.Only suspense scene that i felt in this movie was when Rainn and his crew kills a whale instead of meg and what follows next was something new.So its more of a Jason statham movie than meg as he was there at each and every moment where meg appeared. Hope meg's brother doesn't come back to get revenge on Statham in the next movie. lol.P.S. @DC sack Mamoa and give statham the roll of Aquaman.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Had the director planned a more tongue in cheek approach maybe the film would have fared much better. This is an unremarkable monster movie with cardboard characters and better-than-average special effects. Director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) crafts a few impressive sequences- the one shown in the trailer with the little girl staring at the shark being the best but most of the film is a paint-by-numbers affair. The story is as disposable as the unromantic romance between Statham's Jonas and Li Bingbing's Suyin. (The Meg is loosely based on the first novel in a series by author Steve Alten. Not much of the book remains, however - the movie is an almost entirely separate entity.) Give it a one time watch at home.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While it may not be a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece, it offers an enjoyable popcorn flick experience that caters to fans of creature features and underwater suspense.The film follows Jonas Taylor (played by Jason Statham), a deep-sea rescue diver, as he is called back into action to save a crew trapped in the depths of the ocean, facing a prehistoric megalodon. Jason Statham's action-packed performance adds a sense of familiarity to the film, and his interactions with the supporting cast, particularly Li Bingbing's character, add a touch of human connection amidst the aquatic chaos.One of the film's strengths lies in its visuals. The underwater sequences are immersive, capturing the beauty and mystery of the deep sea. The portrayal of the megalodon, while not entirely realistic, does command attention and adds a sense of awe to the narrative. The CGI, while occasionally noticeable, generally serves the purpose of enhancing the film's suspenseful moments.""The Meg"" does a decent job of maintaining a steady pace. It presents a mix of tension-building scenes and action sequences that keep viewers engaged throughout. While the plot is not overly complex, it effectively serves its purpose of delivering a tale of survival against overwhelming odds.The film also incorporates light humor, providing occasional comic relief to balance out the suspenseful elements. This adds a layer of entertainment, making it more approachable for a wider audience.The musical score complements the film well, heightening the tension during the intense moments and adding to the overall atmosphere. While it might not be groundbreaking, it serves its purpose in elevating the viewing experience.In conclusion, ""The Meg"" offers an entertaining cinematic escape that doesn't take itself too seriously. While it may not redefine the creature feature genre, it succeeds in delivering a satisfactory mix of suspense, action, and spectacle. If you're in the mood for an aquatic adventure with a dose of nostalgia for monster movies of the past, ""The Meg"" is worth diving into.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Among the crew is Morris (Rainn Wilson), the ex partner of Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), a renegade diver who may be the only one with the expertise to save them, leading a team of Marine experts, in what becomes a race against time against the Magadaloon, a giant sea mammal that sees humans as the ultimate prey.While the magic of the big screen may be designed to absorb the spectacular and the bombastic, especially with all the modern amenities that come with present day theatres, I've developed a nose for sniffing out the wheat from the chaff. I've got to sense something really going on beneath the surface to venture out to a cinema to see it, and alas, on its theatrical release, The Meg just failed to do this. Now I've caught up with it on Netflix, and while it's fine as a distraction piece, I think I made the right decision where to catch it.Jason Statham has always had a real 'take him or leave him' effect on me (although he was one of the main components of Snatch) and his inability to really create a solid type of genre staple really doesn't help, and so he never made it any more appealing. And that leaves us with the film itself, which is aesthetically pleasing, with some spectacular underwater visuals, shark effects and action sequences, but with wooden characters you never really care about, a stale, predictable script and a mounting sense of preposterousness, that's to be expected, but is nonetheless an issue.I'm glad I took my time getting round to this overlong, overblown but underwhelming Jaws tribute act. I've just learned a sequel's in the works. Heaven help us. **","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

To be honest, while reading the book, I envisioned the Jonas character to look and act like the main actor in Longmire (ironically Robert Taylor has a small role in The Meg).Secondly, without giving away any spoilers, the storyline and the inclusion of additional characters are wayyy off the main scope of the book.

In fact, the film offers scenes we've never before seen in a shark movie. It felt exciting like the first 'Jurassic Park'. The draw card here is definitely the great big shark, and Jason Statham. And, off course, to satisfy his fans, there simply had to be a scene where he shows off his perfect body. Not complaining. His character was pretty much similar to every other Statham character we've seen in his films over the years, just with less physical fighting and he does manage a smile here and there. I actually enjoyed him in this movie. As for the rest of the cast, I found them lacking enthusiasm. None of the other actors gave standout performances, making me not care for any of these characters. They also tried so hard to include a romantic interest, but there was just no room for that in this type of film and it fell flat. There were a number of scenes causing me to raise an eyebrow. The explanation of why the 'new world' was secluded from the rest of the ocean was not believable. What are the chances of the diving expedition including Jonas Taylor (Statham)'s ex wife? She then disappears for most of the film. Bingbing Li was unconvincing as Suyin and I really didn't care much for her. She felt in the way at times. The billionaire was an idiotic character and DJ (Page Kennedy) was just stupid as the 'comic relief' character. It would have been better without him. The film wanted an LL Cool J type character for whatever reason - only LL Cool J was very good and likable in 'Deep Blue Sea'. Also, how on earth did they manage to get that megadolon on their little boat??? How did they get the shark out of the water in the first place?? Despite these issues, this was an enjoyable and exciting film. I never found it suspenseful, though.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jason Statham is the hero who teams up with Ruby Rose as well as others in a race against time and to save a Chinese beach town from being taken over by the shark. Made on a big budget that was shared with a Chinese movie studio, this movie made back its money home and abroad and is doing quite well on home media.

Nothing says summer like a campy shark attack film. What's better than a regular old shark film though? A megalodon! Jason Statham's newest vehicle just so happens to be this and it seemed like a great ""brain off"" stupid enjoyment type of film. While I do think it delivers on most of what it should have, I think it needed to embrace its stupidity a bit more and doesn't have that lasting campy re-watch factor or much of an impact for that matter.The film is about a group of scientists that discover that deep in the water lives a prehistoric shark (the megalodon) and the shark soon starts to attack humans in its sight. Jonas Taylor (Statham) is a rescue diver who most attempt to find the best way to kill the megalodon before it finds its way to other humans. That's basically it. Also, Dwight from The Office is in the film as well. Ruby Rose too.I think the effects for the film especially the shark were really bad at times. I understand that this is meant to be a B film but the film looked like a SyFy channel effort at times. There are moments of sheer stupidity in dialogue, plot points, and character action which make it fun. I do think more of it was needed though. The film spends a good portion of time trying to explain the megadolon, how it arrived, and how to take care of it scientifically. Less of that and more of stupid action please.Overall, you get what you pay for with The Meg. Its a cheesy summer blockbuster much in the vein of Piranha 3D. My main concern is that it fails to establish itself as something you would want to visit when you want to laugh at dumb things. Basically, The Meg needed to tone down trying to actually be comprehensible and go all out with the hammy nature, shark fun, and gory deaths. What you get shall suffice though.6/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Statham to save the movie from going straight to video.
Overall, the movie is very watchable, with a good pace and impressive action scenes; you just need to take advantage of non action scenes to catch your breath and get ready for the next action scene.
M. Statham, as an ex champion swimmer in real life, is very believable; from beginning to end, he shows extraordinary dedication, almost abnegation, to save not the world but this movie from disaster. We can't help but sympathise with him (the actor, not his role in the movie), with his second degree humor and improbable endeavor - we're there along with him, despite obvious reluctance, to keep the action going as the movie unfolds. In a certain way, this is how we are actually drawn into this movie. Thanks, M. Statham.
And, of course, there's Ruby Rose, who, if cast in the main female role, instead of being some obscure technician, would have given the movie a more high profile, witty, glamorous lead.
Enjoy !","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is almost like they wanted to make a serious action movie, but after filming they didn't like what they saw, so they added Rainn Wilson to bring the comedy.
 The biggest downfall of the film that no director or actors could possibly try to overcome is having Jon and Erich Hoeber as writers. Two of my least favorite writers in Hollywood, who brought to us another eerily similar movie, Battleship. From start to finish the lines were as cheesy as you can get, the plot was as predictable as ever, and it almost just went for a rip-off of jaws. 
 The rest of the team tried their best to pull it back together, but just couldn't do it. This was a movie written for a Chinese audience. Lots of CG action scenes, explosions, Chinese actors, and still somehow an Asian setting for a movie that takes place in the ocean. This movie could have been a lot better had they established a single solid mood. 
 The director was a plus to the film at points as well, with a lot of creative shots and well paced scenes. His downfall was his ability to create tension and to throw in an abnormally large number of jump scenes into a fun movie. So much of the movie was uncomfortable, between cheesy lines, and jump scenes left and right, you couldn't relax and enjoy almost any of the movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, by resurrecting a 2.5 million-year extinct species and trying to kill it, of course. Enter 'The Meg,' a flashy, splashy summer blockbuster that follows the story of a retired deep diver (Jason Statham) who is called on for a final rescue mission only to find something much more sinister lurking in the depths.So yeah, 'The Meg' is every ridiculous renegade creature movie you've ever seen and rolled your eyes at. There's really not much to say here - the plot is predictable with a capital ""P,"" the connection between Statham and Bingbing Li, who is the lead researcher's daughter, is paper-thin and the typical comic relief-cast is just embarrassing. Of course, nothing is expected to be accurate or somehow connected to reality in 'The Meg,' but it doesn't need to be as horrible as it is. And forget the giant shark...the only bright spot is Rainn Wilson, who takes a departure from his past roles as a billionaire playboy who is of course fixated on his funds above all else.'The Meg' is a prehistoric disaster that never should have been unearthed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jonas Taylor (the seemingly indestructible Jason Statham), is a former deep-sea diving expert, though his past, which was explored in depth during the novel, is only briefly alluded to for the sake of storytelling. When a submersible is lost in an unexplored region of the ocean, Taylor is the one man, according to his friend, Mac (Cliff Curtis), to bring the crew, including Taylor's ex-wife, Lori (Jessica McNamee), back safely, though you would be forgiven for having no idea they'd been married. Mac's plan however receives strong criticism from Doctor Heller (Robert Taylor), and Suyin (the beautifully ageless Li Bingbing).Suyin's father, Zhang (Winston Chao), the man behind the operation, has much interest in the ocean, though the reasons for this are only marginally explored. Moreover, though Steve Alten, in his novel, described a massive prehistoric world, what we do see in the film seems disappointingly small, despite being unbelievably gorgeous. Miss Li brings a lot of passion and conviction to her character, the confident yet vulnerable Suyin, her emotional range making for some touching scenes. Her daughter, Meiying (Sophia Cai), is equally sweet, though their relationship deserved more screen time. The always amazing Mr Curtis on the other hand is occasionally forgotten, and there are moments when he isn't seen at all. Other characters, including tycoon Morris (Rainn Wilson) is the stereotypical arrogant millionaire, with a total disregard for human decency, while Jaxx (Ruby Rose) is the largely forgettable designer of the station, whose role needed a lot more fleshing out. It is DJ (Page Kennedy) however, who has the most insulting role of all, as the typically hysterical black man. His antics, not to mention the innuendo and crude gags that accompany a lot of the script, are meant to offer comic relief, though for the most part, is unbelievable and unnecessary drivel.Of course, the film is not called 'Meg' just for the sake of it. It does take some time before we see the great big beast, but it is certainly worth the wait, an unforeseen event (unlike the one in the novel) inadvertently releasing the giant shark into the waters of the twenty first century. Trouble naturally ensues, the station the team occupies (which we never do see enough of) coming under attack. Despite the title, it would have been so much more engrossing to see more of the tyrannical monster, and though this is a creature feature, the occasional violence is kept to a minimal.Despite its predictability and basic narrative (if you've seen Shark Attack 3: Megalodon, this is similar), Meg is thoroughly enjoyable, brainless fun. There is a lot that goes unexplained, and you could spend a lot of time poking holes in the plot, that frenetically speeds along. That being said, there are some excellent jump scares, and Jason Statham has a LOT of fun as the stone-faced hero, the end result being a crescendo of excitement and unending suspense. 
If you want something thought provoking, you won't find it here; if you want to be thrust into an adventure, captained by Statham and Bingbing, this is the ship you should board at once!","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

It is incredibly predictable, full of bad jokes, with terrible performances and unrealistic special effects, full of moments easy to predict and we are able to guess how it ends, a movie that doesn't really take itself seriously. Pretty dull in that sense, but at least it didn't end up turning into a shame of itself, although it does have some ''embarrassing'' moments, but it's something to expect in this kind of movies. It's just another case of a quick cash inflow with a simple and predictable adventure movie. If you ever have insomnia and you don't have anything to do, then maybe it's worth watching to clear your mind and kill the nerve cell's for a while.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What do you expect from shark thrillers? The Meg gave it all and more. Right combination between story, acting, action and CGI. This movie gives a serious tone, unlike Blue Deep Sea.
I appreciate where the characters in this film are feeling sad by the death of their partner who died. That is new in this genre genre.
The only drawback is The Meg plays safely with PG-13. Well, that's understandable considering this film is also targeting Chinese audience with strict age qualifications.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

Already unbelievable, if you're saying the gas barricade was enough to protect the shark from freezing temperatures, that's perfect. However, then you say there was a rupture allowing the warm water, and the meg, to swim through. Then you follow with it closing back up immediately though, so did this shark learn how to evolve and change its body temperature within 10 minutes of eating its first ever human?? Then, OF COURSE, the woman scientist pleads for non-lethal options before killing this beast, that has already killed someone and is proving powerful enough to kill them.

There's no gore, or proper scares, they probably tried to lower the age rating to 12+ to reach a wider audience but the original Jaws was a 12 so why couldn't they have had a bit more gore and blood. Or at the very least have some suspense without showing all of the monster too quickly.Cinematography was alright in places but the locations were rather bland and I can't remember more than one or two memorable scenes. Acting was ok and some of the jokes were alright but there wasn't many more positives.3/10: Boring, rather predictable and not scary","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everybody is pretty knowledgeable about these creatures. So just make the shark (and all other animals) behave A BIT like normal creatures would.
In a nutshell, because the above rules were broken again and again, the movie is not believable and you end up not caring for the characters.

Yes, to me it does. Like most film adaptions of books, certain changes are made. The Meg is no different. To me though, I would rather see a different take for a film adaption of a novel, instead of trying to make it faithful 100%. If I wanted a 100% faithful adaption, I would just reread the book.Some people complain it went too far from the source material. Well, so did Jurassic Park and Jaws. Both were not faithful to the novels, and yet were giant blockbusters. And the same goes for The Meg. I think everyone involved in the film did an amazing job, and its great to finally see a great shark film on the cinema screens.If you love the movie, then make sure to read the entire MEG series of novels starting with MEG, THE TRENCH, MEG - PRIMAL WATERS, MEG - HELL'S AQUARIUM, MEG - NIGHSTALKERS and MEG -GENERATIONS by Steve Alten","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Scary sudden monster attacks but not a lot of gore - check! And just a dash of (circumstantially unbelievable) romance sprinkled into the plotline - check!Yep!

What could they have spent it on? My estimate, Writing $100. 6th grade ESL students could write better lines (They could probably write a better review also, you might say). Acting, well the supporting cast were mostly terrible, whatever they were paid was too much, but I believe the minimum wage for a movie is $10,000. 20 supporting actors or speaking parts = $200,000. Who knows what Jason earns per movie, $5 million? Director $1 million? of course there must have been a large crew working on the movie. Say 100 crew at an average of $50,000 that's another 5 million. Action scenes, there are a couple of short action scenes and a lot of talking. Therefore there must have been loads to spend on special effects, as you would expect from such a movie. Well the effects are also pretty shoddy. The bare least you would expect is that the special effects be good for the money spent on this movie, unfortunately not. Stupid story and badly written. Mostly terrible supporting actors. A lead actor who doesn't have to do very much, apart from raise his eyebrows now and again. Fake looking CGI. The only reason I am giving this 2 is the joke at the end as the credits begin to role, It would normally say The End! I won't spoil it, If you are watching on DVD it't worth skipping to The End! to find out.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well; as much as I like a good gory horror movie; I cannot complain this time.
Turteltaub a director that never quite convinced me had crafted a very good entertainment; fill with very good suspense; a good doses of humor, tenderness and some spectacular marine scenes. Surprisingly for these type of movies; most of the main characters survive and the ecological message is brief and not boring. The FX are very well balanced in the movie. The editing has been perfectly made to compensate some low quality ones; but always the action scenes look amazing. In brief; brainless action packed entertainment that only wants to be fun.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

When the trailer first dropped, I immediately realized they weren't going to follow the book and when I saw it was going to be PG-13, I knew the studio had definitely taken a different route.
That being said, going into this movie knowing those facts really helped my enjoyment of the film.
I found it to be a very good Summer ""Popcorn"" flick that reminded me of monster movies I used to watch with my Dad.
It drug a little bit in some spots but nonetheless I found it to be a fun and entertain flick.

At least those film don't try to be something they aren't.But the acting is the worst. It is so unbelievably bad that it is probably the worst I have ever experienced in a movie. Ever.The best thing I can say about The Meg: well, the lighting of the film wasn't all that bad. But the rest sure was.Avoid at all costs. No, really!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I love a good shark movie. A bad shark movie is a pitiful CGI 15 ft great white shark that leaps from 2feet of murky fresh water to get the giggling half naked bimbo, and the Bureaucrat that won't back down. If your lucky in a bad movie they sometimes have a few stock images of actual great white in deep water for those ""realism"" shots. Yes some of the Meg CGI is mediocre. At least it didn't growl. Ugh that always drives me crazy.This is not that. Yeah, the kid is more cutesie than a good actor. The characters are a bit cliche, stereotypical.But it's a shark movie. Every creature feature works off the same few rules. This doesn't really deviate from that. Is the science off? Yep, you betcha, but at least they tried to come up with something more plausible than zombies, toxic waste, ecological push back, or simple mindless revenge with no real plot or story to go with. Some of the shark discrepancies low rated reviewers noted are potentially due to different sharks... I didn't notice it so much.There are also some hysterical one liners.Statham is fantastic. Car, boat, oil, water, he always brings energy to his character. ""Just keep swimming, swimming swimming...""
And Lori (his ex wife) ""did you really come all the way down here just to say I told you so?"". Jonas: ""Yes""There are your gratuitous nail biter moments. And I always love the moments when arrogant humans assume they are smarter than the films creature and are surprised when the plan goes awry due to something simple they overlooked. (Shark cages, flimsy boats,)(Mild spoilers- but not really)
If I had a beef it would be that 5.56 rounds wouldn't go through it's tough hide, but some aforementioned flimsy boat metal?I also completely forgot that you can actually see a shark get blown up in the opening rescue sequence.There's a lot of random little things I just love. The busy beach scene is gratuitous but amusing. (Brine shrimp to a whale, humans to a meg? Maybe.) the Billionaire staying true to form. Comeuppance is definitely a thing I love in monster movies over the 'everybody dies at random except the designated survivor.Anyway...
If you love a good shark movie, (Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, The Shallows, and 47 Meters Down, even though that barely qualifies as a shark movie) you'll like this one too. I also recommend Bait, Shark Lake, Santa Jaws, swamp sharks, and Sand Sharks for decent B shark movies. If you're expecting National Geographic, this is not your movie. It beat The Requin, Maneater, and many others hands down in my opinion. YMMV.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

We second guessed it'd be a B movie schlocker and were fine with that but we expected spectacle, tension and an entertaining bloodbath. What's delivered is a diluted, lacking, child-friendly, International, corporate by numbers, marketing exercise. Whoever gave Jason Stratham the direction to do his standard schtick of a lame Clint Eastwood drag impersonator just ruined the film. Didn't they view the daily rushes and say 'Hold on a minute..... this is completely off-key and out of balance to everyone else's performance in the film "". Stratham mumbles, pouts and behaves like he's in a completely different film to all around him, wooden, robotic, contrived and nowhere near convincing. He's proven with Crank, Lock Stock, Snatch even Spy he can carry an action film with smouldering sexuality, swagger, a croak in his voice and wit. Here he's out of his depth, with a B script he's as wooden as a first timer and out of synch with everyone. The first two shark attacks are reminiscent of the original Star trek Enterprise, were the actors run from one side of the tilted set to the other. When we do finally get to see Meg half an hour in, it's CGI and as convincing as the Pixar animation in Finding Nemo / A shark's tale. Ruby Rose is stylised as an animated CGI Manga character and alot of her appearances looked lake/artificial like a fake video game avatar. The music score is saccharine swooping violins cue-ing every manipulated emotional reaction. . Beach attack nowhere near the level of creativity of Jaws or even Jaws 2, which both managed genuine menace, horror, fear, shock and suspense. Here a puppy chihuahua and a chubby glutinous asian kid are the uninteresting choice of focus. The movie of course will make a mint. A fortune. Won't matter any negative word of mouth. It's just a little above step above from that dreadful sequel to the recent Piranha reboot Piranha 3DD.(2012) You can see the cynical boardroom marketing meetings of the Asian meets West blockbuster fusion as a double bubble killer box office lucrative return, in every cynical frame transparent there undisguised on the screen. It's a film 6 to 11 year olds will really love. It's made for the uncynical awe kids have at attempted spectacle. I'd have enjoyed it at that age too. But there's little involvement, character engagement, innovation or suspenseful build up of tension to be had. There's one jump scare that's well executed, to be had, a whale is outside the underwater HQ clearly visible and of some size. It's tapping on the corridor window and singing in relaxing whale song. Out of nowhere comes The Meg and chomps it in two bites and for the first and last time the audience ejects out of their seats and nervously laughs out their tension. One last thing, the interior set design of the corridors of the underwater research station look highly reminiscent of the cult 1980 SciFi movie Saturn 3 which is actually good thing and pleasing to the eye. Good choice of set design. When people start running down the corridors, you can't help but remember Farrah Fawcett and Kirk Douglas doing the same but they were in a better movie. Let the kids go see it. It was made for their summer holiday mild dose of fear treat. They'll enjoy it as pure surface without criticism and acceptance.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I mean a movie mostly depends on the story it tells. To produce a movie into looking great on the screen - well, we know that that is possible today also with pretty limited resources, so that is really no reason to watch a movie nowadays. This is also valid for this film. Great production, great ocean scenes, good filming (that is also where the three stars come from). But the story is such a piece of garbage; if they only could have spent more time (and money) into writing a story which we even faintly could believe in. But no, the story here is just stupid, stupid, stupid. So save your money and watch it on your big screen TV at home when it is available there (, if at all). No need to watch it, whether in 3D nor Imax. Another disappointment made in Hollywood.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Just by the trailer or even the name I expected a bad movie, but not this bad. It was painfully predictable and boring. The dialogue was laughable and the special effects were just as bad. I was pre-disposed to not like this movie since Jason Statham plays nearly the same character in all his movies. Now for the science aspect of this movie. Now I know this is targeted more for kids and the general population who don't know any better outside what they've learned from Hollywood about sharks, but for me I just couldn't get past it. For example, the characters in the movie were shocked that there was more than one Megalodon. Obviously there was, these people are supposed to be smarter than average scientists, they should have known better. If this animal was supposed to have gone extinct more than 2 million years ago, but is not, then that means it is reproducing. Sharks need a mate to reproduce therefore there is obviously a population of these animals. And there wouldn't be just one roaming around for two million years, there would be many many generations of them in the ocean. And for the typical sharks are monsters idea, again I understand that this was more a kids movie for cheap entertainment than a science documentary, but sharks do not seek revenge, they will not actively hunt and track people sitting in a boat for days on end. It has better things to do. Guaranteed the sharks does not have an appetite for helicopter debris or shipwrecks, it would be out hunting it's natural prey, which is NOT humans, no matter what the species. Humans never have been and never will be on the natural food chain for sharks.Overall I think anybody with a touch of common sense will find this movie boring and very poorly done.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not just a blunder but a fake ad campaign to bring you in theaters in bait of a good shark movie. But let we warn you, if you have followed all the trailers of this film vigorously, you are in for a major disappointment in the theater. Of course ! If you are a Jason Statham fan, there are couple of cheesy action scenes to entertain you but what about those who would come for the shark.First things first, there is no horror, no chills, no excitement or even thrill to begin with. There's not even a single scene in the film where you would jump with excitement and cheer for what's going on. Some reviewers and fans are really funny, comparing this film with Jaws. Comeon ! I'm unlucky enough to born in 1985 and in a foreign country who could not get a chance to experience the terror of Jaws on big screen celluloid. I am just hoping and praying if the film can release here in my country but that looks tough.Coming to The Meg, it's not even a patch. 10 Years people will forget this film pretty sure even if its sequels would continue to drop by. In comparison, The shallows and 47 meters down with low budgets have enough chills and scares against this giant budget fish film.The biggest mistake/drawback/weakness that made me really mad that the makers have dropped every damn shark scene in all the trailers/tv spots/ promos. Like I said earlier, If you have followed them all, you'll find there are hardly any new shark scenes in the film except the climax may be or here and there. But everything is in the trailer, so if this is it, why should I pay a good sum of bucks to watch the same thing on celluloid. I can wait for the digital release.I think the film has now exhausted its run of course if anyone of you planning to go to watch it. Better save your money. A DVD is much preferred in this case.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This has all of those.Yet it is reasonably entertaining and almost works. There's some decent humour, usually provided by Rainn Wilson as the billionaire or the kid.

I don't know why it has been given so many bad reviews, I think it was darkly comic and a pretty stimulating watch. It's not meant to be an Oscar winner and given its inherently silly nature as a film about a giant shark, I don't think this film could have been any better. It's no cinematic masterpiece, but it's a really great watch nevertheless. I think it's actually way better than Jaws in that people are shown to have brought it upon themselves by messing with nature rather than some macho hero story where sharks must be destroyed by a bunch of men in a boat. In a very saturated genre, it brings something new to the table and holds its own, unlike many other shark films that seem like a waste of energy. I enjoyed it so much that I re-watched it with my family, who whilst understandably sceptical at first, really enjoyed it too. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to a friend as a fun lightweight watch, which is all a film like this can hope to achieve. I would say ignore the bad reviews and give it a go, it's really entertaining so long as you are not looking for an art house masterpiece.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Badly directed action scenes show us a large shark eat people, and then they dispose of it. The fact that it is a prehistoric shark, much larger than any shark today, hardly ever seems to matter, and we never really get that feeling of size in any was that meaningfully impacts the screenplay. It could have been just an unusually large white shark and the effect would have been exactly the same.Wafer thin characters, pointless dialogue, and a surprising amount of filler.

I don't know why this movie particularly would be targeted other than the rhetoric around the financiers, but I must agree based on all of the ""1"" ratings. There's something here that does not make sense. People who would honestly find this as a movie meriting a ""1"" rating, would typically never have the appeal to view it in the first place. In large part, because they belong to a different movie-going dumographic.There is absolutely no way this movie is a 1 or a 2; no more than it is a 9 or 10.Ok, that aside, this movie actually has some fairly creative aspects to it, starting with the world ""underneath the sea"" as we know it. Yes, it's a bit of fantasy, but so is the shark.Speaking of the prehistoric behemoth (Meg), the CGI certainly could've be much better. And that is reflected in my ""Clokey"" reference in this review's title. (Gumby was a Clokey Production.)The bleeding edge underwater facilities (financed by the unscrupulous billionaire), are fairly cool and creative.Yes, a few scenes are unintentionally comedic, like Statham being snatched away by a ship's tow cable, from inside Meg's mega snapping jaw, just making it by a split second. But that's ok too.Speaking of Statham, he is 100% Stathamesque as you'd expect, so that's worth the price of admission by itself. But deficiencies aside; this movie has plenty of decent thrills and fast action.Look! It's a ""B"" SciFi- Drama movie. The mediocre script is predictable and the players are just OK. Still, as mentioned above, it moves well. Add in a few 'spooky' parts as well. As an example, the scene where the little girl is playing by herself in a section of the impervious underwater station/lab, is pretty creepy.The guy who spent billions to finance this entire underwater marvel is Richard Cranium. His friends call him Dick Head for short. He's both goofy and obnoxious (mostly the latter), & as you might expect, gets more than he bargained for.I gave it a 7 and that's fair, and moreover, compared to the IMDB ratings of many other similarly produced movies, probably empirically factual that it belongs in the range of 6-8. I later raised it to an 8 just because it's a fun action SciFi that keeps one's attention better than 90% of the tripe the studios are (and have been) regurgitating for so long now.Definitely worth the watch, that's for sure. Yes, a bit hokey at times, but so what.Okay, that's it. Take it in and you be the judge.ThxBob R.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I guess what bothers me most is that having read Steve Alten's book when it was published many years ago, I eagerly expected the movie adaptation; for which there was always talk, as the book was made in a DanBrownian, I'm-ready-for-movie, style. Now mind you, the book was not a literary masterpiece; it was a mediocre but entertaining and even slightly informative book, and mediocre books can make really fine movies under a clever director and cast. I don't know where to start from: The complete deviation (more like abusing) of the simple but decent plot of the book. The university professor-diver of the book turned badass macho man in the movie; even the most standing feature of the book plot, which is what the name of the protagonist hints to (JONAS), was completely left out in the movie and changed to a completely ridiculous alternative suitable to Expendables; which makes me wonder, why on earth didn't the director change the protagonist's name from Jonas to, well, Tucker or Jack? In order to be faithful to the book? (audience laughs). The fact that the movie tries to be scary and funny, without of course accomplishing any of these. It somewhat reminded me of Sharknado, but Sharknado was at least honest in its trash substance. The complete inaccuracy of the film (a 100-feet shark swims casually below swimmers in shallow waters and no one notices anything, no vortex created, nothing, guess it's a ninja shark).
In any case, don't make the mistake of seeing that movie and losing about 20 IQ units, you'll need some time to get them back. I do recommend the book Meg, though, even though it has some scientific inaccuracies, but compared to the film it's ""mustard"", as Jason Staham said in a movie that didn't have him appear as mentally incapacitated.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Women make stupid descions and have to be rescued by the alpha male lead, cowardly, wise cracking African American male provides comic relief like a discount Kevin Hart without any of his charm, irritatingly cute precocious kid who too cheeky for her own good and of course the irascible Asian dad who regrets being so hard on his daughter when she was a kid... yawn add the terrible script which appears to have been written by a five year old and you have the ingredients of this steaming pile of crap
I watched this with a Jason statham fan, yes they exist. After 5 mins I was praying for this film to end and for the more stupid senseless characters to be eaten by ""the meg"" each time they fell into the water for no good reason.
I read somewhere that it was aimed at the Chinese market and it shows, all the beach scenes have 100% Chinese extras with English subtitles.there is an ambulance of pretty Chinese girls falling into the water wearing skimpy bikinis.
I suppose this abortion of a film could be enjoyed if you were drunk, otherwise avoid it like the plague, it's terrible, truly terrible. I hate this film.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even if you take this movie for what it is, it's objectively bad, very bad.The CGI is uninspired and laughable. I was at least expecting a few epic shots or scenes like in the recent Kaiju movies but no. All the CGI looks like CGI.
Or you could at least expect a scary or epic soundtrack to build up the tension, but no, it's empty.If it's not a comedy, not a scary movie and not a gory movie, what was that supposed to be? They make a few jokes to release the tension like in a Marvel movie, but there's no tension at all, so the jokes just flop and are just embarrassing
.
I guess they blew all the money on the casting. That being said, Jason Statham is doing his thing, speaking in a low voice that you can barely understand to look badass... every character is forgettable anyway.Even if I knew I was going to watch something bad, I was not expecting it to be this bad and boring.Skip it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is like a dumbed down version of Jaws - yikes! The black guy (DJ, played by Page Kennedy) is a stereotype, the fat Chinese kid is dumb and almost gets eaten by the shark, and there is an annoying rich guy, Morris (played by Rainn Wilson). Luckily he gets eaten, which was actually my favorite part of the movie because he is an utter snob and a horrible person who deserved to die.There is a reason I rated this film 1 star out of 10. There are the typical Hollyweird themes of love and intrigue, along with horror. But this is the most silly horror film, if you can call it that, that I've probably ever seen. You could praise the acting of
Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor but I still don't think that would save the film from the depths of horribleness. Not at all.So please, do not watch this movie in a thousand years. You will regret the time you spent watching this piece of trash.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

An 8+ movie about a giant Megalodon eating people...... yeah sure! With my wife we made a bet at the very beginning to see which character would not make it to the end, and guess what! we both won with perfect score! This little flick was a pure ""cliché"" galore, oneliner fest with maybe 2 or 3 jump scares that we saw coming from a mile away! Never the less, I actually had fun watching it. some well placed jokes, none of the characters were actually hatefully annoying (but not memorables either). If you want a movie perfect to enjoy some pop-corn (or Gummy Bears as I did), switch your brain OFF for a couple of hours and have some very simple and mindless fun, give it a go!.......if you are expecting ""The Green Mile"", yeeeah.... no!

In a single word, The Meg was significantly ""boring"". I had a hard time distinguishing what exactly was wrong with it until I realized it was incorrectly marketed. It wanted to be in the same market as Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, The Shallows, and Deep Blue Sea for obvious reasons, but it lacked a vital denominator that connects the others - suspense. They are a type of horror film that really keeps us on our toes and gets us worried about the characters, not knowing how things will ultimately pan out in the end. This wasn't horror, thrilling, or suspenseful, it was an action movie starring Jason Statham. The characters were forgettable, two-dimensional, and even though they were constantly in peril, you never really believe it because you don't really care about who they were.The whole ""this is the biggest shark in the history of shark movies"" thing is mostly a gimmick, and they completely rely on that gimmick for any success it actually finds. Yes, the graphics were rather decent, but this happens to be the most forgettable shark I've ever seen in a movie like this. The size is memorable, that's it. As for Statham, he was so underutilized because this isn't his type of movie, action, or character. It was fine for what it was, but it literally anyone could've played that role. As I write this, I've already forgotten his character's name, because who cares?To say I'm disappointed is a bit of an understatement because it had all the opportunities in the world to really make something special","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most of the secondary characters are likable (even the slightly amoral financier has his funny moments). The Chinese influence did not bug me at all. The 'baddie' is, of course, a 30 meter shark, that played its role as best it could, under the weight of script and editing revisions. But really, the 1-star and 10-star reviews have one thing in common: exaggeration. The film is reasonably entertaining and the pacing is okay.It is, however, apparent that the potential of this film was corrupted. Why?The studio decided to 'dumb down' the film and make it appropriate for teenagers. They interfered in the director's vision by trying to spoon-feed audiences and make a mild popcorn flick out of a potential blockbuster. The original concept was darker, funnier, and MORE INTELLIGENT.This film is one of the many examples where the choice of what to retain and what to leave out, has sunk the ship. The brainless executives involved in the post-production, should be fed to the sharks!I mostly skipped the corny (and unnecessary) 10-minute prologue of the film and visualized the film starting at a later point. It is easy to do and worked like a charm. The ham-handed information that was conveyed in the prologue was not necessary at all. The plot was perfectly understandable without it. It heightened the suspense and delayed the inevitable introduction of the monster, which increased the impact.Surprisingly, I read that both the star and the director had similar views.As it is, it is worth a watch. It would help if you lower your expectations.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A lot of great action, the actors were on point, and the sharks were amazing.

Well I think both, providing there is a 'Cringe-worthy' film award ceremony to be introduced because of films, like this one, that unashamedly flirts with asininity.An amusing notice was the fact that Mr Stratham, early on in the film, adopts an awful American accent that is so bad it's dropped very quickly. To me it was glaringly obvious but, it appears, the director couldn't be asked to remedy this ridiculous scenario. I guess it doesn't matter too much as the film certainly doesn't reach any noticeable heights in acting, plot, direction or, I'm sorry to say, special effects.Mr Stratham plays an ex Naval Captain Hero and expert rescue diver and, it seems, body builder, Jonas Taylor who, five years earlier, had been milling about on a mission in unexplored regions of the Mariana Trench. This is where he first encounters 'The Megalodon', a very large and extinct shark like sea creature that is looking for a crass movie to star in, so it badgers Jonas to the extent of him having to abort his mission and abandon some of his crew. Of course, no one believes him, including a certain Dr. Heller who survived the mission.
Jonas' career, along with his marriage, ends after a dishonourable discharge.An amusing notice was the fact that Mr Stratham, early on in the film, adopts an awful American accent that is so bad it's dropped very quickly. To me it was glaringly obvious but, it appears, the director couldn't be asked to remedy this ridiculous scenario. I guess it doesn't matter too much as the film certainly doesn't reach any noticeable heights in acting, plot, direction or, I'm sorry to say, special effects.We are moved on five years, and a billionaire called Jack Morris has set up an underwater research facility off the coast of China called 'Mana 1'. Morris hires oceanographers, Dr Zhangh and his daughter Suyin, to supervise a mission to explore further depths of the Mariana Trench. The mission is being conducted, in a submersible, by Jonas Taylors' ex wife, Lori, and two other colleagues. After managing to penetrate a cloud of hydrogen in the depths of the trench, they run into unforeseen difficulties and soon become aware that there is something very large lurking in the depths around them. A ferocious attack from outside ensues and the submersible is buffeted and rammed and loses contact with 'Mana 1'. Lori gets injured badly and the mission starts turning into a nightmare as the submersible is rendered immobile.There is only one man who can save the day! Jonas Taylor. This is agreed by all on ''Mana '1, apart from Dr Heller who survived the original mission with Jonas. He thinks Jonas is traumatised and has lost the plot and would be a liability. After deliberation it is decided that Dr. Zhang, along with one of his colleagues, should go to see Jonas and ask for his help. They don't seem deterred by the fact that Jonas is now a washed out drunk who is currently hanging out on some Taiwanese beach.The meet occurs and Jonas appears quite stoic and is adamant that he will have nothing to do with their problems. Well, would you Adam and Eve it, Jonas ends up changing his mind, who would've thought? Maybe it has something to do with the fact that his ex is in peril. So off they go. Hoorah!Soon after Jonas arrives at 'Mana 1', Dr Zhang's daughter, Suyin, decides to exasperate the situation by taking another submersible deep into the trench to try and help her trapped colleagues. This ends up in disaster as her vessel is grabbed and shaken violently by a giant Squid who is also looking for a bit part in the film. Come on Jonas, hurry up, things are looking bad mate !So off he goes, Jonas, down into the deep, but not before consoling Suyin's daughter, Meiying, who it seems, has already decided that if everyone else is acting poorly around her, then so will she.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Suspense? hardly any, forced jokes? a few, not good at all however im afraid, the main protagonist Meg? hardly gets any decent screen time, the characters, are all as empty and devoid of a background as you can have them be, so creating an emotional connection between the viewer and them is IMPOSSIBRU, i didnt care for nobody, not even Meg, in the end, i was like whatever...The movie is in its most just plain boring, seriously, i wish they had took another way with this lowsy script, but there are hardly any redeeming qualities to this movie, i still gave it a 5 because, although the movie is close to awful of just how boring it is, it is still a shark movie (1 point), a megalodon shark movie (1point), has Jason (1point) and the other two were give as professional courtesy, cause i hate to see movies getting ratings below 5 specially when they could have been great.Anyway, there are much better offers out there some even recent and DECENT, such as the Shallows, or even the not so highly rated 47mts down, which btw despite all its flaws, beats this movie in every aspect, suspense, claustrophobic feelings, the sharks themselves, seriously a lot better, tighter script, solid performances, nice character development.The best i can tell u guys, is AVOID SEEING IT IN THE CINEMA, you are most definitely regret the money you spend. Wait for DVD, or watch on netflix, if you really feel like it. But dont go to the cinema for this...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie is also build up pretty well towards the megalodon appearance and the destruction it causes in the movie. The megalodon itself is really threatening and is creepy to be stuck in the ocean with it. While the shark is CGI, it isn't the worst CGI shark that I seen.

Having said that, for a PG-13 shark movie, it delivers absolutely everything it promises. It's cute, it's silly, there's tension and thrills, just not enough tension and thrills to upset a 13-year-old.
Personally, I prefer my shark movies more bloody. But if you're a gory-shark-movie-loving adult like me, and you want to ease your kids into the genre, this is the perfect movie for that.
It's fantastical in every way. Shot beautifully, interspersed with cheesy dialogue and basically the most stereotypical characters you could possibly imagine. Written for 13-year-old and I'm sure enjoyed by all of them.
I didn't dislike it. I like every actor and they did a good job of delivering a pretty cheesy dialogue believably. I've seen it more than once, and I'd see it again. There's nothing wring with this movie. It might be missing some blood and guts for some people.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Big issue number two was that it was so damn aggravatingly bloodless! It's supposed to be a movie about a freaking Megalodon that's been starving for a thousand years wrecking havoc so where were my rivers of blood and guts?! That stupid trailer with the blues singer was totally misleading.. It had somewhat scary scenes but overall it felt very PG and that really hobbled the fun of it for me, the climactic scene which I found the most fun at the end when the shark assaults a crowded beach should have had it devouring the packed swimmers left and right with blood flowing like crazy, but it just felt held back, tons of insane gore and a more tongue in cheek tone and a little black comedy here and there was what this movie clearly needed to make it good in my humble, as it was it was a bit of a chore to sit though, I thought it dragged a little, I was so bored when it had it's dramatic moments and the characters were talking for too long, I kept saying in my head ""get back to that goddamn awesome shark, give us what we paid for!!'"" And I'm never been a fan of Jason Statham but he actually was quite good in this, for what it was, which wasn't very much, do I think he held it all together .. The first act before you see the shark was very atmospheric and creepy, it reminded me a whole lot of the opening act of Deepstar Six. In closing I was considerably disappointed in this, I mean I never read the book but that popular trailer just flat out lied. Too much dull-as-dishwater drama and misplaced focus on weak uncharismatic characters except for Statham, some really annoying characters who just were kind of weirdly jarring with the film's seriously not very fun tone, lame comedy that doesn't work, not enough shark, the bloodless PG rating all but ruins it, it's enjoyable but it is not quite good, I can honestly say that I enjoyed it just as much as I did the movie 5-Headed Shark Attack that I saw the other day. *Somewhat* fun but it doesn't work as a B-movie and it makes for a bit of a lame sea monster thrill ride... The Meg ain't got no real bite, sink her back to the fathomless icy depths from whence she came, what a big ol fishy dud!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are some decent comedic moments as well as some fine visual effects, but that being said, it's gotta be the highest budget 'B-movie' I've ever seen. Because ultimately that's what it feels like, with very cheesy/poor acting, even for Statham's standards. There's no notable directing, cinematography or soundtrack, the plot is predictable, and so overall it's a very mediocre viewing experience. As a horror the jump scares are far too predictable and lack any real impact, which is an area they could have focused better on, something which decent soundtrack would have helped with. The romance element felt unnecessary and too under developed, which could easily have been cut out of the movie. So ultimately it's just a few laughs thrown in with some eye candy, which I find relatively disappointing considering this kind of budget could have been used to create a real decent thriller like Jaws. I feel like cinema should just be far better than this, like since when did the standards drop so low?","0 out of 12 found this helpful.

So, when I saw that it was streaming on DirecTV, I thought I'd melt into the couch with a blanket and a beverage of my choice and relish in the over-the-top awfulness that is THE MEG.Well...I am here to report that THE MEG is awful, just not over-the-top ""so bad it's good"" awful. It's just awful - and that is an awful disappointment.I can see the pitch now - THE MEG is ""Jaws, but bigger, it's Mega-Jaws! What were the best parts of Jaws? Well, we're gonna do that again, just more!"" But what these filmmakers failed to realize is that the best part of Jaws isn't the shark attacking, it's the interaction of the 3 men who go off in search of the shark.And...the folks that are ""fish-fodder"" for this big shark just aren't interesting enough. The filmmakers give Jason Statham a PTSD backstory that is forgotten about 2 minutes into the film. His nemesis/former crewmate (a forgettable Robert Taylor) hates Statham's character for about 5 minutes...the stalwart captain is...well stalwart and he is played by ""I always melt into the background"" Cliff Curtis. Rubie Rose is on-board as the ""young genius"" who's good looks and youth makes everyone underestimate her - even after she proves over and over again that she is young and a GENIUS. And then, there's good ol' Rain Wilson (Dwight from THE OFFICE) who's the megalomaniacal mega-billionaire who wants to capture (not kill) The Meg for profit.The problem with all these characters (and others like Masi Oka's homesick scientist) is that they are one-note but not SO one note that they are over-the-top caricatures. They're just boring and forgettable.As for the shark killings (the real reason that The Meg is intriguing), they are just as boring and forgettable as the characters. Most of them are homages to kills ni the Jaws series of films, so there is some fun in that, but none of them are truly unique and original or over-the-top enough.The blame, I think, probably goes to ""the suits"" at Warner Brothers or perhaps Gravity Pictures. There are 3 writers on this, so clearly the script kept getting sent back to the drawing board - and 19(!) producers attached. I heard that Eli Roth was attached at one point and he wanted to make it EXTREMELY graphic and bloody - but ""the suits"" wanted something they could market to a broader audience, so let him go and hired the always mediocre Jon Turtletaub (LAST VEGAS, THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE) to Direct and mediocrity reigns all over.If you want a ""so bad it's good"" mega-shark film and check out DEEP BLUE SEA (the Samuel L. Jackson speech in this film is worth the price of admission). And when you see THE MEG on whatever streaming platform you prefer and are prepared to watch it ""for a laugh"", save yourself the bother (and the boredom) and stream something else.Letter Grade: C (it is competently made)4 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I understand that this is totally sci-fi, but the sad truth is that this is actually what we would do if this really happened. They did a great job on the sharks being realistic in the movie though. Cheesy and expected but good effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was expecting maybe a Deep Blue Sea meets Sharknado, the reality is, dead on arrival jokes, a cast lacking any chemistry whatsoever, horrific CGI sharks, bad science, and worst of all... a bad child actor!!! The story is extremely formulaic relying on pretty much all shark attack/ocean based movies, no surprises, and pretty frakking boring. Do you still wanna know the story, ok... The deepest spot of the ocean, isnt the deepest spot after all, and with a billionaires money (Rainn Wilson killed the spirit of Dwight K. Shrute with this performance) a group of totally unprepared scientists poke around too far, and you never guess what happens, they get attacked by a giant extinct shark called a megalodon, and get trapped down there, and they need the help of an expendable transporter diver to get em out, but the dumbasses also let the shark out. Most of the film they just spend chasing the shark around, once in awhile having a bad CGI encounter with a fish. And the ending...ugh... so bad.

There are elements of psychoanalysis and a history of it among crew members (even relatives), yet this is junk compared to the ""Sphere"", already badly received by both viewers and critics movie.I will put it simply, in numbers, what I do not like about this movie:
1) It is a kind of a spin-off between the ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic World"", with no value added. I don't care about budgets (it was always the thing that ultimately put the directors in charge to the bottom of the food chain, so to speak in the shadow of this movie's theme). Difficult to beat Steven Spielberg, no matter how much money you throw at the filming team. And you failed here, miserably.
2) Jason Statham acts in a kind of psychological sense for the most of the movie time, and trust me, this particular acting angle from this screenplay is not his forte
3) The Megalodon has like 30 seconds screen time? for a 1 hour 52 minutes movie? Heck, the Jurassic World - the Fallen Kingdom had more action in it, and less of the little of pseudo-action and the max of psychological work by Jason Statham.Unlike other reviewers, I have no intention to refer to any nations, producing or being audiences for the movie. It is absolutely unnecessary. The movie cannot defend itself, no matter who paid money for the screenplay, the acting crew, and the laughable CGI. (and I thought that ""Deep Blue Sea"" of 1998 was a bad movie).This movie in itself is a MAJOR flop, no matter who financed it. I understand Jason Statham has bills to pay and that may be the only redemeeing characteristics in this situation, as long as barely anyone (excluding me) notices that performance as selling out for money. I understand the need, however I choose to review the movie using my criteria, impartial to actors, screenplay authors, or directors, and the final review score is 1/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Trust me, it's stupid, yet simultaneously disposable fun. Unfortunately, it frequently takes itself too seriously and holds back on its absurdity to be deemed as a success. A research team explore the depths of the ocean where they soon discover a giant creature roaming the oceanic floor. ""It's a megalodon"" exclaims Statham in his gruff voice, who really was the only viable individual to make that line feel epic. He, and the rest of the cast, are clearly enjoying themselves as they battle against the gargantuan fish before it reaches civilisation. Both Bingbing and Statham have waves of personality that allow them to become investible, it's a shame that the rest of the crew were one-dimensional expendables. The screenplay forcibly injected banter and humour in an attempt to come across as self-aware, but ultimately felt drier than a beached whale. It worked for certain actors, particularly Statham, Bingbing and Cai, yet unsuccessful for Wilson and Kennedy. A tsunami of clichés, intellectual characters performing stupid actions and lucky escapes littered the plot. But that's when the film works. When it knows how absurd the premise is and fully embellishes in its B-movie tropes, in particular the third act. I was smiling, face-palming and eye-rolling as we witness a cute fluffy dog paddling away from the incoming jaws of death. Had that been maintained throughout, this would've been genius. Alas, it left me wanting more, lacking in gore and deaths. The technical aspects were decent, especially the visual effects. The ocean floor looked like it's own unique ecosystem, and the titular beast was colossal. The size ratios were depicted excellently. It's a shame that 'The Meg' was on a leash. Had that restraint been removed, we may have been in for a fishy treat. Fortunately Statham dives in to save this film from total disrepair as he confidently assures us that ""it's a megalodon"". Yeah, I want that as my ringtone.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It definitely doesn't reach the level of entertainment of classics like Jurassic Park or Jaws, but I don't think that's what they were going for in production despite some audience critics coining it a Jaws ripoff.

Ignoring the false facts, because the blue whale is actually larger than the megalodon was, using the numbers they give in the movie and the images you see it doesn't seem like the meg could get in some of the locations that it got into and I don't think it would want to eat a human given that it is big enough to eat a whale I don't think a human would be big enough to catch its attention that would be like a grizzly bear eating a mouse. The movie does have some neat special effects but that's about all that's good of this movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

We all remember when we first watched Jaws and how amazing that film has stood the test of time, we also remember Deep Blue Sea and how that was almost a comedy, The Meg sits between these in my eyes.It all centers around a gigantic Shark otherwise known as a Megaladon terrorising and underwater lab while the billionaire funding it is on a visit to congratulate the staff on their success. A pretty girl and 2 colleagues get ambushed in a smaller vessel by the shark and someone makes the decision to call in Mr Statham to save the day which he duly delivers, however, thats just the start.2 hours later the film is concluded and a few things impressed me, firstly I didn't see the twist coming and I liked it even if it wasn't particularly believable, some of the tongue in cheek lines are delivered well and some of the suspense was captured well, but, Stathams abysmal American accent coupled by some truly shocking acting from those around him made this film laughable in places, to this day I still don't know why no director has walked up to Statham and told him to stop the voice and they'll change the writing as it would be easier than listening to his attempts amusing as they may be.The Meg is a good fun action romp with many holes and flaws but, isn't unwatchable and you may even surprise yourself and actually enjoy this Holywood B movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Bored-stiff on a Wednesday night with a TV Remote in my hand. Somehow, I found myself gawking on a movie called ""The Meg"". At first, I thought I was on to something cool. Unfortunately, seconds into the film cute little ""Lori"" gets a nice pat on the back for having been a successful eco-terrorist. I almost turned it off right then but I was still bored. That was really dumb...uhh, whoever came up with the idea. Luckily, there was no other mention of that kind of Hollyweird stupidity. Looking back, I kinda doubt Hollywierd was all that involved. Is there one of those in China?So, honestly, there's not much more to review. Statham is what he is, and so is everyone else. There's a couple of scary big sharks (that the SE guys didn't do a very good job in keeping with scale... at all) and some almost lovey drama. I kept waiting for the typical Hollyweird nod to gayness but alas, it never happened. I mean, unless Ruby Rose WAS the typical nod to gayness but, whatever.Different strokes for different folks I guess. I'm rating a 3/10 because, well... they tried real hard. Today, I sat through an hour plus of listening to my wife laugh like a Hyena for about an hour.5. I finally went and asked what the hell was so funny and found she'd been watching ""The Meg"". I don't know her rating, and I don't think I laughed at all. I grimaced a little, and might have smirked a grin but... no laughing. I think the wife would probably go with a 6/10 or so, based on comic content alone. Not sure though.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A frightful direction and vibrant special effects provide a serviceable summer-end movie. Fans of shark flicks may want to check it out.The movie follows a Shanghai-based, deep-sea team as they seek to postulate new discoveries among the underwater trenches. However, their discoveries go awry when a previously thought extinct Megalodon attacks their submersibles and threatens to roam the Shanghai seas. With time on the run, team leader Dr. Zhao (Winston Chao) recruits former rescue diver Jonas (Jason Statham). Unbeknownst to everyone, Jonas has previously encountered the same Megalodon and must now confront his fears to save those aboard.Jason Statham, as Jonas, is always a vibrant presence with his charm and smarm making gold of the cheesy script. He also excels in his underwater stunts, creating some nail-biting thrills. Bingbing Li, as Suyin, proves herself as a smart, yet impatient presence, who wants to prove herself. However, she does fall key to an unnecessary clichéd father-daughter subplot, but makes the best of what she is given. Winston Chao, as Dr. Zhang, greatly presents his fears and desperation for Suyin and the mission, in spite of the weak backing for the emotional stakes of the two. Rainn Wilson, as Jacks, heightens his stereotypical rich guy presence with well-timed remarks alike his in The Office. Shuya Sophia Cai, as Meiyang, is my favorite character in her banter with Statham and brave actions power her from just being a 8-year-old damsel in distress. She truly excels in her first, breakout role. Ruby Rose, Page Kennedy, and Cliff Curtis complete the rest of the pack, each giving a unique performance, even if the characters can be viewed as expendable at times.Jon Turteltaub's direction allows for brisk thrills taking inspiration from Jaws, but allowing for his own unique takes on the genre. My favorite scene is the final act, as it goes all in with the illogic of the shark conflicts allowing for a fun conclusion. The other flaws are the inconsistency of the tone and writing of the movie, which goes from serious to knowingly funny at times and the placement of the scenes feels off at times. The movie also suffers by detracting from the shark conflict and focusing on poorly written character situations. In fact, it takes a long amount of occasionally grueling time and development for the Megalodon to even show up.The movie's message is that being a hero can come with its fair share of compromises. I give this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, because of intense action, gore and some language.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The Meg knows what it is, a ridiculous, over the top, big budget movie about an extinct shark back from the depths and it rarely takes itself too seriously, which is good because when the movie takes a turn for the serious it begins to feel like it's losing its self awareness. The comedy isn't amazing but it's not the absolute worst I've seen, it's just kind of there. The VFX are probably why you would decide to watch this movie and the question is, do they deliver? Well, yes and no. Sometimes the effects can be quite stunning, particularly in the first 3rd of the movie, this also happens to be the most focused portion of the film. The effects begin to look worse when the shark is under the gaze of sunlight, highlighting it's imperfections but it still looks alright for the most part and has some pretty cool scenes. The 2nd act onwards gets a little messy and it only really continues this trajectory. The effects seem to be substantially worse in the final 3rd for some reason, I can think of many reasons why but I would only be theorising which would be counterproductive so... moving on. The soundtrack is decent, not astounding but has its highlights, it's notably more enjoyable at it's most subtle, building tension. The acting is pretty damn subpar but it's Jason Statham and Ruby Rose, what do you expect? At the end of the day this is a relatively mediocre movie but it's a shark movie which we don't get many of, at least not with this kind of budget and for that reason, I respect The Meg and has a decent time but if you aren't a fan of the bloodthirsty, doll eyed menaces of the sea that are movie sharks, you won't get much from this. For the average person, probably a 4/10 but for the shark movie fan, I've gotta throw a couple extra points up.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This assassin shark was accidentally released from an icy barrier of hydrogen sulphide, and now it swims freely until the always present hero comes up with the idea that will prevent people from perishing at its jaws. Jason's usual unexceptional performance is demanded, and a demanding audience could agree on his lines luck of originality. It could be said that it is nothing but a popcorn movie with some entertaining and humorous moments to enjoy. Special effects are not always credible, and most of the times are overexaggerated. So, if you do not have anything to do, and you want to waste a couple hours of your life, go to the cinema, at least this movie is not an enormous disappointment to watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was very wrong. The dialogue is terribly written and uninteresting. The movie takes it sweet time getting to the action scenes and when it does eventually get to the action you know exactly what's going to happen before it happens. Every shark movie clique that exists is in this movie which wouldn't be so bad in a self aware movie or a parody but this movie takes itself so seriously as if it's a modern day (Jaws) when really it's actually worse than (Sharknado 2).The acting is truly awful throughout this movie not one actor looks interested in what's meant to be going on around them even Jason Statham looks like he's just on auto pilot mode in this movie.There isn't much violence or blood in this movie which is surprising as pretty much the only reason people went to see this movie is to see people get torn in half by a massive shark. A lot of the blood shown in this movie is CGI blood from either the shark itself or from other sea creatures that the shark eats like whales and fish chum. Only a few people actually get eaten by the shark and in most cases the shark just swallows them whole leaving no blood or body parts sometimes they don't even get the chance to scream the CGI just swallows them whole.The CGI isn't terrible the shark looks more believable than most modern day shark movies. The CGI blood however looks terrible and unrealistic.Interestingly the rights for this movie were originally sold back in 1997 after the book (The Meg) was released. Originally a movie based on the book was going to be made and released in 1998 but producers were worried about the movie having to compete with the other major shark movie due to be released that year (Deep Blue Sea) 1998 so the movie was pushed back and was ultimately axed until 2017 when The Meg was announced as officially in production. The funny thing is this movie is actually very similar to (Deep Blue Sea) and it actually takes a lot of inspiration from (Deep Blue Sea).I recommend watching The Meg if you have nothing better to watch and are just looking for something to pass the time with it's not worth owning on Blu Ray or UHD/4K at least in my opinion it's not.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But The Meg seemingly can't decide whether it wants to be cheesy over the top schlock or serious drama, as a result it fails miserably at both.Although the movie surely is ridiculous it never manages to reach that ""so bad it's good"" territory, unlike, say, Piranha 3D (2010) which excelled at it.And the drama fails on every level, from the dialogue to the acting which is cringeworthy, especially from the Chinese actors who seem to be struggling with every line, and Ruby Rose who just seem to be struggling with the concept of acting. I think there was supposed to be a love story between Statham and Bingbing, but it's difficult to tell since they have the chemistry of a wet sock.Speaking of Cina, Hollywood pandering (or groveling rather) to a repressive dictatorship (go there and you'll see what i mean) leaves a bad taste. But as long as someone is willing to pony up the dough Hollywood will bend over backwards with an eagerness to please, which is why we will never see a high budget Hollywood movie about the Tianmen massacre, just like we will never see a Hollywood movie about the Nakba or the oppression and wanton slaughter of Palestinians by the occupying regime. I doubt that a studio would make a movie like Red Corner (1997) today.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Directed by Jon Turteltaub, the film delivers exactly what its premise promises: oversized shark action with a side of campy fun.At its core, ""The Meg"" is a B-movie spectacle, embracing its absurd premise with gleeful abandon. From the moment the titular megalodon makes its grand entrance, the film revels in its own over-the-top spectacle, offering plenty of thrills and chills along the way.While the plot may be thin and the characters somewhat one-dimensional, the movie compensates with its sheer entertainment value. Jason Statham's rugged charisma carries the film as he battles the monstrous predator, while the supporting cast adds a touch of humor and camaraderie to the mix.Overall, ""The Meg"" is a guilty pleasure ride that's best enjoyed with a bucket of popcorn and a willingness to suspend disbelief. It may not be high art, but it delivers on its promise of big shark thrills and B-movie escapism.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not only was the writing and acting terrible, but even the editing seemed off which blows my mind. Jason Statham was really terrible as well since his acting was so bad it almost seemed like a mock on acting in general. The only cool part was the actual sharks but since that's all done these days through CGI it really doesn't earn the movie many rating points. Unfortunately I think there is a portion of the population who doesn't care about acting, editing etc and just want to see a big shark so I'm sure the movie made money but still doesn't mean it was any good.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, it took a bit longer than expected. And now I have to say that it wasn't worth the wait at all.The book is a lot more fun to read than Crichton's Jurassic Park and is in itself a perfect 90s blockbuster, full of awesome scenes and thrilling moments. Sadly, almost none of it has found it's way into the movie. Instead they changed everything beside the basic story and a few of the main characters, which were also more fun in the book.Overall they seemed to have made changes simply to make changes without any sense or inspiration. They didn't added any new ideas, concepts or anything original at all. The goal seemed to have been: This will be a shark movie for the audience of a Jason-Statham-Film, so let's make it as dumb as we can.What could have been a rival to the Jurassic Park franchise ends up as nothing than a B-Movie with bigger names and better effects. The absolutely stupid script has any trace of logic removed and showcases a team of scientists and specialists constantly acting like absolute idiots. You get all the cliches, horrible dialogue, unfunny jokes, foreseeable jump scares and stereotypical characters that you could have seen in any other random shark film of your choosing. The only difference is that this shark is bigger.Statham does a great job as usual in the hero role. The rest of the cast is great, but has little to do except constantly falling off boats, like this is one of the Jaws sequels. The effects and the underwater action are really good, but that is practically the whole fun factor of the movie.The Meg is okay to watch on a Friday night, but barely enough to actually watch it till the end.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But let's say the Shark is bigger! Jason Statham is a great. Their he comes to the rescue few people but technically he has to make a decision of sacrificing a few people or risk death. But his decision didn't make a few people happy. Which is somewhat of a reality when people blame each other. But is that the plot? What happened with the Shark? The Shark basically bangs the subs and the boats. However what I find annoying is some of the characters say wow, as something beautiful is happening. The confusing part is the picture is not very colorful or eye popping. It's dark and nothing is there.The last act wasn't very interesting but had funny scenes. As the Shark goes through the beach filled with Chinese people, I don't see the purpose why the scene is important. It doesn't go nowhere with the plot. Killing sharks is so lame. Jason Statham is badass on how he kills it.The music with Mickey your so fine in Chinese version. That music was cringy. The Meg is good entertainment. But you would probably forget about it in the next day.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well I think both, providing there is a 'Cringe-worthy' film award ceremony to be introduced because of films, like this one, that unashamedly flirts with asininity.Mr Stratham plays an ex Naval Captain Hero and expert rescue diver and, it seems, body builder, Jonas Taylor who, five years earlier, had been milling about on a mission in unexplored regions of the Mariana Trench. This is where he first encounters 'The Megalodon', a very large and extinct shark like sea creature that is looking for a crass movie to star in, so it badgers Jonas to the extent of him having to abort his mission and abandon some of his crew. Of course, no one believes Jonas saw this rubbery shark, including a certain Dr. Heller who survived the mission.
Jonas' career, along with his marriage, ends after a dishonourable discharge.We are moved on five years, and a billionaire called Jack Morris has set up an underwater research facility off the coast of China called 'Mana 1'. Morris hires oceanographers, Dr Zhangh and his daughter Suyin, to supervise a mission to explore further depths of the Mariana Trench. The mission is being conducted, in a submersible, by Jonas Taylors' ex wife, Lori, and two other colleagues. After managing to penetrate a cloud of hydrogen in the depths of the trench, they run into unforeseen difficulties and soon become aware that there is something very large lurking in the depths around them. A ferocious attack from outside ensues and the submersible is buffeted and rammed and loses contact with 'Mana 1'. Lori gets injured badly and the mission starts turning into a nightmare as the submersible is rendered immobile.There is only one man who can save the day! Jonas Taylor. This is agreed by all on ''Mana '1, apart from Dr Heller who survived the original mission with Jonas. He thinks Jonas is traumatised and has lost the plot and would be a liability. After deliberation it is decided that Dr. Zhang, along with one of his colleagues, should go to see Jonas and ask for his help. They don't seem deterred by the fact that Jonas is now a washed out drunk who is not sure what accent to use in the film and is currently hanging out on some Taiwanese beach.The meet occurs and Jonas appears quite stoic and is adamant that he will have nothing to do with their problems. Well, would you Adam and Eve it, Jonas ends up changing his mind, who would've thought? Maybe it has something to do with the fact that his ex is in peril. So off they go. Hoorah!Soon after Jonas arrives at 'Mana 1', Dr Zhang's daughter, Suyin, decides to exasperate the situation by taking another submersible deep into the trench to try and help her trapped colleagues. This ends up in disaster as her vessel is grabbed and shaken violently by a giant Squid which is also looking for a bit part in the film. Come on Jonas, hurry up, things are looking bad mate !So off he goes, Jonas, down into the deep, but not before consoling Suyin's daughter, Meiying, who it seems, has already decided that if everyone else is acting poorly around her, then so will she.From here on in we see the usual close shaves with the predator and Jonas parading heroic qualities
while his brow appears to be the star of the film, furrowing at every word that is spoken.Poor dialogue, poor acting and so-so special effects culminate in the current fodder that is being pushed out at an alarming rate these days, still, I think the kids might enjoy it","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even on an IMAX screen, it moves along with all the pace of a milk-float even despite the lively contributions from the enthusiastic Jason Statham as he attacks the leviathan with a glorified Stanley knife.

The experiment works and the crew is amazed by their new discoveries until something violently attacks their ship leaving them stranded on the bottom of the ocean.With a limited amount of air and time ticking away, Jonas is recruited despite his numerous refusals as not only is one of the stranded people his ex; but the last transmission sent by the sub mentions how Jonas had been right all along when he had years early claimed they were not alone during the rescue attempt gone bad.Jonas is teamed with a spirited member of the team named Suyin (Bingbing Li), who has taken a sub down ahead of Jonas as she was not willing to wait for outside help to arrive. She locates her comrades and is attacked by a massive shark long thought extinct.The harrowing rescue goes off but again Jonas is faced with a no-win situation and is blamed by a former colleague for the issues.While Morris is eager to exploit the new find for the huge financial opportunity it presents, their plans change when the creature emerges from its contained area and threatens a level of carnage on the seas the likes of which society and the ecosystem are very unprepared for.What follows is a frantic and often intense series of engagements as Jonas and the crew must battle the massive and deadly creature and find a way to survive.
The film has some very solid effects and the intensity at times had people in the press screening partially covering their eyes during some of the more harrowing moments.The cast is solid and work well with one another as the film does what it can to keep some of the characters from being little more than generic victims for the Meg.The movie does differ from the book in terms of being set off China versus California but this was largely due to the joint-production with Chinese owned Gravity Pictures. The film is also much less gory than the book as Director Jon Turteltaub was mandated to deliver a PG-13 film by the studio to improve the odds of returning on the $150.00 million invested in the film. The dialogue is also a bit stilted and formulaic in parts but action films are not known for their complex plots or advanced dialogue and I attributed this largely to the challenges of a blended cast; many of whom do not speak English as their primary language.Despite a delay from its planned 2017 release date, ""The Meg"" is a solid and fun action-thriller that gives audiences one of the best excuses not to go swimming since ""Jaws"". While there have been numerous Shark films over the years, ""The Meg"" deftly weaves good sets and production values with a top-notch cast and lavish visuals to bring the film to life.With several other books in the series already available, I hope we see the next film surface in a few years as I cannot wait to see what comes next

Well, if anyone goes into the theater with high expectations, then you haven't been to the movies since the 90s. Following 1975's Jaws, Hollywood has been trying to replicate the success of the most influential shark film of all-time ... Which only happens to be the only great shark movie since that time.When I am about to watch this kind of films, my approach is always the same: if the movie is able to acknowledge its absurd plot and its dumbness, then I am all open to enjoy some simple-minded fun. However, if the film starts to go over its head, wanting something with more emotional weight and meaningful storylines, that is where I get frustrated. If your movie is filled with stereotypical characters, a generic plot, and a bunch of incongruencies, at least own it.This is where The Meg fails to deliver. It does not know what it wants to be, the balance of tones is intolerable. Sometimes it tries to go for that dumb comedy with a lot of forced punchlines, but then it shifts, and Jon Turteltaub wants some character to cry over someone's death, literally a few minutes after another character makes a joke following yet another shark's meal. Turteltaub presents a really bad direction, regarding both story and cast.Not only was he unable to establish what his film was going for, but he also didn't support his actors and actresses with the best pieces of advice. There are so many awkward moments with a lot of unfunny lines, and it can't be all the script's fault. Of course, the writers did a poor job writing the main plot and the character's scripts, but Turteltaub must know how to smooth that stuff out.The story is as generic as you would expect. There is a monstrous shark that only kills non-protagonist characters because plot armor is something very relevant to the logic of a movie (not). Characters do stupid stuff that not even the dumbest person on Earth would do. Five minutes in and you can guess the entire story, and I mean details and everything. It is that obvious. Oh, and there is a romance. Almost forgot that incredibly developed subplot, uff!Honestly, there are so many plot devices and so much silliness that even if the film owned it, I don't know how much of it I could take. Primarily due to the not-that-amusing script. I genuinely got angry with the shark because it had just eaten someone in a specific situation and literally in the next attack, a character is in the exact same conditions, and yet the shark decides to simply not do anything. If you want to protect your most important characters, at least put them through different circumstances, ones that I can look at with my blind eyes and think ""you know what, maybe he/she could have actually survived that.""The casting is also pretty bad. I mean, Jason Statham is a badass as usual. He is always the one that carries these films and does not let them sink into the bottom of the ocean. It is evident that his character is the one that really matters since he is the only one receiving a compelling backstory, so naturally I care about him. Everyone else, not really. Bingbing Li (Suyin) is there for the forced romance, Rainn Wilson (Jack Morris) has the typical bigger-than-life personality of a billionaire, Sophia Shuya Cai is the adorable little girl, and everyone else is dispensable.My issue is that even if the scripts are erroneousap, the actors make them even worse. Apart from Wilson, Li and Cliff Curtis (Mac), who don't shine but don't exactly screw up, everyone else is horrible. Page Kennedy (DJ) is supposedly the funniest character since he has all the punchlines and jokes. I mean, literally, every line he says is a joke. Problem is most of them are terrible. Ruby Rose (Jaxx) is so awful, especially when she has to cry. It is so poorly performed that a child could notice it is fake as hell. There are so many bad performances that I am surprised Statham didn't get caught by this wave.Nevertheless, Statham and the Megalodon save this film from an even worse review. I am genuinely surprised at how freaking awesome the shark looks. Not only I was not expecting it looking so great, but the action scenes are also mostly pretty cool (having in mind the irrational part). The underwater scenes are very well-filmed, there was never an overly dark background, and the editing is seamless.There are some clear influences from Jaws, mainly when it comes to the suspenseful moments. Even if the first two acts are sloppy, the last act is great fun, and it has a lot of fantastic shots of the giant shark. Entertainment-wise, it matters most how a movie ends than how it starts, so The Meg has that aspect going for it. Unfortunately, it doesn't succeed, and it definitely does not belong to the enormous (haha) list of ""good shark films.""All in all, you don't really have to shut down your brain to actually enjoy this movie. The Meg follows pretty much every single thing you would expect from it, but it has a fantastic lead from the badass Jason Statham and a beautiful-looking colossal shark, which provides some chilling action scenes. Sadly, these two are the only good things about this flick with a generic plot, stereotypical characters, illogical moments and a bad casting. If you planned on seeing it, go for it. Maybe you like it, maybe you don't. If you didn't plan seeing it, then skip it. Not really worth it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

You will notice weird reactions in abnormal situations, for example: when they survive a shark attack and jump to the boat, they start to laugh to each other and celebrate as the shark is dead, but it's still in the water and can attack them again, and by the way this happened a lot.Most probably this happened due to the chinese touch on the movie, who tend to show cuteness in very intense situations.The plot is simple but has many layers, once you think they are safe, a bigger problem happens, and this is a good thing. They also did every complication could happen in a Shark movie, even if some of them is copied from other movies.""Jason Statham"" is the main character who always has solid face with least amount of reactions and a smile or two to the female star, all other characters did their roles well, but you may notice similarities between this cast and the cast of ""Titanic"", it's obvious when you see the man who controls the robot in ""Titanic"" and the guy in the submarine, is it a chance ? May be.The visual effects are acceptable here, we didn't have a chance to see the outer shape of the marine station properly, also the meg didn't look scary because we didn't see enough details of it.The main problem with the script that everything is expected, starting from the winning sides, till the dying characters which are a lot here, that the living ones didn't react to their deaths by even one tear.Finally, it's an average shark disaster movie, it can be enjoyable if you ignored the little details and looked to the whole movie as one piece. I doubt you will be bored as the events pass very quickly and the fights continue till the end.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film delivers on that summer-fun promise, while also exceeding expectations in terms of action and set-pieces. There are funny moments, mostly in the dialogue, and Jason Statham saves the film from drowning in the deep blue sea. Unfortunately the production does not dare to go further and remains at times as a B movie. ""The Meg"" is one of the summer's most fun, most mindless blockbusters that you love to hate. The movie is certainly no ""Jaws"" but thanks to a diverse cast of characters you can actually care about and some well-placed action scenes, ""The Meg"" is much better than it ever had any right to be.

First of all the characters had no personality they were just there to move the plot forward and some of them were completely useless or just comic relief (im looking at you DJ).The acting was in general mediocre, not even Statham charisma could save his completely hollow and boring character. But who watches this kind of movie for the character development? no one...you watch this for the action scenes and to see some cool giant shark destroying stuff and eating people....well very few of that either, the action was very predictable, you knew exactly who will get eaten and you never really fear for the safety of the main characters. The beach scene could have been the only memorable scene of the movie but it was completely wasted. To put it into one sentence, this movie was so boring...and so bad but not the kind thats good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nobody in the history of cinema has ever done a good shark movie aside from Steven Spielberg, and this high budget thriller is no exception. I thought it would be a fun summer movie to see with my girlfriend, but nope. Don't waste your time, and rewatch Jaws.There were far too many jumpscares, to the point where the movie relied on it. The lead actor for Jonas was your stereotypical big, tough action hero, with a tragic back story. He's stoic, gets the girl, and speaks in mostly one liners, with his deep raspy voice. Nothing new, boring. There was too much humour to take it seriously. The only thing that scared you were the jump scares because it had no psychological value like Jaws. Jaws show the shark only a couple time the whole movie and it kept people out of the water, because it got into people's heads. This film had millions of dollars in CGI and didn't have the same effect. One reason is due to the humour, it's hard to tell if this film is satire at times because it sure feels like it.  Not enjoyable, don't waste your time or money.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That being said, they have entirely butchered it. Why are Australian actors faking American accents, but the rest of the actors speak in their Australian inflections normally? The shark also doesn't really seem to be the main point of the film, its more the interactions of the crew. The CGI is shoddy at best, and to be quite honest it just didn't catch the attention of anyone in my family. I've seen worse, but its as if they didn't try very hard in this one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie succeeds when it's unself-aware and unintentionally funny, for example the overdone cliches that are clearly from an old draft of the script like: attractive goth chick that says exposition, black dude being the comedic relief, character dying and saying dialogue to the protagonist, speaking computer informing us about danger, characters breaking character and the list goes on. From the positives: some of the music was good and didn't sound like stock music, the creature interactions were seamless and some characters not being one dimensional.
Of course the screenplay is dated, barely any scenes bring tension, the acting is sub par, the shark cgi laughable, but i truly don't need that much from a creature movie. Being objective, this isn't the worst movie of all time, hell I believe that this isn't the worst movie of 2018 since the competition is huge, but the biggest crime such a movie can do is being so bland that you get bored and don't even have enough energy to constantly laugh about the mistakes of the filmmakers. This movie would benefit from being more self aware, sticking our protagonists in a place where the escape is hard, well written character-driven comedy and most importantly going over the top as it is a movie where a 75 meter shark kills people.
I don't really reccomend it, but I have heard that it is great when you are stoned...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The original Jaws was far more scary and had better special effects. Sometimes the shark was HUGE, sometimes it wasn't that much bigger than other objects. It isn't scary to see a monster that looks fake. The bigger issue was there was no original story here. And Stratham always is in the same movie - he is washed up and drinking, someone appeals to him and pulls him into an emergency situation to save the day. In this case 4 times. Nothing original, movie went on way too long.

The storyline follows a deep sea expedition that gets stranded at the bottom of the ocean. A underwater ocean excavator known for being the best at rescuing crews is retired after his last mission went poorly. When he discovers his ex wife is on the stranded vessel he comes out of retirement. Little does he know some ghosts from his past is waiting for him on the ocean floor...This picture is directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings) and stars Jason Statham (Snatch), Li Bingbing (Transformers: Age of Extinction), Cliff Curtis (Sunshine), Rainn Wilson (The Office) and Ruby Rose (John Wick 2).Any movie that had a human out swimming a shark is bad...I don't care if the human is Jason Statham. The storyline made sense for the premise, the CGI was solid, and there's a few funny one liners that will make you giggle. There's a ""jelly fish"" swim scene that's far and away the best part of the movie and brought a smile to my face. But other than that, this is a cheesy, cliche shark attack film, with a useless love story that's ridiculous (on purpose) and not really worth your time. This has none of the charm the characters and plot gave us in Deep Blue Sea.In conclusion, this is a Hollywood, big budget shark attack that's only enjoyable if you shut your brain off and have low expectation. I would score this a 4/10 and recommend skipping it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It turned out to be painful to watch and poorly acted. Unfortunately the main issue was Jason Statham, his performance was terrible, he is far more suited to London gangster type movies, I couldn't figure out what accent he was supposed to have, as far as I could tell he was from either London, USA, South Africa or Australia!!! The rest of the acting was awful, it had the usual shark jumps but other than that I'd advise that this film is avoided.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The book was about a publicly humiliated scientist who was trying to prove a prieviously thought extinct 'megladon' is real. It eventually turns out that it is, and he is the only one who knows who to defeat it. The book focuses on the grief and shame of being called out by the public, marriages that are falling apart, and losing your friends. The movie has some of those elements in it, but it does not focus on those whatsoever. Instead, it becomes a monster movie. It is ridiculous, but not on sharknado levels. It also doesn't try to be Jaws, by any means, so it's kind of stuck in between being a stupid and funny shark flick, and a series character compelled thriller. The special effects are good enough to not distract, and the scenery is vibrant and colorful. The plot is very thin, but the action makes up for it, filling in the gaps. My main problems with The Meg were its focus on the shark and not the characters, and how far away it strays from the source material. At least it has Dwight in it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That being said, he should be eaten by a shark just for being in this movie. This movie was just plain bad. Acting and boring one liners where cliche and to tell the truth, kind of irritating. Casting was just terrible. Some of the actors just had no business being in the movie (or even acting period) cause they just didn't fit and it felt out of place for me just watching this mess. If I had to make a guess, I'd say there was some ""China"" money in this cause that's what it seemed to be geared for.

I heard that Jason was a little bummed on the way this movie turned out. Well he should be REALLY bummed cause it ended up being nothing more than shark food. Some reviews here rated this as a 10. Are you seriously kidding me on that? No matter how crappy a movie turns out, someone will always give it a 10. Another unfortunate but typical these days, Hollywood junk movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What's not to like? The sad fact is nowadays every person goes into a shark movie expecting Jaws or certainly a movie to rival jaws. You cannot beat perfection and The Meg doesn't try to. It delivers exactly what it sets out to do & knows what it is. Jason Statham is a lot better than I expected in the lead role and supported by a decent cast. Yes several of them are only there to deliver quips and one liners but it's still done well. 
 Loosely based on the book Meg: A Novel Of Deep Terror by Steve Alten (if you haven't read the book series I'd suggest doing so, they are excellent). Yes it's not the same as the book but movies seldom are. If you want a good action adventure with a very big well done CGi shark then Meg is definitely worth a watch!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

They need good actors (check), editing that keeps the pace moving (check), special effects that don't make me laugh (check), and writing that doesn't get in the way of enjoying the adrenaline rushes (check). So I would never come into this expecting a masterpiece.I also like to give each movie a clean slate. The temptation to compare this movie to Jaws is an obvious one. It did seam like the writing in movies back then was in general more sophisticated, and assumed more intelligence from the audience. I did notice that difference in this case, but I frankly did not care. I liked the characters, and the actors depiction of them, and I'm not going to expect them to put in some wise cranky old guy to add depth to the movie. It just didn't need that. Again, my goals were to be wildly entertained and scared to the point where I involuntarily drew my feet up onto the couch to avoid getting ""bitten"" (yes that happened).Although the ploy to entice Chinese audiences was obvious, I loved all the actors, so I didn't care about that. If they want to movie to take place over there, fine, it didn't effect the movie at all.So for me, this had just the right amount of action, character connection, and fright. It completely entertained me. Not every movie I watch is required to make me think afterward, and especially not a shark movie. I loved watching this so much. it ranks 10 as a shark movie. Now if this level of writing was attempting to be something more sophisticated the rating would be lower. But it was not trying to be something like that. It fully hits the expectation for it's genre.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's just plausible enough to be believed, as far as movie-making goes. And at least it didn't have an underlying ""We're killing the planet"" undertone. I also like seeing Jason Stratham play a different type of role where he saves folks instead of killing everyone. The special effect for the Megalodon is perfectly done showing a species that has been living for a long time in the depth of the ocean, Also showing just how menacing and dangerous these things truly are. The Meg is a perfect example of what would happen if a Megalodon was still alive today in our time. Throughout most of the movie, the film is extremely intense from start to finish special the scene when chaos ensues as the Megalodon attacks.I sometimes wonder what people expect from this sort of film.

However, the movie still managed to exceed even my greatest expectations for campiness. ""The Meg,"" as my review title suggests, is much less in the vein of Spielberg's classic thriller and more like recent productions such as ""Deep Blue Sea"" or even ""Sharknado."" Most of the movie's half-hearted attempts at suspense are obvious long before they come and the plot is filled with common, popcorn movie tropes like profit-hungry villainy personified by Rainn Wilson. The movie's actors were decent for the most part, actually but the characters have such ""shallow"" backgrounds that you find yourself straining to care for their survival. Spoiler alert: Some characters WILL get eaten by the Meg. In truth, I have rarely wasted time with Statham movies in the past. This is not because I have any particular animus against Statham, but because I almost always know what to expect from his wasted talents. This movie was no exception. Statham, ever the action hero, played the role with aplumb by injecting the role with typical grit and energy. Nevertheless, watching him play out a character we've seen on the screen countless times previously is exhausting, and even more so when forced to watch him repeatedly chased by a massive CGI monster that only grows more adept at successfully eating its victims. There is a plot ""twist"" (if you can call it that), which I won't ruin but it comes so late and with such little payoff that once again, I found myself yawning after the reveal.I started out watching this movie with an open-mind but was chuckling in disbelief and wondering why I didn't wait for this movie to hit Redbox, by the time the credits rolled. Do yourself a favor by not wasting an hour and fifty-three minutes with this garbage or if you really can't help yourself, wait for a Redbox promo code.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

During their investigation, they are attacked by a mammoth, 23-meter sea creature (Carcharodon Megalodon), believed to be extinct for more than a million years. There is only one person who can save them, the rest of the crew recruit them in order for him to save the others.Since it's a Sci-Fi movie with a big shark I had low expectations from this movie and I wasn't disappointed by it. It's an average movie to watch, I am sure that you will have a good time and you are going to enjoy it but don't expect deep meanings from this movie or outstanding interpretations by its cast. I liked the plot of this movie because it was a bit different than other movies of the same type, there were some cliché but this is understandable, and I have to admit that I liked the interpretation of Rainn Wilson who played as Morris and he gave a different touch in the whole duration of the movie.To sum up, I have to say that ""The Meg"" isn't a bad movie, you just have to be prepared of what exactly you are going to watch and what this movie is all about. After you know all of these then you are ready and I believe that you are going to have a good time watching it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There was a tease of things to come and the characters all seemed likable: even the eccentric hipster billionaire.An expensive research center and research team is somewhere in the ocean not too far from China. They've discovered possibly the deepest part of the ocean that's hidden beneath a layer of hydrogen sulfide. Beneath this layer of extremely cold gas is where they run into the meg. The meg was happy as a clam in its hidden world until some nosy researchers intruded upon it. Now it must break free and feast upon the new world.I was OK with all of that. If that's how we get to see a megalodon in action, so be it. But then the movie fell into some tired tropes. The two most abominable were the a-hole billionaire and the superfluous destruction.I cannot name the movies where the rich guy is the jerk. It's almost like: he has money so he must be a bad guy. Like every single rich person is a worm because how else would he have gotten rich? It's so played out. Please try something else.And the gratuitous destruction to enhance the drama is old as well. Like: ""They may actually be safe, or this plan may actually work. Let's foul something up to create more deaths and/or make things a bit more hairy."" Sometimes plans don't work and sometimes people die but don't make the reason be because of some impossibly rare occurrence.Like all action movies there were your heroes and goats. That never determines who lives or dies, it just determines how significant your death will be in the case you do die. They made a few too many deaths overly tragic and overly courageous. You're doing a movie about a 90 foot shark, you're not getting an Oscar for it so enough of the dramatic death scenes. The Meg is supposed to be fun with a high death toll nothing more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A Fun Film That Gives You What You Expect","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9248318/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","9 August 2023","In prep for Meg 2: The Trench, I thought I had to go back and watch the first film, The Meg. So yesterday, I watched the film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of scientists encounter a legendary Sea predator, The Megalodon who is clearly the apex predator.Main Character
Jason Statham plays Jonas Taylor and he is exactly what you expect. Statham plays the traditional character that he always does, the tough macho guy that ends up being this ridiculous action hero doing the craziest of stunts here. The Meg is no different, Statham is good in the role he is playing but there is no depth here and the film kind of tries to add depth but it is totally pointless and Statham doesn't do enough, though he is clearly a highlight of the film.Supporting Characters
Cliff Curtis is a talented actor and he is pretty much the only decent supporting character here. He is a friend of Statham's and their chemistry is one of the highlights of the film, though he kind of gets pushed to the back of this large cast.The rest of the cast though are not good. Bingbing Li plays the love interest of Statham and there is very little chemistry between them and I guess I just never grew to care about the dynamic between the two of them which is a shame.Rainn Wilson is usually an actor I like, but he is insufferable here. He plays the rich CEO of the company that is studying The Meg and you can just imagine what he is like and it just didn't work for me and he was just annoying.As I mentioned, there is a big cast and some annoying performances by Ruby Rose, Page Kennedy & Robert Taylor. They are just unlikeable and you don't care about them at all despite the film really trying to make you care.Story
Look, I didn't go into this film expecting a great story but there is literally nothing here to really care about. We're not here for great storytelling, we are here to watch Jason Statham fight The Meg and I am fine with that but yeah the story is bad and there is no depth here.Script
Th script is extremely cheesy but I can't lie that I chuckle at times, if you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the experience then some of it works. Some of it also doesn't, the drama is misused and some of the humour isn't very funny either.Style
Where the film really thrives is the style. The action set pieces are really fun, they are ridiculous and over the top but they are great to watch and a lot of fun. The CGI is also pretty good and I liked the design of The Meg and how it was used. The films pacing flew by and I thought it was a really easy watch which is always a benefit.Overall
Overall, The Meg is an average film, but it is a very entertaining watch. If you just want a film that is ridiculous, over the top and fun then The Meg is for you, but if you need a bit more depth then it will not be you.Rating - 5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film promises stupid funny moments. The final result, however, is less satisfying than it should have been. Of course, I did not expect the film to be any good in the first place. If you expect Oscar-nominated performances, this film is not for you. That is not what I mean. The problem with 'The Meg', despite its colossal CGI effects, is that I never thought it would be as outright boring and painful to watch as it can be at times. The film exhibits so many clichés per minute that any intended tension or thrills lack any sort of surprise or excitement. With its poorly developed character and inept screenplay, this film is neither sufficiently good nor sufficiently bad. Although sufficiently stupid to be a fun ride, it is curiously not sufficiently stupid to be hilarious. 'The Meg' as a whole proves that a film can try to be so bad that it's good and yet fail.Grade: 3.1 / 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not Jaws good but probably on the level of the Jurassic World (Not Park) movies. If you saw the tailer, you know what to expect. The visuals were stunning, the creature affects were cool, storyline felt thrilling and realistic, and the characters were tolerable to some extent. You could definitely tell the producers jazzed up the cast to me more likable for an audience. They were ok. I didn't read the books. Whenever I do, the film adaption never meets my expectations. From what little I actually heard, even I knew Jason Statham was the wrong actor for the lead. I'm sure most of us film fanatics take movies less seriously when he's a cast member. To be honest though, he wasn't as irritable as I assumed he would be. Like he didn't diminish the movie. The Meg is a good summer monster movie. It's not an Oscar winner but its entertaining. I would consider it more of a giant monster action film over a shark horror movie.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Well you basically end up getting only one of these things, which is just the gore. The script and dialogue are simply dreadful. I'm almost convinced that Dean Georgaris might be the worst writer on planet earth. Every one-liner is so cringey. Every interaction between the characters felt like it was written by a toddler. Non-existent character arcs didn't help either. DJ literally felt like they just needed to have a black actor so they cast a random black guy and gave him the most annoying, useless, and utterly irritating character. I actually had to skip a lot of the dialogue because of how cringey it was. I simply couldn't sit through 2 hours of this. Not to mention how the movie was supposed to end twice during it's runtime but the writers just wanted to fill out their 2 hour runtime to the point where it felt like they were just making stuff up on the go. After 40 minutes the movie had reached an ending. 25 minutes later and the movie reaches yet another climax and it looks like it's finally ending. Only to find out that all you've just seen was only an hour of the movie's runtime and that you had to sit through another hour of a forced plot.

Lets face it, the majority of monster/disaster movies have terrible characters with limited development, who are propped up by clichés and stereotypes. The Meg takes this a step further with some of the most uninteresting and two dimensional characters I've seen. Statham really isn't great in this film as the typical hardman who comes out of retirement for one last dive. The wider cast are all wildly unforgettable and cliched. If you manage to get emotionally invested in any of these characters then I'd consider that an achievement.The plot was incredibly two dimensional - oh here's a shark, lets kill it (with this in mind though I can only admire Spielberg for somehow spinning Jaws into a good film). That's all there is to it. I know that most monster movies can be boiled down to a simple plot such as this, but even within this flimsy concept there seemed to be such little effort put into making a logical film. None of the decisions they took made sense and it makes for slightly frustrating viewing. The script is also painful at times. I felt like I'd heard all of these lines (or at least the sentiment behind them) a million times before. There was nothing original here, and the script enhanced all of the character stereotypes that drag this film down.I was also a little disappointed with the effects. They weren't awful, but weren't great either. Considering the film was focused solely on the Meg you'd have thought that the effects would be spot on.If you like monster films and films of this ilk you'll probably get some entertainment out of The Meg, but if you actually look for plot, good acting and an engaging script then look again as the Meg won't deliver.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The script is nothing new but that could have gone very right had there been any other redeeming quality to this movie... First of all it's the poor acting, combined with the lack of any film effect and the frames per second we've come to be used to in a movie, makes everything seem contrived, cheaply contrived at that. Or should i say the higher frame count simply is less forgiving of the acting. Then there's the characters who are utterly stereotypical and they would be fine if the movie were a parody and not trying to be a serious thrill. There's also the ""science"" which is quite nonsensical. That too could have potentially saved the movie by making the scenario seem the slightest bit plausible. There are a few tense moments that's true, which are helped a bit by the special effects we've come to expect in the age of computer generated graphics but those aren't quite enough to classify this as more than a B movie one watches when there's nothing else.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In my opinion it was watchable but that's about it. The storyline is shaky. The characters aren't developed well and the shark failed to scare me the way I felt it should have. I give them credit for coming up with the idea to use a megalodon but there are a lot of shark movies out there. You really have to bring it if you want to impress. This wasn't terrible and I am glad I watched it but I am disappointed. Out of the shark movies out there, not one, in my opinion, has been been able to top Jaws but I would eventually like to see one that can. That means you've got to do some serious investing into the characters and bring a story that will be gripping. You've got to make sure the dialogue is on point and the animatronics, CGI, stunts and additional effects have got to be mind blowing. It needs to be frightening but a visually stunning movie to help keep the audience's eyes on the screen even when they want to look away. I know this movie is out there somewhere!

The visual effects are impressive and the underwater sequences and shark attack moments are well done, keeping the viewers on edge. On the other hand, ""The Meg"" is a film based on a rather improbable premise from a scientific point of view, so some critics may find it too fantastical and far-fetched. Also, the story does not bring many surprising elements and is based on classic patterns of the genre. He performances of the actors are good and Jason Statham fits the role of a tough and brave hero perfectly. In addition, the film brings in some humorous moments that help lighten the mood and make ""The Meg"" a more entertaining experience.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Dumb, but Kind of Fun to Watch","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4283587/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","13 August 2018","Until films like Sharknado put a new spin on shark attack movies, Jaws was the best there was and ever will be. With the recent release of The Meg, I didn't have any hopes that it would come anywhere near the original, nor should anyone reading this, but if you're looking for a dumb movie to check out this summer, you can definitely do worse than The Meg. It's not exactly a good film by any means, but it's perfectly fine to turn your brain off every now and then in order to be excited by a film that has zero cleverness. Here's why I believe The Meg may impress you in terms of excitement, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.Discovering that there is more to the ocean than just what people have seen (which is already ridiculous, to begin with), a team of divers go to the depths that nobody has in the past. Learning that there are larger-than-life creatures living down there, one of them escapes, in the form of a giant Megalodon shark. Attacking everything in its path as it tries to prey on the weak, this film becomes the dumb blockbuster you would hope it would be, but not soon enough.The cast is filled with talented actors/actresses, from Jason Statham to Li Bingbing, everyone delivers solid enough performances for this type of film. That being said, the unlikely pairing of young Shuya Sophia Cai and Jason Statham was easily the highlight of the movie in my eyes. Their fun chemistry throughout the course of the movie is what kept a smile on my face. The humanity is definitely present here, but you go into a movie like this to see awesome shark action, and although it's not as crazy as it could be with an R-rating, it still delivers some very cool sequences.Many viewers will be going to see this film in order to witness Statham going toe-to-toe with a giant shark and I can say with confidence that there are moments that will surely give you satisfaction. Sadly, the climax itself doesn't feel long enough in comparison with the very drawn-out build-up to that point. On top of the slow build-up, the characterization of everyone is very one-note and quite frankly, forgettable.From Rain Wilson to Cliff Curtis, even though they deliver solid performances, the characters throughout this film are incredibly predictable. The people you don't think will make it, don't, and vice versa. There isn't a single moment of real tension, because you can see everything coming from a mile away. The visual effects make up for the dumb characters and ridiculous premise, but it really isn't enough to warrant a recommendation in the end.The Meg is held up on a pedestal by the numerous talents throughout the cast and the action itself is awesome when it does come into the forefront, but it was too little, too late, at least for me. If you want to check out a fun action flick with Jason Statham fighting a shark, then I would absolutely recommend it for that, but if you're looking for another film as great as the original Jaws, I would look elsewhere. I would be lying if I said I didn't have a bit of fun watching this movie, but as a whole, it really does feel like a lazy attempt to sell a giant shark film to an audience. As a film this movie is terrible, but due to the fact that it knows exactly what it's trying to be, it's watchable. That's not really a recommendation, but if that sounds like something up your alley, I'd say give it a shot","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's funny, it had all the tropes we expect, the characters we want to see, in a really satisfying package that's head and tails above the Sharknado movies in quality.It's so well made, the actors are so good (especially the little girl!), the effects so fantastic - I couldn't want anything more in a great summertime shark movie. This is just so much darned fun.I have to mention some comments I've seen denigrating the presence of Asian characters, and suggesting that the producers were interested in capturing the Asian audience. Frankly, such comments are embarrassing. Additionally, the movie was made in Australia, with a largely Australian cast, and a darned good one at that.Really glad I disregarded the surprisingly low rating and watched it.

His books combine some interesting theories of marine biology with science fiction.What didn't I like about the movie then?So what do we have here then? I'd say it's a slightly better version of Deep Blue Sea. At least when it comes to the animation of the shark, when you can actually see it. Which isn't that often.I understand that the Chinese market has become one of the most important markets for movies. However, letting the Meg go to Chinese shores, while some Chinese actors show some of the worst performances I have ever witnessed, it is just too much pandering to the audience.Then it's the language: When the female lead role speaks English, the pronunciation is over the top, and I can hardly listen to her without feeling put into an English lesson at school again.Overall: The whole movie makes you squirm. The action is ok. The ""romantic"" story totally unrelatable. And the Chinese tourist masses, who spend their lazy days at the overcrowded sea shores: I'd want them all to be eaten.That movie in the cinemas in 3D was acceptable popcorn cinema, but it didn't live up to the expectiation I had for that movie. Not even close.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Since Shakespeare once said that brevity is the soul of wit, I will try to keep this review short as well:The Meg has no wit. It is a standard horror flick that owes so much to the superior classic film, Jaws. This Chinese-American production, directed by Jon Turteltaub, offers some scares and gore, inconsistent visual effects that are far more animated than its rugged leading actor/action figure, Jason Statham, who grumbles his way throughout the movie, and a very formulaic plot in which only the dumb, villainous, or heroic will perish. Rest assured that no women, children, or cute dogs will be on this dinner menu with a standard screenplay by a trio of questionable writers, namely Dean Georgaris, Jon Hoeber, and Erich Hoeber. Parts of this movie are unintentionally laughable, with only Bingbing Li giving a resemblance of a performance as a strong-willed courageous heroine and single mom.The Meg is inane and somewhat inept seafaring chum. Its box office success and popularity is the film's real horror here.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action scenes aren't convincing with the characters especially the protagonists escaping and the visual effects were sometimes quite unbearable but was quite well done for The Meg excluding some attacking and engaging scenes. The story is very predicted in almost everything and the music written for the film is not much original and not powerful at all. The direction for the film is really not bad but weak along with the screenplay as most shark films focusing on the shark and leaving the story it's involved in. The movie lacked it's reality in the scenes and the ending which was the worst for me. And how in the hell is there a 25-27 meters shark that in most of the plots for the attacking scenes is withdrawn from one place to another by sound or light even when it's this close to it's pray!!! Now that was very unbearable and not even possible. The scenes when it would appear is very ordinary and predictable and looked like it's a group of a gigantic shark scenes linked together by a thread as a story with ordinary characters and one with a serious face along with a director trying to put it all together in it's order trying to convince us with it by saying ""Here is the most powerful and gigantic shark we can't defeat and here is it's weakness points that can't exist in it"". The story is not moving,thrilling but still entertaining. 4.5/10 for the entertainment and only The Meg's visual effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Meh, what ev's. I read this book when it first came out in 1997 and have read eagerly all the sequels that followed it. Many times they announce that it was soon to be a major motion picture, or a made for tv movie and so on and every time it fell apart. When I first heard early this year that this was happening I didn't believe it til I saw the first trailer and bounced in my seat in the theater when I saw it finally. People go to these movies thinking it will be something so spiritually uplifting that it will change your life. This and other movies are simply what they are meant to be, a block buster to entertain you and for you to enjoy, nothing more. When you see Transformers, what you are getting is giant space robots kicking other space robots asses. Nothing more. When you go see a shark movie like this, you are getting a shark movie that hopefully will entertain you and you will walk out going that was fun. Was this a full on take of the book? not quite. Was it fairly close, mostly. The actors were fun and the movie was more than enjoyable. Yes there has been some griping recently from actors and the makers saying they wanted to go for a bloodier version but realized in order to be accessible to the masses, they had to tone it down to be PG. When you want to appeal to a broad audience to make money, then you have to unfortunately make some choices. They did and it worked for them as it made more money in it's opening weekend by double than what they predicted. It's fairly hard to make me jump during a movie and this had a couple scenes that made me flinch in surprise so BRAVO for that. I enjoyed it and thought it was a fun summer flick and actually enjoyed the characters and their interactions. I've heard some griping about the Asian actors being put into it to appeal to that demographic, before you say things like that read the source material. That's who they were in the books as well as it does take place in that part of the world. So go with an open mind and expect a fun roller coaster of a ride and know that that's what you will get. This will not be the movie that changes your life, but will make it more fun for a couple hours.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I like shark movies, The Meg was out, I didn't have anything to do, so I decided to go see it.So The Meg is the inevitable non-Sharknado shark movie that comes out every summer (because there's also a Sharknado movie that comes out every year). This trend brought us an absolute masterpiece of this genre, The Shallows, 2 years ago. Last year, it also brought us 47 Meters Down, an unintentionally hilarious movie ( I'll let you decide if that's a good thing or not. It's on Netflix if you're interested). Whereas The Shallows was a very gritty film and 47 Meters Down at least tried to be one, I could tell that The Meg was going to be intentionally silly. I mean, it's about a Megalodon! If you have the intentions of watching a thought-provoking masterpiece, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. But let's be honest: no one in their right mind would think that THIS would be that type of movie. I just thought it would be a fun, somewhat tense, and somewhat enjoyably stupid shark thriller. And it certainly delivered. The Meg takes its ridiculous premise and just runs.... no, not runs..... swims with it.In terms of intensity, it was relatively mild compared to The Shallows. But The Shallows has a level of intensity that many shark movies only dream of replicating. The Meg has its fair share nerve-racking scenes and some pretty effective jumpscares, however. The effects are top notch, which is especially good considering this film came from the studio who brought us Justice League. I can definitely say I felt much more suspense watching The Meg than I did watching 47 Meters Down, even though the latter was a more serious movie. However, this is certainly the most lighthearted movie in this genre that I've seen. It actually might be more of an action comedy rather than a thriller. One of the things I really like about this film is the self-awareness it has. It knows what it is and what it's trying to be: simply a fun movie about a ginormous shark. And it is fun, yet without losing its thrills. It can be hilarious at one point and thrilling at another.The cast was pretty good. I know I say this a lot, but they really seemed to enjoy filming this movie. My personal favorite was the little girl, who was unbelievably cute and funny. I also thought Dwight Schrute was pretty funny as a billionaire (that's right, he plays a billionaire. I'm as confused as you are). However, there were some character development issues, as expected with this type of movie. It's scattershot in which characters are developed and which ones aren't. Jason Statham's character probably had the most character development, which is good considering that he's the main character. However, some of the side characters had it and others were quite literally (for lack of a better term) shark chum. Like seriously, some of the characters were just there to get eaten by the shark. This is something that even The Shallows struggled with. Or if you're tired of me referencing that movie, Jaws struggled with it too. Like seriously, what do you know about that girl who dies at the beginning? Or the guy in the pond? Nothing right? This movie also has that problem, but it honestly isn't a big issue considering what type of movie it is.In all honesty, I don't really have too much to say about it. I did notice that the critics are split 50/50 about it. And to that, I say this: don't expect it to be a masterpiece. Unless you're determined to find its faults rather than the enjoyable parts of this movie, you should be able to have fun watching this movie. Just take it for what it is and enjoy.The Meg gave me exactly what I wanted: a goofy movie about a huge freaking shark.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Numerous books later his fans remain. But hopefully not because of the film version of his novel. Spielberg's shark opus will never be topped simply because he created great characters and a tense plot that makes it one of the greatest horror films of all time. All of which this film lacks. But they happily stole many of the Jaws scenes from the beach attack to the boat destruction. The only thing they left out was the line, ""We need a bigger boat"". Between the death and destruction are the comedic lines that sound rediculous and truly out of place. 
I suppose if you're looking for light summer action then this is your film. The perfect ""Creature double feature"" type of film. Where Jaws made you want to stay clear of the beaches, Meg is silly fluff. 
The acting is fair at best and Statham puts on his usual show of bravado and heroism. I'm sure it will make money and it is close to family fare. But beware! The kids will love it, but parents might want to sit this one out.

The acting, the CGI, the plot, everything was awful. My 12-year-old and 8-year-old sons were ""bored"". You see the shark in the movie just about as many times you see it in the trailer and the CGI is so fake I felt as though my eyes couldn't keep up with it. The actors including Rain Wilson were B actor quality, the addition of the tough hot chick was forced and pointless and nothing more than a generic version of a 1990's Angelina Jolie. I am not sure how it gained the 6.1 score, but what I watched was awful and unwatchable. I wouldn't even suggest it for a corny kitschy good time. If you are looking for that watch Sharknado.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Although this could be seen as a light hearted film with comedic aspects from the brilliant Rainn Wilson and comedian and rapper Page Kennedy which sometimes make you forget about the poor action sequences, this film isn't something that I would recommend. Action movie legend Jason Statham doesn't really seem bothered about this casting and you can really tell he was just after another paycheck to get him through the year with an American accent which ,in my opinion, is one of the worst I have ever heard . His reputation wont be tarnished by this movie but he was walking on thin ice after the cinematic release. A over advertised movie which clearly did not make as much as Director Jon Turteltaub and his crew though it would. Unfortunately Jon if you want to make a classic underwater horror movie, you're gonna need a bigger shark.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Things the movie and the book have in common: They both have a big shark (megalodon). The both have ""Meg"" in the title. The main character in both is named Jonas Taylor. I guess they changed the Asian scientist and his daughter from Japanese to Chinese to attract Chinese viewer since China is a bigger market than Japan. This is so common in movies these days the Chinese must be tired of such blatant pandering because they didn't turn out to see this film. The book is so much better and intelligent compared to this dumbed down action flick. I read the book and its sequels in the early 2000s and loved them but when I heard they were turning them into movies I was very worried. Worried that they would do exactly what they did. I am guessing that they will be no longer making the sequel since the movie fell flat. If you are just looking for a movie to keep you entertained for 2 hours than this might be for you. If you are looking for something that challenges you mentally and has realistic science in it as well as action then read the book.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However I am keen to point out, this isn't the film of the Steve Allen book, but it's lovely based on it. If you go expecting that story you will come away disappointed. If you go, expecting a good shark film, then you'll be happy. I loved it. It's a huge prehistoric shark for heavens sake - it's like Jaws x 10. Whilst the films tone is vastly different, there are great characters and if anything I think a bit too much character development. The story is great, fast paced, with plenty of action scenes. There are some huge jump out moments and I honestly screamed out loud. It's exciting. The megalodon, the star of the piece is so well done - I'd say it's the best CGI stark to date. The movement is super realistic, with speed and grace just like a real shark. So many previous shark films were let down by crap CGI sharks, but this time it works well. I will be going to see it again for sure. Go see this on the big screen. I really hope they make sequels","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Almost every tension moment is built over stupid and overly heroic decisions. Everyone is disposable and desperate to be a martyr: it really gets annoying on this. Jason Statham was hired to play his usual sociopathic irreverent action hero, which I like,... to a stress point: It's like they gave him insistent electroshocks to make him do that. Some of the actors could have been replaced by animatronics. Overall a little fun to watch, close to OK if it's an excuse to chug down some ice cream but if you have seen Jaws, making a comparison will be unavoidable and you'll miss that tension. The soundtrack is rather disconnected. Visual effects are OK but look a bit behind to be a 2018 movie.

What's unforgivable in these kind of movies is bad execution, and boy is this movie badly executed. From a bad screenplay to a not so happy casting to bad cgi, you name it, it's there. This is just a bit better than an Asylum production with 100x the budget. Everything is so cheesy that it starts just being annoying, like the scarred but noble hero, the conveniently single female marine specialist, the over the top millionaire who finances the whole thing, and whoever had the idea to put a little girl in the middle of it all should just stop writing for film.

Every time a shark movie comes out, it seems like people flock to go see it. I don't know if people are collectively hoping each film will be as good as Jaws, or if people are just drawn to sharks, but there seems to be worldwide anticipation every time a new shark movie is coming out. Nowadays, there are really only two kinds of shark movies that are made. You have the serious thrillers like The Shallows, and then you have the absurdly ridiculous ones such as the Sharknado films. And when the trailers for The Meg came out, a lot of people thought it would be almost in the vein of a Sharknado movie. I personally thought it looked more like it was going to be just plain dumb instead of being dumb fun, but I know a lot of anticipation surrounded this film. So I went and saw it, and I didn't like it but I also didn't hate it. The problem with The Meg is that it doesn't know which of these two types of shark movies it wants to be. Sometimes it wants to just be big zany fun, and then sometimes it tries to be uber serious with narrative building and character development. The Meg has a real identity crisis, and it would have been for the better if it had just picked one and stuck with it...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I understand that the eternal argument about wether film adaptions of novels are good or bad will never be won, but this movie has scored a pretty sizeable point for the 'novels' side of the debate. Steve Alten wrote a novel that was never supposed to win any prizes for scientific authenticity but made a good job of at least convincingly making a rational argument for how a massive prehistoric shark could be alive at the bottom of the ocean. The Meg 2018 seems to half ass almost every aspect that made the book enjoyable. The sharks appearance is too fast, meaning that there's no real tension. The gore that made the novel so punchy is to tame in this I'm surprised it even broke the 12 rating let alone 15. Jonas portrayed by Jason Statham is charismatic, but lacking in proper backstory and motivation. Rainn Wilson is good as the billionaire overlord who decides he wants the shark as a extra large wall ornament, but again his character seems to have no real motivation other than just 'cause shark'.Many of the auxiliary characters from the novel are either cut, or made so pointless they may as well have been and while yes, the novel has far more time than the movie, what little time the movie has it squanders on pointless sequences that almost beg you to become connected with the very 2d characters.There are exactly three good moments in this movie:1) The sequence where the sub is first attacked by The Meg after entering the trench as the visuals are fantastic and at this point the tension is pretty decent, although still hardly enough to get you leaning forward in your chair.2) The first person scene with Jonas (Statham) floating in open water bobbing above and below the surface of the water and the shark is circling him.3) The 'Meg hunt' with Rainn Wilson clinging to a dead whale.Apart from these three moments, The Meg 2018 is an utter flop. It's not funny enough to be a horror/comedy, it's not tense enough to be an out-and-out jaws esc thriller, and it's not punchy and gory enough to be a fast paced horror. It's mediocre in every aspect, and hardly worth a viewing beyond morbid curiosity.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Nice to see a shark movie in the theater for a change","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4292053/?ref_=tt_urv","Aaron1375","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1111192/?ref_=tt_urv","19 August 2018","These days, what constitutes as a shark movie is lame films on the scy-fy channel usually involving some stupid premise such as the shark being a ghost, a weather event or some other premise that just screams, not serious and not good. This one though, was a nice way to end the summer movie season as it is not great, but still a fun time at the theater. What is more fun than a big shark terrorizing the oceans as Jason Statham tries to track it down and kill it? Not much! The story has Statham as a rescue diver who had trouble with his last dive as something seemed to be crushing in the submarine he was trying to get people off of. Five years passed and he is considered crazy. A group find there way to a strange underwater realm beyond a strange mixture that keeps the sea life in the chasm separated from the rest of the sea. A group makes their way to this area only to be attacked by something and soon Statham's character is called upon to undertake this rescue operation and soon a huge shark is found. It makes its way past the natural barrier thanks to a fluke and soon this shark is terrorizing the ocean! The main problem I had with this movie is the cast. Other than Statham, the little girl and the shark, the rest of the actors and actresses were total crap! The rest of them aside from the badass, the child and the shark may as well been starring in one of those crummy films found on the Sy-Fy Channel! Thankfully, Statham makes this movie a lot better and the shark looks a lot better than anything seen on the aforementioned station.So despite the problematic acting, this film was pretty good. Kind of reminds me of Rampage with Dwayne Johnson as that one had a similar problem in that the acting beyond the Rock and the monsters was very sub par, but still a good movie and both of these movies were better than Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Still cannot wrap my mind around how that one's script got approved. So, the film is a nice end to the summer and it was nice seeing a giant shark movie in the theater instead of flying through a tornado on television.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A lot of critics rate this low but if we really think and compare it to other Megolodin movie that is out there this is by far the best among them. The lines/dialogue isnt that good, the acting/script is ok, the story is predictable but the good thing about this movie is that Jason Statham did a very good job on his acting and the story mixing adventure and action with a little suspense made it worth watching. The director also did a good job delivering memorable moments from the scenes down deep below the deep sea up to the ocean and the shore where the shark attacks. I recommend this movie to all those shark movie lovers and they will love it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Meg is how you make a killer animal movie. Lake Placid: Legacy? Not so much. I enjoyed this film. It was suspenseful. It was exciting. There legitimately were scenes that made me jump out of my seat and yell, ""Oh Crap!""....and that doesn't happen often when I watch films but it happened often enough in The Meg that it made me enjoy the thrill of it all. Jason Statham plays exactly who you think he plays: the angry loner who becomes a hero beyond all odds....just like he does in all his movies, but hes charismatic enough that you don't care that he's being typecast yet again. For me the stand out performance was that of Rainn Wilson....you just have to see the film to know what I'm talking about. As far as the shark goes: they made a CGI shark that is probably 5x the size of a humpback whale. It could bite a luxury yacht in half. It's not perfect, but it's real enough that it strikes fear and gives you goosebumps when you see it charging towards the cast. It's strength lies in the fear and sensationalism of sharks in popular culture. Fear of being attacked by these giant underwater eating machines is high at the top of most people's phobias. Throw in a shark the size of a nuclear sub and you're bound to scare the pants off of anyone. The verdict: Don't take this film too seriously; rather enjoy it for what it is while you suspend your disbelief because this is a fantastic deep sea scare-fest that you won't want to miss.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, I went to see it as there was nothing else on I wanted to see, and went with an open mind.After just 10 mins in (my normal gauge time for a movie quality), I found it had gripped my attention, and I was starting to become pleasantly surprised. Yes Jason Statham is a bit wooden, yes you sort of know how it is going to play out, but for me its all about value for money. There are a few cheesy bits that make you smile, but I am pretty sure they are deliberate, and what you should really expect, but me and my son left the theatre feeling we had indeed been entertained.I have seen a lot worse, but expecting better, so overall I thought it was a good movie and was worth seeing and investing 2 hours of my time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Those movie suck big time. But this is a very good movie. It has great story line. It also has great acting. It is very scary. It is better then Jaws and that is not easy to do.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The Meg is a fun popcorn flick that I enjoyed quite a bit. It's not trying to win any awards or be the next shark classic like Jaws. Rather, it's offering up a good time of entertainment with some impressive visuals. There's plenty of action and thrills and even a little horror and comedy. The Megalodon sharks look great and gave me some shivers. Those who already have a fear of sharks should find this to be a nail-biting experience at times. It's nice to see such a SYFY channel concept get the big budget Hollywood treatment. Even if the characters and dialogue aren't the best, the actors are good and the solid special effects make it fun to watch. If you go in expecting a typical Jason Statham action/ thriller, you should be pleased to find that it's slightly better.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And it's a wonderful thing to see.It doesn't have the eerie terror of Jaws, but then such a thing is damn near impossible to recapture, so they don't even try. They went with a crazy concept and made it work. Great action, great jumps, great monster movie acting, and some truly amazing CGI. The Meg starts delivers exactly what it promised.Jason Statham was yet again playing himself, which is exactly what people want to see. The rest of the cast did a great job, even playing up to some of the tropes and then pulling a fake out, which was a nice change. It's great when a movie knows what the monster movie expectations are and decides to play with them. If more movies would do that, things wouldn't be nearly so predictable.Definitely a movie you can sit back and enjoy. More action than horror, but oh so entertaining.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Meg got a lot of to offer for you starting from Multi racial representation casts, simple and easy to understand plot and action, Mini Submarine, Big Underwater Aquarium, Deep Water Exploration, JASON STATHAM as main character, and most importantly A 25 FEET DEEP SEA GIANT MEGALODON. I really enjoy this movie and would rate it 7 or 8 out of 10 because I like shark.
The story starts during first exploration in the deep sea, Jonas Taylor played by Jason Statham encountered giant shark during his rescue mission and cause him to leave some people to die to save other from the shark. However, his statement about big shark was deemed unbelievable and people scorn him, thus making him quit his rescue job and live by himself in Thailand.
 
The story then follows a team of ocean researcher that explore deep sea. The researcher team consist some diversity it has black people, Asian, and of course white people. This was expected since it was a china-american movie. The acting is somewhat mediocre, and was nothing noteworthy. But I still like how Jason statham managed to stay badass in all situation even when facing the great giant shark.
Oh yeah if you have kids and children they will be amazed and awed when the Megalodon showed up. It was so much fun seeing their reaction about the giant shark. However, for adult even though the film is enjoyable the conclusion is so unnatural and seems forced as I think the giant died in unsatisfactory manner.
But even with all its flaw the meg stays an enjoyable ride with a lot of waves and thrill accompanied by shark. I recommended this movie for you that enjoy jaws or monster movie alike, or even like ocean.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Fantastically enjoyable mainstream creature feature","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4578180/?ref_=tt_urv","kannibalcorpsegrinder","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25837689/?ref_=tt_urv","12 January 2019","After a submarine accident in the middle of the ocean, a former diver is called upon to rescue the trapped crew only to find the cause that trapped them was a giant prehistoric megalodon shark that has now escaped into the world's oceans forcing him to track down the creature and stop it.For the most part, this was an enjoyable mainstream creature feature. One of the biggest attributes here is the strong mainstream qualities afforded to the film. Not only is the overall look and feel of the film, including the sleek and slick layouts of the underwater research station as well as the high-end special effects work all create a fantastically enjoyable entry. That effects work, featuring stellar shots of the underwater sea-life in the grotto and the titular sharks all being enjoyable enough to really like here. That also helps out considerably with the action scenes here. The rescue attempt requiring the two boats to get the crew out of the creatures' lair offers the kind of explosive action sequence that really works, while the initial attack on the station features some chilling moments. The lead attack on the first shark manages plenty of open water fun in the matter of tactics employed against it as they dive in the cage or tracking it with the restraining equipment which brings about the eventual method of capturing the first specimen in a fun, exciting manner. The last half of the film, though, is where this really wins out. The action in this section is far grander and much more spectacular, including the stellar sequence of the second shark making it's appearance to the crew as well as the ensuing race to stop it before it disappears. The beach attack is absolutely spectacular and wholly enjoyable with the scenes of the shark swimming through the sea of humanity attacking the support buildings or the various beachgoers there before leading into the over-the-top battle to finally put the creature down, resulting in a full-on spectacular battle to do so. These here are what manage to hold this one up over it's few flaws. The only real issue to be had with this one is the simplistic story that brings about a series of intense cliches. It's way too familiar with what's going to happen here which keeps things going along at a steady pace due to hitting all the familiar beats and plot-points, from the rescue attempts being pulled off at the last minute to the characters kept out of danger simply by their billing and rendering the encounters with them as quite bland. The idea of the second shark getting free and coming up only once the first one is defeated also feels rather lackluster due to being such a common trope of the scene. As well, the ending is a little anticlimactic that offers up a solid idea but is somewhat of a letdown in terms of storyline catharsis compared to what came before. These here are the film's few issues.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But all else is perfect. Rest of science is real. Funny, extreme, adventurous, much action, emotions, facial expressions, details, reactions. Looks like one of my dreams and hopes, something I always wanted to see, the extinct large monsters like dinosaurs, or Megalodon in this case, being brought back alive, or discovered already alive, even if just for excitement, to scare people, to enjoy something extraordinary. Different than most movies, and even than most shark movies. Unique. Science part looks convincing, creatures look real and scary, and all other graphics and actions look real enough, detailed enough, interesting enough. Also unique because in unusual place or nations. One of the most extreme movies similar to other extreme ones like , , and  and it's sequels. Actually to me at least this does not look too unreal but like real scientific discovery or possibility that could happen. Good to learn some new scientific terms and watch all people fighting with something much bigger than in most cliche movies. Beautiful characters and I could recognize main guy actor from other movies all of which are good. Good mix of different unique and funny characters. The best part here was extremeness of all of it, and that unrealistic part is more like real possibility, something I think will always deserve perfect rating in all such movies.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The acting was good, even from the little girl, who manages to skirt the line between too cute and too cringy with minimal corniness. Rainn Wilson could have been given a bit more in terms of comedic moments, and they could have done away with some of the extra characters, but that's just me quibbling.
CGI was good, though that is a staple these days, my toes curled in certain places from things eating/being eaten.
Plot was predictable, but they got a couple good jump scares out of me, so there was that.
Gotta give props to them for not putting any of the three female models in bikinis to sell tickets; you see more of Jason Statham's rockin bod then you do theirs. (That dude is in his fifties?!)

There, I said it.This movie actually took me by surprise, simply because I didn't set any expectations upfront. And that is how anyone should approach this movie.There are a good number of upsides to this movie. Firstly, I generally like Jason Statham (and of course, Cliff Curtis), he certainly adds some weight to movies due to his intensity. Secondly, there's a mix of cute and dark humour thrown in for fun. Thirdly, the CGI mostly looks fantastic and realistic, especially the silhouette of the Mega ominously swimming underneath people. Lastly, I like the fact that the climax is great and layered, so it's not boring or ho-hum.This movie was a pleasant surprise, and I'd fully recommend if you know how to relax and enjoy!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Besides, Deep Blue Sea is one of my favorite movies. Although different, the similarities between the two movies are inescapable.1.) You have the Sea-Based Laboratory, 2.) the eclectic crew, 3.) the rich visitor, 4.) the no-nonsense tough guy, 5.) the funny black guy, and 6.) amazing, unyielding sharks. However, instead of trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's, this group of scientists is searching for other scientific breakthroughs.The backstory is different, there are more rescues and last second saves; and in this picture, instead of large, genetically enhanced Mako sharks- the star of this movie is the massive, thought to be extinct- Megalodon.Aside from the shark itself, no new ground was broken here. It's like a mixture of Jaws (shark size) and Deep Blue Sea (story), with a bit of Jurassic Park (scientific meddling and humor) with a spritz of The Fast and The Furious (Heroic maneuvers and saves) mixed in.It's worth a watch. I missed seeing it in theaters, but I just watched it on OnDemand, and- I will watch it again...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jason Statham is an underwater rescue expert, burned out after he lost two men in a strange incident. He was blamed but is certain a creature attacked the wrecked sub he was rescuing the crew from. Now his ex-wife has dived deeper then the Mariana Trench, through some membrane into even deeper warmer water. But her submersible is attacked by a giant squid and then by a Megalodon 90 foot shark, causing serious damage. Will Jason get to her on time and also be vindicated? Will she survive the Viz style wise-cracking by her two crew members?We also get a selfish billionaire, stock doctors, scientists and engineers. Even a cute kid on a research station who isn't annoying. And we get underwater gliders which look like a 1960s idea of a 1990s car, lots of glass/perspex but manages to dive 6 miles down! Great fun! 8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Last Decent Shark Movie at all Time It Was Great Movie I Have Watched It a Lot of Times Shallows (2016) was a Great Fun Thrilling Intense Movie Just Like This But Different Style. This was had a very decent CGI in this movie it was so great looking of Shark, most of another scenes i can tell it was shot for real some another's i can it's green screen mostly because of shark. believe me it's worth it for your money it is grab popcorn it's worth it to see the fun ride, Jason Statham i am a super die hard of Statham super i loved his movies all time this was thank god a big movie release he is in all movie he is there a badass, kickass, Bad Attitude a lot of It, Good Lines, Him Facing Against Fear at a 75-Foot Prehistoric Shark not like pussy like in movie shark attack 3 Megalodon Because One of Actors didn't faced 75-Foot Shark Statham has THE BALLS to do it even he Saved Woman In cage while Meg was swimming around. Soo Great and a Lot of Fun Never Seen Movie With Action Star Fighting Against Massive Biggest Shark Then Jaws this Felt Like a New Generation of Jaws on Steroids But it's a Megalodon film.
Story follows (Jason Statham) Jonas Taylor Deep-Sea Rescue Diver is no laughing business: in the throes of his latest mission to save the crew of a nuclear submarine trapped at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, Jonas is forced to sacrifice two of his crew are trapped in the damaged submarine he needed to make a choice to rather save these 2 men or die because after it is purportedly attacked by a giant creature which crushes its hull. Jonas' account of the tragic event is disputed by another key member of his very own crew Dr Heller (Robert Taylor), and After Being Accused of Suffering a Psychological meltdown, he retreats to seclusion on a rustic island in Thailand. 
Five years Later, Jonas is Given the Opportunity to Get Even with the Creature when he is approached by an Old Friend Mac (Cliff Curtis) to lead an urgent Operation To Save His Ex-Wife Lori (Jessica McNamee) and her two other crew Mates Stranded Underwater In a Deep Sea Submersible Names Origin off the Chinese coast. Mac and Lori are part of a larger team on a Modern Research Facility Called Mana One Exploring If There is Life Beneath The Depths of the Ocean as We Know It, And The First Successful So-Called 'insertion' (cue the geek joke delivered by Toshi (Masi Oka) known for TV Series Hero's and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) He is known for Last Witch Hunter Vin Diesel. Into the hydrothermal sphere at the bottom of the seabed brings the Origin face to face with the titular super shark previously thought to be extinct. (Ruby Rose) Jax was good in movie but at least I would say it was one of her good roles in movie I can handle her she is not bad role in movie she is there. Suyin Zhang (Li Bingbing) Resident Evil: Retribution, Transformers: Age of Extinction. Is in this I thought she had same braven as Jason Statham Character. Jason Statham character is a badass with a lot of bad attitude like you wanna love his character even more and movie as well. I thought there were funny moments in movie made me laugh hard and hard there are some jokes in film not stupid silly jokes, there is similar character like LL J Cool in Deep Blue Sea is 
(Page Kennedy) if you watch deep blue sea then to this then you will know There Are Similar Characters in each movie kinda same characters but expect Page Kennedy Is Not Chef or he has bird nothing like that. I thought the Haunting Scene Where They Wanted to catch Meg was cool with a lot of 
The CGI effects are superb and the Meg looks very real. The choice not to have her luminescent was the right one. I know that it goes against the book but I believe Meg would have looked unnatural with her white glow. In the movie she has a wonderful prehistoric texture to her hide. This makes her look gnarly and ancient. Only the odd scene, particularly her introductory one looked a little fake. The CGI wizards have managed to capture her movements naturally. The underwater scene when she is chasing Jonas as he's being reeled back to the boat looked very realistic. As did the scene when the Meg swims underneath an unsuspecting paddle boarder.Fantasy ideas not lazy idea, Director Has put a lot of effort of movie. and yes people this isn't realistic or should I Say it's not In a grand tradition of as Jaws, Open Water then became a direct to DVD franchise, Reef, Shark Night, Bait, Shallows, this is unrealistic like Movie Deep Blue Sea but with a bigger Shark Monster That Movie shark hasn't never been made with Megalodon you will be Surprised That Every Shark Movie Is Normal Size In Realistic Way Like Jaws (1975) was 25 Feet Long and Weighed Around three tons. 
great white shark Female: 4.5 - 6.4 m (Adult), Male: 3.5 - 4 m (Adult) but In Shallows It's large great white shark But Then In This Meg is a 75-Foot Prehistoric Would Chomp At Any Sharks This Movie I Haven't Never Seen a Megalodon Shark Movie In a Great CGI Not a Shitty B-Class Grade Movie Where SC-FI Channel Crap I Never Seen a Bigger Budget Movie of Megalodon Movie Ever Since Trashed Can Shark Attack 3 Megalodon Crap Dumpster Film At Least This Has Great Budget, Great Fun Experience In Theater, Great Cast, Great Budget For CGI And Everything I Never Wanted to Write everything down you need to see this Thrilling ride movie it's fun, scary ride Ignore the haters and have fun!! believe me The Haters makes you not get into this movie if you watch movie it's difference because at end of day you make choice don't let anyone let you get into your head say it's not worth it, It's GREAT MOVIE have fun a lot of it, it's worth of your time. And yes you may be expecting to be R RATED ok first of all there are shark movies that are PG-13 like Jaws how did that became one of popular Shark Movies? How in earth did that become popular? That movie is PG?? And Shallows is PG-13? If you look at Deep Blue Sea that's R RATED! that's Unrealistic Horror Shark movie but that was great it showed a lot of great violence out of it that's explame if you seen it but this is a different style of movie Forget another movies like Black Klansman or Ant-Man & Wasp the recent movies WATCH THIS believe me it's worth it, I don't get why people are giving this movie poor to mediocre reviews. If you liked Jaws but not a normal shark or Great White Shark it's different style of a Meg 75-Foot Prehistoric Shark Movie you have never seen this is first bigger budget Megalodon movie not a B-CLASS style movie you'll love this movie, to death I really hope this gets a lot of sequels with Jason Statham.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most characters are a bit out there, but hey, aren't we all in real live?The Meg itself? I really liked this beast. It looked very real to me and has a cool ""design"". Not ""over-CGIed"", very organic, reminded me of the first Jurassic Park. There are many memorable moments (some even made it into my dreams next night :-))All in all, I had Fun and it felt like the movie became what it wanted to be. Something that I cannot say about many movies these days. Rainn Wilson as corporate weasel alone is worth the price of the admission.

Mine is not fake... I liked it because I take the movies as they are, not as I would expect they should be. I respect all the actors, the directors, the crew and everybody who works in this field, as everybody of them tries to do the best they can. Sometimes it's an Oscar, mostly it's not, so what? I watch the movies without expecting anything, this is the reason why I can enjoy ""the Meg"" or ""Skyscraper""... I'm sorry for those who watch a movie with a lot of expectations and then angrily they write useless reviews on IMDB giving only a very low score... 1 out of 10... are you kidding me? Those are people who are not able to live their lives, they are just always angry, disappointed for everything and they think that it's always the others' fault if they live a bad life or a life that they don't like. I'm so curious to know how good as actors they are when they say... bad acting, that actor should change profession, he/she shouldn't work... I bet that nobody of you is an actor, nor a director and probably never you acted and nor you shot a movie... otherwise reading your review, I could think that you are so brilliant, important and famous that almost every director thinking to shoot a movie, they immediately would call you offering you the main role in their movies... obviously, no way, not even they know you exist! I don't think that Tom Cruise would have been writing reviews here. Poor guys... so envious of the others' success.

"8","/10","Movie Review: THE MEG (2018)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4441904/?ref_=tt_urv","LegendsofHorror","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6274849/?ref_=tt_urv","6 November 2018","It was when JAWS first hit the big screen in 1975 when people everywhere became more aware and to be honest afraid of sharks, and since then the fear has increased a thousand fold. That has been both a blessing and a curse, mainly a blessing for Hollywood a curse for the latter. Since 1975, there have been over hundreds of horror films about sharks and shark attacks, 80 percent of them were let's be honest quite terrible but the ones that did stick with us, affected us. Many of us in different ways, that being said THE MEG is no different except that this is the first time EVER that we have ever had a chance to see a Megalodon shark so up close in your face without any repercussions.The film starts off with a underwater rescue lead by Jonas Taylor (played by Jason Statham) which ultimately goes awry with the help of a unseen beast which causes the deaths of two military sub officers. We then cut to 5 years later Shanghai and we are introduced to the main cast which consists of: Bingbing Li (Resident Evil: Retribution), Cliff Curtis (Fear the Walking Dead), Ruby Rose (John Wick 2, Orange is the New Black), Robert Taylor (KONG: Skull Island) & adorable newcomer Shuya Sophia Cai who in my opinion steals the show all are lead by Hollywood funnyman (Rain Wilson) who plays Mr. Morris, the CEO of a underwater thinktank who are attempting to break a hydrothermal cloud on the ocean floor which is believed to carry more and unseen ocean life that has yet to be seen by human eyes. This expedition via sea rover is a success but once again reawakens the beast from the depths that attacked the military submarine only 5 years before. The beast not only once again destroys the underwater sea rover and releases the 75 foot Prehistoric beast from the oceanic depths and wreaks havoc on the entire seacoast of Japan.Once we are introduced to our main characters, the film slows down quite a bit which is reminiscence of JAWS in that aspect as we see that beast but not as often, exactly like we did in the 1975 film. This also gives time for us as a audience to understand and feel for some of the characters in the film and not just have them on screen as cannon fodder as most films in this day and age do, so when they do die...their deaths mean something whether for the good or for the bad.As I said before, after the opening sequence the film slows its burn down until about over midway up until the finale of the film. This is where THE MEG finally rears its ugly head and Japan gets a taste of AMITY BEACH love - MEG STYLE.Obviously, this is another Statham action themed feature but its a fun romp. The action sequences featuring THE MEG are awesome to watch. In my opinion where the film really shines is the underwater scenes, they are beautifully shot no matter what format you watch it in. The visual effects in this film are fun to see and really the only way you'll ever see a Carcharodon Megalodon on the big screen after all.For those that love shark films, now I will say this, it won't scare you in fact I don't think its meant to. It comes off more as a fun in your face popcorn flick. This film reminds me of a combination of ""JAWS"" & ""DEEP BLUE SEA"" but with a damn BIGGER shark and much more fun.For those who didn't get a chance to see it in 3D will even get a BIGGER BETTER experience of Shark fun as it will be available on 4K, 3D, and Bluray on November 13, 2018.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One week, a very bad week, I watched it three times. It never fails to bring me out of a funk. Jason Statham is both heroic, down-to-earth and funny. The action is top notch as is the CGI. I've seen bad CGI and this is great. I believe that shark exists in this movie. The team of characters work well together, even the ""villain"" who is like a Bill Gates gone bad. If you know Jaws well, you're in for a treat with all the Easter Eggs in this movie. The story is simple. An ocean station funded by a billionaire sends a small sub to what is thought is the bottom of the Marianna Trench. They have charted a cloud layer there, hypothesizing there is more below it. They're correct, but there's something down there. Upon their return, the Meg escapes to wreak havoc. Lost of great action, dialogue, characters and scenery.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The surprise? IT DOES THIS WELL. Where similar films of the same genre have tried either too hard or too little, The Meg plays around with obvious tropes, lampoons itself and provides a compelling plot, likable characters and impressive special effects. The pacing is pitch-perfect and the chaos escalates delightfully with the stakes raised ever higher as the story unfolds. Whenever the script or performances showed signs of becoming predictable there was a twist or laugh not far away to make up for it. Certainly one of the better shark flicks and visually stunning to boot.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The original Jaws had ham acting, poor dialogue and rubbish special effects. The only thing it had was a great soundtrack, yet it is considered a classic.
This movie has brilliant special effects and plenty of suspense. I didn't watch it expecting a classic drama or something to provoke deep thought, I watched it to be entertained and I was.
Jason Statham is good in the main role and shows he does not have to be a martial arts fighter in every movie he does.
Bingbing Li was very good but the young actress, Shuya Sophia Cai playing her daughter stole every scene she was in.

Jason joins us for an intense intro with a first glimpse of the journey the Meg is about to embark on, with us. 
Jason classically puts up a hero fight but of course we know he will be saving the day with a gallant fight, hey Micky being the theme tune to this. At moments we were quivering in our pants, others quite literally peeing in our pants, from laughter. This film was Jason at his best and almost so convincing we're now watching conspiracy theories, is the Meg real? will Jason survive? Has the movie left an opening for a sequel? Well it's sure left me wanting more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It seems like anytime a new shark thriller comes out, everyone is quick to jump on the ""compare it to Jaws bandwagon"", which has become overdone and overkill. Yeah, we get it. Both movies are about renegade sharks who kill people. Let's move on, shall we?All the ""Jaws"" comparisons aside, this movie is your classic retelling of the ""we disturbed a creature from the depths and now he's loose and wreaking havoc"" tale. When a submersible is sent down into the Mariana Trench for exploration purposes, they reach an area that has never before been discovered. While exploring, the submersible is attacked by a large, unknown creature rendering it helpless on the ocean floor. Enter Jonas Taylor (played by Jason Statham) who witnessed a submarine attacked and destroyed by a similar creature five years earlier. In their efforts to save the submersible, this creature is allowed to break free and surface, leaving a trail of dead bodies in it's wake.I enjoyed this movie. I felt the creature was indeed very ominous, deadly and a formidable opponent. The cinematography was good, the pacing was good, the creature effects were well made, and the acting decent. If you want a fun creature feature with explosive results, this is one you would enjoy. I would watch this one again and probably enjoy it just as much, and is a recommend.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Be that as it may, ""The Meg"" is a wildly entertaining movie. The Killer Shark movie is a nice little sub-genre. Of course, many fall into the Sy-Fy channel kind of stuff but many others are really good. ""The Meg"" got of to a little bit of a rocky start but after 15 minutes or so it really takes off. The special effects are hit and miss. The cast, however, is top notch across the board. Notable standout: Ruby Rose.

It had a feeling of pure fun around it and never took itself too seriously. Hearing Jason Statham sing Dory's ""Just Keep Swimming"" song from Finding Nemo is something I never knew I wanted. Bingbing Li is both awesome and adorable, as was Sophia Cai as her daughter. It was interesting seeing Ruby Rose in the role of a scientist for once, with Cliff Curtis and Rainn Wilson rounding out the surprisingly great cast. There were, unfortunately, some low points with a bit of a cringe factor (take a drink every time someone says the word ""prehistoric""), and the ending felt a bit anti-climactic. I'm sorry that some of the crew were frustrated with the way their movie turned out, but with that said, The Meg was just as enjoyable for me as the trailer led me to believe.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I say this because going into one of these movies, you are not expecting to have a deep intricate story line with lots of character development or tense drama that will leave you thinking about the movies days after. You go in, expecting that some of the content will be a bit stereo typical and predictable borderline cheesy, with similar characters/situations that you are familiar with and a complete escapism mindset into a make believe world. This movie does not try to make itself to be believable in that sense that its trying to hit science right on the nose nor does it try to make you believe that the possibly that a Megalodon could still exist (or is it!?! lol). Suspend your disbelief and just enjoy this fun ride. You may even find yourself rooting for the shark! Don't trust some of these ridiculous (and spiteful) reviews about how bad this movie is or how terrible the actors/actresses are. I'm pretty sure they went into it picking apart all that the movie didn't do right or whatever reason they need to just openly bash and hate on this movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a popcorn film. It's directed by Joh Tuteltaub who directed National Treasure and The Sorcerer's Apprentice and has a similar feel. There are also some script issues. (Rainn Wilson's rich boss has some good lines but either the writer or actor seemed to have trouble with making him feel consistent. Page Kennedy appears to be straight man only to suddenly become the comical relief two-thirds in.) Still, although this is a lightweight film, its appeal.The characters are likable and mostly understandable, and the actors all seem to be having a nice time. Special credit should be given to Shuya Sophia Cai who is remarkably good for a child actress.Besides the film has a giant shark, and it is hard not to entertain with it. Although PG-13, I felt the violence was done pretty effectively under the restraints. There are a few pretty tense and eye-catching moments here. The final shark fight is completely unbelievable, but man is it fun to watch in how over-the-top it is. Overall, the film isn't deep but a lot of fun.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He's at his best whenever he's with Shuya Sophia Cai who's adorable throughout and their scenes together are endlessly endearing.Rainn Wilson totally understands the assignment as a selfish billionaire who can always sink lower and Cliff Curtis is just so damn likeable here. He's really funny and a real charme, in some ways he keeps this team together.Jon Turteltaub's direction is really good, his greatest strengths lie in how hard he tries to push that PG-13 rating and that he keeps everything moving at a brisk pace.

Jason Statham a great choice for the lead (his following just keeps getting bigger and more faithful) with great contributions from the terrific Cliff Curtis and the great Page Kennedy.

The dialogue contains more ham than a can of spam and is decidedly less tasty. I actually felt sorry for the unnecessarily large cast who had to deliver this corny and career limiting script. In particular, a special shout out to Jason Statham who manages to chew up the scenery much more effectively than the meg chews up the cast.The CGI is also dire and anything remotely approaching tension is lost to actors pretending to fight an empty green screen. At least Robert Shaw had a real rubber shark to eat him. way back when.The only moments of actual drama come when it rips off scenes from Jaws such as the beach scene and the Alex Kintner moment. It just shows how Jaws set the bar so high on shark movies which even its sequels couldn't come close to matching, let alone a big budget mess like this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I wanted to love it so bad. It's Jason Statham and a giant shark! Also the trailers made the film look really self-aware and funny, suggesting all the ingredients for a great ludicrous b-movie in the vein of the fast and the furious. I love the fast and the furious because those films know exactly what they are and how to play up the ridiculous elements that make them so enjoyable in a dumb entertainment way. But sadly, this film is just middle of the road. (Middle of the ocean...?) It's not knowingly self-aware enough to be enjoyable or obliviously terrible enough to be a great ironic guilty pleasure experience (like say Deep Blue Sea or Geostorm). The Meg has no idea what it wants to be. It's fluctuates between broad comedy verging on parody, and serious emotional disaster film throughout the runtime and it doesn't do either of these things well. It's not funny when it tries to be funny, and it's not emotionally affecting when it tries to be serious. All of the characters are as cliche as they come and for the most part portrayed by terrible actors. The only character you'll like is Jason Statham's, and that's only because of Statham himself, not anything to do with the character or the writing. But despite all this, I did have *some* fun with The Meg. The visuals are spectacular in the underwater sequences and the shark does look great. I also found the final confrontation between Statham and the Meg to be pretty entertaining. But these things are just a few minutes out of a otherwise very dull boring film. With films, like fast and the furious or deep blue sea, there is a consistent tone and style throughout the film, and that's what makes those films so enjoyable to watch. It's not enough just to have a couple crazy moments. But as I said, there is a moderate amount of fun to be had in The Meg. If you enjoy this sort of dumb action/disaster movie, I recommend finding a cheap Tuesday showtime somewhere or a matinee. Don't see this film for $15, you will be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
