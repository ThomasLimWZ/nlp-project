"7","/10","The sequel of Transformers is improved in direction, cinematography, effects, action, plot, duration, transformers, but is worse in seriousness compared to the 1st one.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6697108/?ref_=tt_urv","Mivas_Greece","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur126240095/?ref_=tt_urv","15 March 2021","Fantasy/action movie. The sequel to Bay's great franchise, Transformers. The 2nd film further enhances the action, the effects, but also the overall budget, since we are transported to the desert and foreign countries. Also, Steve Jablonsky's excellent selection in the music of the film and in the songs the top New Divide from Linkin Park continues. The second film is longer in plot and duration than the first, but Bay's lack of seriousness is also unfortunately reinforced in this film. He also makes reference to another of his great film, Bad Boys 2, through a large poster in the film, while in the first he mentioned the Armageddon. The threat of bigger, and more dangerous transformers, and generally all the elements are improved in this film, only overall it is less serious than the first, especially in dialogues and some characters. Better in action, effects, directing, but inferior in dialogues, so it remains at the levels of the first, perhaps a little below, but for different reasons.","45 out of 60 found this helpful.

Problem is, everything that made the first film so decent is basically gone here. The story is extremely formulaic and not really gripping in any way. Useless scenes and subplots are sprinkled throughout, especially during the college portions of the film. Shia does a good job as Sam once again but the rest of the original cast are either sidelined or written so badly you don't really care about them anymore. Megan Fox is especially exploited in this film, similar to the first Transformers but much more sleazily. Speaking of sleaze, the edgy humour of the first has carried over but where in that film it was fun, it has been toned up to borderline vulgarity. This film also adds quite a few new characters, some are cool, most are annoying and a handful are blatantly offensive. I'd give this film a 4 but the action really is worth a couple points. It's more of the first film but better, it's just a shame it's in a less consistent package than the first movie. Strong 5 to a light 6 from me.","22 out of 28 found this helpful.

Half the college footage was unecessary and the flim could have been a bit shorter. The characters and their development fell of by a mile in this sequel and the new characters were annoying, such as that roommate and the autobot twins. And the romance between Sam and Mikaela was a bit too cheesy and had no depth whatsoever.

Having said that, the story is a bit lacking and I really had to pay attention to try to understand what was going on at times. There could have been a bit more of the every day Sam to counteract the more apocalyptic elements and give a bit of balance. It all happens very fast.I also think that there was too much ""Comic Relief"". We already had The Witwicky's and Simmons and to some degree Sam himself, the addition of The Twins, Jetfire and Leo was fine, but they didn't need to be so comedic too.At times it is difficult during battle scenes to see who is who and which ones are winning.It is a good film though and an enjoyable watch for anyone who likes cars and things being blown up.","23 out of 31 found this helpful.

This movie stinks. When I heard that Michael Bay was at the helm of the first Transformers movie, I was very worried but then by some fluke of nature he actually managed to pull off a watchable movie, perhaps because he was kept on a tight leash by the studio.This debacle of a sequel is another story. Bay must have been given full power over this one due to the success of the first. Big mistake. This guy can’t make a decent, realistic and entertaining movie. He makes action/soft porn trash. A good script, story or dialog are just inconvenient afterthoughts for him and it shows. He probably thinks he can distract the audience away from these gaping holes by adding a lot of nonsensical action and unfunny humour.Sorry Mr. Bay you can’t fool people all the time and the people who grew up with the transformers are absolutely hating this movie. I heard that you didn’t want to make the first movie because you didn’t even like the transformers but you became very keen for the sequel after the first movie made so much money for you. Here’s a tip: lay off the third and let a real director and a real team make that one for us because you have just totally trampled on the transformers legacy.","519 out of 1,052 found this helpful.

When you attach your name to a project like this, hopefully fans will not give future projects done by these people record breaking box office feats. I'm embarrassed that I supported the cause.One of the poorest acting, directional, and written efforts I have seen in a long time in modern cinema. The scoop: This movie is good for a couple of scenes where the audience might be like 'cool!' due to CGI effects. There is a couple of cheap laughs from some other scenes. If that entertains you, great, there are lots of action movies out there for you. However, if you're reading a review on IMDb, you've likely separated well done movies from poorly done movies, and at least seen a couple in the top 250. To the reader, don't see this.I left the movies mad. I wonder what other directors think when they see a screening of this film. The story is near non-existent, there are so many plot holes, or unexplained courses of action this movie takes... it really is unbelievable that the script was given an okay by any film studio. Here's the thing : the target audience is obviously young kids or early teens. I think back to when I was 11 or 12 and I saw Men in Black in the theatres. I was entertained then, it's at least plausible that 12 year olds could be somewhat entertained by this now. However, I am still entertained by 'younger'generation stuff like spongebob, south park, and even beast wars. This didn't do it for me at all. Similarly to how family guy uses the strategy 'hey people love our interchangeable jokes in early episodes, let's overload our new episodes with the same jokes'.... Michael Bay employs 'hey people love the cgi and megan fox in the first one... let's overload the film with sex overtones, explosions, and fight scenes'... and then at the last minute tried to fit a story around it.This is the kind of film that makes a person angry that they aren't in Hollywood directing films, because most could do better than this.","304 out of 616 found this helpful.

Sadly, that's about everything good there is to say about ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"". Not only was the huge number of negative reviews for this film justified, but the second cinematic installment in the ""Transformers"" series is really paradigmatic of everything movies should not be.It all starts with the sub-par acting of Shia LeBeouf, which, by now at least, no longer comes as a surprise. Megan Fox, who plays the admittedly hot Mikaela Banes, doesn't really help either, as her role seems to be limited to bumping into stuff, falling and subsequently finding herself in ready-made bikini model poses, cleavage wide open. The story, if that is what we can call what little is left when we subtract 140 minutes of explosions from the film, is so blatantly drenched in in-ya-face product placement that even the most bullshit-resistant viewers will find it hard to look away.Now you might say: ""Fair enough, but wasn't the first 'Transformers' just the same?"". Well, here's where the real problems of ""Revenge of the Fallen"" start. While the original ""Transformers"" had some genuinely original, funny and gripping moments, ""Revenge of the Fallen"" largely lacks these elements. Most of the transforming and warping sidekicks are simply robotic versions of stale clichés, the humor has taken a turn for the worse and hardly any suspense builds up at all. It is this general lack of originality that makes for the new ""Transformers"" film to be so much less than good and entertaining popcorn cinema.150 minutes of random stuff blowing up without any real substance to the plot, cliché upon cliché, bad actor upon bad actor, and every so often a pseudo-moralistic lecture given to the audience by some over-sized pile of talking CGI-rubble - I can do without that kind of wisdom! Even just thinking about how many more people are going to watch this movie rather than one of this summer's real cinematic gems, such as Charlie Kaufman's ""Synechdoche, New York"", makes me a little sick!","255 out of 517 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Drivel. It's shameful that this will be remembered in the Transformers legacy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2093791/?ref_=tt_urv","matchitehew","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1834114/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2009","Well, I enjoyed it as it happened, but after some reflection...I've come to the understanding that this film is very, VERY messy.A lot of people defending this film are saying the action scenes are spectacular. Sure, they're spectacular...if you like trying to figure out just who's who and what's going on. Most of the time the characters are so obscured by objects/smoke that you can't see the ""action"" that everyone's raving about. When they're not behind something, the camera's changing every five seconds that you can't focus on the mess before you. The only cool part about these action scenes is the intense way some of the Transformers are disfigured.The over-all plot, story, and script of this thing comes together in the most ugly way possible. Most people are complaining about it being too all over the place, or that there wasn't one at all. Unfortuneatly, it's hard not to agree on both fronts. There was no flow, no suspense, no build up, no up, no down, just one flat line of point a to point b to point c. The intense battles would have been made more intense had they been preceded by some sort of build up, but they just kind of...happened. The plot in and of itself has the makings of something epic. MULTI-FILM EPIC. The script used to flesh out this story was mediocre AT BEST. It could have been so much more than what it was, it could have spaced apart plot points by delving into the characters (specifically: the transformers). Instead, the film was littered with unnecessary, and often crude jokes.Heck, this overly cartoony humor was barely present in the first film. Now it's been ramped up to over 9000, and it severely offsets any emotional impact the film might have had. Most of it would have been better suited to something like Aqua Teen Hunger Force, at least there crude humor comes off clever. It's really sad we had to put up with all of that instead of enjoying some actual quality time with our favorite machines.And, speaking of which, the lack of Transformer character development presents itself yet again. You would think after fans complained about the infrequent amount of Transformer screen time in the first, then things would have been different now. Nope. We still don't know what they're thinking, who they are as living beings, or really anything about them except that they shoot at the opposing force. And why would they just sit around in car mode when they were hidden? They came from a planet where they walked around freely, one would think they'd enjoy being able to just be themselves.The annoying liberties that were taken here in the name of artistic licensing are nauseating. I understand this is an ""adaptation"" and that things aren't going to be 100% to the source material. However, completely rewriting a character's personality is like killing off a loved one and replacing them with someone completely different. They also went waaaay to far with appearance, as well. Being a fan of a character from the series isn't' going to matter much here because there's a good chance they've been overhauled beyond recognition. Heck, the only one that barely made the transition from cartoon/comic to this blight of a film is Optimus Prime. No one else even remotely resembles their previous incarnations. From personality to appearance, this piece of work tramples all of the work of those before it...AND the fans they had sought to please.The film's treatment of characters like Sky/Jetfire is utterly appalling. It's proof that the people involved in this film don't actually give a crap about the characters in their movie. Then again, the lack of character development makes that just as obvious.The character design here is also noticeably different from the previous film. In the last film, all of the machines were quite bulky, a little more humanoid. The new ones here all seemed to be cartoony or very streamlined. The mini transformers all seemed to sport bug eyes, where as the ones last time around did not. Why would this new batch, decepticon and autobot alike, differ so much from the others? It's not like they were all brand new, they'd been around as long as the others. I dunno, different art direction from film to film grates on my nerves, especially when it comes to character design.And, for the love of sanity, WHY can't they treat women like people? If I wanted to gawk at girls who were just there because they're pretty I would look up questionable material online. I honestly feel sorry for her and any other actress who doesn't actually get a chance to show off any acting talent they might have. I don't have a problem with them showing a girl as being pretty in the film...but if that's all they concentrate on then they can just get right the heck out.The rest of the talent on hand might as well have been treated the same way. No one was really given an opportunity to actually do much acting, it was all jokes and running.The movie's fun, but if you have a brain you'd better shut it off or your going to find yourself wanting to bring some pain to the creators of this drivel. And for the love of pete, just because it's an ""action"" film doesn't mean the film can't have substance. It's possible to have a load of brain-flexing story AND explosions.","151 out of 305 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Could have been better, but could have been much worse!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2089265/?ref_=tt_urv","hugh_booth","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14190226/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2009","For the most part, this film is the decent thrill ride that the movie going audience is looking for. As an action moving, it has scenes to astound and thrill any avid fan. As a science fiction movie it stands reasonably well. It doesn't over-explain things and doesn't throw in concepts as central plot points that are blatantly impossible (super novas that threaten entire galaxies, I'm talking about you Star Trek). The movie also does relatively well on a comedic note, and from a standpoint of general plot. Though others have complained about the central importance of Sam's role being unlikely and a retread of the first film, it follows through logically from where the first film left off.Though the film is a lot of fun, it does have its flaws. Unfortunately the humor descends to the low brow a little too often. Also the Autobot twins that Michael Bay apparently loved so much were frightfully annoying. They did also lean towards offensive cultural stereotypes a little heavily. It is unfortunate because a couple of their funnier lines could have been delivered just as well by completely different characters. In fact they might have been funnier coming from a more straight laced Autobot. The use of the twins in pure Jar Jar Binks fashion (though not quite as irritating) was unfortunate given how many underused robots there were. The comment about Sam's roommate's bravery could have been unexpectedly hilarious coming out of Arcee.Most of the other glitches in the film were relatively minor and not worth mentioning, though the writers could use a geography lesson. If you enjoy action films and don't need a deeper artistic message, Revenge of the Fallen is well worth the watch.","100 out of 161 found this helpful.

"5","/10","An ambitious, over-indulgent attempt at making the ultimate brainless summer film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2087429/?ref_=tt_urv","tchockythegreat","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20431164/?ref_=tt_urv","27 June 2009","When discussing Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, one must disregard discussing issues typically inherent to most quality films, such as plot development, character development, and acting ability, because these aspects of film-making are clearly irrelevant to director Michael Bay, especially after considering that this movie is his latest entry in a lengthy resume of largely brainless blockbuster films. Rather, one must discuss what this movie is, and it is Bay's attempt at making the brainless summer movie to end all brainless summer movies.Looking back on classic summer popcorn movies such as Independence Day, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc., one will notice that most of these films tend to have one of a number of common denominators that draw the masses to them; loud and expensive special effects, a healthy dollop of action-adventure, an escapist premise, and at least one source of T & A. Some are critically acclaimed, most are critically panned for whatever predictable reasons that pompous critics who write for alleged high-brow publications typically come up with. But the bottom line is, these common denominators compose a formula for box-office success, one that moviegoers eagerly turn to time and time again. Based on his directing credits and based on how successful his movies have been, it's clear that Bay knows how to work this formula backward and forward.With Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Bay is not merely trying to top his first effort in the series from two years ago: he's trying to top every mindless popcorn flick ever made. This might initially sound like I'm overstating his ambition, but if one thinks about the movie for more than the five seconds that Bay expects your attention span to be, one realizes that this is the case.Bay's ambition must be commended. He knows that people don't go to see a movie about giant killer robots, or even a summer blockbuster period, for the interesting characters, or even a plot line that makes sense. So with this movie, he has masterfully attempted to eliminate all pretensions to the above, because his knows that those things are mostly irrelevant to bolstering a popcorn movie's bottom line. Indeed, after seeing this movie, all I could recall about the story was something about the bad robots needing to blow up the sun for some reason, and all I could remember about the characters was Shia LeBeouf's character running around screaming, John Tuturro's character making unfunny wisecrack after unfunny wisecrack, and Megan Fox's character looking unbelievably hot even while dirty and running for her life in the desert.Logically, this movie should be the best summer popcorn movie ever made. It's 2 1/2 hours of pulse-pounding relentless escapist fantasy. The special effects are amazing. The action is intense. There are enough shots of Megan Fox looking sexy to fill a few issues of Maxim magazine. It has everything a film fan should supposedly want from a summer popcorn movie, and it's all cranked up to 11.So why ISN'T it the best summer popcorn movie ever made? The answer to this question is a painful, age-old cliché. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is unabashed cinematic junk food in its purest form. Cinematic junk food can be tasty, but as the cliché goes, too much of it can be tiring, and will eventually give movie-goers a bellyache from over-indulging. But this isn't even merely cinematic junk food: it's the cinematic equivalent of drinking five extra-large energy drinks in one sitting: it'll get you going initially, and you'll be excited and maybe even a little entertained for awhile. But after the rush is over, you'll realize just how unhealthy for you it is to gorge yourself on something so shamelessly devoid of substance...or you'll become addicted to it and crave it even more.Considering just how much money this movie is likely going to make, it's safe to say that Michael Bay has addicted enough people to this franchise that he could likely get away with Transformers 3 being nothing but a slide-show of giant robots, explosions and sexy shots of Megan Fox. Don't tell me people wouldn't pay money to watch it, because people are basically paying money to watch it now.","98 out of 196 found this helpful.

After leaving Bumblebee and the other Autobots for college,Sam (Shia Labeouf) starts experiencing weird symbols in his head that result in the return of the Decepticons.","20 out of 28 found this helpful.

Neither of the Transformers films are masterpieces, but neither are terrible movies either in my opinion. And yes, this is coming from a fan of the 1984 series and 1986 movie. Transformers 2:Revenge of the Fallen is not the best of the year, but it is a long way from the worst either(not like The Ugly Truth or Dragonball Evolution). And is it the worst movie of all time as I have seen in some reviews and various message boards? For me, not even close.Does this mean it is completely flawless? No. The characters are rather shallow(the twins especially, they are offensive too), the story is formulaic with some of the scenes with the humans on the dull side, the Autobots get nowhere near enough screen-time and some of the script is weak going overboard with some lowbrow and immature humour. In regards to the latter though, it does have a few humorous and exciting parts so it wasn't quite as glaring as the characters and story problems and to be fair to those two problems the original suffered from the same problems exactly.But when it comes to the visual spectacle and effects, I can't fault this movie at all, the whole film does look amazing and the effects are in my view some of the best of the year. And the action sequences are very thrilling, there isn't too much and it makes up for the not-so-involving exposition with the human characters. The soundtrack is also fantastic, and the sound is very impressive in its authenticity. The acting is an improvement, Shia LaBoeuf is likable enough and while she is far from a great actress Megan Fox has improved as well. John Tuturo and Kevin Dunn are great too, but my favourite characters are Megatron and especially Optimus Prime voiced wonderfully by Hugo Weaving and Peter Cullen. Another improvement is Michael Bay's direction, I can find it murky and unfocused but it was serviceable here.Overall, an okay movie that gets some not-entirely deserved but understandable flack. 6/10 Bethany Cox","72 out of 119 found this helpful.

It is horribly apparent, however, that the guys behind this think so too, and wants to make that abundantly clear by shoving 2h of it down your throat, non-stop. And the initial amazement turns into boredom and annoyance.There is a laugh here and there, but other than that, what else makes up the movie is so extremely poorly done, there really isn't much movie here at all. It's like they started out creating action sequence after another with little or no respect to a story or plot, and then superglued it together with some subpar plot-fluff and poor acting. The movie is a near-complete hackjob.In all sincerity, with respect to the much disliked director Uwe Boll's quarrel with Michael Bay, I actually believe that if Uwe were given the same resources truly WASTED on this movie, he would produce something similar or even better.I also saw Steven Spielberg's name there somewhere. Which is just sad, given the man's earlier work.Personally, I will not waste any more money on these kind of movies ever again.","89 out of 186 found this helpful.

It lacked any discernible plot and was too long. Shia lebouef is never leading man material and meagan fox looks good until she opens her mouth and attempts to act.The new transformers movie is much more of the same. Its much too long and has the same problems as the first one. Its hard to distinguish between the good and bad robots in the big fight scenes. The script, such as it is, is padded with clichés and hilarious comic robots provide supposed light relief.I know revenge of the fallen is not meant to be some great cinematic masterpiece but its a blockbuster done badly. I like big dumb films. they can be terrific entertainment. Star trek is the best film of the summer so far. Big, bold and funny. The laughs in the fallen are lame and the major set pieces lose their impact due to the inflated running time. I sat in the cinema depressed. Meagan fox eased the depression slightly but if all a summer blockbuster has to recommend is a pouty pneumatic brunette its a sad state of affairs. 4/10","76 out of 157 found this helpful.

This is rare, but so, so very valuable.It becomes possible because film is hungry for ways of delivering that power, so it grabs weakminded filmmakers and forces them to extend cognitive boundaries and refine new visual grammars. That gives us the second kind of interesting film — where the project itself is worthless, but there is some clear new thing emerging that by itself makes the soul tingle with expectation over how it might be used by a real artist.This and its previous version are such a movie. They contain something that I think is important. I mentioned it in the comment on the first one and can only repeat the observation here. We are seeing here the development of a visual style that is more than a style I think.In an ordinary movie, the framing and staging is expository: you are shown what you need to see to make sense out of what is happening. If it is a boxing match with Sly Stallone, you see what is essential: you see perhaps the possibility, the actor, the action and the effect. Its all there, very carefully engineered. In fact, this engineering — a very constrained subset of what can be photographed — is what constitutes the contract we have in communicating visually.What I first saw in ""Black Hawk Down"" was an engineering of what you do not see. Some of the action happened around us, the camera eye moving as if it were panicked and seeing only a part of what is going on. You could not make out the sense of what caused what. Because we so solidly expect to see everything that causes things, when we deviate it is a powerful statement.What we have here are transformations and fights that are only partially framed. We are denied enough information to know precisely what is happening. We know there is an exact order to how the many parts fold into an automobile or plane, but we often see just motion. The effect is most pronounced in battle scenes when the viewer would be panicked in the motion and threat of war. Confusion and lack of comprehension is part of the effect. It isn't just random noise though; we know that though the screen is filled with scores of metal shapes apparently in chaos, they belong to two beings. We cannot sort out who is who. We know that within those beings, the animators have programmed coherent bodily motion. We know that each blow is basically like those of Stallone, but we do not know any of the physics behind it, or even which way it is going.This is an amazing visual experience. I saw it in Imax. Sure, the film otherwise is ridiculous, and I find the cosmology troubling. But it is notable that while they go to extreme lengths to explain every point in the history of why these beings are here and why they fight, they go to equal trouble to keep the visual understanding of the fight from us.I think this is something new, and I can't wait until it is used in a real film.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","37 out of 71 found this helpful.

And left the cinema absolutely gobsmacked at how terrible it was. Then the next morning my 10 year old niece wanted to watch it and her parents weren't willing to sit thru it and neither was I but they offered to pay for my service to accompany my niece and so I gave in and was willing to put myself thru it all again.And I'm glad I did, I actually managed to enjoy it the 2nd time around. Probably because I knew the bad points and they weren't gonna catch me by surprise. I must admit my expectations were quite high the Friday night, but once I knew what to expect it wasn't all that bad.The fight scenes, I personally thought were much more ""watchable"" than the first movie. A lot more slo-mo punches and such made it a bit easier to see just what exactly was happening. And of course, the special effects and general mayhem was literally out of this world. There were quite a few ""fun"" moments that made you laugh.And I don't understand the whole hullabaloo about the twinbots signifying racism. I thought they were funny, and it never occurred to me that they were based on black stereotypes. By the way, I'm black.Unfortunately though, there were quite a few points that need addressing when part 3 comes around. Most notable, unnecessary characters that do little-to-nothing to advance the story. And speaking of the ""story"" - a little more sense could help. I know its a "" fun summer movie"" but it didn't need to be a ""dumb fun summer movie"". The plot could have used a bit of tweaking.And the excuse that ""nobody comes to these movies for plot development, they just wanna see robots fighting"" makes no sense. Then they might as well have just had a 2 hour tag team WWE match-up in the desert quarry.Still I have to say it's worth a watch, although it could have been so much better.","67 out of 137 found this helpful.

After re-watching the first movie, I decided to review it (feel free to check that review out). Then, I thought it would be good to review all of the Transformers movies, which is why I am reviewing this. The Transformers series really is awesome, and it is one of my Top 5 favorite series. Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox really are a good couple in the movie, and they fit together perfectly, so they were great casting choices. Every other main casting choice was great, such as Josh Duhamel as Lennox, and Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. Everyone in the movie was great, however, and all played a believable part, and displayed their emotions and delivered their lines without a single problem or malfunction. One problem I had with the first movie was that the camera was extremely shaky during some of the battles. Sure, the recurring slow motion shots helped, but not all the time. There was not a shaky camera in this installment, and that really made me happy. The camera did a lot of cool angles, such as when they rotate around the action, or battles. Which were amazing except for one thing. Sure, the special effects were fantastic, and the battles were extremely entertaining. However, they were only entertaining when there were just 4-5 Transformers and a bunch of people at max. But there were some scenes where there were so many people and Transformers that I could not tell who was who. After you spend half of the battle figuring that out, they are really fun to watch. The special effects in the Transformers movies really are awesome, though. The Autobots and Decepticons look so great that they are even more believable than they would be if they were cheesy. The voice actors are so great in this movie, and all of the voice actors were perfect choices for the Transformers, which made them very fun to watch. The robots such as Mudflap and his twin added a lot of good humor to the film, as well. On to the music. The music was very good, and some of it was taken from the original Transformers, such as a song called Arrival to Earth, by Steve Jablonsky. Jablonsky made such good music for this movie, which is awesome because music is one of the most important parts of a movie. The setting varies greatly from the first movie, which is refreshing so it isn't like we are seeing the same battles again. The only reason I gave this movie only a 7 is because it is so long. Some of the scenes drag out way too much, and there were about five boring parts. The story also differs, which is good. The writers still used some of the objects in the first movie such as Energon and the AllSpark cube. There were new objects and new Transformers in this movie, which made it a lot better, too.

"7","/10","Not the kind of revenge i expected but still its enjoyable in many parts !!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2546264/?ref_=tt_urv","loopmyworld","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22210094/?ref_=tt_urv","9 January 2012","After the success of Transformes Michael Bay & Spielberg is back with Transformers revenge of the fallen. The movie introduces new alien robots like sideswipe, RC twins under autobots & newer version of bonecrusher & devastator under decepticons & the most important more hotter Megan Fox.Movie starts brilliantly & grips you as autobots join the classified strike team nest & hunt for decepticons foes around the world, & on the other hand Sam goes to college begins his life along with Megan.The movie is all about matrix hidden somewhere in Egypt by the ancestors to protect from the decepticons around 1700 BC.Megatron returns to life with the only piece of cube left & the hunt for matrix starts between autobots & decepticons. The movie is has got some of the best action sequences & exceptional CGI graphics. My personal favourite forest battle, very well executed & amazing sound efforts during the whole battle. The robots looks more detailed & the action scenes are much more smoother than the previous one. Shia has improved a lot over this movie & of course so does the Megan with her killing sexier looks. Linkin park gives the best theme song in the transformers series {New Divide}. Steve as usual gives the best score for the movie, specially during the forest battle.There are few things in the movie that i guarantee my viewers will agree with me. The RC twins were totally waste in the movie & the old age robot at the plane museum, actually they were irritating & were pain to my eyes & ears. On the other hand whenever the movie gets serious there are funny moments which ruins the mood of the movie this is the problem i have with you Bay get over it please. The movie could have been much better with the deletion of funny humour in the movie but still in many ways its enjoyable. I would recommend that Bay should have showen robots are replacing or repairing their parts damaged during the fight like painting their bodies, replacement of tyre's.But still as i am huge transformers fan i enjoyed the movie, but definitely not as the first one for sure. I rate this movie 8/10 !!!!","12 out of 16 found this helpful.

Sure summer blockbusters tend to be no-brainers but this movie takes it to a new level.There are a bucket load of special effects shown but they hardly have been put to good use by the director.They are wasted on a lot of unnecessary scenes. Its saddening really because they must have spent a huge amount of money and put in a lot of effort to make these special effects. They should have used the money to hire better writers.Sure there are some awesome scenes especially the ones involving Optimus Prime and of course the transformations.Some action scenes were amazing. Some scenes still give you the goosebumps. But most of them are chaotic and have no proper direction whatsoever. What we end up watching on screen is senseless and direction less metal-on-metal action with a whole lot of explosions and robots just firing at each other from everywhere. The transformers still look amazing but they seem better in the first part.There a lot of new ones involved this time and sometimes you struggle to differentiate between the autobots and the decepticons.There are a few irritating transformers as well. The transformation sequences of the robots are not shown as well as in the first movie but are still incredible though, the sequences in the first part were much better.Megan Fox sizzles on screen. But she has been used too much in excess, no doubt to cover up the innumerable flaws in this movie(which of course she doesn't). Shia LeBeouf does a pretty good job. Apart from the military guys the other characters are horrible,dumb, painfully irritating and totally unnecessary.The climax shot in Egypt and Jordan is ridiculous.I sure did expect much more from it in terms of action.The climax in the first one was incredible and left you amazed. The direction is incredibly horrible. This is truly a very lazy attempt at making a movie, I think the makers knew the movie would become a smash hit because of the hype of the first movie and hence have come up with such a piece of crap.3/10...3 is just for some incredible special effects,some good action sequences and Megan Fox of course.","59 out of 121 found this helpful.

This one had a lot of excitement, there was no boring parts. It was a little darker, the Decepticons had a lot more screen time in TF2, and Megatron was Beastly, Starscream was better in the 1st one. My favorite part of the movie was Megan Fox and Optimus. Megan is not the best actress, but she's so hot you don't care what her acting is like, so she was enjoyable to watch, Optimus was the best, he kicked a lot more butt in this one than in the first one. He didn't let Megatron throw him around at all. well better see it! if you are a huge transformer fan like me you'll love it!","32 out of 42 found this helpful.

I figured the plot would take a back seat to the action and special effects, and I assumed the effects would be great. While I was right on both counts, I was stunned at how painfully long the movie felt - not how long it WAS, as I knew the run-time, but how excruciatingly dragged out it felt as I was sitting in the theater. If I hadn't been at the theater with friends, I would have walked out early on. Regrettably, I stayed for the whole thing. So many of the scenes seemed completely worthless, as they did nothing to further the plot. I was also surprised by the content of many truly inane, tasteless scenes: the mindless, grade-school humor, the borderline (borderline?) racist depictions, the jarring dialogue. These are all sins that can be easily forgiven if one is a pubescent boy. Michael Bay obviously knows his audience; it's too bad I didn't realize in time that I wasn't meant to be a part of it.","44 out of 88 found this helpful.

I went in with the understanding that there would be a lot of action, but I also went in with the expectation of the same amount of human dialogue and screen time from the first one, if not more. I didn't care about the characters in the slightest, and it's because the main characters were no longer Sam and his family and friends. They were robots; poorly scripted uninteresting robots. Like I said, wonderful for boys who need 98% of a film to be consistent explosions and action. It is not, however, enjoyable for anyone who is not the aforementioned.

This is not one of them. OBVIOUSLY this movie had more going for it than those pieces of no good crap, seriously people, put more thought into your ratings. This movie was not like Epic movie.Overall, I enjoyed the film, but I also know it was not a very good film. Here is why...Michael Bay. Bay, as we all know, is still a child at heart...a VERY little child. Which means he finds things like sex jokes, explosions, and fooling around hilarious. We were unfortunate enough to have him put on the transformers series, honestly anyone else would have made them better. He took his inner child and spilled it all over this movie. Between robot humping, explosion after explosion, farting jokes, and overdone closeups of Megan Fox we can see the Michael Bay traits in this film. All this added together ruined a lot for me. At times it was almost hard to watch, especially when Sam's mom gets high which was not necessary, yet Bay finds it amusing. You all get the idea, Michael Bay is the reason this film had all it's negatives.Here is why I enjoyed the film. Simply because I love action. This movie delivered all of what I wanted to see in the first Transformers when it came to action. In the first one, we say very little fighting especially with Optimus. A lot of people saw the first wanting to see Optimus woop Decepticon butt, however he ended up getting HIS ass wooped. With Revenge of the Fallen, we get an all new badass Optimus Prime whose voice sounds like god, ""I'll take you all on!"". When I was in the theater watching Optimus during the Forest fight, the audience was rooting out loud for Optimus. The last time I saw that happen was during the 2005 King Kong T Rex fight.Overall, this movie delivers on action but fails on story which is what everyone else has been saying, but don't give it 1 star for that! 1st one had better story but not as much action, this one went vis versa. Big lack of character development in this one, way too many autobots, but it did not ruin the movie for me. What ruined a lot of it was Bay's inner child.My thought? I think Michael Bay should be pulled off the project and they should put J.J. Abrams on the project. See what he did with Star Trek? Imagine what he could do with Transformers. Let us all pray that Michael Bay does not do this again, or the 3rd movie will full out suck. Pray with me people.","48 out of 82 found this helpful.

But I could not watch this film anymore after the first 30 minutes. Where to begin? The acting was awful. Megan Fox and Shia Le Boeuf should not be allowed in front of a camera anymore. The plot was... I'm not actually sure there was a plot. The attempt at humour... was aimed at apparently no one. To be more specific: the entire dialogue and acting by Shia's characters mother... drove me insane. Zero point whatsoever to her even being in the film, let alone actually having a lot of dialogue and scenes. The Megan Fox Show aspect of the movie was completely pointless. And how many times could they play that agonizing Green Day song!?!?!? I think they played the song 5 different times throughout the first 30 minutes. The song is horrifying to listen to once.. let alone 5 times.Considering this film was made in a society that allows Britney Spears and Lady GaGa to have success, it doesn't surprise me that this film was SO terrible.But it is a shame. Just like they did with Spider-Man... they took GREAT potential, and instead of creating Gold, they created feces.","54 out of 112 found this helpful.

I guess i can a little. Action was spot on and much more clearer, cool slow motion shots when necessary and great combat between the robots. In comparison to the first Tranformers instalment it was a lot better. Improved and delivered well in that department.Tranformers: revenge of the fallen pretty much offers visual action at it's best. Fights, shoot em' up scenes and blowing up things. Effects again were mind blowing, just like the first one the effects were truly amazing (as you would expect) nothing has changed there. With offering all those many flaws, somehow it manages to slip everywhere else. Apart from the robots scenes (who had much more screen time compared to the first one.) It was all just a big waste. The scenes between the characters such as Sam Witwicky (Shia) Mikaela was unnecessary as nothing much got developed. Sam's family still had there touch of comedy, which was good to see. They were pretty hilarious. Also old characters were bought back into it, which was nice to see. New robots were introduced too, but there character content was a little weak. But something still was definitely missing, it wasn't the same. I preferred the way the first Transformers instalment was panned out, i missed the more immature ""human character's"" screen time.The film does have a long duration, but it didn't really effect me. It went pretty fast. I guess if you prefer a movie with full on fun action, then you will love this one. I suggest you see the first Transformers first though as it introduced the whole ""Transformers saga"" Overall i find it hard to rate. Were it succeeded in many things (action and adventure) i was let down in the many things that didn't remain from the first instalment (social screen time, comedy) Michal Bay again did well and delivered a good sequel, but i hope there will be a third instalment. It's a love it or hate it type of movie, Transformers fans will be pleased. Watch it yourself and then you will know.","28 out of 45 found this helpful.

Everyone has grown up since then, but the reason we go to see transformers as ""sophisticated"" adults is to reach back to that nostalgia - this is what we are after. movies are pieces of art that tell a story, sometimes these stories are fantastical/dramatic/philosophical etc., not every movie should have to fit all criteria provided by the movie critics who would prefer every movie to be citizen kane, or the godfather perhaps. in fact, if you went to see transformers and you have something along the lines of ""there was little character development - it didn't move me - the dialogue wasn't what i wanted"" it is you who are the lesser for having complaints when you should have known what you were going to see before you bought your ticket. it's transformers, don't try to make it something else - each movie/book/painting has its place - learn to like things for what they are","46 out of 94 found this helpful.

I respect the fact that you didn't like it. But come on, the director made a great job in this sequel. Even the story was new, I never thought that the story would be like this. I thought that it would be the traditional storyline of the villain who wants to have his revenge. The script is good. I agree that there some jokes that are completely pointless and added length to the movie. As well as, some weird jokes like farting. But look on the other side, the battles are perfect. Especially the one of Bumblebee, it was perfectly orchestrated, adding to that Optimus Prime's battle against the Decepticons, I have never seen Optimus so strong. Some of the scenes are close and quick, but we got to see the original forms of the robots. If there's something that I didn't like about the film, is that they gave lots of scenes for the army during the battles whilst they could have give the scenes to the other Autobots so they would appear more. At the end, I believe that the movie is one of a kind, and Micheal Bay did a great job. He resurrected the fame of the Transformers","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

I wasn't particularly blown away by the first movie, but it had great special effects and a somewhat decent plot. I figured: if it's on the same level as the previous flick i will surely enjoy myself.Movie begins. Chase on the freeway. Megan Fox on bike. Explosion explosion, explosion. ""Wait a minute... what's happening here?"" Cheap joke, explosion explosion explosion. ""Eh.... Who's who? What are those robots fighting about? How did those parents end up in the desert? Is there a plot?"" Then my eyes forcefully closed and i dozed off. The movie was boring.I really wonder why they couldn't stick to the basic idea of the cartoon. The cartoon had two factions: autobots and decepticons. Each faction had equal screen time. Once in a while the story would switch to the other side by means of an autobot logo switching to the decepticon logo (or and vice versa). The story centred around the robots and not around the humans. The humans were caught in the middle of the fight against their will, and were being protected by the autobots. Why are these movies so different? So, don't see the movie unless you need a good few hours of sleep.","35 out of 72 found this helpful.

You can guess the excitement I had when I heard they were making a live action movie as well as a lot of other die hard Transformers fan were. I was amazed at the visual aspect and cg effects used in the first movie. I was blown away at how realistic the Transformers looked and how they were able to move flawlessly. The movie concept and action scene were all top notch and went down as a summer block buster movie with good reason. After hearing critics come down on the first one because it was a ""Micheal Bay blockbuster disaster"" I could not believe it. Micheal Bay is an icon for explosions and action movies, some may disagree but hey, its an opinion right? Now, Transformers Revenge of The Fallen, simply marvelous. Totally took every expectation I had for the movie and multiplied that by 10. I first saw the movie in IMAX and was visually stunned! I was in marvel at a 60+ ft Optimus Prime in front of me as if I was in the damn movie or the movie was real life. I believe this is the best cg animated movie ever made, I mean come on, 160 TB of cg effects? That's never been heard of! Even the first one was only 80 or so TG. But, critics again bashed the movie. Saying it was ""A Waste Of 2 1/2 Hours"" and ""Michael Bay should hang up the directing"". This is all the work of self loathing hypocrites who have no better opinion for a well deserved film than to bash it or make it so that nobody wants to see it. I fully disagree with the bashing or mediocrity involving the negative comments towards these two wonder movies. I think Michael Bay did a magnificent job portraying the Transformers and incorporating the small things from the cartoon stories. I am most excited that he will do a 3rd installment of this film and think that anyone else couldn't pull it off.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

Mikes become a pop-director who likes his product placements and his royalty checks. He's a sell-out who doesn't care about quality anymore. I question if he ever really did want to make a decent movie.

It stars Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox , John Turturro, Ramón Rodríguez, Josh Duhamel & Tyrese Gibson. Ben Seresin is the cinematographer and the music director is Steve Jablonsky. The Autobots and the US military have formed an alliance called NEST, their singular goal is to rid the World of Decepticons. But now they face their biggest challenge, because heading for Earth is the ultimate destroyer, The Fallen. Michael Bay has never been the most subtle of film directors, he knows how to have fun, and in the main he knows how to drag his target audience along with him for a slam bang good ride. After the hugely enjoyable Transformers film, and after its subsequent success, he has crafted a sequel that he felt needed a more is more approach, where everything is bigger and louder and nothing pauses for breath. The end result is a dizzying ball of entertainment that's sadly devoid of substance. If ever there was a film to be put forward as OTT then Transformers 2 is a leading candidate. The plot is thin yet unnecessarily made complex by the writers, who you feel are trying to be heard in amongst the eye candy carnage, while Bay even resorts to cheap moments of crudity to get some laughs for his film. His cast are fine, yes Megan Fox seems to only serve as a drawing in weapon for the randy teenagers, but she still works well off of the ever likable LaBeouf, who in turn continues to deliver a good line in action comedy performance. Pity, tho, that in a film that's so big, with everything expanded, that John Turturro doesn't get more screen time. Only he, with his visual comedy at optimum, can make a metal testicle scene seem less crass than really it is. When all is said and done, all the human actors are playing second fiddle to the Bots/Cons and metal critters. To that end the film is exciting, undeniably so. Sure some of the set-ups riff on other movies that have gone before it, but Bay is the master of Bayhem, there's just too much fun to be had if one is prepared to forgive its shallow center. With a third film on the go and set to be released in 2011, without Megan Fox (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley slipping into the considerably short skirt this time), it's anyone's guess what we will actually get this time. Will Bay pull back a touch and give us a story, with characters given time to breath? Or will it be bigger and noisier than part 2? You hope it's the former, but even if it's the latter, it will be fun for those after a certain level of popcorn explosive cinema. Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is like a great ride at the funfair, one you have been on four times in a row. You know you have had a great time, but as your head starts to spin and your stomach feels queasy, you wonder if it was just too much overkill? 6/10","21 out of 36 found this helpful.

It was up and down for my take. First, what the hell was all the ridiculousness of Sam's mom visiting him in college. Please, let's bring a marijuana reference to make us laugh. Come on, that was as low brow as it gets. Also, not to break up the fact that the effects are amazing, but it is extremely hard to tell who is who in this movie! I mean, give me more colors and an easy way to decipher whether these guys are Autobots or Decepticons. Say their names for God sake!!! I almost, nay, I do miss the 1986 movie where at least I knew who I was seeing and could root for or hate against the robots because I knew who they were. Also, what the hell happened to Devastator??? I thought I heard he was in this movie but failed to see him or any constructagons at all. Michael Bay, you do an amazing job with action and special effects so bravo. However, as a fan and as most people watching should be fans, it lacks on some basic levels. First, don't introduce ridiculous characters (the twins) who were a complete social shall I say rip-off of a genre which didn't need to even be there?? I'd rather take two robots who were just robots than to offend a race or ethnicity by what you did. Now, I'll just rant on what I thought could have been better. Megan Fox....you are dumb. She really did absolutely nothing and did not even need to be in this movie. Sam, (nitpicking now), could have been called Spike to start with since we all remember Spike from the original series but have no clue where Sam came from. Bumblebee...became a badass robot?? Should be smaller and able to freaking TALK!! Where are the robots we remember? Jazz, Hound, Sideswipe? At least you mentioned Ironhide. Did Shockwave just sit in outer space?? What the hell was that for? Yes, we saw Prowler, but no Soundwave? He was the bomb in the series. Again, and I can't stress this enough, there should be more mention to who we're seeing and more colors to represent who we see. Most decpticons were plain silver (gray metal) and we had no clue who they were showing. I think Michael Bay needs to sit down and actually watch a whole series to get what the audience would like to see. The premise and plot was good for the movie, but it was all over the place with random characters, weird enemies we didn't recognize, and robots who came and left and were not heard from again. I absolutely LOVED the original transformer movie because it brought in all the characters from the original series, gave us a good plot and scenario of what was going on, and brought in new characters and events that we could follow and enjoy. There will be a third movie, yes, I know. I already think that it will be another shoot off of Shia and Megan Fox and some plot dealing with just Megatron and Optimus Prime. Ho hum. If you really want to draw everyone in, bring in characters we all know, a LOT of them. Bring in the Dinobots! Bring in the bots that transform into the Huge bots such as DEVASTATOR. And please,please, make the transforming 'sound' when they transform. That was the standard and I actually liked when I heard that. Yes, you brought in a lot of action, suspense, and thrilling things to see. BUT, you left out what a lot of us miss, which is having the things we came to see in the first place! Bring us more characters we know and love, mention their names, even make the characters more cartoony, and not so machine-like. I like my polygons to be quick to recognize if they are a truck, car, or plane. Not take 3 minutes to see if they transform into a radio. All I'm leaving this with is I feel the fans of Transformers want what we love, not what Michael Bay thinks is the 'hip' kind of robots. Remember what made this popular is what will continue to make it popular. Autobots! Roll out!","20 out of 36 found this helpful.

I like how he brings some overblown action entertainment to the screen with basically all of his movies. His Transformers movies however have never really appealed to me.But having said that, I actually have to admit that I liked this movie better than the first. It seems like they learned from some of their mistakes of the first movie, which also makes me somewhat more hopeful for the third movie ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". If they improve even more, the movie could actually turn out to be quite good, as well as entertaining.Cause by saying I liked this movie better than the first one, I'm not saying at all that this is being a very good movie. It's entertaining enough to watch but that is it really. Everything about it is quite bad and simplistic but I'm of course not talking about the special effects though.The special effects are basically what Bay's Transformers movies are being known for. They are top of the bill and with each movie they keep pushing to the limits of what's possible and come up with new unseen stuff. They are innovative movies special effects wise and that's also why I often enjoy watching a Michael Bay movie; they are big budget ones but you can always see the budget back on the screen. Not only with its computer effects but also all of its action in general.And yes, there obviously is plenty of action in this movie. But too much though in my opinion. At times the movie is really nothing more than the one big action sequences after the other, which quite frankly can get tiresome to watch. After a while you stop caring what is happening, also because you often don't even understand what is going on. Not because the story is hard to follow but just because of the way the movie got shot and told. The movie is definitely too long as well, also because the last hour or so is being like one big action piece, that could had wrapped up things far sooner.But strangely enough the reason why I still liked this movie better than the first one was its story. This actually might sound strange because this movie its pre-production really suffered from the writer's strike. The story had to be finished in a hurry, while Michael Bay had already come up with some big action sequences to write a story around, connecting them all. So by all means, the story shouldn't work but it just all felt less random this time. Maybe it was a good thing that they had to come up with things in an hurry because when having more time, you also have more time to come up with lots of other crazy action stuff, like perhaps was what happened and was the problem with the script of the first movie.Also all of the characters worked out better this time around. Lots of characters and actors from the first movie return in this one and the movie seems to have found a better balance between their sequence and the ones featuring the Autobots and Decepticons.An entertaining enough overblown movie to watch but by no means a great one.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","15 out of 26 found this helpful.

A plot hole is like the scene in the Matrix where Keanu is on the roof and fires all his shots at the agent misses every shot drops his weapons they hit the ground and he says ""Trinity help!!!"" The agent then empties his clip at Neo who dodges almost every shot and gets grazed by a few, as the slow motion stops he falls to the ground along with his weapons that had already hit the ground. Thats a plot hole.This movie is not perfectly written (feels a bit joggy and doesn't seem to flow naturally) I'll admit that but this is also a Micheal Bay film, if you wanted something more then action and T&A then look elsewhere as this movie is loaded with both.I originally gave this movie a 10, yes it was a knee jerk reaction but at this time Id still give it a 7 or 8. It does what it sets out to do, there's action, cheesy jokes like in the first movie nice long shots of Megan's bits and pieces.This movie did what it was supposed too, however I will admit that the Autobots like Ironhide and Ratchet had very few lines :( and the Decepticons lacked introduction and development.I did enjoy this film but maybe I was not expecting as much as everyone else was. I wanted to be entertained I wanted to escape reality and realism and thats what I got a few hours to kick back and enjoy a film for what it does well.","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

Although i felt the movie was awesome, i still felt there were a handful of negatives regarding the movie as a whole. here is the handful of negatives!1. megan fox. her acting is MUCH better than the first movie. and i remember reading an interview where she actually said ""i've worked much harder on my acting this time round"". sam's mother is also quite annoying, but you either love her or hate her.3. there's a lot of scenes that were pointless. they could have easily cut down the movie half an hour shorter. so yes...the movie is incredibly long! make sure you choose a cinema with comfy seats! 4. there's a slight drag to scenes. but the movie holds so many positives which is why it's a must see movie.1. the graphics are INCREDIBLE 2. many believe there wasn't much of a story line???? they're WRONG. in fact, there's more of a story line the second time round. 3. bigger and bolder characters. when i say bigger...i mean bigger! there's two that are HUGE compared to optimus prime. 4. humour. the movie holds different types of humour: humour that will appeal to just the children, just the adults and both. so great family movie5. original cast members. some may hate this, but i don't. I like seeing the same people. even the guy from sector 7 is in it! who, might i add, is one of the best characters in the movie. but the only person i see missing is Jon Voight. which is no biggie because he didn't play a vital character. I honestly could go on, on and on. It really is a good movie. oh! and there's something really important that you should know. DO NOT WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT ON DVD. why? 1. Small screens will not give this movie justice. 2. i don't think it's a movie suitable to own on DVD. i wouldn't be able to sit still while watching it...it's sooooo long","19 out of 35 found this helpful.

How does Michael Bay keep getting work? Don't get me wrong, the first transformers sucked but it was The Dark Knight compared to this horse dung. Now i will attempt to list everything that is wrong with this movie( that i can think of there's so much to list i can't remember it all.)#1 The script sucks(if there is one at all). nothing about this movie makes any sense and i mean NOTHING. #2 It's NOT funny at all. The two gang banger robots are not funny just because they talk about farts and genitals. Sam's parents are annoying as hell and the dogs hump hardy har har. #3 Megan Fox. Yeah she's hot but she can't act to save her life. #4 The action sequences are bleary and nauseating. #5 Michael Bay does not know the difference between story and specal effects. He is what makes this atrocity so atrocious. He shouldn't just never be allowed to make another movie again, he should be arrested for releasing this monstrosity upon the world. SHAME ON YOU Mr. Bay. #6 It's way too long. It's not like the Lord of the Rings which was a masterpiece and had a reason for being so long. This just goes on and on and leads to nothing. I thought I would die of boredom. To put it simply this movie sucks. Don't see this movie.

They named him Galvatron, but Bay couldn't do that because people like you would have one more thing to complain about not understanding.

Sam is having hallucinatory episodes of Cybertronian symbols, and is being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named The Fallen (Tony Todd), who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process.The story is very incoherent, but I still watch this movie and like I said, this movie had a lot to go through before being released and I am not going to talk about this movie. My god, man. I can't hate this movie.If there is one thing I hate about this movie, that is a scene where Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron and I did feel some emotion in the scene, but I almost cried because he was killed and did not come back into this film until before the end credits come on and when he comes back, it is okay, but I just did wish they did not kill him off in the middle portion of the film.The visual effects on the Transformers are really amazing as hell and it was fantastic, but the CGI on the Fallen is a little off, but it is really amazing. The musical score by Steve Jablonsky is really amazing and the score is just fantastic as hell, especially with the other Transformers films and the scary movie remakes produced by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller, this includes the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday THE 13th remakes. The acting is amazing. Shia LaBeouf once again plays Sam Witwicky and he does an amazing job. Megan Fox is really hot and cool as Mikaela Banes and this would be her last TRANSFORMERS film, and I would have loved to have seen her play that character in the third film. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are cool in their roles, too. John Turturro is really funny, but there are scenes that the humor is taken way too far in this film.Isabel Lucas as Alice is creepy and hot in the screen time that she has. The other person, Ramon Rodriguez is funny as hell as Leo in this film and I would have liked to have seen him in the third film as well.This would be the last film to be distributed by DreamWorks Pictures as Paramount Pictures distributed future films in the franchise.Overall, with TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, I love and hate this film and that's pretty much it. I give it a 5 out of 10 because I have the two-disc DVD and I watched the special features and even the documentary and I felt sorry for the filmmakers and cast doing this film, but they made one hell of a sequel. Critics should have gave this movie a lot of critical praise for this movie.This is Michael Bay's worst reviewed films along with Pearl Harbor, Transformers: Age of Extinction and Bad Boys II.","22 out of 30 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Transformers 2 A Decent Sequel With Some Flaws","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2147431/?ref_=tt_urv","sebastianbishop8749","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22053103/?ref_=tt_urv","26 October 2009","Let me say that I'm a fan of the first Transformers movie. It had some flaws but I still enjoyed it overall. The same goes for this sequel which after seeing twice I actually liked this film more the second time than I did the first. Yeah it has flaws that were in the original but this sequel isn't as bad as critics made it out to be. It does suffer from a rushed finale (Optimus vs The Fallen), an abrupt ending, and not a whole lot of character development for the robots but that's all right because I guess they served their purpose. Most of the humor worked too except for some that didn't. Michael Bay is a talented director and he's admirable in giving audiences more of everything (giant robots, intense action, special effects and humor) in this one which worked for the most part. Labeouf reprises the role of Sam Witwicky providing his usual comic relief and he's believable as the character. Megan Fox is all right as Mikaela but isn't given much to do except to be eye candy. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back as well and they're good in their limited screen time. John Turturo is also back and he does a good job as the wacky former Sector 7 Agent Simmons. The rest of the cast are okay including the military and Sam's parents. The special effects are top notch and the robot action/fight sequences are well executed. The one that stood out is between Optimus and three Decepticons in a fierce forest showdown that leaves the Autobots leader ready for the scrap yard. The biggest flaw this movie has is the treatment given to most of the robots. Many of the new Decepticons including Soundwave, Grindor, Ravage, and Demolisher among many others merely show up for a few minutes before being destroyed or disappearing only to be killed off much later when they reappear briefly for the desert climax. The same can go to the new Autbots introduced too including Arcee, Jolt, Jetfire, and Sideswipe because they arrive early on (except for Jetfire who shows up in the second half) but then after that they only make brief appearances throughout the movie but their characters are okay despite only being given a few minutes of screen time. Even returning ones like Optimus, Bumblee, Ironhide and especially Ratchet seem to be fighting for screen time because the're MIA for large parts of the movie. Optimus isn't in it for a very large part of the second half but I was glad to see he eventually returns briefly for the third act so his character is sure to be back for the third one. Bumblebee like the other Autobots seem to be in their vehicle modes for a majority of the move but they do get their moments. Megatron and Starscream get a little more to do than the first one action and screen time wise but not by much. The two characters I was little disappointed in were The Fallen and Devastator. They both get at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time. The Fallen could've been a good villain but he's killed off in his only fight near the end by Optimus way too easily and he could've been a much more worthy adversary. Devastator had promise and looked like cool but the joke with the wrecking balls for his well you know I didn't find all that funny. Not to mention Devastator doesn't show up until near the end is easily defeated like The Fallen. Scorpnok makes a blink and you missed it cameo in the desert climax before being killed off as quickly as he appeared. There seemed to be too many robots on both sides but as mentioned before I guess they sort of served their purpose by giving the movie an action/fight sequence. The only two characters to get any sort of development were the Twin Autobots. I didn't find them racist like some critics did and they're not as bad as you might assume. More screen time could have been given to Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, or Ratchet without them but hey thats all right. The abrupt ending left you wondering about what happened to many of the characters who didn't die. There was also a part late into the film where Sam gets hurt and then a second later his hand is bandaged up so this seemed like an error by the writers for not coming up with a better way to put Labeouf's real life injury into the movie. The ending does leaves the door open for another sequel but I hope if they do make a third film they improve the flaws that were in the previous ones. The humor was often funny (Sam's mom eating brownies) while others not so much (Dog/Robot Humping and the joke with Devastator). The movie was a little long but the action make's it move at a relatively steady pace though. Overall despite it's flaws Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is a decent sci-fi adventure with plenty of robot action, some humor, and good performances by the cast. This sequel could've been a little better but Transformers 2 is worth watching and I still enjoyed it. So if you're a fan of the first film you'll probably like this one as well.","17 out of 31 found this helpful.

It's exhausting duration-time does not help out when there's really no climax to appear, scene after scene after scene Bay tries topping himself with explosions, shiny cars, ""funny"" one-liners, robot-fights where it's impossible to tell who's fighting who, an outrageously bad love story and a dooming story that uses bogus words to get out of a clamp. And for that matter, director Bay doesn't seem all that interesting in story, he is far more interesting in going out on the highway (again!) and making those wheels screech, or loading-up military weapons with our men Josh Duhamel and Tyrese; the plot-holes he makes leaves much bigger craters than his explosions.Using this kind of budget, and having so many ideas to pull from, we're left with what may just be the worst sequel of all time. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen does not manage to make one good scene; that's what I call a horrible mess.","26 out of 55 found this helpful.

It was disjointed, sophomoric and should not have been able to receive a 'PG-13' rating from the MPAA.Bay clearly has a fondness for our Military, and for that, I am thankful. And there were a few interesting moments on the outset of the film, but they were quickly overshadowed by oversexed college students, silly, sophomoric humor that was all but devoid of taste, and sub-par writing delivered by even worse 'acting'. Bay knows how to blow crap up, and do it well. But wow, did he drop the ball with this one.The silly thing is that one even has to say these things about a film like this. It's a movie about giant robots from a planet called Cybertron. One should not even have to comment on a film like this in such a way. That's what makes the film such a sad state on the affairs of Hollywood today. That one has to point out the crude, tasteless, pointless film-making of a movie about a Hasbro toy.Hollywood, shame on you for making a film that should be fun and a nice escape into something that any sane parent with half of a brain will have to seriously consider (and I hope, decide against) whether or not to take their children (13 and up) to see.I'd rant about the film more. But really, do I have to? I think anyone thinking clearly could understand within minutes that 'Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen' was not only a waste of time, but a waste of a fun idea.Too bad.","34 out of 75 found this helpful.

A vast improvement. It was also vastly better due to the fact that the Transformers appeared so much, unlike the first film in which they were more like Cameo's in this they where is most of the scenes. Unfortunately many of the new Autobots and Decepticons didn't get named, i only knew whop they were from finding out previously online. Prior to the film, there was a lot of criticism about Skids and Mudflap's appearance because they appeared to be designed like Jar Jar Binks from star wars. I found that in the film, they actually stood out as key characters and were lovable characters. This is the same for Jetfire, who was criticised for looking to much like an old man. Sam's parents, two of the humans i was really pleased to see again, both of whom played a bigger part in the film, and i am glad about this, i thought their roles really contributed to the film. This is the same for Simmons from the first film, as well as Major Lennox.Apart from a few minor plot holes this has to be the best film i have ever watched. As soon as it is out i am going to be buying this on Blu Ray.I Rate this 10/10 and would recommend it to everyone!","46 out of 69 found this helpful.

I didn't think the shameless corporate advertising and abominable military propaganda from that film would be repeated. Then I remembered having seen 4.2 minutes of Pearl harbor (completely by mistake; I was waiting for my tires to be rotated) and shuddered.Yes, Michael Bay can make worse cinema than the first so-called Transformers film.And so he did. I have never before witnessed such trite and random comic relief than what this film offers (OK, a middle-aged woman whining that things suck? the same woman repeatedly using adolescent curses? the WWE-style trash-talking between robots?), and I had no idea you could pack hundreds of instances of such superfluous nonsense into just one instance of cinema.If that's not enough to put you to sleep, add in about 35 minutes' footage of robots transforming. Sorry; not interesting. Not even a 2-year old will remain engaged after the first drawn-out alteration. I know this for a fact; mine fell asleep 7 minutes into the film. I joined her for about 20 minuted at the beginning of the second hour and was very ticked off to find I hadn't missed anything.I won't go off on the military recruitment propaganda anymore - if you're too stupid to see through it yourself that's your problem.The final word on this film: good thing I stole it. No single person is more deserving of having his 'art' stolen than Michael Bay, and no studio deserves to sell one less ticket than Paramount for having allowed such utter trash to be distributed to the public.","39 out of 88 found this helpful.

(It's interesting that this this films was released only one year after Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; both star Shia LaBeouf and both are constructed as loosely connected vignettes built around a surplus cast of useless side characters. This Spielbergian sub-genre officially died here.)This structure is how the initial disappointment sets in; it's deliberately banal, as if the screenwriters had no idea what to make the movie about and so threw together a grab-bag of ludicrous plot elements involving the Matrix of Leadership, dream symbols, ancient history, All-Sparks, Sun destroyers---recent audiences will recognize this same tactic from the wretched Star Wars Rise of Skywalker. This problem does not automatically stem from the fact this is a 'Transformers' movie---the very title 'Revenge of the Fallen' suggests something almost Milton-esque, but the storytellers obviously have no clue how to construct an epic narrative to match the oversized heroes. That's failure number one.The other failures mostly rest on the shoulders of Michael Bay, who neglects the (for him) restraint of the first film and plows full speed into inanity. His fine eye for composition is still evident in the action scenes, but they're mostly so long, cacophonous, and numbing that not even the impressive practical effects can save them. Tawdry sexual humor pervades the entire film; any parent expecting a tame Marvel movie-style PG-13 will be horrified at how sleazy it can get. (Bay's leery camera never met a pair of female buttocks it didn't want to ogle). How can anyone take this seriously as an epic when so much is just relentlessly trashy?The actors don't fare that well, and neither does Megan Fox, who mostly hangs around looking stupid but fulfilling her purpose as a hot chick. Shia LaBeouf probably comes off the best, doing his usual neurotic stuff which can at least be entertaining. Bay tries to do the same thing for John Turturro that he did for Nic Cage in 'The Rock' (turn accomplished character actor into quirky action star) but it's just grating here. Voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving are mostly reduced to voice-box quotes.It's frustrating, since unlike the brain-numbing superhero movies of today, there are some scenes and sequences where you realize the potential of the material, only for it to never materialize. The only really good thing about the film is Steve Jablonsky's fantastic soundtrack, which gives a further hint of what might have been.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well Well...They gave it to the right director. and Paramount did the rest..Everything was damn near perfect!!So success(IE. money!!) breeds sequels..If my expectations were low going into tans 1..They were off the charts for Reveng of the Fallen..The trailers looked awesome..The main cast and Mr.Bay was returning..Everything was in place..Then the movie started,or should i say the action started..Now i am not the one to quibble about the plot doesn't make any sense or the acting is this and that in this type of movie.Its about fighting robots for crying out loud..and i did grade this flick at 7 stars..No spoilers here..as if you haven't already seen the movie..but i will just list a few observations..(1) For shear spectacle alone see this movie in the theatre!!(2)The ""twins"" that have caused the controversy.They didn't bother me that much..they were more annoying than anything..Jar Jar was much worse!!(3)Two movies in.. i still don't know anything about Tyrese,and Duhamels' characters..give me just a little more with them (4)I didn't know who was who at times..A little clarity at times would been helpful.(but)(5)I knew exactly what i was getting with a Bay sequel..If you have seen Bad Boys 2!!..With more money means more mayhem..SO give him a movie with 200 million dollar budget and prepare yourself!(6)Its almost TOO much movie..and i don't think i have ever said that in my life..(7)Shia,and Tuturro were good(8)Fox was OK..she is still a little green (9) Is it me or did Ramon Rodriguez(College roommate)have a bigger role in this flick than what was intended??? (10) Starscream..LOve that character!! To wrap this up..back to my title. I borrowed it from the WrestleMainia series. A couple of days later i was talking with the buddy i went to see it with and we wondered out aloud in Transformers 3 they should skip the plot altogether and just have AutoBots vs Decepticons in one big cage 2 HR cage match movie.. *And if they did that..I still be in the audience.. just like when i was watching Hogan vs Andre the Giant as a kid in the 80's..","17 out of 31 found this helpful.

The tension of fearing the death of a character during an action sequence isn't there. The emotion that Mikaela try's to show for Sam isn't believable.Now the biggest complaint.

I had Hot Rod with attachment and almost had the complete Devastator tank before I outgrew the toys. In short, I loved these guys, and the movie was a nice revisit to nostalgia.The first movie had a decent story line, the transformations were moderate and the acting was at times semi corny (I don't blame the actors for that... *looks at Michael Bay*). But it was still entertaining, because you hadn't seen it before, it was a big thing seeing your old hero kick ass as you previously only could imagine it would look like in ""real life"".Now, in what way does Transformers 2 differ? Not in a single way, except a weaker story line. There are no improvements, no proper introductions of the new robots, which simply just appear and starts whipping out dialogs, or more often monologues, that are supposed to be funny, but falls to the ground after the first two.Do you remember back when Optimus would transform into the truck in the cartoons and you'd go ""where the f*** did his trailer come from??"", in this case you'll still be sitting ""what the f*** is going on?"" because Michael bay still does ultra close-ups, uses objects or terrain to cover the transformation, or there is so much going on that you won't see it. In other words, he still skips nice and easy over this part which is probably the coolest thing about both movies. To be honest, that was the biggest thing I was looking forward to in no. 1.There is an upside for you fan-boys though: you'll see an excruciating amount of explosions big and small... just like Bay seems to like it. I guess he has an idea that that compensates bad directing.For my part it was 2½ hours of pain... my girlfriend, who also like the first movie, walked out after 1½ hours. I only stayed to naively get value for money. As soon as the texts started rolling I was out of there, I didn't bother staying for any post-images that would only toss more shameful humor at me....Oh... if you're thinking that a digital presentation and THX sound is going to make this an experience, just like I did... you're wrong. Go to see this movie in the theater just to say you saw it, not because you want to watch a good movie.When the next transformers comes out, I will read every critique about it, read every spoiler, then buy the DVD and then give it to a charity shop.","32 out of 71 found this helpful.

The tinnitus was caused by less than 3 minutes' exposure to the trailer for the Transformers sequel. At least it was fair warning. I made it a point to see the actual film in a regular theater and avoided Imax's 12,000 watts of sound. As a result, I am not totally deaf, tho not for Michael Bay's lack of trying.No shot in the film runs as long as 5 seconds, and the camera never stops moving. You think I'm exaggerating, don't you?There are some giant robots who want to destroy the Sun and other giant robots who want to protect the Earth. Except for one old-fart giant robot who just wants everyone to get off his lawn, it's close to impossible to tell them apart. They spend a lot of time duking it out with giant whirly hunks of metal and lots of flashing, smashing, and of course transforming. Everything goes by in a blur, which I have to presume was intentional. Little humans run in and out of the carnage, and I guess we're supposed to care.Based on product-placement fees and quantity of gratuitously destroyed vehicles, I strongly suspect I've figured out why General Motors went bankrupt.Every now and again the movie slows down just a tad and people stop shouting over the din enuf that you can actually understand what they're saying, and they get off a couple of clever lines, enuf to save this calamity from my lowest possible rating.Dramamine and earplugs. You have been warned.","42 out of 98 found this helpful.

Any real fan of the original Transformers was waiting to see this on a big screen - a full scale war between the large robots that hasn't been really delivered in the first movie.There are so many new Transformers around this time, they fight and destroy each other in unbelievably detailed battles from the beginning till the end of the movie. If you really like the franchise, this is the one film to watch: it's as if the Michael Bay and producers have heard the fans and did everything to make the movie for them. Can't wait to see the next Transformers movie.","43 out of 65 found this helpful.

I am a fan of Transformers since school days. they don't know anything about this movie. All I have to say is the 2nd franchise is filled with more action, a good plot, new characters & Shia Lebouf/Megan Fox/Tyresse Gibson makes the movie happen as usual. I am happy to say that Megan Fox plays a good roll and acting than the 1st Transformers movie. Well I don't know what all others who watched this movie is thinking. To tell the truth if someone makes a better movie with a good plot, they know how to insult the people who made it. Again for a bad movie it is all good for them. I think all this European, American's are nut heads. They don't know how to respect people and their hard work. It is a habit of humans that they do not appreciate great work of a intelligent human being. Finally all I have to say is ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is a top class movie with state of the art special effects with a good story. Hope everyone understands that!","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

Seriously I wouldn't mind the ridiculous plot, silly dialog, childish characters, etc if it wasn't mixed in with extreme violence, sexual innuendo, and all the other inappropriate for kid stuff thrown into the mix. Who is this movie made for? If it is for kids then Bay needs to be checked. No parent with a brain would let their kid sit through this. If it is for adults then holy cow they didn't offer up anything. As far as I can figure the writers and Bay put this together for males 18-25 who sit around in their basement in underwear playing with action figures. If that is the case then mission accomplished. It really is a giant piece of rubbish. My whole problem with this is man it could be amazing. Either for kids or adults. Just pick a direction and stay focused on it. You don't have to be perfect although shooting for that would be nice. But if you want to make an amazing Transformers then pick an audience and give that audience the best movie because what you are doing now is turning every crowd off. My kid loves Transformers toys (I never did as a kid) which is why we got excited about the first movie. But he found it boring except for parts and as an adult I found it even more so. I had hoped for more from this one but seriously my kid wanted to leave part way through and go home to watch Clone Wars cartoons instead. Sad.","18 out of 37 found this helpful.

The robots in the sequel are more humanize, more active, more naughty. Personally I dun like it. In the first movie, they were much more cool and charming. Anyway, Michael Bay,who usually do not care about character development and plot details, make another success attempt to give us an exciting Summer Blockbuster action movie. Explosion, robots, special effects, MeganFox, Shia LaBeouf and Josh Duhamel.... What else can you ask for??? Are you not entertained?

I don't know much of the original Transformers series, but what else can you expect than explosions, crashes, AWESOME animations, awe-inspiring fight scenes... I could go on and on.I think what did a lot for me was that I was able to enjoy this movie, as well as the first one, which BLASTED me and SO made me long for this one, on an HD computer screen with a decent sound system. It just blasts you! Again and again, one scene after another. The detail of all the transformers is amazing. The camera movements are amazing. Every scene with a Transformer in it could be watched again and again in 1080p and you would notice another awesome detail on them EVERY time you watch them. I'm not kidding. And it's not just the ""typical"" Transformers from the first one, no, there are actually some extremely out-of-the-ordinary ones that I think most fans will love. I certainly did!!Anyone expecting a deep story or deep characters will be disappointed a little, especially character-wise. But if you're just a fan of AWESOME animations and special effects, or generally love great CGI stuff, this is the movie for you. The point for me also was that the attempt of the background story actually wasn't that bad. I am used to some rather 'flat' stories from video games, and if you can accept that, it's OK. The background-story about Transformers-related stuff is truly epic, just not THAT well-elaborated.The humor is truly bad at some points, this is why I can't give this movie a 10/10 score. I would love to, but that would be dishonest. There are some jokes in the first 30 minutes of the movie that made me wanna puke. But after that, Bay unleashes a roller-coaster ride of action and awesomeness - this is actually much like in the first movie.The thing about the two movies is that you feel like you're 12 years old again. All this crashing and exploding and fighting and transforming that is going on just amazes me to a deep and satisfying degree. The WOW-effect of the first scene of the first movie was just AMAZING, and this second movie just tops it again and again and again. I also love movies with deep stories, but this is none of them.Accept that, await awesome CGI effects, and if you want to feel like you're 12 again - go watch this movie, with the best sound equipment and picture resolution you can get your hands on. It truly is awesome.EDIT:I must add something, now 5 months later. I corrected my rating from 9 to 7. The problem is that the lack of any story or depth keeps me from watching it again after I have seen every animation a satisfying number of times. The movie remains perfect for kids, and it remains perfect for fans of spectacular CGI art, but after a few times you have seen it.The lack of depth is a problem that's lasting, but the initial WOW-effect from the animations were oh so worth it.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

I had been looking forward to seeing it for months. Well, this is a car crash of a movie sequel, i mean even though i enjoyed the first one very much, i was still disappointed how different Optimus Prime, Megatron, Jazz, Bumblebee and Starscream all looked in the final movie compared to their appearances in the Genration 1 comic books. But my disappointment got bigger and bigger until i left the cinema consumed with a hatred for the makers of this vile garbage that i could barely contain.To begin with, it starts with another gigantic, confusing battle in China (i think) there was so much happening in these scenes that it confounded my mind into a bloody headache. Optimus Prime and the autobots have teamed up with the platoon of soldiers from the first movie to go hunting down Decepticons around the Earth, so far so ho hum. The problem with this scene is that i couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon because of the way the Transformers motion around on the big screen during the action scenes, this was a problem i had with the original as well.The narrative and the storyline were all over the place. I couldn't help thinking that the cast were hurrying through their scenes as if they were desperate to be somewhere else. Shia la Beouf is one of the worst actors ever to become a film star. Hes like a human version of Jar Jar Binks from Phantom Menace, honestly i wanted him to die horribly.Megan Fox kept me going though, but lets face it, she knows why shes in this film and its not because we all think she has the same range as Jodie Foster and Meryl Streep combined, its because shes fantastic looking straddled out over a Harley Davidson thats why. Thank God for that scene alone.The 'comedy' scenes stamped any potential this sequel had into the ground. What did the screenwriters think was so funny about Shia's mother running around his Campus high on Drugs? The dogs having sex on the couch didn't help either. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.I honestly thought this would be a great follow up to the first movie the way Superman 2 or even Terminator 2 was to their originals, but boy i was wrong...absolutely terrible.Cal.","24 out of 52 found this helpful.

It was good, but not what it could have been. Let's start with the negatives: - Devastator/Constructicons have NO introduction. They just kind of appeared. - Too many unidentified robots. - WAY TOO LONG! The first was even a tad too long for a Transformers movie, so this one is just ridiculous. - Skidz and Mudflap are the two most annoying characters I have seen in a film in a long time. - Much of the CGI was actually worse this time around. The textures were spot-on and it mostly looked life-like, but the transformers seemed to move at a lower frame rate than the rest of the movie, making them looked stuttery. - The whole film ended with a bit of an anti-climax. - Megatron OR Optimus Prime should not have been resurrected. - Please zoom out, Michael Bay! At times, it is hard to see what is going on!But it is not ALL bad. The good points are: - The fight scenes are brilliant. It raises the bar yet again for CGI, but it needs to be tightened a bit. - Retains the humour from the first one. - The sound. The sound in this film is incredible. Much better than the first film, especially during the pyramid battle as well as the Paramount/Dreamworks bit at the start. - Scorponok has a really incredible entrance. You almost forget about him until he appears.So there are more bad points than good, but that is just me. The first film, for me, was a 9 out of 10. The only bad point was the 2hr10minute MINIMUM running time. This is 147 minutes, so it gets a little silly in terms of running time. Still, I hope you enjoy it.","38 out of 82 found this helpful.

Including the usage of more Autobots and Decepticons than the first one had to offer. As well as a continuing story from what was left off in the previous installment.In the sequel, the Autobots have form alliance with the U.S. military in tracking down the remaining Decepticons that are wandering around parts of the world. While Sam is trying to keep his involvement with Optimus to a minimum by attending college, however after encountering a piece of the all spark from the first movie. A great deal of information had raced through his own head, and Sam ends up writing symbols of a code to something that the Decepticons are interested in getting hold of. Sam who tries his hardest to live a normal college life finds himself involve with the Autobots saving the planet yet again.This sequel was slightly better than the first one, but it didn't get where it was suppose to in surpassing the original. One would think that Michael Bay and the rest of the film team would be able to know what the old and new fans of the franchise want to see in a Transformers movie. The only pet peeve about this movie was the scenes that weren't necessary for the story itself, most the ones that involved the humans. While there's so much they could of added for this movie. Maybe giving some more screen time for most of the Transformers or more scenes involving Decepticon hunting.The only reason why I gave this movie an 8/10 was cause of the usage of more transformers than the other one and the transformer battles which saved the movie from being bad. I would give it a 9/10 if they took out the unneeded parts of the movie and more screen time on the Transformer's side of the movie.There's always a chance for the third installment to be better than this one. But let's hope they'll learn their pet peeves and know what to include for the next sequel. My suggestion is include a battle royal of at least a hundred Autobots and Decepticons fight against one another, that's what I'd like to see for a third installment, cause what would be more entertaining than watching all of your favorite transformers having their own role in the field of battle.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

The Autobots have united with the US Military hunting down Decepticons, when they learn of an ancient Decepticon that is coming to destroy the human race.Its not that I think the story should be completely void of a human story line, but I just don't care whether or not Sam, the main character, can keep his girlfriend while he goes to college especially when there's fighting robots in the same movie. The film comes in at a hefty 150 minutes run time, which I think even tests a die hard fans concentration levels, it definitely needs some trimming down in certain places.There was far too many rubbish jokes in there as well, although a couple of them made me laugh, the mother getting off her face with hash cakes and running loose on a college campus and John Turturro making a robot-scrotum reference were highlights for me, also the promise of Matthew Marsden coming on screen with his cringe-worthy acting is always entertaining but for the wrong reasons.You have to take it at face value though, its entertaining however you look at it.For more of my reviews please go to http://alansmitheejrmovieblog.blogspot.com/","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

In the original movie the transformers were treated like punching bags and punchlines. No real interaction with the story or other characters at all. This movie, in that respect, is slightly better, but while, in a few scenes, where the transformers are treated like actual characters, this movie also does some really dumb things.The most glaring example of this added stupidity are the 4chan brothers; twin Autobots that do nothing but talk smack throughout the entire movie. The one scene where they aren't talking smack is so ridiculous, that its not even worth mentioning.A couple of less impressive moments include a paper-thin Decepticon that somehow manages to hold onto and hide a large chunk of the cube from the first movie, a female Decepticon that transforms into a human female with a three foot prehensile tongue (the tip of which remains as a tongue even when she is in robot form, because the audience is not expected to know what the long appendage reaching from her mouth is referring to), and a tiny Decepticon whose most treacherous act is to hump Megan Fox's leg for far too long. Bumblebee's stupidity was seen in the trailer so it should come as no surprise when he starts bawling like a 3 year old that doesn't get its way.Also the plot includes finding this key which five Autobot ""Primes"" died to protect by merely burying it in a pile of rocks and turning their bodies into the shrine which housed it. This ""sacrifice"" makes absolutely no sense except that Michael Bay needed, for the sake of the final fight, all the other Primes to die so that only Optimus Prime would be left to kill off the Fallen, which only a Prime can kill - its never explained why nothing else can kill this robot. Maybe its like the 4th directive from Robocop, I don't know. This is not a movie you can put a lot of thought into.There are a couple of good things in this film. Soundwave makes regular appearances as a communications satellite and is never found out during the length of the film - which is surprisingly good writing. Also, Shia Lebouf is far less irritating in this film than he was in the first one, which is a major plus.All in all, not bad. I was honestly expecting it to be much worse.","17 out of 35 found this helpful.

The action was intense and it literally kept me on the edge of my seat with my jaw grating the floor! The CGI effects are incredible and really blend in well with the live action elements, very seamless.The story line is OK, far from spectacular. A lot of people are complaining about how believable it is, but the movie is about a race of alien robots who disguise themselves as vehicles! Come on!!! It has some very funny moments, the twins Skids + Mudflaps for example, along with the Witwicky parents add that comical element to the movie. Shia & Megan do a good job with some solid performance's and they really pull off a convincing relationship in the movie.The main problem with this film is that it is very long and I think they could have at cut out at least 30 minutes from this movie. A few of the scenes do not add anything to the film and left me thinking 'wtf was that about? Also, it is easy to lose track of all the autobots/decepticons, especially nearer the end when a load of them appear from nowhere! All in all, a spectacular action movie with incredible CGI. Good Stuff. 9/10","26 out of 55 found this helpful.

I really liked the first movie so there was no way I could believe that THIS franchise could possibly be bad (although I did see that later on, I didn't see it here). In my review of the first movie I said how I got interested in the Transformers franchise after watching it, since I didn't know this was actually a toys company and not an anime series. If that movie was just the introduction, this was where the real action takes place.I saw Revenge of the Fallen on Amazon Prime soon after the first one. I only had one week left before my Prime subscription would expire, so I had only decided to dedicate this time to watching all the Transformers movies so that I could understand what this franchise is all about. Unlike the future movie this one actually expanded on what was established at the first movie. Although the human characters were not as interesting as the previous movie and the story was also pretty much empty, the action scenes completely made up for it.As usual the CGI and action was very good. The new characters introduced were fun to watch. I really like to see it when new characters are brought in and given their own character development as they transform into cool cars. However not everything about this movie was good. Like I said above the human characters were not as interesting. The entire blood about Sam going to college and his parents continuously pestering him was very annoying. This was the last time we got to see Mikaela, which is also something very sad IYKWIM.This movie was able to explain very well the entire concept of Transformers, something that the prequel fail to do so. Before I used to think that Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be cars, but now I know that they are actually robots which can turn themselves into whatever they see in front of them. I would definitely give a rewatch afterwards sometime in the future whenever I have to show this franchise to a new generation.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I would gladly go back in time and see it on DVD later because then I would've had an option of stopping this torture of bad script and jokes which was just painful to watch (even Turturro seemed boring on screen after watching T2 for about hour and a half, probably a first for him) . The design of Autobots is still pretty amazing tho, and thats about the only good thing there was about it. The plot seemed very ordinary for the much awaited sequel, and instead of a couple big, charged battles there seemed to be about ten of them which took the wind out of the last time.

It was the best fight scene yet between the Autobots and the Decepticons.The Fallen, the ultimate villain in this movie, is also a prime like Optimus. He was made out to be much more evil than that of Megatron. But yet, there was not that much of him in the movie up until the very end of the movie. All that hype was for really nothing. It was the same mistake made in the first movie with Megatron's character.Despite the length of the movie and the short lived screen life of The Fallen, the movie was not bad.

There are some parents who say this movie was bad for kids or whatever, bad it did have a pg-13 rating that says ""intense sequences of sci-fi action violence, language, some crude and sexual material, and brief drug material."" So no one should complain about the ""bad words"" or ""sex"" or whatever that was in the movie. Other than all the complainers saying this movie didn't have a plot or whatever, should know that the first movie was made the same way, not really a big plot just action and graphics.

It is an utter, and complete mess, an abominable and failed film-making exercise in all CGI and no character advancement.It is a cocktail of explosions and over-use of CGI, and eon-old Hollywood clichés stolen from a collection of classics. Michael Bay has obviously forgotten his adequate storytelling since ""The Island"" and is now treading where horrible sequels tread... the land of all style, no substance.Aside from plot holes, loop holes, and gaping crater holes spread throughout the film it is terribly edited. There are time-lapses, and untimely scene cuts, and inexplicable displacement of characters and robots all the time. It is as if Michael Bay decided to edit it on his own (which he has), and gave up when he realized what a churning, improvisational mess he had shot on set.The acting is competent from all leads, aside from the mediocrity of Megan Fox, which has to be singled out. She is nothing more in this film than a vessel for cleavage, a tanned face with blue eyes. I don't know which one is sadder; Michael Bay's objectification of this girl, or her acceptance of it. Her romantic scenes with Shia LeBeouf feels like torture, force-fed and with less authenticity than the most tear jerking sequence in ""Pearl Harbor"".Of course it all comes down to the material, since the script is an utter insult to those tireless people who toil and write everyday in the film industry. It is truly a marvelous piece of juvenile humor, chaotic action scenes and Michael Bay's genital fixation and toilet humor with robots.All the characters are tanned from the 80s, all the girls are hot, all the men are wise cracking clowns and all the robots have stereotypical accents of either black or English men.If you do one thing right in your life, do not see this film.

The story has to broaden. The conflict has to be ramped up more than before. I don't think anybody would argue that ""RotF"" fails in this field; the action is easily more impressive than the first film. From the incredibly massive chase scene in Shanghai to the epic finale in Egypt, the film takes us on an epic journey all over the world, blowing more s**t up, and causing unprecedented amounts of mass carnage! Entire highways are reduced to rubble, an aircraft carrier is ripped in half, the ancient pyramids are desecrated; these are incredible scenes that may never be topped (well, except for the next ""Transformers"" film).This film has been panned by audiences and critics for a number of reasons though. In their efforts to make things bigger, fill up the film with shedloads of new ideas, and take the story to multiple locales, the filmmakers may have indeed neglected to make the story congeal and flow as properly as it should. Some folks claim that the film has no story, but that's pure exaggeration; the story's quite clear-cut to me, just too much all over the place. If they toned the story down and maintained a steadier focus, the story would have probably would have won more hearts. Not to mention the myriad of lesser nitpicks; one too many crude jokes, perceived plot holes and inconsistencies, questionable mythology, the twins, etc.Personally, the issues regarding the story, humor, plot, characters, and everything else has never bothered me. If it wasn't for the Internet, I might have never known this movie sucks! Suffice to say, none of this has ever hampered my enjoyment of the film, and it hasn't affected my opinion of the plot. In my opinion, the plot works in its own inherent way. Just as a sequel should, it showcases the villains having their glory, while continuing the main character's development. The film is admittedly overblown in a lot of ways, but I love it anyway.Like before, the film has gorgeous picturesque photography and some very fast and hectic editing. Editing can be a little screwy, as certain shots are repeated or recycled from the first film. Altogether though, I think the action is better-framed and it's much easier to see the robots than from the first film. Acting is about as strong or as weak as before; Shia LaBeouf is still semi-lovable and semi-annoying. I think Megan Fox puts on a stronger performance here (or perhaps is more likable, or else has more material to work with; either way, her presence is stronger). John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Peter Cullen, and Hugo Weaving all return and are decent. Production value is still insanely high, with no expense spared on sets, props, costumes, special effects, or all the genuine military hardware and personnel on display. Aside from one or two iffy rock songs, the music is quite smashing.Given all the hate this films receives, I can only recommend it as a rental.4/5 (entertainment: 5/5, story: 3.5/5, film: 4/5)","13 out of 17 found this helpful.

As a stand-alone film, it's noisy, vapid and bloated. As a sequel to the first film — which was, as you might recall, a surprisingly entertaining popcorn flick — it's disappointing and borderline offensive. It's the sort of sequel that was all too common in the 1980s — a continuation of a story without a story; about as necessary as Weekend at Bernie's II or whatever other marginally tolerable cash-in you can think of. The movie was clearly built from its predecessor's success, with little consideration given to the dynamics of what's actually occurring on-screen. For some people, this may seem a minor complaint — after all, as its stars willingly admitted in junket interviews, people don't go to see films about giant fighting robots for the story lines — but at nearly two-and-a-half hours, you're likely to find your patience put to its test, especially when you can't even wrap your head around what's happening half the time.The actors are all given thankless tasks to perform. Shia LaBeouf is one of the most likable and convincing actors of his kind — perhaps not the sort of deeply committed artist you'd rank as a great actor, but amiable and charming enough to carry blockbusters. His performance in the first Transformers helped add human conflict to an otherwise robotic (pun intended) string of action sequences. Here, he's given quite little to do. Why's he even in the story at all? It's never fully explained, beyond the obvious (um, he has to be, because you don't fix what ain't broke, right?). The plot: He finds a piece of shrapnel left behind from the first film and has a bunch of alien data magically ingrained into his brain on the day he leaves for Princeton University; suddenly the Decepticons are after him, to extract the information that will apparently lead them to the location (in an Egyptian desert) of a device that can, like, blow up the sun or something.None of it really makes sense. Most of the characters from the first film return (bar Jon Voight), and the roles seem pointless. Megan Fox, god bless her, tries to do more than just pout for the camera, but she appears and disappears at the will of the screenplay, which disregards her altogether for half the movie. She is, of course, a bad actress; but she openly acknowledges this, which makes me respect her far more than I otherwise would. I want to see her do well based solely on the fact that she's not the typical politically correct, wholesome Hollywood starlet. Brutally honest, self-deprecating beauties don't come around very often. To witness her fighting against the underdeveloped typecasting of her character is a struggle. To watch her openly describe Michael Bay as a ""tyrant"" to his face during a press conference is delightful; I'd more gladly pay for 2 1/2 hours of that.Most action films have one form of comedic relief; Transformers 2 has four. John Turturro returns to his role as an obsessive and wacky CIA agent (he provides the most laughs, which are hardly plentiful), but there's also three regrettable new sidekicks: a pair of unintentionally racist gangsta Transformers (perhaps the most offensive animated ethnic stereotypes since Jar-Jar Binks), and a perpetually whiny college kid played by newcomer Ramon Rodriguez, who has promised us that his role in Transformers 3 will be greatly expanded. No, thanks.Then, at least, there's director Michael Bay. What on earth inspired him to create such a laborious, boring film? Perhaps the same level of vanity that propelled him to feature close-ups of a poster for Bad Boys II here? Another filmmaker — Steven Spielberg, for example — might be able to get away with this sort of apparent self-love on the belief that he's being tongue-in-cheek. We never quite get that feeling with Bay. When he shows us the Bad Boys poster, it's self-idolatry — not self-deprecation or even just self-reference. And it's that ego of his, I'd imagine, that caused him to make his worst film since Pearl Harbor — and that one's really only worse because of its blatant disregard for the historical aspects. If Transformers: RotF were based on a true series of events, I'd be inclined to say this is even worse, because it felt even longer than Pearl Harbor, which is no easy feat.The saddest part about this whole mess is that you realize countless hours were invested in its technical craft. The special effects are superb; animators gave healthy portions of their lives to making this thing look good, and then when you see it up on screen, it's all so barely decipherable; between the shaky camera, split-second cuts and constant panning, the intertwining robots are virtually impossible to get a handle on. Who's beating whom? I couldn't even tell half the time. The last 45 minutes of the movie are so painful, dull and monotonous that I just kept checking my wristwatch in anguish, trying to calculate when the film had actually started and how long the previews had lasted. I saw The Dark Knight a year ago — a film of comparable length — and don't recall glancing away from the screen a single time, much less to check the time. The era of superior action thrillers has only rendered Michael Bay's inadequacies all the more obvious; it's clearer now than ever before that this guy really doesn't have a clue what he's doing. There are elements of his style that I admire, and certainly no one can claim he isn't distinct — the problem is that he's currently distinctly awful, and cutting his running times down by about an hour and learning how to handle his actors (I haven't yet mentioned his complete misuse of Rainn Wilson) might be a step in the right direction.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

The first version did not contain so much use of harsh (adult) language. Within the first five minutes or so, the autobots were using such language as ""hell"", ""G--Dam--"", ""bit--""; totally unnecessary for the type of family movie this was supposed to be. I can hear the writers justifying the use of the harsh language to suggest it was more realistic; I disagree. Parents please be mindful of this if you plan on allowing your children under the age of 14 to see this movie. Other than then that, I really liked the movie.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

The stuff most critic complained about was true and if Bay had humbled himself he would have gotten rave review from everyone including the critics. If he had even listen to half of what was said about the film, this movie would have probably won awards during the Oscar seasons. But no, bay is all ego and he made is ego ruin a great franchise...The first movie was all eye candy. from the girls, to the cars, etc. but this movie was just long and boring. The movies started out decent but for some odd reason that i cannot put my fingers on, i didn't enjoy the film....I was bored to the point I fell asleep within the first hour, because nothing interesting really happened in the movie...don't get me wrong, there was action happening all the time, but there was no built or character development at all...while watching the movie i saw new transformers die on both side, and i kept thinking to myself, ""how come they didn't introduce us to any of these characters"".Are you going to enjoy this movie? more than likely you won't, especially if you love the first and want the second one to be better.","19 out of 41 found this helpful.

This movie seems like ALL they did was focus on the Special Effects and nothing else. I like movies with a story and depending on genre, a deep and thought out one. In this case, this movie was much like Terminator: Salvation. Only in T:S, there was good acting.The machines are smart right? Wrong. They have the worst dialogue I have ever heard. Well, not actually. They had terrible dialogue. Shia LaBeouf was more interesting then the machines, and that (in my opinion), is saying something. He isn't the best lead.I have to hand it to Michael Bay, the effects were very nice, but he wasted a ton of money. He just seemed to focus on the effects. This movie was missing everything needed to be a movie. A shame. Michael, stop blowing things up, make a story first, then blowing things up will be much more rewarding.2/10","15 out of 31 found this helpful.

Well they do this OK. Its not what I expected. I did enjoy this movie. It was very fast paced, with extremely well done special effects. Sometimes the story got a little out there, which unfortunately you do think about it watching the movie. Most times you would like to think back after you've seen the movie to review the story, well that doesn't happen so don't be surprised if you start to review the movie before its over. The characters are mostly just there. The only person you really care about is Sam because well he is the only real character in the movie. Megan Fox seemed way way too fake in this movie. Just watching her makes you think she is a total b*tch in real life. She was only eye candy in this movie. Again the special effects are top notch in this movie. They were about the same professional wise as terminator salvation's were. It did seem sloppy at times and it was hard to tell who was fighting who and who really to root for. That didn't distract me too much. The only two things that bothered me the most about this movie is its split audience attraction. With the 2 gangster robots and there dialog and childish behavior you would guess this movie would be PG. Then all the sudden the robots would start cussing and swearing and talking ghetto. The movie would start to look dark and evil and move to its PG-13 rating. It didn't stay consistent all the way through. The second thing that bothered me was the cliché's of right place right time in every instance in this movie. There would just happen to be the ""right"" missile on a ship that just would happen to be close to where the action was. They would all be prepared to handle this unexpected and unlikely event. You knew Optimus was going to live again to see the final climactic battle yet the battle was short and pretty pathetic and expected. Now I did like this movie and sequels are hard to be as incredible as the first movies. Its rare to see newer movies these days that can be moving and worthy as some of our past classics that are available to us. I would say that many people are going to hate this movie and many people are going to love it. Me... I like it, nothing incredible nothing horrible, just there for me. I thought between to two summer blockbusters Terminator Salvation was much better but thats just me. I give it a 7 out of 10 because for what it is... it does its job I guess.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

I didn't like the first one, but I gave this a chance. Last time they were testing the CGI, the characters, the budget.

Mostly the same fast talking-smart mouthed kid that he always will be.Two: Devastator is not a tank.The latter irked me the most, and I was excited upon hearing that Bay said the real Devastator would be in the sequel.After a year of anticipation, I go to see it.This movie is filled with sexual humor that got old after the first hour. Shia plays the exact same character, as if it was difficult for him. Lastly, Bay ruined Devastator for the second time.I was in an okay mood with the movie because the special effects were unbelievable, Megan Fox was gorgeous as always, and I do enjoy seeing Optimus on screen.

There were too many unfunny comic reliefs, the sidekicks were off- mark and the entire movie is TOO long.I thoroughly enjoy watching Optimus Prime and the Autobots kick ass. I thoroughly enjoy Decepticons and their numerous gizmos. But serious, some Autobots and Decepticons didn't even get names, and if it wasn't for their size difference I wouldn't have been able to tell whether the Decepticons were Transformers or Terminators. There's THAT MUCH character to the individual Transformer. Even Prime seemed uncertain and wavering in this sequel.And the comic reliefs. They may have been hilarious for soft porn lovers, but they simply didn't cut it for a movie directed at young adults trying to catch a ride back into good old Transformers and young children who would have been looking for TRANSFORMING ROBOTS.Plus Bay never fails to put in as much kickass American MILITARY PRIDE in his movies. I'm not even going to comment on this; it's the guy's right as a director to do what he will to his movies, but I honestly don't think it'll sit well with many of the audience.Oh, did I mention that the movie is too long? I went into the movie theatre expecting nothing from the story-line (I mean, I was there to watch robots blow things up and get blown up) but the glaring plot-holes carried on and on and on and on....hanging out like some serpentine tongue.

What I really liked about the first one was that it was serious, with non- forced humour. This one for me was less serious, with terribly forced humour - it's the difference between Star Wars a New Hope & the Phantom Menace. In fact the difference didn't stop there, as just as Lucas put in the awful Jar Jar Binks, Bay/Spel put in two similar silly autobots - the names of which escape me. And to be honest, on reflection, that was another issue - whilst watching the movie I had no idea which robot was which. In the fight scenes it was difficult to tell them apart, it all looked quite scrappy - unlike the first one, where each robot seemed more individual.Now to my main bug bear - and yes I know it's just a movie.... However, the pyramids, the red sea & Petra are no where near each other!!! It would take days to walk from the Pyramids to the red sea, and even longer to walk to Petra - I know, I've been to all of them!!! In addition Sam seemed at one point to be running through Karnak temple??? Luxor is even further!!! Things like this just don't make the movie seem credible & it's sad to think that kids are now going to believe all these things are in the wrong place. I certainly get the feeling that Americans (and I am very pro American btw), do feel that if it's not in the USA, then it doesn't really matter about the accents/locations - I mean for them if it's in the same continent then thats enough - however I think if someone came out with a movie that had the star running from the Empire State Building to the Sears Tower, then they'd think that was very silly and unbelievable - and they'd be right!!!Overall I did enjoy it - but no where near as much as I did the first one, and part of me senses a Batman-esquire similarity, where we started with a couple of great dark moody Gothic Batman movies, but then descended in to comic-book tripe (Batman & Robin.... yuk...!!) - before it was rescued by Christian Bales latest excellent movies.Please don't let this happen to Transformers... Make it more serious, non-forced humour - no stupid/camp autobots - and I think one slow-motion shot of Sam running is perhaps enough for one movie.....","18 out of 39 found this helpful.

The fact that a multi-million dollar budget and who- knows-how-many tonnes of explosives produced such a phenomenally uninteresting and poorly-crafted action film is beyond me. Micheal Bay, who I unashamedly call the village idiot of Hollywood, isn't able to maintain an engaging storyline (or what I would more accurately describe as a sensical arrangement of explosions) or for that matter an engaging anything. What ensues is a clumsy combination of hit and miss comedy, tediously long 'action' scenes, terribly written 'emotive' scenes and indecent use of the slow motion effect. Micheal Bay and the scriptwriters ought to be ashamed of themselves as well as the horde of idiots who have given this film a 10.

If you want simply a treat for the eyes then you have to settle for glimpses of Megan Fox because the CGI is as bad as the first film. If, like me, you are annoyed by an idiotic plot and tons of nonsensical issues, then stay away from this dud.What happened? This really is a good cast, what should have been interesting characters, but a boring story. I just didn't care what happened to them. The legend generated by the first film has properties that just were missing from the story. Not much action, not enough story. Unfortunately, this sequel joins the dreaded list of disasters.

There are people on here banging on like they are all film critics, Michael bay this, Michael bay that! Its hilarious really.Transformers Revenge of the fallen is a good action movie, plenty of action, Optimus prime actually does himself justice in this movie, not like in the first when he was quite frankly a bit of a wimp, there is plenty of humour to go along the way (which was greeted with laughter from the cinema crowd, always a sign people are appreciating the humour involved) and overall I didn't feel it felt like 2 and a half hours (suprising considering the speakers in the cinema weren't working completely so we lost some of the surround sound effects!!) And and Megan Fox is just Hot, and who doesn't want to look at that!! Overall. I don't think this movie is a 9, but I rated it as such because of some of the pathetic reviews on here. Its more a 7.8 which is still a good movie. If you want action and light humour, go see it, you'll enjoy it, and ignore some of the would be film critics on here. And remember, its a 12a.......... :)","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

When I heard of the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, I was ready for an even better sequel. I heard it wasn't all that good via RottenTomatoes(19% rating currently), but I brushed that off. I even bought an IMAX ticket(this was my first non-zoo IMAX visit). What I got was 2 and a half hours of time lost and $13.50 as well. The critics were, right: this was one BIG disappointment.It follows Sam(Shia LaBeouf), who is now in a big relationship with Mikaela(Megan Fox), going to college while the Autobots, including good old' Optimus Prime(voice of Peter Cullen), have sided with human soldiers to take down all of the Decepticons on Earth. After touching a piece of the AllSpark, Sam's mind is filled with symbols and this information causes Sam to become a target of the Decepticons. Apparently the Fallen, a prime who really hates Earth. It's a basically another clash between good bots and bad bots. Oh yeah, and Megatron(voice of Hugo Weaving) has been revived and he's looking for a little revenge.For the positives. The film has great effects. It also has plenty more bots than the first film. And pretty much you have almost all of the major original characters(John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhammel and even Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents) from the first film, except for Jon Voight(good move on his part).On the negatives, it's mostly same old Bay, with a weak plot and lackluster performances. One of the film's new humans, Sam's college roommate and later companion Leo Spitz(Ramon Rodriguez), is utterly annoying. And that's just an example. Unfortunately, I didn't care much for the effects after the first 20 minutes, as the excessive running time really annoyed me(I checked my watch like 20 times). The film has plenty of moments that didn't need to be put in, and I even think some of the fight sequences were unnecessary. If I had my way, I'd shave out the useless bits, which would reduce the running time to 100-105 minutes. And what's with you, Michael? It's like he said, ""Okay, we need to focus mostly on our effects. Forget acting and story, get those effects guys on the hook now!!!!!!"" I thought the first film was his chance for a great comeback, but this just destroyed it. In fact, aside from Transformers, Bay hasn't done a decently good film since 1998's Armageddon. If they do a Transformers 3, hopefully they'll look on this film as what they should NOT do.Overall, I give Revenge of the Fallen a 4 out of 10. What a shame. And it's still going to make oodles of cash($672 million worldwide and counting).","18 out of 40 found this helpful.

Not a great movie. I attended a screening last night, and all I can say is this is definitely not something I should've waited 1.5 hours in line for. Almost 800 people attended, and were very disappointed when not let in. They didn't miss anything but a piece of work pretty much only showcasing nothing but great special effects, and other stuff that you see in every regular movie.This movie includes jokes that were not too funny, lazy writing, above average direction, pretty good acting, and a dragged-out story. It seems as if the people making this thought adding special effects would cover up for their other weak areas. They were wrong.As for the characters/actors...I am SO glad Mikaela did more than stand around in this movie. She actually HELPED Sam. That is one improvement from the first movie. Shia Labeouf did a great job of making Sam much more mature and less naive than he was in the first movie.Overall, not too impressed. Way below my expectations. You disappointed me, 'Transformers'. Wished it was more juicy.Overall rating: 6.04/10","16 out of 37 found this helpful.

A complete lack of understanding of military tactics and hardware. Bad acting, sure. But with such a bad script and directing, it is hard to tell.

The transformations still seem to keep the audiences hooked up to the screen.Though it is basically an action, fiction cum special effects movie, it still clings to a good enough if not an awesome story. The climax is a little overplayed with typical romance creeping in.The end leaves path for another sequel. It's not like dooms day and has left of loose ends to build upon.The characters have been played well. Romance might not have been entirely necessary in the movie but it does not hurt.

I don't know why but the absolutely horrendous writing was so funny to me that it actually became fun to watch and it was hard to be bored. The huge exposition dumps were just so hilariously dumb to me and the way they just skip around and literally invent teleportation with no explanation is just hilarious. Michael Bay's humor runs completely wild in this movie and it is so so so bad that it just becomes hilarious.

This was the general concensus when talking to people after the movie. The start of the movie seemed to show the same elements from the first one such as the comedy within the family which was good however as the film goes on the comedy can almost be described as slap stick. In fact it is the very over used comedy but stopped me from actually being bored by the action ironically.The movie is very long and the explosions were amazing but at one point I wanted them just to sit down and start talking. I felt that the movie became more of an indiana jones movie which ironically they went to the same location as the third Indiana Jones which was probably some Spielberg influence. The performances was good however, their were some awkward Shia performances which you will see when u view the movie. Megan Fox as always was looking amazing, but her character was very much under used and her role became more of a photo shoot with Micheal Bay using camera angles to highlight her beauty which is not that bad but does not make the movie that great. Again I'm trying to justify to you why I thought this blockbuster was such a disappointment.The story felt like it was made up on the spot. As if the writers were winging it and therefore made the whole film feel ridiculous. I felt the story did not have to be so complicated and would have been much better if made simpilar. The dialogue throughout the movie was very hard to hear and this was reinforced by this same statement being said by many of those at the premiere.One man said at the end of the movie that ""thank god it was CGI based movie because otherwise it would have nothing going for it."" I do hope you do see it in the cinema because I do not believe this movie should be seen any other way, but I was surprised that at points of the movie that my eyes glazed over because of how boring some scenes were. At points I could not believe some scenes were happening.Anyway this my opinion let me know what u think of the movie.Anthony","98 out of 333 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it had quite the opposite effect.I was a big fan of Transformers in the 80s and 90s. I liked the first movie, though I don't find LeBoeuf particularly watchable. I like some Bay movies (Bad Boys, The Rock, Armegeddon) and hated others (Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II).This film was long. Way too long. It's almost 2 1/2 hours that could have easily, easily, been 45-60 minutes shorter. There are so many slow-motion shots of people diving away from explosions, or screaming aloud, or just doing nothing interesting that they could have saved 20 minutes just by taking those out.Most of the characters are ridiculous, especially LeBoeuf's Sam. He has to be one of the most unlikable main characters to appear in any blockbuster in living memory. The rest of the characters are all stupid, and wait around to have things explained to them that the audience have already guessed.The fight scenes are almost genius. If you're wondering what 2 giant robots slugging it out looks like, you will get your answers here. The 'choreography' of the fights is much better than the first movie. However, and I'm sure it's been noted before me, it's hard to work out who is fight who amid the noise and blur of steel on steel. In the final battle especially, you can't work out who is an Autobot and who is a Decepticon.The romance sub-plot is pretty poor, Sam's roommate is another annoying character. John Turturro almost saves the day until he spews out some pretty bad lines.If you're going to see this in the same frame of mind that you watched Charlies Angels in, then you might enjoy it. I was going just hoping to see a match of the first movie. Sadly, it's not nearly as enjoyable.","18 out of 41 found this helpful.

The film is everything you want from a Michael Bay film:- Tension, gags, attractive women and of course lots and lots of explosions. This film takes all of the aspects that audiences loved and critics hated from the last film and amped it up 7 notches. I found the film really enjoyable with great pacing and a nice mix of humour, simple plot and lots of action. But obviously the reason people go to see this film is for two reasons 1) the explosions and incredible special effects and 2) Megan Fox both in this film are amazing... to look at ahem. I think anyone who goes in with the intention of watching a summer blockbuster will be delighted with how this turned out... Spielberg is said to have told Bay that this is the best film Bay's ever done, obviously Spielberg would say that seeing as he's involved, but I have to agree with him on this one. Enjoy, the master of Krrrraaarrr and Kablaaaaaar is definitely on form... but be warned about possible criticism about racist issues that I expect will surround the film they are quite blatant.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

If all you want to watch two robots fighting each other, you will not like this film. What you will experience instead are the following; Giant robot testicles, John Turturro's scrotum and buttocks, two dogs humping nonstop, robots humping humans, non-stop close-ups of Megan Fox's clothed private parts, a giant robot penis, endless amounts of sex jokes in general, robot heaven, robot black racist stereotypes, conspiracy theorist stereotypes, a mentally handicapped college professor compare himself to god, a woman going crazy from exposure to marijuana, two second transportation across the world over and over, a girl speed racing to Washington from LA, a guy not caring that a robot has saved his life constantly, characters getting killed and then magically being alive again, obnoxious and annoying subplots involving human characters that we couldn't possibly even begin to care about, pretentious and shameless Michael Bay advertisements for his other work, lots of falling wheels, lots of falling cars, lots of falling cogs, lots of falling bolts, lots of falling pieces of random scrap metal that breaks apart far too easily, lots of people not caring that giant robots are fighting in the middle of the city, lots of really bad dialogue, lots of confusing gray colored robots with no discernible features, endless amounts of plot holes, endless amounts of scenes of characters pointing out plot holes and then being shut up, and NO PLOT. There is nothing here. Not even the fight scenes manage to satisfy. It's all just a lot of endless noise and machinery flying all over the place for no reason! Occasionally you'll get a lackluster view of robots holding onto each other and shoving each other and that's it! I actually enjoyed the first film, mind you. It wasn't good or anything, but it was entertaining. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is just junk, plain and simple. There is, literally, nothing. There's no reason to care, no reason to watch, and no reason to waste money on it. It is just junk. That's the best way I can describe it. Junk. I'm so glad I saw this for free because if I had paid to see this I probably would never go see a Michael Bay film ever again.By the way, I've noticed that this comment has gotten reported and taken down three times now by snooty fanboys. That just goes to show you the crass mentality of some of the fans of this film.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

First off, clocking in at over 2 hours of playtime, the movie is considerably long. However, in the entire movie, they manage to shove in as many overdone scenes as they could manage to fit in, and the whole movie is apparently intended to be nothing but continual action. The story had major events happen extremely quick and were clouded out by ""everything else"" that they had in it (i.e. explosions, massive fight scenes with unnamed and forgettable characters, so on).First and foremost, I want to know the audience they were shooting for. Many of their humorous moments were extremely overdone and were questionable for why they would be put into the movie. Two dogs start humping out of nowhere...twice. The massive Decepticon is for some reason given a pair of metal ""testicals"" (wrecking balls from a construction vehicle). The mother getting high on pot brownies and proceeding to make an ass of herself for no reason. The jokes were extremely childish and way out of place, but at the same time were definitely unnecessary for any child to see. In fact, about 90% of the movies humor is through blatant sexuality, and again...most times for no good reason.Beyond that, the many overused, overdone scenes that just make you cringe keep popping up. The ""say you love me"" ""I don't want to yet"" stuff got old right off the bat. The mother being extremely clingy. My favorite has to be something I have seen so many times and it continues to make me face-palm...the ""You have to let me go, dad!"" scenes, where the kid has to save the world or whatever, and the dad doesn't want to let him, so he screams ""you have to let me go!"" until the dad breaks down and gives in. It's no longer moving or meaningful after excessive use. War of the Worlds did the same thing and it was just as bad.The plot was extremely basic but took so long to happen, and was even harder to enjoy with the gratuitous amounts of overdone and at times unnecessary action sequences. 2 minutes of plot advancement, then 20-30 minutes of fight and action scenes, rinse and repeat. Many unknowns are killed off rather easily, even the massive one near the end (not spoiling, you'll see if you haven't). At the end, you feel like the story wasn't that important, and while it could have been much better, it falls far short.The only saving grace has to be the graphics...this definitely had to be a difficult film for the animators due to the massive amount of CGI needing to be done. Still, many scenes are so quick moving that you can't really marvel at the detail put into the characters. Most of it looks messy and disorganized at times. It was large amounts of work, which looks impressive at a distance, but looking closer you pick up on how it feels like no deep detail was done on the bots, and a lot of things feel thrown together.So, all in all, surprised as hell this movie stands at a 7.5 right now, I expect that to go down significantly, but I agree with a line from a great song...""Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?"" Very disappointed, and so were many of the people that went to see the movie with me.","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

Sam was forced to return in the Transformers war.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is thesecond f ilm continuing the machinations of the problem between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Revenge of the Fallen presents a revenge story from a Fallen who is the teacher and the person behind Megatron and the Decepticon attacks on earth. I guess this gets interesting by fighting much stronger enemies. It turned out to be the same. The dashing heroic action of Optimus Prime became unexciting. This can be seen from how easy it is to solve the Optimus Prime and Fallen battle. Simple and stunning, but not fun and fun enough. Seeing the change of form from Optimus Prime like Power Rangers is funny and weird. A completion and became the end point of a sucking movie. Revenge of the Fallen has a plot that is not bad but also not entirely satisfactory. Too many stories, dramas, and conversations are widespread and long-winded. It's a pity that it's far from expectations. We are not given too much room to see how Energon works as well as the function of the existence of the Matrix itself. It can be seen in this film that many of the pieces are hidden or not shown so that it shows a half-storyline.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What else do you need to create a new film? Right! More money in the ""budget"" column, more robots and more stupidity, which, by the way, prevails over sanity here. Transformers, whose popularity has increased every day since the release of the picture in 2007, a great future awaited. Talented actors, talented director - all this was part of the original film, which thanks to these things has become successful. Foreshadowing the sequel, everyone expected that it would turn out no worse than then. But, unfortunately, the sequel syndrome, which is popular to this day, successfully manifested itself in 2009, when creating this picture.The first thing I want to note is the problem with the development of robots. Started in the first film, the ""bzik"" continued its journey in the sequel. Unsuccessful attempts to develop chemistry between Sam and Bumblebee lead to children's fairy tales, in which the essence is the same - someday mutual love must begin between the characters. Sam and Bumblebee have it, but it is shown so clumsily that the love line between Michaela and Sam looks much better, and it is practically absent in the film. So draw your own conclusions. Newcomers among the Autobots, recently arrived at the behest of Optimus Prime, the Skids and Wheelie twins should have brought more humor to the picture. With their arrival, it was possible, but it turned out to be too hackneyed. Not much is known about the twins themselves, other than that they love to ""pin"" each other at the most inopportune moment. Ironhide, famous for disliking the human race because of excessive cruelty, is still a big man with hefty guns. Bumblebee's guardian has been transformed from a warrior into a postman who rushes around at every signal from Prime or Whitwicky.The second thing that needs a major overhaul is a love and friendship line. Sam, having clearly shown himself in the battle with Megatron, won the heart of the beauty Michaela. If in the first picture Sam was thinking about how to introduce himself to a girl in order to please, and not scare away, then in the second part he shows himself as a slob who is afraid to say ""I love you"". From the stormy relationship, which amazed themselves with their actions, dramatic lyrics turned out. Megan Fox, the sex symbol of the tape, from a naive schoolgirl turns into a mature girl who really has found a brain. She shows charisma, proving to Sam that she is worth something and now her character represents a more important person than the one that was in the first part. The acting looks decent, even against the background of the drama. Sam, after graduating from school, began to study at the university. Realizing what student life is, Sam quickly finds friends. Leo is an Internet entrepreneur with his own view of the world and a business plan for the future. In general, Leo is another comical character who came to the franchise to dilute the lackluster situation. His personality is cheerful, the character is casual, and his actions are cowardly. One of the reasons why you want to watch a picture.The Decepticons are still not wanted to be the main faces of the franchise, and this is really terrible news. Follen, a member of an earlier Transformer race, wishes to rid the living worlds of the sun. Follen, whose desire prevails over realization, is no different from the previous film's version of Megatron. Weak motives backed by a desire to kill Optimus Prime - stupid, isn't it? Megatron, the powerful ruler of the Decepticons, is depicted as a dull journeyman who has a clear goal - to serve Follen. The once great transformer has turned into a messenger. Pleases only Starscream, whose hypocrisy is the main weapon of the transformer. He still pretends that Megatron is his master, and he wants to serve him. But in reality, Starscream is still the same hypocrite, ready to frame the leader to take his place.Do not be upset if you are going to do this after reading the first three points. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" boasts colorful battles between Autobots and Decepticons. Popular to this day, the battle of Optimus and the Decepticons in the forest, the result of which turned out to be tragic, no longer amazes with the quality of the shooting, but with the emotions. Optimus' desire is not an empty phrase. He wants to protect not only Sam, but all of humanity. He understands that if he loses this war, then the end will come not only to the Autobots. Losing means death. The final battle in the Egyptian Desert differs from Mission City in that the location has a one-sided tone. Bright, warm Egypt replaced the various lanes of cities, which did not really benefit the picture. The scenes, although they look exciting, but the monotony quickly gets bored.Verdict. Revenge of the Fallen is definitely not the best picture in the entire franchise. Weak attempts to create a worthy sequel led to a fiasco. The already not the best plot became even worse, attributing to itself in the category of ""terrible"" new characters that they did not bother to reveal. The game of some actors (Duhamel, Turturro) allowed the film to stay afloat, thanks to which the picture could not sink to the very bottom. From all this tape, the good news is that this is at least not the worst film in the series. As the saying goes: ""And thanks for that!"".Remember me boy?Happy viewing!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The storyline picks up where the last film left off but now Sam is off to college and Mikelea is home helping her dad run the family business. As they balance a long distance relationship an artifact remains from the first film that energizes the Decepticons and gives them hope they can bring back Megatron. Can the Transformers, Sam, Mekeala and some old friends stop the Decepticons again?This movie is directed by Michael Bay (The Rock) and stars Shia LaBeouf (Fury), Megan Fox (Jennifer's Body), Josh Duhamel (Turistas), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy), John Turturro (The Big Lebowski) and Kevin Dunn (Warrior).The sound and special effects that made the first film so great was consistent and carried over well to this picture. They also did a great job of bringing back the original cast moreso than they did utilizing them. The writing was even cheesier than the first film and the use of the characters at times felt forced. I will say I liked the addition of the twin characters and there are some tremendous action scenes in. There's a woods sequence that's tremendous and as good as any action sequence in the series.Overall, this is a fun addition to the action genre that's a step down in storyline from the first film. I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and strongly recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After seeing this film, I asked all my friends (who saw the film independently) to rate the film out of 10. It scored and average of 2.5I'm not even kidding about this - please do not watch this film. It was appalling. One of my friends suggested he'd have a better time going to the see side and hurling 10 £1 coins into the sea!OK, so why's it so bad? MICHAEL BAY like all humans loves money. No effort was put into script writing. The dialogue was appalling... I think my least favourite aspect of the film was the introduction of 2 ""gangsta"" autobots who tried to talk like they were ""from da hood"". AWFUL!!There was a joke at the end pertaining to the testicles of a decepticon. One of my friends compared it to going to see a stand up show where the comedian defecated on the audience for 3 hours then told a knock knock joke. It got no laughs whatsoever. In fact, about 1/3 of the audience were asleep at this point because of 30 minutes of BORING fighting.I think the CGI and action scenes took a turn for the worse in this movie. Also: there was no suspense, unlike in Transformers 1. Anything that was good about Transformers 1 has been removed to make this movie.After the first movie, the 2 main comments to Michael Bay were:1) REMOVE THE HUMANS and 2) FFS, PUT PRIME'S MASK BACK ON!!So Bay responds by keeping Prime's TERRIBLE lips and adding more useless humans to the mix. As if that's not enough, he introduces some new transformers that talk like gangstas. The introduction of these robots made me so angry, I felt sick. I like my giant robot battles to be serious and dark (like the trailer suggests). Thanks false advertising.I'm not sure I can continue with this review without getting SUPER cross. Please, just do not go see this movie. If you're curious, wait until it is out on DVD and download it. Do not, under any circumstances, pay money to view this movie. You'll feel robbed and almost certainly demand your money back!","14 out of 31 found this helpful.

'Transformers 2' offers much more on action and CGI. Although it was maybe a bit too CGI-heavy, it goes with the territory considering the nature of the film, and was still thrilling to watch.The impressive action-packed opening sequence set the standard for what was to come. Once again, the visuals are incredible. The story continues as the Decepticons learn of a shard of the Allspark Cube remaining still, and they'll do anything to get it. Naturally, chaos and mayhem follow as the Decepticons destroys much of the cities around the world. And boy, Michael Bay does enjoy destroying things!!Most of the original cast is back to reprise there roles, which I enjoyed. It was not as suspenseful as the original, as this film has a lot more humor. The Transformer twins were just stupid as the comic relief characters and it would have been so much better without them. The library scene was really great, and the desert attack scene in Egypt was simply awesome! The action is insane! I must be honest, though, I enjoyed the first film much more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is the worst movie ever. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, the worst movie ever made. Normally I disregard trolls and people who just go and throw a random commentary like that, but now, I feel powerless beyond belief, beholding this crime against moviegoers.Even if you thought the first one was good, this one is going to disappoint you to tears. If you felt N#1 was awful (like I did), this should be obvious; don't commit my stupid mistake; at least the first one had John Voight blabbering stupidity. Even though I feel happy because he isn't around this one to further tarnish his career, my heart bleeds for John Turturro, who's role here is even more idiotic than the one he had in numero uno. Not even Megan Fox's Bayesque cleavage and bouncing is a good enough reason to suffer through this.Story? Plot line? acting? None. None that you can understand at least. Everybody is terrible, but specially the lead. Just wait till Shia starts acting possessed or whatever (man I wish I could kick his butt!) and claims that he just read a book in two minutes and found that ""Einstein was wrong"". Your IQ will go down just by hearing that. A special mention should go to the main character's parents, a couple of the utter-most imaginable annoyance.OK, maybe you're saying ""hey man, you are a retard, you went and see Transformers expecting plot line??!! it's about FX!! Well, I'm not that naive of course, so that was my original thought. And no, not even what's supposed to be the movie's forte was good. Action was stupid and senseless, trying to catch moments of brilliance of far superior previous movies like 300. Na, here you have Devastator's Scrotum (textually), and a couple of the most racist clichés made into robots.You don't believe me? well, just go ahead and watch it. Go and watch how bumble bee has been demoted to an even more stupid scoobby doo. Look how Optimus Prime has become a bully with a gun.I just hope this flops at the box office. Not because I want Micheal Bay to stop making movies (even though I do), Not because I want these awful, awful 2 hours and a half of disastrous boredom to lose money (I don't really care). I want this to flop because that way, I would know there's still some notion of common sense around.","33 out of 85 found this helpful.

The movie is directed by Michael Bay and stars Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, and Josh Duhamel. The story continues where the first movie left off, with the Autobots and the Decepticons fighting for control of Earth.The movie is packed with action from start to finish, and the effects are even more impressive than in the first installment. The fight scenes are bigger, the explosions are louder, and the CGI robots are more detailed.The performances of the actors are also commendable, especially Shia LaBeouf who plays Sam Witwicky. His character goes through a lot of emotional turmoil in the movie, and LaBeouf delivers a convincing performance.The plot of the movie is not as strong as the first one, but it still manages to keep the audience engaged. The humor in the movie is also a welcome addition, and it provides a nice break from all the action.Overall, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a worthy sequel to the first movie. It may not be as good as the original, but it still delivers on its promise of high-octane action and stunning visual effects. If you are a fan of the first movie, then you will definitely enjoy this one too.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was 8 years old and I liked the first Transformers, although not as much as my brother, who was 6 at the time, who was a huge fanatic of all sorts of robots and creatures fighting in the Saturday morning cartoons, and he was extremely pumped, but I wasn't too excited, although I did think it looked like a good movie. I saw it with my family, and we loved it! I didn't know this got bad reviews at the time because I wasn't familiar with film critics, and I won't say it's perfect, but it's a great summer film in its own right. The action and special effects are extravagant, particularly the forest battle and whenever a computerized Transformer is interacting with a human character. But I'll say that some of the comedy maybe a little too awkward to watch with families, in addition, the Leo character wasn't important nor funny in the slightest. Other than a couple of small problems, ROTF is a ton of fun for Transformers fans and action movie fans.","17 out of 24 found this helpful.

This member has best described the movie so I am just copying and pasting his comment, because I believe he is true. Anyone wit a little brain do not watch this movie, but it is meant only for brain less children, and making it a Box Office hit.""When Shakespeare's Hamlet spoke of life being ""...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury; signifying nothing."" he was actually referring to a Michael Bay film. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the movie equivalent of a 13 year old boy who has stopped taking his ADHD meds and overindulged on caffeine, sugar, video games and porn. It makes me wonder if Michael Bay actually is a 13 year old boy--the victim of a tragic case of arrested development. 13 year old boys also appear to be the target demographic that this movie was made for.In Revenge of the Fallen the dialog mostly consists of people yelling inanities at each other and robots making expository speeches that attempt to provide some vague skeleton of a plot. The female characters are either soft-porn eye candy or blithering idiots. Or both. The violence is almost non-stop, interrupted occasionally by jokes which revolve around scrotums and testicles and oral sex and humping. The ethnic stereotypes are shocking. The homophobia is palpable. This film displays all of the tact, intellect and decency of a locker room full of pubescent boys.Once the action kicks in, it is relentless. The battling robots are mostly incomprehensible blurs of motion and color and clanging noises. The music pounds. Guns and cannons fire. Jets roar. Things explode. The characters run and yell. It quickly becomes tedious, but it goes on and on and on like this. When it was over, I walked out of the theater dizzy.The best part of seeing Revenge of the Fallen was when I left the theater, got into my car, closed my eyes and basked in sweet silence.

I bought tickets and popcorn to see the movie, and it's awesome.This is just as good as the original, with stunning CGI effects, great screenplay, and fantastic action sequences. The story is hard to explain, so I won't get into more detail. The cast members came back in this, like Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox, and the Transformers like the Autobots (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, etc, and let's not forget about the Decepticons, (Megatron, Starscream, Devastator, Blackout, etc.) Another ""must see"" movie and a ""must buy"" DVD or Blu-ray if you haven't seen it yet.The climax scene where they battle in Egypt was epic, almost close to the original climax scene where they battle in the city doing all sorts of destruction.The one thing that really gets me into a bad situation, it was nominated and won by the stupid Golden Raspberry Awards!!! And it won Worst Picture, shame on you!!!!! I wish Old Dogs or All About Steve should of won that award, instead, they had to pick this movie for the worst, Why? With Avatar nominated for Best Picture (Lost to The Hurt Locker) and this movie nominated and won for Worst Picture. Two great movies, but opposite award shows. Last years Best Picture winner was Slumdog Millionaire, and last years Worst Picture winner was The Love Guru, so that's the difference. Even fans of the Transformers will be so disappointed when this occurs. As for the Oscars, keep up the good work!!!

Michael Bay's direction is especially good in the forest fight, resulting in an excellently filmed and really fun fight that is one of the best action sequences in the entire franchise.

Since the main characters are already familiar with the Autobots and we know how everything works, there's almost none of that epic surprise moment. Where the first one scored points, it doesn't do so well here. What makes this film good is the action, which is still plenty and still awesome, even if it still remains far behind the finale from the previous installment. Besides, there is less of it here as the film slows down the pace. From a certain point on, it became quite uninteresting for me and downright drawn out towards the end. The plot is quite weak. Unfortunately Transformers as a franchise failed in my eyes. The first was revolutionary and great, but this one is ""only"" good.

'Transformers' was an amazing experience, with almost everything going with it. That film was a winner, but the sequel, for which people rushed into the cineplexes and making this a Blockbuster, isn't really that great.The problem: The script lacks fire, it's paper thin and gets dragging towards the end. As they say, first impression is last impression, the first made people to wow all the way, but the second lacks the fizz. The film doesn't hold in most parts, apart from the climax, there is hardly anything that makes you go Holy Cow!!! A special mention for: Bay's brilliant direction, one wished he would've come up with a stronger screenplay. Performances by Shia and Megan are top notch. Shia is fantastic.

If you enjoyed this movie, or had any positive feelings about this movie after having seen it, then I hope you have brain cancer and are suffering an unbearable amount of pain.

I really didn't care for the first Transformers movie much, but I assumed, like most people, Michael Bay uses criticism to improve and move on to the next project and do it better with this new found knowledge. But, with Transformers 2 some was improved, but a lot was just plain bad. The first hour was painful.. Terrible dialogue, many many innuendos, a set of twin Autobots that were equally annoying as Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, awkward plot movement, and just plain bad writing. The first hour felt like it was written by a 40 something who is completely out of touch with the audience they are trying to reach, trying to write a story that will touch that age group with dialogue that will be relevant to them.. and it failed very badly. And please, do not take any children to this movie. It is given a PG-13 rating, but I wonder about that. Not only do you get see a robot that has testicles, but also you get to hear many profanities used by robots for seemingly no good reason other than they are supposed to sound ghetto. Also sex is eluded to with Megan Fox in pretty much every scene she is in. This seems to be her only function in this movie.The last hour and a half wasn't so bad. I started to notice a difference around the time the main characters go to meet John Turturros character. From there on, the story gets pretty good, the action is non stop, and the Autobots get some pretty cool gear.Overall I give it a 50%. Don't pay to see it. Wait for a friend to get it on DVD, and even then it still may not be worth your two and a half hours that you could be doing something else.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Being the sharing kind of guy I am, I wanted to point out a few of my opinions about this train wreck.1) The trademark Michael Bay camera is, as always, all over the place - even in the scenes where there's no action at all! Characters talk about stuff and what does the camera do? It moves around them non-stop! At the end of the movie I felt like I had ridden a bad roller-coaster for too long.2) I enjoy a romantic movie every now and then, especially with a girl next to me. Bu I'm sick to the bone with seeing romantic twists in all kinds of movies. In ROTF our heroes are saving the world from evil robots and they still find the time to have a relationship, complete with arguments, fights, jealousy fits, and all that. What the hell!?3) I have no objection for pretty girls strutting around in movies, but there is a limit to that. Apparently M. Bay doesn't know about this limit. There are way too many half-naked girls in this movie. Especially the dorm Sam moves in looks like the Playboy Mansion more than anywhere else.4) Action movies don't necessarily have strong stories; that being said, this movie's plot manages to insult a 5-year-old's intelligence. They spend $200 million and still can't write a decent story? How hard can it be?5) Of all the stupid things in this movie, there are actually two robots, twins to be precise, who talk and behave like stereotype Afro-American gangbangers. Apart from being extremely insulting to black people, why would robots do that, even if they could? For crying out loud, what is the logic behind this?6) I am aware that history is written by those holding the pen; that being said, I've had enough of watching American propaganda in Hollywood movies. In ROTF, the U.S., once again, saves the world. Americans bravely fight and sacrifice themselves while the rest of the world sits on its butt. U.S. war machines roam the skies, conquer the seas, dominate the land, and as always people from other nations live in mud huts and breed chickens. Get Real!ROTF is a disappointment, through and through. If you like watching endless special effects hour after hour, can listen loud, tuneless action music without having a headache, and have a strong stomach for M. Bay's shaky camera, than go for it. Otherwise avoid it like a pile of nuclear waste.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

Unfortunately Revenge of the Fallen's chemistry was severely unbalanced. The much adored battle scenes from the first movie were sadly not outdone for this sequel, instead they were just longer, louder and without creativity. I would not totally discredited this film as Shia la Boeuf's performance was yet again commendable. You could see the director was pushed for time as most of the battle scenes were shot in slow motion to add the more dramatic effect but after 9 or 10 of them it can get a bit tedious then eventually funny when it shouldn't be. But in respect I wasn't constantly watching the clock waiting for it to end, so I was entertained enough to sit through the length of this picture. But as a person who truly rates films on the premise that I could watch them over and over again, sadly this is not one of them.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

This second chapter however has nothing to do with the first, starting from the new ""look"" of Megan Fox, who was so pretty in the first movie, to the silly ""girly"" voice they used in Italy to dub her, continuing with the exaggerated use of special effects to the total detriment of the plot (if there was one in the first place), to the two silly Autobots. Geographically speaking, it seemed like Petra, in Jordan, was near Giza and Luxor (Tebes) in Egypt, while the three locations are hundreds of kilometers away from each other. Also, Giza is right next to the city of Cairo, but in the movie it looked like it was in the middle of the desert... And what about the Egyptian authorities? The final battle was taking place around the pyramids... but there were only a few Jordan helicopters! Just a lot of nonsense... Kind of reminded me of Matrix 2. In my opinion, just an excuse to make money, certainly not good cinema. By the way, where was Spielberg?","12 out of 30 found this helpful.

I loved it as a kid. It was my favorite cartoon to watch. I had a ton of the action figures. Loved it to death.And then came the movies...Now, I kinda liked the first one. I thought the visuals were really neat, but mostly I just thought it cool that they brought my childhood love to life (Yay, Optimus!). I excused the pitiful plot in the first one. But I should have been able to have had one in this second movie. No. I get nothing. Just another random scrap heap thrown together in a semblance of coherency (and failing pretty hard).It would seem that most of the effort was spent making the visuals, which are quite amazing, I'll admit. And at first I believed that it would be okay just to see for the eye candy aspect (I'd read the horrible reviews before and was sad that it was considered so awful). I hoped for something though and went to see it. There's all this talk about reboots these days. I think Transformers is already in need of one.There is a ""plot,"" but it's just boring and cliché. About 90 percent of the characters are cardboard cutouts and stereotypes. I didn't really feel there were racist robots in the film, though I can understand why some people want to believe it. Most of the humor is vulgar and asinine, the kind that 12 and 13 year old boys make up and repeat to each other over and over again. Halfway through the movie, I was bored, even though there was non-stop action taking place. But it's not even good action. It's chaos and confusion. You can't tell who's who. Some of the new robots weren't even given proper names or lines. I don't have a beef with the acting. I thought it was okay. But it couldn't save this sad beater in need of a date with a car crusher. Also, there was no suspense, no sense of threat or danger, and no emotion evoked where it should have been had.Wait for the DVD if you haven't already seen it. No, I take that back. If you must see it, go now. Seeing it once in the theater is at least cheaper than buying the DVD.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

But this is not a valid excuse for the travesty that was Transformers 2. Just because a movie is based off of a cartoon which is based off of a toy, this doesn't mean that the director doesn't have to construct a good plot. Is it terrible to ask that a movie with a $150 million budget have a decent plot line? But a decent plot line there was not. There was something about a key, and a machine to blow up the sun, but the rest of the plot was so haphazardly thrown together that it seemed to have fallen last on the list of Michael Bay's priorities in this film. Priority one was, it seemed, to blow up as much as humanly possible. Some people can endure 2 1/2 hours of explosions, others cannot.The acting is not only sub-par, it's lazy. It's as if all the actors in the film knew they were only second to the super-cool robots, and so they PLAYED second to the super-cool robots. Shia and Megan's romance was hard to care about, because there was no chemistry, and it was very annoying to see Megan Fox's character embody the ""love-obsessed-girlfriend"" stereotype. The world is about to blown up and all she can care about is the fact that her boyfriend hasn't said the ""l"" word yet? Please. At that point, no one cared. In fact, no one really cared about much in this movie except the fights, and it doesn't matter that it's an action movie or not. People still need to care about what they're seeing, it doesn't matter whether it's a movie about the Holocaust, or a movie about a toy. People need to care, or else what's the point of going?","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times and some of the humor didn't work either. Director Michael Bay is an okay director but this isn't his best film because there's more of everything (robots, action, special effects and humor) in this one but it ended up hurting this sequel instead of making it better. Shia Labeouf reprises the role of Sam providing his usual comic relief and he's decent as the character. Megan Fox is all right as Mikaela but she isn't given much to do except to be eye candy. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back too but even they seem to have less to do in this one. John Turturo is also back and he does a good job as Simmons . The special effects are top notch but it sort of becomes overkill after a while and the robot action/fight sequences are well executed for the most part. The only fight though that had any emotional to it was between Optimus and three Decepticons in a fierce forest showdown that leaves the Aubobots leader ready for the scrap yard because after that battle the action/fight sequences kind of become repetitive. This sequel definitely seemed to be more about the action and special effects than the story and characters. The biggest flaw this movie has is the treatment of not only the new autobots and decepticons but the returning ones as well because most of them with the exceptional of maybe Optimus, Bumblebee and Megatron don't get nearly enough screen time. Many of the new Decepticons introduced (like The Fallen, Devastator, Soundwave, Grindor, Sideways, and Demolisher among many others) only show up for a few minutes before either being killed or disappearing with no explanation. Except for Megatron, The Fallen, and Starscream the others have little to no dialogue who serve no real purpose besides one maybe two action/fight sequences. Some of the new Autbots including Arcee, Jolt, and Sideswipe aren't even given the proper treatment they deserve because none of them are in it long enough to leave an impression. Returning ones like Ironhide and Ratchet are MIA for the most of the movie. They both make a few appearances with little to no dialogue. They're not in it nearly as much as the first one. Even fan favorites like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are MIA for large parts of the film but they're effective in their limited screen time. Megatron and Starscream get a little more to do than the first one by not by much. The two characters I was most disappointed in were The Fallen and Devastator. They both get at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time. The Fallen is an interesting character but he's killed off in his fight near the end by Optimus way too easily to be that much of a threat and he could've been a much more worthy adversary (His fight with Optimus lasts 8 to 10 seconds if that). The character Devastator had promise and looked like cool but the joke with the wrecking balls for his well you know I didn't find that funny. Devastator doesn't even show up until near the end and is easily defeated like The Fallen. Scorpnok makes a blink and you missed it cameo in the desert climax before being killed off five seconds later making the characters appearance rather pointless. There were simply too many robots on both sides. If they focused on the returning one mores and gave them more screen time while introducing some new robots it would've been better because some character development is better than none. The only two characters to get any sort of development were Jetfire and the Twins. I didn't find the Twins racist like some people did but the movie could've easily done without them giving more screen time to Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, or some of the other characters. Jetfire was another interesting character but I don't know why they had him speak with an accent. The abrupt ending left you wondering about what happened to many of the characters like Megatron and Starscream to name a few. There was also a part late into the film where Sam gets hurt and then a second later his hand is bandaged up so this seemed like an error from the screenwriters for not coming up with a better way to put Labeouf's real life injury into the story. For those of you who have seen it already you probably know what scene I'm talking about. The ending does leaves the door open for another possible sequel but I just hope if they do make a third film it's better than this one. The music also didn't really seem to sync well with the movie like it did with the first one and the raunchy humor was often funny while others no so much. The running time of 2 and half hours did make the movie feel a little long especially toward the end. Overall despite it's many flaws Trasformers Revenge Of The Fallen is a decent sci-fi adventure with plenty of robot action, some humor, and good performances by the cast but this sequel could've been a lot better.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

While the movie is a tad long, it is a good watch and it's always exciting to see the 'bots transform. Shia does a very good job and is believable as he helps the audience to feel his difficulty leading a 'normal' life while there is an alien war going on that he can't avoid. Meagan Fox is wonderful on the eyes but she needs to work on her acting. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee stole the show in my eyes...again and it's clear Michael Bay is highlighting their heroic acts..and the audience in my cinema loves it. I will always remember the cheers in both installments when Prime first takes the screen. Bumblebee believes in Sam and will always be there to protect him. It's a toss up which one is better...but action wise, Revenge of the Fallen wins. If you enjoyed part 1, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this installment.

The plot point centers around the Fallen getting revenge and firing his weapon. Optimus Prime was a main obstacle to this, but the Deceptagon attack on Optimus was incidental. Then the plot switches to reviving Optimus, and his part in the climax could have easily been a one shot in the opening. In fact the same power to revive Optimus so he could thwart the destruction of Earth was also the source to put Earth in jeopardy to begin with. It would make more logical sense to destroy the matrix right off eliminating the danger. This would prevent Optimus' return, but likely he wouldn't risk the Earth just to be revived. Also Blackbird ended being more instrumental in restoring Optimus.The geographic planning in the movie sucked. Cairo and the Gizz Pyramids are over 200 miles from the tip of the Gulf of Agaba, and Petra is another 100+ miles beyond that. The climax sequences made them seem much closer in relation. Also the Air/Space Museum in DC is in the city limits and does not adjoin a large airfield as alluded to in the movie. Location flaws such as this and bad internal plot logic really emphasize that this movie is flash over substance.","24 out of 61 found this helpful.

I have to say it kicked the originals ass about 10,0000 times. It had everything the original had: great acting by the same actors, amazing special effects, same great robots. There were other things the original had but were bettered by this one: the score by the amazing Steve Jablonsky, more humor, an amazing soundtrack by various artists (namely Linkin Park's New Divide, which was worked into the score), and new robots. Do not listen to those who are complaining about it just because it was 2 and a half hours long. You will wish it would never end. An amazing plot, great characters, and the same lovable Autobots plus some new funny ones, and the same old evil Decepticons. It is the original, only better!!! A million times better!!! And a recommendation: see it in IMAX","39 out of 63 found this helpful.

The effects are great as well as the fight scenes but other than that it's really nothing special. It failed to get me excited at all, didn't have the ""wow"" factor so to speak. The movie was really dull, as much as I wanted to get into it I simply couldn't. They really overused Megan Fox in this movie as well, went completely out of their way to show her hotness. I love Megan Fox and all but even when she was ripping off her clothes at one point and hearing the men in the theater all yelling ""wooooo!"" I sat there thinking ""what the eff does this have to do with anything?"" I came to see a movie, if I came to see Megan Fox I would have stayed at home and used a thing called the internet. Overall it was an OK movie but the disappointment overruled the movie itself.6/10","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Sam suddenly became an intellectual, and many things were not explained. the robot girl was disgusting. and utensils randomly turning into robots are weird. sam's mom is weird, behaving like a loony, and his dad is very calm at first but turns emotional later on. overall, this movie is quite exciting, but, like candy, it does not last.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

There were a lot more fights in this film compared to the first one which again was good but since the first one i felt the scenes could of shown more of the autobots and stop keep going back to the humans.

Just more of it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2085974/?ref_=tt_urv","diac228","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3387663/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2009","Bigger is better; that's what Hollywood and the Michael Bay team believes. They believe that if you hurl everything from the first film, enhance it a gajabazillion times, and then enhance it even more, you'll have a better film. This mathematical formula has been used for action blockbusters since the early 80s when Empire Strikes Back unleashed its sequelness for the world to see. However, for years, we critics (and moviegoers) have shouted back: ""Check the math!!!"" Well, we don't really actually say that, but sometimes more of something is too much of something---get what I am saying? Let's simplify: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is basically the original film except louder, longer, more stereotypical, and even more anti-climactic. All the strengths and flaws from the original transform their way into the sequel, and the end result is another Michael Bay firestorm of explosions (you know the kind, in which there are explosions inside explosions).In Transformers 1 ½ (my interpretation, my title) we follow Sam as he heads off to college. But, trouble is brewing as a source of unspeakable energy is being hunted by the enemy (that sounds awfully familiar). Before you know it, evil transformers are everywhere, and our heroes see themselves being overwhelmed by the enemy and also by the United States whom is finding Prime and his followers more a burden than helpful. 8 million dollar script gets you a repeat of the original script, with more dialogue and more backstory. Call me crazy, but in a franchise known for the fights and the awesome robots, do we really need deep conversations about relationships? Roberto Orci (writer of Star Trek and several episodes of Alias) should know better. The other writers, well, their (Ehren Kruger and Alex Kurtzman) previous work wasn't as impressive.More. More is the recurring theme to this film. More transformers, more characters, more action, more talking, more exploding, more music, more comic relief, more build-up, more fights, more close-ups, more special effects, more scenery, more military vehicles and weaponry, more stereotypes, more danger, more deaths, and to top it all off, more animal humping. There was more Megan Fox showing off her body instead of her acting. There was more from the parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), as they throw in more sexual humor and a surprising bit of drug-related humor as well. The parents was actually one of the better portions of the movie, as they provided the best comic relief; much better than the hoards of transformers whose only job was to attempt to make the audience laugh.In a film that has more, there are surprisingly less of other elements. There was less Optimus Prime than the original, there was actually less robot-on-robot fighting, as more of the action sequences involved the military going at it against the robots (Funny how we only see the United States military in the entire movie despite the fact that the fighting took place in two other countries). Michael Bay cannot deny he loves the military and the weaponry brought, since this film could have passed off as an Army recruitment video describing and showing just what the United States army is capable of. Bay himself dons the same directing techniques as all his other films; the man is coming off as a one-trick pony.Despite all the setbacks, you will see this film for one main reason: the special effects. The special effects team yet again delivers some of the best work in history, as the transformers themselves look absolutely fantastic and full of detail. The special effects never drop from prime quality, and is the main strength in the entire film. The fights themselves do improve, as the scope and range allow us to accurately see who is fighting whom. Unfortunately, the third act is where almost all the intense and gigantic action is, as the previous two acts had little blurbs of action. What hampers Transformers 1 ½ even more is that like in the original, the final battle (and the ending itself) is extremely anti-climactic. When the main and grand finale does appear, you are already tired from all the build-up that happened for about 45 minutes. There just wasn't enough activity coming from our robotic heroes, all the focus was on the military.Bottom Line: Am I being too harsh to a blockbuster flick? Most people would say so but guess what, summer action blockbusters can be noisy, explosive, and smart at the same time. This has been proved with the likes of Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Last Crusade, True Lies, Speed, Pirates of the Caribbean, Terminator 2, and even Michael Bay's very own The Rock. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will satisfy the action junkies loosely, but only if they are willing to accept all the drawbacks, especially that of the franchise changing from robots vs. robots to man vs. robots. 150 minutes, several stereotypes, hundreds of explosions, and a couple dues ex mahcinas later, a weak sequel arrives.The ironic thing is I grade this film the same as the original. So, more does not equal better in this case, and more does not equal worse either. It just means, more of the same, and it's the same sort of stuff that prevents this franchise from ever being halfway-decent.","16 out of 38 found this helpful.

I even bought it on DVD the other day and have watched it a couple time. I like the action, explosions, the sounds and the characters and the adventure they are on. People say it is the worst movie of the year, even though if you look into 2009 their were a lot worse movies. This is however my opinion. I didn't like The Blind Side and it is because it is not my type of entertainment. That is why award shows suck because it makes it seem like everyone agrees on the same thing. I don't even want to see half of the movies that are up for the best picture awards at the Oscars. In my opinion Michael Bay is a great director and I like a lot of his movies. Shia Labeouf in my opinion is the greatest young actor out there right now. I thought Megan Fox is a fine actress and Julie White is very funny. The tranformers are awesome and my favourite characters of all time. I can't wait for Transformers 3 to come out. I will be there the day it comes out in theatres. Also, the soundtracks for these Transformer movies are the greatest.","39 out of 63 found this helpful.

It was a waste of money, & I suggest people not to go see it. I thought it was very pointless. The first one was very good, but this one was horrible. There was a lot of crude humor, sexuality, and i was appalled by everything they did to destroy this movie. At first, it seemed kinda cool. The opening and everything. But barely into the movie, you see some stupid dogs humping each other, twice in like 5 minutes..which is pointless anyways, and has nothing to do with the whole Transformers thing, and then we see girls in college, and they show all of the ""beautiful"" ones with cleavage and nice bodies, just like the media wants you to believe. It's eye candy for many guys, and probably made many girls, including me, feel horrible, and makes us feel worse about ourselves, because of how ""perfect"" the girls seem, especially Megan Fox, and how much we would like to look like her. The movie shows off her body, closes up on her lips, and there are scenes of a ""beautiful"" girl trying everything to seduce Sam, she suggestively pushes a chair into something and sits on his lap, and then you see her later, get on top of Sam, until you see a tail come out, showing her underwear. Obviously, I could tell from the beginning that something was wrong with her. Anyways, getting off subject... another thing that bothered me and my boyfriend, is how the Autobots would bleed blood, and they would be torn apart as if they had guts. Omg, robots are not supposed to bleed! I mean, cmon. And so many things were just thrown in there unnecesarily. I mean, if guys like this movie because of the sexy girls, the party scenes, the crude humor, and the sensuality, you guys can go buy some porn or something instead. But don't waste your money on this. This is supposed to be about robots, not skanky, suggestive girls, and stupid explosions, and no plot.","47 out of 133 found this helpful.

It was as to be expected for a summer blockbuster. The only complaint I had was the sexual material that was used and I watched three different sets of parents leave with their small children. Parents use extreme caution with any children under 1o years old. The sad thing is that the scenes were pointless and did not add or would not have taken away from the movie, so why were they added? Transformers at the heart is for the kids. The director should have taken that into account before adding those scenes.Visually I thought the movie was great. Like most sequels it lacks a good story line but they try to make up for it by adding more explosions and fighting. If your looking for a movie with lots of action then you'll like this movie. Just remember to leave the kids at home for this one.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Megan Fox - supposedly the sexiest female on earth - shows up in every other shot with her glossed lips, brushed cheeks, mascara-ed eyelids and the permanent pout... great eye candy, but kinda gets in the way of most of the action. Michael Bay used her the best in the first movie, where she actually had a lot of action, but in this one, all she does is to run behind Shia, scream, ""bounce"", and tame a midget Decepticon! All in all, I want to love the movie - because I am such an unabashed fan... but the movie is overdone - with special effects - both transformers and sexy babes...","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

You go to the movies (to watch Transformers) expecting to see something bad, turns out it's unwatchable, long, terribly boring and hand-made for retards. If that's what you want, go ahead and waste your money. If not, wait and rent it. Rent it and watch the beautiful Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas, because man, they're hot. If you're girl, stay away from this movie, you'll probably vomit during the first few minuets. If you're a guy, man, hold on and watch the DVD, at least you'll have the ability to fast forward.So, if you're absolutely idiot, brain-dead, and think that money ain't worth a thing, go watch the revenge of the fallen. PS: No, the explosions ain't worth it. Not even a bit. They're just loud. (and I like explosions).","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

If there is any justice in the world, he will one day be kidnapped by people with actual talent. They will force him to watch his movies over and over in a Clockwork Orange chair until they break the soul he clearly doesn't have.As someone who loves movies of all genres, Transformers 2 offends me on a deep personal level. Michael Bay's latest opus is a testament to the dark, greedy, soulless side of the movies. Anything for a buck, lowest common denominator, pandering to the base nature of humanity, crap.That bad? Oh yes. And its insidious. There were 2 things in this movie that were better than the first one. The transformers transformed more slowly so you could actually see it happen... well, you would be able to if it didn't also look like the movie was edited in a wood chipper. The Transformers also had more personality, which was an improvement over last movie where the only way to tell which giant robot was Optimus was to look for the Mac Truck.However, there is a dark side to these new personality-filled robots. The appearance of Amos and Andy in robot form was awful. Nothing like 2 buck-toothed, illiterate, bumbling, stereotypes to affirm that Michael Bay is either completely racist or completely naive. His comment that, ""they're robots,"" is moronic. And Jar Jar is just an alien.There was so much action it was sort of like an assault which got increasingly tiring. Yeah, the special effects were pretty and the explosions were loud, but 2 hours and 40 minutes of straight Michael Bay action was incredibly boring. Part of that is his style. The aforementioned wood chipper editing does not help anything. You can barely see whats going on. Despite the loudness, I fell asleep. Twice. In a theatre seat. I've never been that bored in a movie in my life. And it was 2 hours and 40 friggin minutes long! Indulgent and vapid. There was not enough movie to justify it being that long.The problem is the movie is all surface. There is an overly complicated plot, which really doesn't need to be there at all. Why explain giant killer robots in such depth? To appease the fan boys? I doubt that'll happen. They're already angry. And the plot is not engrossing. The characters are irritating. All the humor is fart and testicle jokes. The dialog... I'm actually in the process of repressing it, but robots + declarative = bad news bears. Out of self defense Michael Bay has to rely on fiery explosives and robots hitting each other with trees. He is incapable of every part of making a movie that is not special effects.There was a love story, which mostly involved Megan Fox bending over and pouting and then her face spiraling around near the end in a completely mystifying moment. Of course, to show how epic the love was, Bay decides to spiral around our couple in 360 camera shots that directors don't generally use. They don't use them because they are disorienting for the audience and considered amateurish. So after 5 straight minutes of rotating cameras I was ready to vomit, and it wasn't entirely the revolting meditations on saying I wuv oo first from Shia and Fox.You know, I can't actually do this movie justice. It was that bad. It was everything I hate in a movie. Everything. I think I died a little inside last night.And Michael Bay? Please do not rape anymore of my childhood memories. I can't take it. You should be ashamed of yourself.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

It was nowhere as BAD as the negative reviews have portrayed it.This movie was great fun. I took my daughter to see it because she loved the first movie and she thought it was awesome. Did it have its faults? Sure it did but first and foremost this is a movie about giant alien robots that transform into planes, cars and a variety of other items. To expect anything other than pure escapism is to delude oneself.The action sequences were very intense and the fight sequence in the forest is by far the most amazing thing put on film. My only major beef with the film was the sometimes inappropriate interjection of needless sexual references. The Autobot twins were hysterical and nowhere near the level of Jar Jar annoyance that some have claimed. This movie also showed how bad ass Bumblebee can actually be. My only other complaint is they included many new Autobots into the mix but overall screen time was lacking. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next sequel. Definitely one to see on the big screen.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

And then you cringe to think you still have another 2 hours left. The amount of sexual content makes me want to punch myself in the face. What a disgrace to Transformers to rely so heavily on insignificant dribble. Sex may sell, but this was ridiculous: Robot ""parts"" coming out of a woman's panties, a transformer humping the leg of Megan Fox, and balls dangling from another transformer. Sadly, I could go on. What an outcry for attention and blatant distraction to the absolute lack of a plot. The amount of time spent on lame and unnecessary content causes a pathetic lack of character development and insight. ALL characters were COMPLETELY one-dimensional and some even extremely stereotypical. Sadly, not even the special effects made up for all this: The further the movie progressed, the more confusing the fight scenes since all the Transformers began looking alike. The movie gave me a sense that it was much, much more about Megan Fox's assets than about Transformers. And no gentleman, not in a good way... in a highly annoying, pathetic and nauseating way. Easily one of the worst movies I've ever come across. Please, Michael Bay, for the love of God....retire.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) moves to the college campus and leaves one piece of the cube with his girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). However, Sam has touched the small metallic piece and has acquired the ancient knowledge that interests to the Decepticons that want to retrieve it through the brain of Sam. Bumblebee and Optimus Prime protect Sam, but when Optimus Prime is destroyed, the life of Sam seems to be in danger.""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a typical action movie for fans of Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI), with lots of explosions, car chase and special effects that does not need acting. In addition, the movie shows two sexy women (Isabel Lucas and Megan Fox) and stupid characters supposed to be funny, like July White in the role of the mother of Sam, but indeed an annoying character. The sequence in the campus of the university is one of the most ridiculous that I have ever seen. It is funny to see the North American President taking decisions in the name of the human race (where is UN?) and probably this is the best joke of this brainless movie. This time, the World Heritage Site destroyed by the truculence is located in Egypt.

And I'm not going to criticise the plot either, because, clearly the film was not intended to have one. There is just enough dialoge to stitch the various battle scenes together and that's it. Continuity comes down to keeping the same characters throughout the film and having them say variations of their four or five different lines over and over again, and you know what, its fine, because the film doesn't try to be more than that. After all, this is a life action version of a cheap cartoon show inspired by a toy commercial. Hey, Michael Bay would have been my first choice too!I was getting annoyed by the frequent use of words like ""destiny"" and ""purpose"" and all that, but its not Transformer's fault. Every second Hollywood movie has it by now and I was already tired of it by the time Matrix Reloaded came out.There is some true potential for comedy here, snappy, fast shot dialogue, and little side stories that are cut together and overlaid in a very fast and exciting fashion. Typical for Michael Bay and something that worked well in movies like Bad Boys II. Too bad they all boil down to some character bumping her head or something, oh well.What I was expecting were stunning visual effects and a big, thoroughly directed action spectacle and in that respect I felt rather disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I have to give Bay credit for being able to insert an action driven sequence in five minute intervals, and I'm not being cynical! If you love big explosions, there are few films that can reach this sort of action density.It's fun, but it's also way too uniform. From the first opening battle with some huge unicycle robot to the last fight in the desert there is little or no dramatisation, no structure to keep me interested. For instance, the robot's agility and strength are in no comparison to the little human soldiers with their petty machineguns, so having humans fight robots for more than 20 minutes without them getting ripped into little fleshy pieces just seems odd and therefore drains a lot of suspense out of the action. The Explosions are repetitive and especially the final battle seemed to go on forever. The camera feels detached and inconsistent, which is sad because some sequences had some really great camera work in them but they are short moments and are easy to miss.Even the visual effects on the robots weren't all that impressive. I would have actually liked to see some robots TRANSFORM but even that wasn't possible most of the time. I'm sure a lot of effort has been put in building and animating these characters but apart from two or three scenes none of the transformations can actually be seen!!?! Either the camera swoops around so there's too much motion blur, or it's just a close-up where you can only see some random metal parts fly by, or the shot is cut early, or the transformation is actually purposely hidden behind some cleverly placed obstacle (parachute!!!).Kudos to the production team, it's a technical masterpiece. Still, despite all the effort, it left me somewhat unsatisfied. I rate it 3 out of ten because, sadly, it's not what I'd consider a great action film. Transformers 3 will probably be better than this but I won't be going.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Hit-and-miss sequel does basically accomplish what its predecessor did with non-stop action mixing with would-be witty one-liners, beautiful women, and sleek technologies. With all that said, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" still lacks the complexities and depth of legitimate film-making vehicles to be much of a movie from a critical standpoint.

I don't want to spoil anything for our American friends but be prepared for the first scene in Shanghai. In my eyes that part blows you away. What a great way to start the movie. It jumps straight in and hits you in the face with action from the off. The forest fight scene is also a mega deathmatch, although I would like to see it in Imax due to there being a longer cut for fighting in that version.

The films SFX are again breathtaking and slightly better than the first film. However, when there is a lot of action happening on screen the robots seem to move very quick so you cannot see anything very clearly, i am not sure if this is because its hard to get it clear whilst moving at fast speeds.Overall the film is slightly dragged out by about 30 mins but still fun nevertheless.

The parts that were edited should have remained and a lot of the parts that were in the movie were not needed...I got tired of seeing Ms. Tennessee Megan Fox puff up her lips and do all the things she thinks the guys are looking for in this movie, its called ""suggestive direction"".

I didn't even check IMDb. Which in my case is odd cause I always read comments before going to the cinema. I LOVED the first one, so I just expected Bay to get this as right as Nolan did on The Dark Knight... Silly me.In movies like this I can usually put up with cheesy clichés, dumb third grade jokes and .... who am i kidding, NO I CANNOT! I cannot believe i went to watch this movie with my girlfriend.Shia LaBeouf thinks that good acting equals repetitive screaming and stuttering. Megan Fox is unbelievable, literally. The plot is just a big gaping hole. Micheal Bay took the first film, amplified it by 200% and threw the story in the trash. But as long as he gets the cash, I guess it's okay. Every character in the film doesn't have to be a comedian! Particularly a bad and an annoying one (the twins). The story is... well there is no story.Personally I'm puzzled by the choice to put this film into production. What were they thinking?? Can't they tell good from bad?Furthermore, if I were an actor that starred in the first Transformers I would never agree to a script like that. I mean I wrote better essays than that in high school. My point is, they screwed up the franchise. I feel sorry for the fans including myself for paying to see this pile of crap.My suggestion is, if you only want to see big explosions and destruction. Plus you're capable of blocking out all the utter mix of nonsense that this film is, then go and catch it on the big screen. Otherwise save yourself of the disappointment and go buy a six-pack instead.Edit:I wrote this while still being angry at Mr. Bay for not making me care about the characters. I'll give it a 6/10. 5 for the mind blowing effects. 1 for the silly little plot.Bay should stick to effects (which he does best) and let other people worry about the plot. That way we might even get a great movie.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Megan Fox is going to end up in adult movies if she doesn't get some acting lessons, and that's the honest truth. Shia Labeouf was pretty good.

Followed by a totally unnecessary gremlin-transformers blow up the house scene. We find Bumblebee is being kept in the garage like a bloody dog... Toilet humor... Very quickly the smile on my face from the opening Shanghai sequence (which looked great, along with a forest fight later on) quickly started to fade. From here to got worse. Shias crazy roommate (who serves what purpose?) Shia caught cheating with a TX from Terminator 3 (yes, I'm not kidding). Annoying 'stuck in there' scenes with Shias parents.

All in all though, this movie was the pornographic equivalent of a 2 hour close up of a knob ramming an a'hole. Maybe some people want that but I don't want to see it. Show us a little foreplay, a little tease, change position, anything!Speaking of porn, that's also the reason Megan Fox didn't work. She looks like she's in the wrong business. She also has zero charisma or personality (though the writers could be to blame here). You see makaela would have worked if she was smoking hot in a pretty sense and a touch down to earth (attainable) so an audience could dream their were Sam. We would of related to her more and therefore cared about her. It also would have made the T-X 'seductress' work in the film work. But she's less hot than the ott megan! Talk about the girlfriend experience. How much is Sam paying for the privilege? And the story spoke of being faithful? Come on, how could you trust Fox? Seriously. In skimpy shorts and low tops hanging around motorcycle grease monkeys all day? Add this to dogs dry humping, robot radio control cars dry humping... Who is this movie aimed at? I mostly enjoyed the first film. It worked for the most part and felt like the story had been worked and then shot, as opposed to being shot while they worked it out. I think the transformers franchise could of worked brilliantly. It needed more 'Berg less Bay though. Given us a touch of wonder and magic...Star Trek still makes the summer a success. That was so enjoyable it counts for two movies. Same writers, yeah, but Bay would have turned the dark knight into a noisy snuffy mess.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

This isn't even the worst of it. $200 million was spent on making Revenge Of The Fallen, and it made 836 million green ones at the box-office. I was wise enough to avoid seeing it in a movie theater, but I still felt ripped off after watching it at home. If this is the sort of film that passes as a big money-making machine these days then what is the world coming to? As an experience the film leaves one feeling tired, but it still has its good points. The CGI is often amazing though sometimes it takes effort to figure out which transformer you're looking at. Bay is, no doubt, a very good director of visuals. He can direct actors towards good performances too. I will say that Shia LaBeouf does a good job playing Sam Witwicky. The script hurts the film for sure, and makes it like a cartoon. Things could have been good if the dialogue was more thoughtful and if the pacing was better. As it stands Revenge Of The Fallen is somewhat of a mess. If only the juvenile humor had been kept out. Some people criticized Megan Fox, but I say why? It's not like the other actors in the film did much better. She's just there to represent a piece of good ole suburban American ass. At least SHE called Michael Bay Hitler. Yeah, the film could have been better (perhaps much better) if the Bayness wasn't so plentiful. So, for every impressive battle featuring the mighty Optimus Prime there is a lame attempt at humor featuring a small transformer with a machine gun for a penis. I don't recommend seeing Revenge Of The Fallen, but children will probably enjoy it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I can hardly mention how intimate I got with myself during Jurassic Park and T2 back in the days. For me CGI is incredible because when it's done right it opens up new worlds and fantasies. Look at JP, Matrix, LOTR, these are examples where it works, in this movie it doesn't.We've seen the first Transformers, they can transform and it looks good and that's why I actually kinda liked the first one. I agree that the plot was thin already in the first one but the new type of cgi used made it a worthwhile movie in my book, a great theater experience.So these days you have to make a trilogy if the first one is successful, it's simply one of the ways the studios make bank. In some cases the sequel gets pushed through just for the sake of making a sequel. You saw it with Matrix and Spiderman how horrible it can be, but with Transformers we have found a new low, one that I think will not be beaten for a very long time.It's simple, there is no creativity, no idea, no story, no message and nothing new at all. This is a 2 hours action ride that ultimately have you hoping for the doors to be kicked in to have the theater taken over by terrorists or something else to break the sleep hypnotic piece of crap you are watching (ouch, I went full out hate, ow well lets keep going).Let's just assault the premise of the movie a bit.Megatron was killed in the first one. You might think they would disassemble him, melt him down, send him to the sun or something to make sure this was it. Naaah, the American government and those in charge of security had a brain aneurysm here. Instead they thought ""hmm what are we going to do with this dangerous creation now that it's dead?"". The answer was of course to drop it in the ocean and keep like 10 cruisers and submarines around JUST IN CASE he should wake up again or someone might come to pick him up. This is early in the movie that this moronic premise is revealed.So I won't reveal anymore because then it becomes spoilers but if you have a brain you HAVE to leave it at home if you want to see this movie. Seriously, do not think about ANYTHING. Look at the transforming cars and let out the occasional ""wow"" and you might actually make it out. My IQ dropped about 50 points from watching this movie which explains why I can't spell English words anymore I suspect but at least I made it out, I doubt everybody will be so lucky.Trust me, the last 45 minutes you will be begging for the movie to end and you wished you would have never have to listen to 30 minutes of actors trying to justify the most ridiculous plot in movie history.But Hey, Megan Fox's titties bounces around a lot and there is a nice shameless intro shot of her on a bike. The people HAVE spoken, this is a commercial success but I dare ANYONE to try and watch this movie twice, it simply can't be done unless you are completely retarded.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

I usually wait a few weeks to see the big ""Block Buster"" movies because I don't like lines or crowded theaters. For some reason my wife has been bugging me to take her and the kids to see this since it released on Tuesday. After waiting in line for an hour in the 95 degree California sun, we spent another half an hour in the theater before the movie started.First off, I went to the first movie because I have 2 school age kids that were wanting to see it. I hated the cartoon because of the juvenile humor and irritating voice characterizations. This first movie IMO had none of these things and was a fantastic action movie!(I gave it an 8) Within the first 10 minutes of the new movie I knew I was going to be disappointed. They added a lot of the voice crap from the cartoon I hated. Why does Hollywood have to ruin movies by adding stereo-typed characters to them? If I see another modern movie with a 70ies style jive voice in it I am going to freaking scream! I see this urban element in tons of the new movies, even in ones that are supposed to be in medieval times! WHY! WHY! WHY! This movie was trying to please way too many age groups IMO. There was way too much sophomoric humor in this movie that was being pushed toward a preteen crowd. I never thought I would spend my hard earned money to see dogs have sex, TWICE! I am not a prude be any means and I like seeing good looking women bent over in their panties but not when I am sitting next to my 13 year old daughter! One of these scenes actually had a soft-core porn feel to it! This movie was a very cool special effects ride with some parts that were just plain irritating! For the rating? I would say it borders on an R for the sexual content, language, drug use and adult humor.Worth seeing if you have money to burn and nothing to do on a Saturday Night but leave the 16 and under kids at home!

Every scene was action after action, with Michael Bay trying to make everything seem ""cool"" so retards who don't appreciate a good film won't complain. The acting was horrible, but I can't completely blame it on the actors. The script, or should I say lack thereof, gave the actors no room to be more than mere two dimensional characters. Many of the characters were insignificant to the plot anyways (the military guys and the human decepticon chick). These characters added nothing to the movie and were added either to reprise their roles and please the fanboys, or to give the audience something to look at other than big f**king robots.

Those who completely hate this film and those who thought it was amazing. Well I don't really agree with either side on this one. While TF2 is certainly not brilliant, Bay knows how to entertain. Me and my friends went to see Transformers 2 and had a great time. We laughed at the cheesy dialogue, thought the special effects were awesome, decided to ignore the mediocre and melodramatic acting, forgot about the story, and had fun(also enjoyed Megan Fox).It's no 'One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest' or for that matter 'Terminator 2'(made by the true king of action films) but it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be mindless fun, which doesn't take itself to seriously. All of Bay's films are like this. So enjoy TF2 for what it is. The best way to watch this movie is with a bunch of friends where you can laugh together and enjoy it. The problem with critics is that they get to critical, they forget about fun films.

I am a little of director myself, so I watch movies maybe a little different. The camera in actions sequences is too close and moves too fast when the robots are fighting. And the robots move too fast, when in battle. For example: when Optimus fights Megatron, Starscream and Blackout in the forest I couldn't see almost nothing, because they were moving too fast and the camera was too close too them. Good thing that Optimus is in red and blue colors'cause if he wouldn't be, I wouldn't tell the difference between them. Too close and too fast camera in this movie, especially in fight scenes.

Not the worst one in the series it still a good one in some moments. The worst one that would be Age of Extinction because the film it is just too long and boring. This movie was good, but it lacks on a story and it is forgettable for me. Sam Witwicky goes now for college and he wants to focus more now on his life. He accidentally cross a path on an ancient mystery implanted into his mind by the now-destroyed AllSpark, who has to now unravel ancient origins of the Transformers. Megatron wants to caught Sam while ancient mystery he has in his brain so he can resurrected Fallen and is planning the revenge on the world. Now Sam and his friends have to run for his life and try to stop the Decepticons before is too late. In this one Megatron dies, but on the end of the movie he actually get's resurrected and get's back to life and he stops Fallen. I liked the ending that was the perfect in the film. The film tends to sag in the middle when the action slows down to progress some of the silly plot. Transformers is not a film about plot, it's about the action - just keep it coming and don't try to make a story from it because it's RIDICULOUS; - Megan Fox still looks amazingly hot but cannot act to save her life. She was too hot and she just did not gave a good acting performance. You may as well just put a cardboard cut-out of her next to Shia Labeouf and it'll do the same job for a fraction of the cost; - A scene towards the end of the movie where there is a small ""dream sequence"" of sorts, and the word ""destiny"" is mentioned. I almost vomited. The word 'ridiculous' doesn't quite do it justice; - The girl that Sam meets at college and who she is. I am simply AMAZED that they actually let that whole thing get put into the movie - it just doesn't fit into the Transformers world and leaves stupendous plot holes and questions; - There isn't enough slow-motion in the action sequences for you to take it all in - Transformers trying to be ""funny"" - yuck.This movie had everything the fans were waiting for. The story fit, and didn't go willy-nilly. My honesty of the four Transformers. The first one is only the best one and worth to watch it. I watch this movie in 2011 before the third one was released and I thought was better than the first one but no it wasn't. The first movie I always enjoy this one I just can't. Transformers was the only movie I watch it several times. I give up with the last three, I only liked was the music theme they really had wonderful music theme. I didn't got it what was with those pyramid things and who of Transformers was who, they all looked the same The movie got me exhausted, I thought Mikaela was hot and sexy in the beginning of the movie on the bike and the story started wonderful but than just all blow it off and was too long. Sam annoyed me in the beginning when he started screaming Bumblebee and ugh. Transformers 2 is terrible lacking movie, confusing and is the worst story telling and I don't got it either what was with the story. The only thing I enjoy in the movie was the music.I Like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen because of the music. 2.weeks ago I did got it 2 BD and I love it. I would watch the third one after the first one. The problem with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was Megan Fox she was to damn hot, she shouldn't be but not all that. They put to much romance than action and less story in it. The final battle in the pyramids wasn't that great as the first one was, Dark of the Moon is Better. The music makes the movies."" Anyway Movie - disappointing! Too much unnecessary comedy. The action was very good, but what was with all of the robot spit? The confusing plot about the film. One of the most popular, thrill-packed, franchises of all time is back with even more action and more Autobots and Decepticons! In the highly anticipated Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.I am giving this film a 6/10 because there were moments in the film that I did enjoy them, and there were moments I just couldn't enjoy and did not got it. Still Age of Extinction is seriously the worst one, even Revenge of the Fallen isn't that terrible movie than Age of Extinction is.

It was decent for what it was about; transforming robots. Not a big fan of the original cartoons but I loved playing with the toys growing up. So my buddy and I went to catch this film opening night, and we walked out of there feeling like our lives had been deprived, as in we wanted not only our money back but our time we lost seeing the film.It follows the same basic formula the first one did; you got the transforming robots, hot girls, an O.K. cast, lots of explosions, but this one failed whereas the first one pulled it off. For starters, I laughed just a couple of times throughout the movie. O.K. so it wasn't meant to be a comedy, I'll keep watching for redeeming qualities. They never came. It was like watching Terminator Salvation all over again where it was the most unrealistic (and I'm not talking about transforming robots that fight unrealistic) movie I've ever seen. I expected this. The first film was unrealistic. However, at least they got some of the military stuff right which in this movie it's just all wrong wrong wrong.Then there's the plot development, or the lack thereof. Again, it's a Michael Bay vehicle I more than expected this. However, I didn't expect a COMPLETE lack of plot. It's as though literally the explosions came first and what there was of story was thought of on the spot as dubbing for the transformers. It was kiddish (again, Transformers, but more so than the first) it was filled with dumb dialogue from both autobots and decepticons, and it made me angry is what it did. I don't walk out of movies feeling like that; they don't get to me, but this one was just so horrendously bad that I couldn't help but feel mad I had to sit through it.You know there are people who loved it in there and they clapped, good for them. Just means that if this film succeeds Hollywood is going to again insult the movie going intelligence in order to make their millions. This is O.K. I'm all for making money, but also there's supply and demand, and I really hope demand for a third film is so low they'll just save their money and make something else. That's my dream, don't think it'll happen like that though.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

People criticize it's story line. But do these apparent ""professional"" reviewers know what they're watching at all? I'll be hopefully the one of many to tell them that it's Transformers for god sakes! The last thing that I would expect out of an action thriller involving robots/vehicles coinciding with humans to help the planet for the greater good is a deep meaning or moral at the climax of all the CGI special effects! People striving for Oscars strive for a good strong story, not an action/thriller! I mean at the end of the day, it's Transformers we're watching, a former kids TV show.  I would hardly expect to find a massive deep, strengthened story line after it's history of childish, cartoon programming. So what I'm getting at Is, is that this movie did what it was supposed to do. It lived up to the action category!i Drama needs solid story lines far more than anything else in the movie business, so those who judge Transformers on plot are sadly mislead. Transformers (like every movie) needs a structure. It had one. Maybe a bit of a cheesy one, but, to the fools who analyze and criticize it based on plot, remember what your watching.I mean, dear God! I paid a couple of bucks to see what I hoped to be a thriller that performed to it's genre from start to finish, and let me tell you, it did just that (and over achieved on top of everything else). Transformers was marinaded by non stop thrills and adrenaline kicks of pure action! And the CGI was impeccable! So smooth to watch brawling robots in such crisp detail with the sound effects off the scales in terms of perfection.It didn't need a strong story line to keep it together. Transformers 2 was the whole package and should only be judged on the category that it performed so fantastically to!Don't over analyze it and you'll enjoy the show!Overall rating 8/10","29 out of 46 found this helpful.

On part of the acting I don't have any problems but it's the way some things are done and shown that made me think, what the hell, this is for kiddies. The effects are again sublime but I do had a few problems with some transformers. There are two small cars that can transform, once they did they really reminded me of Cars (2006). They had teeth that were laughable and they also act childish. That doesn't add anything and makes this flick going towards the jokes done in M.I.B. (1997). But not only that, the talking of those small spider robots I didn't like either. In the first flick they talk their language but now they can talk English with an accent and again it doesn't make them believable anymore. The story itself is rather good although it's written in two sentences. There's still a part of The Cube on earth, by coincidence it's in Sam's hands. Megan Fox is here two years older than in Transformers and she is indeed more sexy and could have been the next thing but she showed that her mind was a terrible thing to taste. She had said stupid things toward the director Michael Bay and towards others which has led to the fall of Megan Fox. From becoming a blockbuster girl she is almost not seen anymore. She only performed in Jennifer's Body (2009) that was worth mentioning but was broken down by critics. The end for Fox.For me The Revenge Of The Fallen is on the edge of becoming ridiculous but the effects made it worth watching. Watchable with teens due the way the robots are shown this time.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Gangsta robots ? John Turturro's thong ? Mother getting high on pot ? Those are the clear signs that the divine hand of Steven Spielberg lost his grip on the project during the production of this predictable two-hours and a half hip-hop car commercial.Technologically speaking,this movie is a breakthrough in computer generated graphics and sound editing/mixing.Few scene in particular almost made me forget about the total artistic kitsch and enjoy magnificent backgrounds and character rendering at least for a few minutes.The cinematography is the sole improvement over the first ""Transformers"",with less shaky cam and more slow-motion to enhance the eyecandyness of the explosions within IMAX shots (which are surprisingly rare given the insane budget).Unfortunately,the movie fails on so many levels that technical brilliance alone cannot embody a redeeming factor.""Beginning, middle, end,"" Agent Simmons pleads to Jetfire. ""Details. Plot. Compress. Tell it."".If only Michael Bay and the writers had listened to the very character they created,this film could have been cut to half of it's length,and double it's value while avoiding a 19% rating from top critics and furious roars from dedicated fans .3/10 .","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

Basically my problem with both installments is that it seems that both were made with 8-12 year olds in mind. 8-12 year olds are gonna see a movie about robots that turn into cars no matter what the story line is, so they should have had a good one, also they should not have geared the movie for kids, instead they should have made them both for the adults, the kids who used to watch them, but that are now much more savvy. p.s. did the whole movie have to be made in slow motion? its running time is listed as 150 minutes, it could easily have been 90 minutes without all the slow motion parts.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's music, action, special effects and acting were all exceptional. But as for this sequel, it seems like the tone of the film needed to be changed. Transformers (2007) had realistic tone, every now and then it would inject some silly humor but that was to let its audience know that there was room for some laughs. But for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), it was decided that more comedy and slapstick was needed. But for what reason?For the most part, every component was kept relatively the same as the first. Some of the statement is good, while the other part, not so much. What's good are the special effects action and music. The transforming sounds are still there, as are the visuals and the explosive action. Even Steve Jablonsky returned to make a musical soundtrack for the film. What went wrong here was character placement and how that effected the tone.Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf both reprised their roles as the popular couple, Mikaela and Sam. However, as I mentioned in the first review of this franchise, I would only forgive Mr. Witwicky for being so jittery because it was his first time being around alien robots. What do we have here? Mr. Witwicky is still jittery AND now he's screaming like a woos. Half of the running time in this film Shia LaBeouf is screaming. Even Megan Fox's character screams less than him. Enough with it LaBeouf! Did you ask to have a script with little dialog so you didn't talk much? He should be used to this kind of thing now.Then there's the character placement of Simmons (John Turturro). Turturro played a supporting character in the first film and now he's been moved to head honcho/plot motivator. Why do that? Some of Turturro's lines are really ridiculous or worse, inappropriate. This was supposed to add to the comical scenes but I didn't find very funny. Plus, writer Ehren Kruger thought it would be fun to pen in some loud- mouthed autobots as well. Yeah they weren't needed either. I enjoyed more of Mark Ryan's performance as the decrepit decepticon, Jetfire. It reminded me of the senior citizens of our time. For nostalgia purposes. And for the rest of the voice actors, they all return as well. Even Frank Welker is here this time, which was a nice addition. But again, all these good things can't override the abundant silly slapstick that is placed in this film. It needs to be toned down again.To make the film more attractive, it was thought that by adding more slapstick would increase the films likability. To be honest, it just made it more stupid including LaBeouf's role. The rest is fine though which isn't much.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The whole ""college"" section could have been compressed to about 20 to 25 minutes rather than an hour long, which have no impact on the story as a whole.The plot is not very good, and the stuff about the fallen is pretty gnarly. Its just a shame you don't find out about it till about the last third of the film, and there are a lot of plot holes - like why the hell didn't Sam give the splinter to Optimus Prime instead of his lame girlfriend?! But i think if they had started with the plot earlier and cut a lot of the ""in-between"" they could have made the film a lot more fun.Overall, it was fun, but the faults become tiresome and therefore make the film less entertaining and some what boring at times, especially with its long length (2 and a half hours i believe). Worth Seeing yes, but definitely not the blockbuster monstrosity we were all looking forward to.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What an absolutely ridiculous movie! I still cannot decide whether I detest or love this movie and the swirl of robot carnage which Michael Bay delivers slickly. I have plumped for a diplomatic seven as it neither deserves full praise, no film by Michael Bay does, yet I came out with my adolescent male blood pumping to Linkin Park's great new song. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is trying to forget about the events of the first film, and even leaves his loyal friend Bumblebee, parents and girlfriend (Megan Fox) to go to college. (Once again Fox displays a lack of acting ability, but I think we will forgive her for that). Sam discovers a remaining piece of the Allspark, which imprints a map onto his mind (seriously!) to a device which can destroy our Sun. With the resurrection of Megatron, and the return of his scheming master The Fallen, Sam is suddenly in high demand, with everyone wanting his mind. Sam goes globetrotting with a century old Deception, his sleazy college room-mate (they never seem to ask him what he is doing with them!), and other friends from the last movie. To make things worse, Sam's ever embarrassing parents are captured by the Decepticons (a very strange, and seemingly unnecessary sub-plot). This messy storyline turns into a mission to save the Earth, so Sam must save the day.Does that seem a lot of information for a Michael Bay film? Well, that is because it is a lot. It is too long at two and a half hours, something I noticed clearly with the high proportion of people needing to nip out to the toilet. There is a fabulous scene in forestry where Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) fights off multiple Decepticons, which could probably have served as the end of the movie. Instead, it is dragged out for another hour or so, leaving the audience a bit tired and, I have to say, the excitement of seeing crazily complicated fights between robots has waned. There is also a distinct feeling that Bay simply has a craving for Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson walking in slow motion, as except for these cool shots there was no other reason for them in this film. Ultimately, what can a sharp shooting soldier really do against killer machines that turn into very cool cars? We even get a strange few lines from an English soldier whose accent is as strong as the robots themselves. There is not a similar feeling of worthlessness to John Turturro's return as Agent Simmons, now living at a deli with his mother. Turturro actually rescues the film when interest begins to fade, and lifts it to the climax at the end.Despite Turturro's injection of humour and interest, Revenge of the Fallen cannot hide from the fact that it has a very, very similar plot to that of the first movie. Both end up with similar scenes, Sam running to stop the Decepticons from using a machine (the Allspark before, and now the Matrix) to destroy the world. Part of the reason these films are just SO insanely stupid is the fact that the villains are too one dimensional, with seemingly very little reason to destroy the earth other than their hatred of the Autobots (does that make sense?). Some may say this film was just too ridiculous. I thought that for a while. But then I thought, is it any more ridiculous than a small man with hairy feet trying to destroy a ring, or Bruce Willis saving the world from an asteroid? Transformers 2 has some comic moments, some exciting moments and even some sad moments, but not enough of these pockets of quality to fill the two and a half hour run-time. It is a fun action romp, but be prepared! For full enjoyment be willing to turn off all, and I mean ALL ounce of common sense!7/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is a tough movie to review. It's bound to make a ton of money even though the professional critics pretty much hated it. Who's wrong? the public who pays to see it and liked it or the critics? If I don't like it, am I being snobbish and expecting too much of a summer popcorn blockbuster? I liked the first movie way more than I expected, it was fun, spectacular, exciting and the robots were cool. The second movie left me numb and perplexed. It starts well enough with a thrilling action sequence (where you do have trouble identifying who are the good and bad guys, a recurring problem) followed by a relaxed scene showing the funny returning parents (love the mother) and the upcoming trip to college by Sam (played by Shia Labeouf who does a very good job as usual). At that point, the movie still felt right.I'm not sure how a rather simple plot became confusing. I also had trouble caring about the fate of the characters. Since I'm not particularly dumb and tend to enjoy more complex films, I'll attribute this to bad storytelling. There's even a big deus ex machina for good measure, sign of the lazy writer. The film is also blatantly commercial and excels into making American military look heroic so if those things bug you, steer clear. On one hand, the visual effects are awesome, on the other hand the writing sucks and the dialog is trite. The actions scenes are spectacular but very busy and too often you have trouble identifying the fighting robots. The robots have virtually no characterization and often go unnamed. The exceptions would be Bumblebee but only at the start, the little twin cars who are not only annoying but hard to understand, an older bearded robot seen later on and a tiny hyperactive radio-controlled monster truck. There's a huge variety of Transformers, they look amazing and their transformations are even better than the first film but how I wish they had at least some of the minimal characterizations of the TV shows. Is that too much to ask? The music is appropriately bombastic or heroic. The sound effects are loud and powerful. Yet the sound mix is sometimes bad, drowning out the voices. The director Michael Bay is quite good at making visually impressive set pieces and money shots (he loves his slow-motion) yet he falters in other ways. The movie logs in at around 2 hours and a half. It started feeling long mid-way through. The old returning characters are still the best, the new ones, either human or robotic, are lackluster. It's certainly not as good as the first film, which to be fair, had the novelty factor going for it. The human parts are not as clever or engaging. There's more robots but keeping track is confusing and it's almost too much of a good thing. The sequel has more of everything except storyline, human touch and charm. If you liked the first, you'll likely be curious to see the sequel, if you haven't done already, but I wouldn't pay full price for it. If you're a male who loves hot babes, hot rods/robots, cool action and lots of explosions, you're going to love this. I was disappointed but not as much as the critics said I should be.Rating: 5.5 out of 10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

And he hasn't progressed far since. His teaming up with Spielberg only further exaggerates the film's ridiculous effects. The first movie... okay. It had half a story line and was somewhat charming and easy to follow. Sadly, the the title to this film does not do the film any justice. Aside from the two candy-tart girls who brought the sex appeal, this movie is filled to the brim with ethnic stereotypes, cheap-shock humour, unbelievable events, and most of all, too many robots smashing into one another. You can make a brilliant film for $40 million or less, so why waste so much on this failure? Some might say that the story couldn't be handled any other way, and that if you don't want to see action and be entertained, then don't go and see it. It's just a shame that movies with thrilling plots and characters and real issues seem to be pushed aside and collect dust, while mindless robots trudge into the theatre in an orderly fashion to be 'entertained'.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

This film holds a proud place next to ""The Wild Wild West"" and ""Van Helsing"". The reality is that Michael Bay does not care about Transformers fans or ANY fans for that matter. Bay never took nor wanted to take the Transformers property seriously. It was Steven Spielberg who had kept Bay on a tight leash for the first Transformers and that's why the original movie is a decent film.TF: Revenge of the Fallen is a relentless mess of childish comic relief, horrible characters, and the worst writing in Hollywood history. And did I mention the jokes? Oh yes the jokes!! Sex jokes, pot jokes, fart jokes, penis jokes, ghetto robots, more fart jokes, and John Turturro..Nuff said. I swear this movie is so bad; it's almost as if Michael Bay was trying to purposely mock his own audience. Bay never liked Transformers, so now he has spent 2 ½ hours making the audience suffer for liking a franchise that he considers stupid and juvenile. It's amazing really Sure, Transformers is based on a children's toy line, but it didn't have to be like this. We could have had a quality adaptation that was on par with Star Wars or Harry Potter. But instead we get a big pile of garbage from a man who is such an ignorant film maker and some of the worst writers in history. .Shame on Michael Bay and his terrible team of Hollywood hacks","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

I mean you think with a name like transformers revenge of the fallen that your going to get the shawshank redemption? No of course its going to be cheesy. Some people need to let up on this site and stop nit picking the **** out of every film they see. Enjoy it for what it is. Anyways this movie is freaking amazing. The special effects, the adventure, the war scenes. They were all done perfect, and props to Michael Bay too bad he has to deal with people who don't know a good movie when they see one. Positives: 1. The Action was incredible, major improvement from the first film. 2. Megan Fox..... 3. This movie had more of adventure theme in it, it's hard to say how without spoilers but, trust me its cool. 4. More Transforms and more actions scenes in different settings. It was a treat for the eyes. Negative: 1. WAY to long 2. It should have focused on the original autobots from the first film but it was focusing on two new robots 3. Not enough megan fox aha :P All in all its a great film. The movie to see this summer. Normally i would give it a 7 or an 8 but al the negativity caused me to give it a higher rating.

What happened to movies with a story, that created suspense, that had action and adventure that was fun? I love a good Hollywood blockbuster but thanks to overuse of computer generated effects, clichés, mindless scripts, clichés, paper thin characters, clichés...well it's gotten boring and predictable beyond a joke. I was praying for this movie to end. The transformers are not fun, they're not even cartoonish, they're just stupid. I did not care for any of these characters. The only one that came close was John Turturro's, at least he was funny. And the use of slow motion action just prolonged the agony. I wanted the terminators to enter and wipe them all out. At least wipe out the parents, surely there was enough bullet fire to get Shia's mum in the forehead, she should have been the first to go. The action scenes are not enjoyable as you can't see what is going on as the lens was not wide enough. Just a mish-mash of computer generated robot body parts filling the screen with ample sound effects. Please Mr Hollywood, make movies that are great again and stop this pointless dribble. Sadly we learnt last year that you can't revisit the great days of Indiana Jones because of stupid stories and pointless plots, and now they're talking Indy 5 ... noooooooooooooooo!

Now replace toy cars with real cars and real explosions. That's basically Transformers 2. Also, the cars punch each other in the face and shoot rockets.Transformers 2 is a movie made by boys, made for boys. And as that, it's great fun. As an achievement in storytelling, you should rate it much, much lower. The script could have been written by a 9-year-old. What little there is to act as story makes little to no sense and sometimes comes out of nowhere. If Michael Bay wanted to create a cinematic masterpiece, he failed. What he did achieve though is a boy's dream of an action movie. Go see it if you can ignore the plot and enjoy the action for its own sake, otherwise don't.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It has everything: Explosions! Robots fighting robots (and they're robots in disguise)! Cool cars! Hot chicks! Numerous jokes about testicles! Unfortunately, I'm not in this demographic and found ""Transformers 2"" to be probably the worst movie I've seen in years. From horrible, clichéd writing to confusing special effects to incessant explosions, this movie was 2 ½ hours of noise, blunder and bluster. I enjoyed the first movie, mostly due to the charisma of Shia Lebouf, as Sam Witwicky, and the over-the- top-performance of John Turturro as Agent Simmons. In addition, Megan Fox was exactly as her surname implies and the action was impressive, although a bit hard to follow. Michael Bay and the script writers clearly believe that more is better and throw so much at the audience in the sequel that the only outcome is vomit-inducing nausea, confusion and unintentional hilarity. The story bounces around constantly and throws in pointless snippets, such as when Mrs. Witwicky eats marijuana-laced brownies while visiting Sam (Shia Lebouf) at college. This serves no purpose whatsoever other than for cheap, juvenile laughs. Another glaring example is when Sam escapes the clutches of a cute, anorexic freshman who turns out to be a Decepticon. After Sam eludes her once, she completely drops out of the story. If the evil robots could appear as humans, wouldn't they have taken over the world by now? Taking a cue from George Lucas and Jar Jar Binks, this movie introduces several new, highly irritating and completely extraneous characters, such as Sam's roommate Leo Spitz or new Transfomers, ""The Twins."" The latter are stereotypes of the worst kind and are clearly based on an icon of self-parody, Flavor Flav. I'm just surprised they weren't called Step and Fetch It! Probably the main reason I hated this film though is due to its cost. With a budget higher than what the state of Wyoming spends in a fiscal year, this movie attempts to make up for logic and smarts with juvenile humor, special effects and military hardware. I guess if you can't convince them with intelligence, confuse them with BS! Finally, does anyone else think the character of General Morshower (ironically played by Glenn Morshower) looks like comedian Jim Gaffigan? I couldn't stop giggling every time the General appeared on-screen. How apropos for this movie.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

Sad moment, sad music; Happy moment, happy music; Military deciding to go into battle against the Decepticons, military deciding to go into battle against the Decepticons music.

For sure, it was better than the first one, but I still can't stand Michael Bay's style. Mainly, his constant comic reliefs bug the hell out of me.In this review, I vaguely talk about the plot of the movie. It's not in depth at all, but if you don't want to hear anything before you see it, don't read.There's a bit of duality about my personality that conflicts me on this movie. On the one hand, I'm a techie electrical engineer (in training) who loves robots. Therefore, seeing big robots duke it out on screen is pretty enjoyable. On the other hand, there is the critical, contemplative side of me that enjoys movies with a lot of substance beyond explosions and mayhem. As such, I really enjoyed most of the fight scenes. However, the acting was all pretty much sub-par to par, and you never really get attached to any of the human characters. Optimus was probably the most emotionally convincing character in this movie, and he's completely CG! One thing that really bugged me was the disposition of the decepticons. The decepticons' story doesn't really fit how they behave. They're searching for something all transformers need, but they're willing to destroy life while trying to get it. Does that make them bad? Sure. However, it seems to me that they wouldn't actively revel in the destruction of that life. To put it in D&D terms (LOL), the decepticons' story should make them neutral-evil, while they act like chaotic-evil.Michael Bay likes to center his movies around a small group of protagonists against a large number of mostly faceless foes (except for 1 or 2 main bad guys). I think he chose the wrong group to center the movie around. Both transformers movies so far have pretty much revolved around Shia La Boeuf and his unarguably foxy companion Megan Fox (No surprise here that her first appearance on screen is more or less an upskirt shot). But this is Transformers! I don't care that this little dweeb is having girlfriend problems, I want to hear about the autobots and their problems. I'd like to see their characters developed more.As for the rating, they crammed in about as much ""light"" profanity as they could, while keeping it PG-13 level. You won't see any body parts flying around (aside from those of nonorganics), despite the explosions they so frequently stand on top of. I would've preferred a darker, more gritty rated R version, but I'm sure that wouldn't be nearly as profitable.As for the IMAX quality, before the movie was shot, an announcer came on and described the difference between the IMAX and 35mm versions. For most of the movie, the original aspect ratio (16:9 or something) is displayed (just much bigger than a regular theater). However, for certain scenes, the movie was shot with IMAX film, and IMAX viewers get to see some content that was not in the 35mm version. In these scenes, the entire IMAX screen was filled. I tried to notice when this happened, but I only caught 2 scenes. First was when optimus is fighting the decepticons in the woods. Second is the scene that really SUCKED (lots of SUCKING). If you've seen the movie, you should know which one I'm talking about.As I see it, there are 2 kinds of people in this world. There is the critical minority, which I belong to. Then there is the more receptive general public. 95% of the time, movies are made for the general public. Every now and then, a movie (such as The Dark Knight) comes along that can satisfy both parties. I would say that this movie is not quite one of them. It could have been, had Michael Bay not directed it. (On that note, 100% of Michael Bay's movies are made for the general public) For the TLDRers out there, I give this movie a 7.4/10.Jason","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Let me begin in a top-ten list format to quickly express my gripes: 1.First, the movie was too long, clocking in at 150min: Basically depending on how far you commute to your local theater, you are wasting an estimated +3hr on this mediocre, brainless summer flick.2.Second the plot, or lack thereof: Yes there was a plot and yes it was BARELY enough to keep this fireworks show of silly action scenes moving forward. The movie is all mindless action, no character interaction or simple character building. Only what is necessary to move the action scenes forward.3.Excessive Product placement anyone? Are transformers limited to GM products only? Why did we need to hear that Sam's parents are insured by Allstate? 4. Once the first Transformers was announced, EVERYONE suddenly expressed they were Die-hard Transformers fans and that they had been fans since a very young age, much like when superman,spider-man,xmen, hell-boy,fantastic 4, and both In.Hulks were announced: they are probably lying and are failing at pretending they are ""cool"" 5. Most die hard Transformers fans, like myself, hate this movie. However most people looking for a simple action movie DID enjoy it.6.Megan Fox-Very attractive don't get me wrong, but she couldn't act herself out of an episode of Blue's Clues. Ill sacrifice a nice pair of legs and pretty face for an actress that can do other things then bend over in front of the camera.7.Why did Dreamworks approve a second Transformers? Because the simple fact that: it makes bank. The movie is mindless spending and random effects and explosions trying to shield a bad script and bad plot.8.The non-funny ""unneeded"" transformers: They are not funny, nor did they contribute to the story progression whatsoever.9.CGI: The action scenes are too detailed and hectic for the average human to fully appreciate in one viewing, thus most action scenes are ""too"" gorgeous, and I say that meaning that the illusion that the movie aims to create with CGI is way overdone, and it feels like you are playing a really detailed computer game rather than the adrenaline filled film it could have been.10. The under use of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. It seems to me that these two were put in the movie ONLY to boast about, and NOT to have any significant role in the progression of the film. The movie changes NONE if Tyrese had not been in it, heck all he says is a smart comment like ""we're about to get our asses whooped!"" or the movie changing quote of ""that guy is an asshole!"". You really should wonder if those making this movie are insulting your intelligence?","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

There isn't a single scene she is in where she is not portrayed as a sex object. She doesn't actually act. She just poses. I don't think the effects people were even satisfied with her natural charms. I am pretty sure they enhanced her using the same effects they used to simulate robots and explosions. Her lips are absolutely dripping wet all through the movie—like they added a coat of Vaseline between each shot.

This time around Sam is attending college but a piece of the Allspark got caught on his shirt and the piece that was ""hidden"" has been stolen.All the key people have returned to reprise their roles. The developing relationship between Mikaela and Sam is romantic and funny, with the ability for any couple to relate to what their going through - despite the alien robotic race.Action scenes are stuffed with loads of special effects and new robots are introduced. Story-wise it sticks to the comics/TV show and stays loyal to it's large fan base.Ending felt contrived and seemed to lack a certain feeling I can't pinpoint. I found myself kinda asking ""is this over yet?"" few times and checking the time left.It's rare for me to find a sequel that is better than the original, but it can happen. This isn't one of those times, because the original is still better between the two films. However, it's not a bad film. Far from it. It's entertaining, it's fun and it's hilarious. But I won't be watching Revenge of the Fallen quite as much as I will watch the first film.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

This was because of two factors: 1) I am an avid fan of the 80's TV show and, a result of this, watching it on the bigger screen was like being a kid again. Especially with Peter Cullen being the voice of Optimus Prime once more. I have to say that whilst the 1986 Transformers movie was much more faithful to the show, the 2007 movie did a damn good job of presenting the concept to a modern audience. I enjoyed the design of the robots (despite HUGE product placement from Chevrolet and Chrysler.) and overall the concept was clever enough and to top it off, it had a kick-ass soundtrack.2) This conditions in which I saw the sequel. It was a perfect summer movie. I saw this film during the day, and then spent the rest of the day partying. It was perfect. Giant robots beating the sh*t out of each other. Could it get any more simpler? To those who criticise the film for having a vague plot, well did you ever watch the 80's TV show? That had no plot what so ever. It was dumb, loud and colourful (aside from the Decepticons). In other words, perfect for it's target audience. It was the same for this film. It provided a basic set of rules for people to follow. Good and bad robots. Fight. Explosion. Done. $800 million big ones.One common complaint about this film is that it is a typical 'Michael Bay' movie. By this I mean it has all the classic trademarks, poor direction, explosions (oh so many explosions) weak plot lines and poor character development. Although this is a valid complaint, I felt it worked for this movie. Bravo for putting Transformers in the hands of the most crazy director in Hollywood. Having so many explosions and action scenes mean that I was never bored. And those moments when there was no action. Bay throws in Miss Fox to entertain the male half of the audience.Although it may seem stupid and insulting to women. It is important to note that Michael Bay clearly knows his audience and so panders to them. He knew that the average summer movie goer wants to see some action, listen to some awesome music (provided by Linkin Park) and watch Megan Fox fixing motorcycles whilst bent over. I have to say that for 90% of the time men are respectful to women. But when your watching a film for escapism you just want to no be judged for thinking a certain way, you enjoy being free of judgement.In conclusion, you can either love or hate this film. Love it if your in the right mindset and like simply being entertained. Or you can complain. Pick this movie to death because it that's truly what you want to do. In the time you do that, I'll watch Transformers 2 and love all the way through.8/10","28 out of 45 found this helpful.

Michael Bay seems obsessed with making each film 'bigger' than his last, and it feels like REVENGE OF THE FALLEN attempts to cram in twice as much stuff as in the first film. There's military stuff, with soldiers and helicopters, there's globe-trotting adventure stuff, and, of course, there's a great deal of massive robots beating the hell out of each other.Despite the massive budget and the copious amounts of on-screen destruction, this is a dull film and you feel every minute tick by as you watch it play out. That's because the human story is awful. Mr Devoid-of-charisma himself, Shia LaBeouf, is back and entertaining nobody with his tired 'college kid' schtick: whether he's running away from explosions, screaming like a girl or engaging in supposed comic routines with his extremely irritating mother, he sucks energy from this movie. The supporting cast are also vapid, none more so than blow-up doll lookalike Megan Fox.Now, as a kid I used to enjoy playing with transformers toys. I admit, the thought of watching massive robots fighting each other does sound fun, in the way the goofy old kaiju movies with Godzilla battling King Kong and the like are still enjoyable even today. I'll admit that the CGI effects in this movie are excellent – you never question the destruction for a second. But even watching transformers fight gets boring, especially when the movie starts with a full blown climatic battle (ever heard of build-up, Bay?), features tons of samey action, and ends with a pitched battle that lasts for around an hour. Too much of the fighting just consists of blurry close-ups, these robots are so big, and I wish Bay had taken more effort to bring his camera back a bit and keep it still for a while. He doesn't, and the film exemplifies all that's wrong with Hollywood blockbusters as a result, even if it is superficially entertaining in places.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was really impressed with the first one, so it was hard not to have high expectations for Michael Bay's second installment. I heard certain complaints about the plot, but I find it somewhat interesting as it uses different time periods and introduces some new characters. As the title indicates, the story involves the Decepticons gathering up their forces for another epic battle. I don't want to say too much just in case you haven't seen either of the two movies. As would be expected, the first one should be viewed before seeing this one to get the full effect of the story, but the sequel actually stands quite well on its own. There's an equal blend of comedy and action, but the humor was hit-and-miss to me. The first few minutes were downright hilarious thanks to Kevin Dunn and Julie White (the parents), but later on the humor relies on corny, low-brow jokes and visuals which makes me groan more than laugh. I much prefer the slight dramatic touch of the first movie that this one lacks. While I'm nitpicking, I'll point out that the cinematography during the action scenes are a bit blurry and seem to be too close-up, which is a problem I see in most action movies to be honest. Also, it feels like all sense of scale was abandoned. How does a small sports car like a Camaro become four stories tall and appear to weigh 20 tons just because it transformed into robot form? Oh well, like I said, that's nitpicking the little stuff. Even though this film does not quite blow me away like I had hoped, it is a strong, entertaining movie, especially for a sequel. The props are outstanding, with the amazingly cool Chevrolet vehicles, fighter jets, etc. Plus, what's more awesome than a semi truck personified? The sound effects are well done, but this is an action movie after all. Shia LaBeouf has always made me laugh since his days on ""Even Stevens"" and there has never been a more aptly named actress than Megan Fox. As far as the soundtrack goes, I've been really impressed with the Linkin Park songs for the ending credits on both films; they just seem to fit. Despite its long length, the movie flows quite well and makes for a good watch.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

For some reason, it opened in London before most of the rest of the world. Wow, this was probably the dullest, most stupid and irritating film I've seen in a long time. Like watching paint dry, while being punched in the face at the same time. Transformers as characters are dull visually, so I'm not sure why they would have made a good movie in the first place. The plot ends up being some symbol-driven Indian Jones quest for something that makes no sense, as does most of the film, which means there's consistency, but not a fun film, at all.There's the stock shouty sidekick character, a lot of boring explosions and endless minutes of over-sized robots knocking the crap out of each other, which, without any characterisation or plot development is just an exercise in sitting with very expensive computers and having a lot of money to make these things visually interesting, which given the results means that isolating yourself from the screenplay and the rest of the movie, gives the money a fractured feel- between the non-existent plot and the explosion pornography.If any of it made sense, then the payoff would be somewhat compelling, but this film insults its audience. Nothing wrong with dumb Summer movie, but not so quite stupid and annoying and boring would have helped. Especially, as they added two Transformers that have obviously being hanging around gangs in the ghetto, because they speak so ""street"". Jar Jar Binks, all is forgiven.The set pieces are boring too, especially as they're made in isolation to any hint of a plot that engages or makes sense. At 150 minutes, it's at least an hour overlong. People may say, ""well, what did you expect?"". True, I wasn't expecting great things, but, in contrast, I didn't expect something so stupidly dull. I'm sure it'll clear up at the box office, but I'll be looking for Michael Mann's new movie to re-engage my cinematic taste buds. I'm not a film snob, but ""Transformers 2"" upset my sensibilities and didn't entertain. I'm sure it'll make a bundle... which is a pretty sad state of affairs for movies for the future.","12 out of 30 found this helpful.

Well, the same can be said of Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, except for the fact that almost nothing works in this film like it does in the first.Megan Fox is exploited more, there's more sex humor that's supposed to make us giggle, there are annoying robots that fist bump and act like offensive black stereotypes from ten years ago as if a KKK member wrote the script, there are robots that act and sound like gremlins, there are pointless characters that are there only to shout out terrible one liners, there are random explosions (see: aircraft carrier exploding for ten minutes in unconvincing CGI) there are even giant testicles on one of the Transformers and these are described as ""the enemy scrotum."" That's a direct quote. It's mildly funny in an immature, tongue in cheek kind of way, but it makes a mockery of the Transformers franchise, and that's how most of the film comes off.We spend the majority of the film following Shia Labeouf and the US military around while they search for, guess what, another mysterious source of power that the Decepticons want. But let's face it, if you want to see this movie, you're not seeing it for plot, you're seeing it for the explosions, basically the eye candy. I can understand that, but the problem is that 75% of the movie is flat-out annoying.The slapstick humor is too over the top and a lot of the jokes are out of place. There's even a scene in which Shia's mom eats a pot browny and tackles a college student playing frisbee. The point? There isn't one. It's one of the things that hampers this film throughout and it all stems from an incredibly sloppy script. The tone is disjointed and it often can't figure out if it's supposed to be an intense action movie or a fratboy's film made for his twelve year old brother who still thinks fart jokes are hilarious. (There are at least two obvious fart jokes, probably more).The robots look good in most scenes, but the effects are strangely not up to par with the first film at times. It seemed sometimes like the effects team had a hard time keeping the framerate right during the big robot fighting scenes. It's not a big problem, because it's gorgeous for the most part, but there are really only two glorious fight scenes and they're very far apart in this two and a half hour film that could have been cut in half if the writers knew what they were doing.This is definitely one of those films that you either love or hate, and it's all going to bank on whether or not you can sit through the annoying over-the-top humor to get to the effects. Syd Field described movies like this as ""characters running from special effects"" so that the effects become the plot and character loses out. He's right on, but the biggest problem here is, as I've already said, the annoying humor and the sometimes cutesy cartoonish robots that don't really have any place tonally or plot-wise. I guess the humor is supposed to somehow hold the film together, but it doesn't even come close.The script needed an overhaul, but it obviously never got one, and it all feels very thrown together and unpolished for the sake of cash. My advise is, if you LOVED the first movie, rent this one, because there's not enough here to redeem the flaws. The only robots from the first movie are Optimus Prime (who barely has any screen time) and Bumblebee (who spends most of his time in the background as a car), so you can't even rely on an expansion of those characters. The only other positive thing I have to say about this film is we really get to see how much of a serious threat the Decepticons are. The good guys are always outnumbered, and the Autobots are essentially absent, which is strange since it's supposed to be a war of robots vs. robots, not humans vs. Decepticons. But it does make the war seem desperate, even if it makes the Autobots seem relatively useless without Optimus around to ninja-slash his way through anyone in his way.3/10. Again, rent this one or see it in a dollar theater when you can. There are better turn- your-brain-off movies out there right now with their own flaws that you don't have to put up with for two and a half painful hours.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

A lot of reviewers are griping about Megan Fox's weak acting but I didn't go into the movie expecting Oscar-worthy performances. I came into this one expecting to be entertained.The Special Effects in this one are mind-blowing. When I left the theater I was still in awe on how long we have come in the movie World with visual effects. I just think about the geniuses that it takes to put a movie like this together.I also enjoyed the comedy in the movie. John Turturro was a perfect addition to the movie and he was funny every step of the way. I like the twin robots speaking like some Mid-90s hip-hip MC's. The parents are hilarious too.I am giving this movie a 9/10.

Did that happen? Well, in part yes. What I liked about the movie is the basic fable of it. However the way the movie was shoot leaves it way behind the original Transformers. Here's what I did not like: - too much robots, making everything look like a huge mess - too big robots - too fast action sequences, which look like a bunch of robots squezed together, like a giant robot taking whole screen; which make you wonder: ""what has just happened?!"" - too complex robots, that won't allow me to grasp the ""coolness"" - soulless new robot characters (eg: the twins, new guy, etc) - areas that should've been left alone (eg: cyborgs) - flat humorAll in all, the movie is mediocre. Don't mix is with bad, because it's not. It simply lacks ""soul"", lacks the warmth of the first part, lacks the nobility, the greatness. It's hard to describe a movie without a soul, you just feel that it's not there.It's worth going to the movies to see, but that's about it. And to Mr. Bay I got this to say: don't try to capitalise on the success of the original Transformers, because a sequel doesn't have to follow the ""same times 2"" formula. Make the 3rd Transformers it's own movie, don't repeat, don't rush, don't multiply robots. Less is more.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' was just a plain, horrid mess.I have to give it kudos for its homage only to the 2007 movie: continual product placement, enormously bad and juvenile humor and robot battle scenes where you can't tell the good from the bad. The best they did to improve was voiding Sam's (LaBeouf) insistent need to repeat the same word 7x, such as ""no,no,no,no,no,no,no""I had extremely low expectations for this movie after (the insult to the original source material) 2007's version, so I figured I might actually like it. And it wasn't 100% bad: some battle scenes were good and I've seen worse, but yeah it was trash, all the same. As for some people/critics ripping on the ""racial"" stereotypes, I have one comment: they weren't bad due to the bigotry, they were bad because they were simply horribly created (CGI,) had awful lines and too 'Jar-Jar'ish. That should be insult to any race, creed or human enough.We're given absolutely no script, no direction, scenes that are completely incoherent from the previous, painful dialogue and so-called ""touching"" scenes, flat-out lies (it is told that multiple Autobots came to Earth, yet, there's probably a grand total of 6 on Earth, not much more from the 2007 version,) comical acting – trust me, I was laughing out loud when we're supposed to believe Mikaela (Megan) was scared, clichés from here to Cybertron, enough swearing and partial (male) nudity for an R-rating and roughly 45 minutes that could've been easily cut – the movie went on longer than it took Frodo to ditch the ring.You'd think with all the dumbed down gags it was meant for the younger, naïve crowd, but they up'd the ante from 2007's masturbation-talk scene to include numerous sexual references (robodog humping Mikaela) and even roboballs. Those and all other jokes fall flat and make me wish I was 4 again so I could've enjoyed it.Weakly, they reintroduce Sam by a fragment of the All-Spark and now a resurrected Megatron needs it to, oh, I can't remember (or care) why and I just watched it. Bay just made the movie to sell toys, cars and Mt. Dew and show beautiful young women, big robots and explosions.

I'd rather watch Spider-Man 2 than anything from Fellini any day of the week. I can certainly tolerate high concept, big budget action movies. I can even appreciate the occasional need for mindless entertainment with little substance - I gladly paid for, and enjoyed, 300 even though it wasn't a quality film. It was entertaining while lacking substance. But there's a difference between a little bit of substance and none at all. And Transformers 2 isn't 300.There's nothing wrong with paying to see Transformers 2, since I understand that it's a tent pole film of the summer and everyone's buzzing about it and, let's face it, if you're gonna see a movie like this, it should be in the theater. But if you enjoyed Transformers 2, you should be ashamed of yourself. This is not hyperbole. Transformers 2 is not only a horrible movie, but one that's actually insulting to intelligent people and made me feel worse off having watched it than I was before. And how is a movie like this received? Why, with thunderous applause and laughter, of course.If you need to have it explained to you why Transformers 2 is bad, go read any critic's review of it - it's not difficult to figure out why. But the critics don't represent the masses. Every joke in Transformers 2 is either corny, stupid, lewd for the sake of being lewd (robots yelling expletives is not a punchline), or all three. Yet the audience laughed at them. The action scenes are overly congested and, despite looking flashy, have very little going on. Yet the audience stared at them in awe. The drama is forced and canned, the characters are blank slates, Shia Lebouf is a mediocre actor at best who brings nothing to the table, there are mile-long pieces of plot exposition that should put everyone to sleep and need to be broken up, every woman is drop-dead gorgeous and talks like they came out out of a late-night phone dating ad, and yet...Michael Bay will make millions and millions of dollars for this sorry excuse for entertainment and will be allowed to continue to make movies. And I'll have to hear from people for years how ""awesome"" Transformers 2 was. These are the same people who eagerly wait to hear what Dane Cook has to say. These are the people who turn on the TV and watch Family Guy for their comedy and House for their drama.There were, at best, two genuine moments in the entire bloated 2 1/2 hours of this film (Optimus Prime's big scene in the middle and possibly Shia Lebouf's moment near the end). Couldn't we, if nothing else, just get 2 hours of robots punching each other? I would have been content with that. I especially feel sorry for people who were fans of Transformers prior to the movies. There's nothing that says that the franchise requires Shia Lebouf and moronic story lines - that's just something they added in. Those poor fans will never get a decent live action flick.This is why the terrorists hate us, folks. Because this is what we do with our freedom. We applaud movies like Transformers 2. I spent my last 13 bucks on it and feel genuinely sick because of it. I've heard a great deal of debate as to whether or not it's okay to give the people what they want or not. This is pure proof that it's not. Because ""the people"" want explosions, cars, and no plot or substance, assuming it's covered up with hot chicks, of course. The people who also say no in response to this question usually cite Nazi Germany, in which what the people wanted was clearly wrong. It's a bit of a leap, but replace excessive violence and genocide with stupidity and you've got the same idea. Ever see Blade Runner? That's the junk culture that our society is heading toward. It's very rare that I play the ""someone think of the children"" card, but there were a lot of little kids in that theater. If this is what they're watching, not just in terms of the violence/vulgarity of it, but also in terms of the stupidity, what's the next generation gonna be like? I'm a film major and I just watched my art form get defecated on. I need to go watch Cuckoo's Nest or Raging Bull or something as a metaphorical shower. Seriously, last summer, Christopher Nolan released the Dark Knight, showing that blockbuster movies could be intelligent and rich in subtext, while still being adrenaline pumping. How could he have raised the bar so high and yet trash like Transformers 2 is still considered acceptable? I don't want to be on this planet anymore with people that enjoy Transformers 2. If there were an alternative option to Earth, I'd take it.Unless I see a Decepticon there. For those who have yet to see Transformers 2, I urge you to resist and not pay to see it. I won't judge you if you do, though. I will, however, if you enjoy it. If it weren't for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Fantastic Four 2: Rise of the Silver Surfer, I'd say Transformers 2 is the worst movie I've ever seen. Go enjoy your millions, Michael Bay, and hope there's not a film hell awaiting you in the afterlife.I saw a trailer for 2012 prior to this that suggested the world would end that year. Here's hoping there's something to that.Oh, and Megan Fox is so hot, it hurts. But that's not a good reason to enjoy Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

The length 2 and a half hours have tons of action and the battles really pull you into the movie. The comedies also acceptable, at least the whole cinema laughed when they're shown.

Explosions are there because they all are using weapons!!There are some weaknesses as well, nothing is perfect anyway. Some characters are being different compared to the previous. Some parts of the movie are weird without clear explanation of their background. The battles are fast paced and hard to differ between Autobots and Decepticons.

You must be taught to appreciate Shakespeare.To a film viewer entering an imax theater for a sold out show to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, much like going to see Hamlet in the Park, you are stepping into a period piece. If you did not grow up listening to Run DMC and the Beastie Boys, and watching Transformers and Voltron on Saturday mornings, the experience will feel like two-and-a-half hours of nonsequiturs over-wrought by a cacophony of metallic crashes, and dialects that would make Buckwheat frown with embarrassment.But this is a period piece, and to the children of baby boomers and hippies -- and more specifically the children raised by Bugs Bunny slapstick and a sense of ethics born out of the age old battles of Heman and Skeletor -- there is real grace here. If you don't know the difference between Space Ghost and Moltar, or Gloop and Gleep, then it is a grace you might never see.Film in a large way is meant to be ... at least eccentric, and not a far leap from esoteric. It should be a goal of a film maker to bring light to things that people might miss. Why else would we praise film makers like Fassbinder and Herzog? This noted, Transformers IS dumb. I'll be the first to admit that. But the script by Kurtzman and Orci, and the banter as it's executed by Lebouf, Fox, and Duhamel carry the story as though it had always been a part of the series -- much in the same way the Star Trek revival carried the character of the original series.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

While the first ""Transformers"" at least delivered some intentional entertainment, this one was more of a Gangland (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265198/) experience. Plot? Well... basically none, but they put some pyramids in it in the end, maybe to make it look mystical or to find a connection to the desert stuff from the first movie. The whole storyline develops around cuts between ultimate-hardcore robot-fights and some body shots on Megan Fox - which really would be sufficient for a lovely evening, but somehow it just doesn't work this time... maybe because everything's just toooooooo chaotic. Like attending a meeting of a dadaist work group without being invited or having an idea what dadaism means. You are guided through an hectic and unsteady series of fights, without any climax at all. Maybe it's really just to much action for a movie of that length, but even the end-fight failed to stand out or deliver - just another fight in a row. Acting was... decent. Shia LaBeouf will never become my favorite after what he did to Indie. The role of Megan Fox was stripped down to look good and to ask Shia LaBeouf whether he loves her. The Parents? Ridiculous. Everybody else can be sure not to win the Oscar for best supporting role neither. Let's get to the positive aspects: visual artists did a wonderful job, as did the sound artists. All of the Post-Production should be awarded and guaranteed that they never ever have to work for Micheal Bay again.

I was surprised in the first 30 minutes that this movie was such a blast, a vast improvement over the original. A thinker of a story, comedy where action was at a null. The trailers are a bit misleading to this movie, they almost give off ""creature awaken from a thousand year old sleep vibe"" but totally goew off a different direction. Toward the end I was actually questioning how the end woud turn out.

Just... wow. The action in this movie is amazing. The plot for the most part stood on it's own, but let's be honest: you're here to see robots kick the crap out of each other. Transformers 2 delivers this by the truckload (no pun intended.) The fight scenes were incredible, to the point where I turned to my girlfriend at least 20 times to say ""This is badass!"" The action was nothing short of breathtaking, and I love the fact that the Autobots could actually hold their own this time (no more 3 Autobots and the Army struggling against a single Decepticon here). However, there were a few cheesy moments, clichéd characters, lame one-liners that I felt detracted from the movie. And the ending was not satisfying at all. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that it felt too ""easy"". It felt like the writer got lazy and just wanted to finish it.Minor flaws aside, I loved this movie, and will be seeing it again, then buying the DVD and watching it again. The fight scenes were AMAZING, and for a popcorn flick it definitely hits more than it misses. See this movie!!Edit: After reading a lot of the comments and seeing the negative ones, I kind of get the feeling that a lot of people were a) expecting Transformers 2 to be the next Shawshank Redemption or b) just plain hate Michael Bay and therefore anything he does. This was SUPPOSED to be mindless and over the top. I'm not a fanboy, you're entitled to your own opinion, but when someone compares Transformers 2 to Goodfellas, it's clear that some people just love to hate this movie.","33 out of 55 found this helpful.

In the last part, it was good to see the new detailed versions of the transformers, although it was off the track from the classics, but it was descent and a good movie.The new part however is so different, it feels like the new series is going to be ruined, and won't last more than another movie (if it survived). One of the most disappointing things is the lack of transformers original character's behavior, it is becoming so American with many ""funny"" comments, especially for the Autobots, which is so different from the original characters and not good at all.As for the action, it is a good thing to have too many action, but the big problem is that you will not know who's with who! And there is a specific scene near the end where you will get totally confused, there are too many characters, many of them didn't appear in the classics, and so you have no clue who they are, and you won't know what's happening and what's the role of every character even when the fight is over!The human involvement is one of the biggest holes in the new sequel; it is supposed to be a robot war, with no involvement of humans, in the first movie it was OK, but in this one, it is not OK at all. The spotlight is for the very most of time on the human characters and their lives, to the point that makes you feel you're watching a ""human"" movie with a ""robotic"" involvement!Imagine the old series to be done in present days with the new graphics achievements, and maybe adding some very little human involvement to spice it up, would't that be wonderful? I really hope writers, producers, and directors start thinking about what people really wants not what they see people want.Conclusion; go watch the movie, it's worth to be seen, but don't watch like a classic transformer fan, just as an action movie fan 7/10 for an action movie 4/10 for a transformer movie","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Michael Bay knows better than others. This movie sets a bar on the technicality for future movies. I agree with the lack of plot and acting performance, but one should also remember that making the plot too intense would have forced Mr. Bay to divert his attention, time and money from the superb action sequences. This movie is like a good chick flick where you do not have to apply your brain except it has superb action sequences. So put your brain to rest for a while and just enjoy the human feat that has been achieved by the special effect guys. Hat's off to special effect guys. Before watching this movie, I was told that this movie is bad and I had the same perception, but it became thinner with the progress of the movie and I must say I enjoyed the entire movie. I have hard time watching a movie which is more than 2 hours long, but the storyline of this movie is fast and keeps you involved till its last frame. Movies like a transformer suffer from legacy problem, since they are derived from a cartoon series which have more than 50 episodes under their belt, and viewers have high expectations from it. Though these movies provides a great assistance in creating a plot, but at the same time also forces the director to give more importance to the theme, which in case of transformers is robots. Therefore I believe that expecting a plot like Batman or Lord of the rings will be injustice to this movie. This movie is lot better than Pirates of Caribbean (2 -3) and Spiderman (2-3). So it's a must see movie that too in a theater. One suggestion to the future viewers, do sit as far as possible from the screen, otherwise you will have hard time watching it because gigantic robotic action. It's worth the time and money I spent for the ticket.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I also did not like the moron that they turned Sam's mother into or the way that they over-sexed Megan Fox's character. The new autobots and decipticons were impressive. All of the hype about the twins is not a stereotype that white people put on blacks, but a portrayal of what many blacks have made as a recognizable as a rapper stereotype. They were comical characters. As usual, Bumblebee was great. His emotions were endearing. The scenes with the dogs were not needed. This movie could have excluded so much and it would have been a better movie.

This is the kick-ass movie you go into knowing exactly what to expect, and yet again I was anything but disappointed!!! The Autobots are just as hysterical and charismatic as in the first movie, and the deceptacons are more evil than ever.Movies like these do their job perfectly. They let you enter into a state of imagination where the impossible becomes possible and the stressful becomes enjoyable. Once again Bay's mixture of special effects and not overly used CGI meshes perfectly well together.I'd like to say thank you to Michael Bay for creating enjoyment twice in a row, something many directors can't do. I'd also like to say amazing job, in the behind the scenes sense, to such producers as Lorenzo DI Bonaventura and Mark Vahradian for helping put such a great film together.

Michael Bay's sequel to his 2007 mega-hit features Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, who this time is heading off to college leaving his girlfriend (Megan Fox) back at home. While at college Sam begins seeing cryptic symbols and soon the Decepticons are coming after him. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is an incredibly stupid, loud, obnoxious and rather worthless picture that perfectly shows what's so wrong with Hollywood today. Why on Earth would someone green light a picture like this and why on Earth would someone like Steven Spielberg not ask for a re-write of the screenplay? I understand this is a summer blockbuster so the ""story"" isn't the most important thing but what we have here has to be one of the worst written screenplays in the history of cinema and I still can't get over how someone wouldn't at least try to fix some of the various problems going on. Just take a look at how poorly written all of the human characters are. It really seems as if they're in some sort of bad sitcom because we get some of the most obnoxious scenes you're ever going to witness and what makes them so painful to watch is how unfunny they are. Take a look at the scene where Sam is getting dropped off at college and his parents embarrass him but it gets even worse when the mother eats some hash brownies and goes crazy on campus. Give me a break. Did someone in the script stages actually think this was funny? The dialogue going back and forth between the characters are just brain-numbing bad because it really does come off as if they don't know what they're talking about and just making up words and putting them together without any thought. A Bay film usually at least delivers on the action but even these scenes are rather boring here. Once again there are a lot of explosions, loud noises and of course things going boom but all of them are rather ugly and poor looking. I think it's obvious that most of the $200-million budget went towards the CGI effects but I found all of them to be quite poor, which is rather shocking considering how good they looked in the first picture. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is a really, really bad movie on all levels but how it got to the shooting stages is beyond me.","6 out of 35 found this helpful.

A film with a laughable plot, often horrid dialog, lame jokes, and that tool Shia LeBeouf should be ripped apart a la ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". However, this does what that joke couldn't do...it entertained.Let's begin by getting the obvious out of the way. The acting (at least the live action and some of the voice over) was reminiscent of an Elementary School production. The storyline was full of clichés and plot holes and meaningless subplots. Some Autobots were barely mentioned or seen and other characters that were prominently featured just seemed to disappear. The acting direction was a joke and those twins reminded me of Amos and Andy (if you get the reference, kudos).That being said, when one goes in to see a movie about giant robots fighting, you can't go in expecting something worthy of the IMDb 250. Many have insulted the defenders of this film by saying that they are ""mindless"" and ""tasteless"" and should know what a good movie is. Sure, this movie was all those, but it was good escapism. I wanted to see epic fight scenes and good explosions, because that's all I trust Bay to do. What movie of his has had ""good"" film-making involved? It's going to be bad, but it's going to be fun. If you want a thought provoking message film, you should stay away. If you want a fun, but stupid, ride, go for it. Try to enjoy a few hours of stupidity and stop over thinking things.Besides, the trailer for ""New Moon"" was more cringe worthy than this whole movie, so it could be worse.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The lack of time and/or the short script which Bay had access to may have indeed affected the production process, considering he didn't have that much to work with. Whether those were just excuses for the ""failure"" it doesn't matter. Bay had to adjust the sequel and ended up highlighting the action (as always) bits at the expense of dialogue, character's development etc. Despite Bay's critics concerning the ""mystical"" tone given to the script by the writer's IMO it was what saved the movie and ended up pulling me back to watch it more than once (something that did't happen with the third installment of the franchise).

You didn't see the whole Lord of the Rings movies in the theater they all got extended through the DVD release.

So to sum it all up; OK storyline, cut down on explosions, if you're going to take kids to see this be prepared to take whatever comes your way, and two and a half hours of explosions and a mediocre storyline shouldn't release until DVD.

Going to see Transformers for the movie quality is a bit like going to see Star Wars for the dialogue - you know that you're just going to be disappointed.Yes, the dialogue was weak. Yes, parts of the movie dragged on a bit. I personally thought that there was a distinct disconnect between the first part of the movie (Sam going to college), and the second part of the movie (action scenes). The plot itself was so/so, but in parts was drawn out so much that it got a bit tedious, and tedious and Transformers are words that do not belong in the same sentence.That being said, it was still a fabulous movie. Gorgeous special effects, even better than last time, and loads of new Transformers, which was especially fun. This movie was meant to be entertaining, and entertaining it certainly was. New characters and old characters combined with spectacular special effects were what made this movie worthwhile.So ignore the reviews that decry how terrible this movie is. If you liked the first Transformers, you will like this one. If you thought the first Transformers was swill, this will be swill as well. All in all, a good movie, a good sequel, and well worth going to see for the entertainment of it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

How ridiculous (that wasn't a ""warp"" scene either, that was after to the desert)!!! There aren't any mountains in DC you idiots or deserts with airplane graveyards. Put the icing on the crap cake with these stupid Jar Jar Binks like (with respect to humor and silliness for the kiddies), ""The Twins"", a set of Autobots that ""act a fool"" throughout the movie. They're completely annoying and pointless, they're not even funny (just like Jar Jar was retarded in Star Wars). I want to see an edited version that takes out the ads, the love scenes and the two idiot mutt and jeff robots, that would make it a decent movie! The whole movie was a waste of my $5.25 matinée money. Wait till this movie comes out on TV and you have absolutely NOTHING going on, maybe wait till you're laid up with N1-H1 (Swine Flue) to watch Transformers Revenge of the Fallen it's that lame of a duck.I hope this helps anyone wanting to watching this movie, I can't BELIEVE anybody would give this more than 1 star, it was the worst piece of garbage I've seen in years, if I think about it - EVER!

"","","The money is all up there on the screen, but not a lot else","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2091913/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2009","There is one thing that you can almost always say about the blockbuster films of Michael Bay and his ilk, and that is that the money is very clearly up there on the screen. The money is there in terms of the locations, the expensive sets, the destruction of those expensive sets and of course the many robots who do always feel like they are really ""in"" the scene with the real aspects. In terms of all this the film is impressive and if you go into the film wondering how on earth anyone could spend so much money making a two hour film then you will leave the cinema with your question answered because it is all right there.Unfortunately there is not much else there with it and indeed many of the problems with the film (and unsurprisingly there are many) cannot be addressed by simply having a lot of money in your hand to throw at it. The plot is the most immediate problem, partly because you have to keep the two human characters central to it whether it makes sense to do so or not. As a result we get a reasonable idea that is stretched too thin and loaded with convenience into a narrative that really never does anything other than provide the most basic of frames for stuff blowing up. The problem is that, because it is so contrived and basic, the viewer never really cares about the story but yet still has to sit through many clunky scenes where the characters explain to one another what is going on and why they are now going somewhere else to blow stuff up. Needless to say that the same writers struggling with this are not able to make much of the characters either. This conspires to undermine the one selling point of the film – the action. Without me caring one bit about the proceedings, the action becomes nothing more than special effects. My heartbeat never increased and my palms never got sweaty because there is no tension, danger, thrill or reason to have any emotional investment in the film whatsoever.The writing produces the most painful problem as well, which is the lame and ill-fitting attempts at comedy. While watching it I thought to myself ""Will Smith"" does this very well"" because the mixing of comedy with the action of big summer blockbusters is something he is called upon to do very often (I know it is not just him involved in making this work). However here the comedy is poor and it sits really badly alongside the action scenes because the humour is not part of the film so much as an aspect that is inserted in specific scenes. I say this because the film is not ""fun"" in the way good blockbusters can be but rather it feels like boxes were ticked without any intention of whether the various elements fitted together or not. The low points are generally associated with two of the Transformers who have clearly been scripted in a meeting that involved the word ""urban"" being used a lot. Mudflap & Skids are essentially urban stereotypes and I suspect that the people who wrote them probably think that Jar-Jar Binks is a great character as well. At best they are annoying and unfunny; at worst they are offensive race-related stereotypes.The cast (real and unreal) add to the film's problems although I will acknowledge that the cast don't have a lot to work with when you consider some of the lines they have to deliver and things they have to do. Having said that though, it doesn't help that the film is led by two ""stars"" who we are told are the new big things but who still leave me wondering why on earth they get all this buzz around them. LaBeouf doesn't have the charisma to lead this film and he doesn't really work in comedy, action or romance. OK he jumps around a lot but that's about it – his material is awful at times and it does feel like he just ""went with it"". Fox's role is a lot easier. As with the promotion of the film at various premieres (Fox front and centre, posing for the many press), the film pushes her body to the fore – her first scene has her repeating her ""bent over"" pose from the first film, this time over a motorbike. Personally I don't really see it and am not sure why she is famous while countless equally attractive women have yet to get a breakthrough –outside of her body there doesn't appear to be much else that makes her noteworthy. Oh, and if she is going to continue working her body in action movies, someone needs to buy her a decent sports bra or she find her assets ""depreciating"" the more ""running from explosion"" scenes she does. Turturro doesn't escape the rot but at least he is a bit of fun and even though he is so-so he steals every scene he is in – easy considering he shares some with the annoying Rodriguez. Duhamel and Tyrese do the same as last time with little to offer. The voice work is all very gravelly and fine with OK turns from Weaving, Cullen, Todd and others but Wilson and Kenny should be ashamed – blackface is unacceptable even when if one is a black actor ""wearing"" it.Transformers 2 is noisy and expensive but offers no more than this. A lot of the problems come with the territory but they have the knock-on effect of leaving the viewer apathetic to the action and ultimately I found it dull and unengaging which is probably its single biggest failing. Might satisfy those just looking for noise and colour but offers little else for anyone else.","5 out of 33 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Bigger, louder, not necessarily better","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2086936/?ref_=tt_urv","MaxBorg89","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5156288/?ref_=tt_urv","27 June 2009","Prior to Transformers (and, to a certain degree, The Island), Michael Bay seemed destined to be remembered as the director of a string of mindless, loud, critically lambasted blockbusters, plus Pearl Harbor (which was all of the above, only a lot more). Now, he's announced he won't direct the already announced Transformers 3, preferring to focus on smaller projects, and so he leaves the franchise with a sequel that looks scarily similar to his previous movies: dumb, excessive and (at least in the US) despised by critics. Sure, it is all of those things, but there's a big difference between Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and, say, Armageddon: this time, the good parts manage to largely outweigh the missteps.Plot-wise, the Kurtzman-Orci duo (aided by Transformers expert Ehren Kruger) aims to set up a complex mythology, as is to be expected with action and sci-fi sequels nowadays: the Fallen mentioned in the title isn't just an adjective related to the defeated Decepticons, it's also the name of a god-like Transformer (voiced by Tony ""Candyman"" Todd) who's up to no good and has been around for a long time. At about the same time as he decides to make his move, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is about to start college and trying to keep his relationship with Mikaela (Megan Fox) alive, but realizes the war between Autobots and Decepticons isn't over as far as he's concerned when he starts having spooky visions that could be of interest for the Fallen and the newly resurrected Megatron (Hugo Weaving). And so it's time for Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), Bumblebee, Ironhide and the other 'bots to help save the world. Again.The first Transformers succeeded because it displayed a foolproof mix of action and humor, barring the final battle which was a bit OTT. It was a silly movie that was perfectly aware of its own silliness and turned that characteristic into an asset. And for about 90 minutes, it seems like Bay and the writers got that balance right the second time as well: one moment Optimus and Megatron kick the mechanical crap out of each other, the next Sam is trying to make sure his parents don't embarrass him or goofing around with John Turturro's disgraced - and shamefully underused - CIA agent (""What you're about to see is classified. Do not tell my mother.""). The laughs don't just come from the spot-on humans (Rainn Wilson's cameo is a blast), they come from the robots as well, as new entry Jetfire (Mark Ryan) eloquently (more or less) proves.Then, all of a sudden, Bay drops the restraint in the third act: buildings blow up incessantly, slow-motion, smoke and dust are overused, the big Transformer battle goes on for ever and EVER, the mythology leaves room for every cliché in the manual and the silliness is blown way out of proportion (a close-up of a Decepticon's ""privates""? Really?). One might also wonder why the director bothered casting the animated series' original voice cast for the new robots (Ravage, Devastator, etc) when said machines are hastily introduced and then swiftly disposed (speaking of which, why come up with a Decepticon that looks human and drop the subplot after five minutes?).And yet... and yet Revenge of the Fallen is a pretty decent piece of entertainment. Yes, it's loud and dumb in all the wrong ways past the 90-minute mark, and yes, Bay is obviously pandering to a certain audience's expectations by inserting clearly gratuitous slow-mo shots of Megan Fox running in a quite revealing outfit, but what the hell, he does all that with much more gusto, energy and willingness to amuse than he did in Pearl Harbor. If this truly is his last big movie (for the time being, at least), it is, in its own, weird way, a triumph.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I get tired of everyone who complains ""well, I just saw it for Megan Fox,"" or ""I just saw it for the action."" There is no justification for saying this film was anything better than what it is: an insult. Michael Bay is given enough money to feed an entire African nation and gives us THIS. The acting was awful, and I'll admit that in these sorts of films, usually, that would be no problem. But Mr. Bay went as far as to say that the acting wasn't only supposed to be good, but it was. His only redemption and HE squashes it. Kudos, idiot. And as for the writing, it's no secret as to the immature, offensive, plot-hole-filled wretchedness that shows no bounds; the transitions to new plot points are ridiculous (""We're on three of the most beautiful pyramids in the world, Sam""...""OH MY! That just gave me the epiphany that there are three stars! I KNOW WHERE THE MAGIC THING IS!""). The action is killed with awful, embarrassing one-liners said in monotonous old-man voices via the transformers, (""Ah-pull.. ovah!""). The main problem was that Mr. Bay's target audience wasn't really a single group. The idiotically immature humor could only be funny to a five-year old, but the sexuality wouldn't be allowed by most adults (John Turturro in a thong shouldn't be viewed by anybody, let alone children). And nobody could truly enjoy the plot, which is like a story trying to be told by somebody with an awful case of Tourettes. My point is, avoid this movie at all costs. The first was funny and entertaining, don't let this schlock ruin it.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

I saw an IMAX showing for this on the opening day, and I was not disappointed with the special effects at all, in fact, the quality and quantity of explosions and crashes and booms and bangs overall in the film was the best thing about it. The rest of the movie, disappointingly, was flawed in every aspect of the film compared to its predecessor, otherwise, it was still a fun ride. In short, its not awful...its just the first one but not nearly as good.First of all, the plot and general writing seemed to have been an identical copy of the first one with a few tweaks. There were the occasional funny and stupid one-liners and the same humor the first one gave. In addition, the number of robots in the film was so immense i walked out not knowing any of their names (save for the ones returning from the first film) and some of which have so little screen time there is no point to seeing them in the film anyway.The general thought i had when I saw this movie was that Bay sought to top number 1 with MORE OF EVERYTHING. He even dragged this one out an additional 20 minutes. Although it seems harmless (as I thought before seeing it), the plot is so minimal there was virtually no point to stretching it out that far. Also, the action scenes were way more animated; however, the editing only nauseates. The scenes had the potential to be excellent, yet this was one factor holding them back.Another argument is the stage-time of the human eye candy in the film (aka Megan Fox). Much of the films emptiness centers around her character. Although she is very HOT, she takes up too much time and overall what she does waste in the film pulls the rest of the movie down.Now for the good things! I did enjoy the action scenes even though some seemed very far-fetched and overlong. The acting was suitable for the film too, and the comic delivery was par with the first film. Overall, there are things to criticize in this movie simply because it didn't match up with the first film, yet it is still a thrill ride and an lots of fun! This is still definitely worth seeing in theaters despite the flaws!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I won't bother regurgitating the plot (what little of it there is) I'll just focus on the shortcomings if I can keep them below the 1,000 word minimum. Two scenes hit me over the head with their sheer stupidity, the first being the Air and Space Museum scene. Sam and company enter the building in Virginia, then walk through a hangar door to be magically transported into the desert amidst mountain ranges! Perhaps the films makers felt the intended audience were so out of touch with reality that they would have no grasp of basic geography. They must also know nothing about the laws of motion. One scene shows people standing in the bay of a troop transport jet, the jet then makes an abrupt turn, its wings being perpendicular to the ground, then the next shot shows them still standing as if nothing had happened instead of being plastered against the wall! Couple this with painful dialogue, over the top acting (this is a Michael Bay film, after all), and seemingly endless scenes of robots tearing each other to shreds and you have something that isn't even good enough to be considered a ""popcorn flick"" or a guilty pleasure.

Well, we got it... 2 1/2 of almost literally all action and Transformers scenes. I am not exaggerating when I say there are probably less than 10 scenes in this movie without a Transformer in it. Though the thought of 2 1/2 of pure Transformers action may seem appealing at first... I'll be the first to say it can become mind-numbing. Also, I must add that I am a HUGE Transformers fan and even for someone like me this became almost redundant. Overall this movie is quite good though, but 2 1/2 hours is just too much and that's what drives it down from an 8 to a 7 for me. It's 4:11am I just got back from the movie I'm not completely coherent so please forgive me. I should have waited to do this but I felt the urge to do it ASAP.Final Thoughts: This movie is like the counter weight of the first movie and together they balance each other out quite well. The first movie focused more on us, the humans, and our reactions and actions to toward the Transformers. In this movie the main focus by far is the Transformers. Little explanation involved in this one.. almost all action with a little comedy and slight drama thrown in. This movie could not stand alone without the first movie which isn't a bad thing though. I like that Bay used the first movie as the entire foundation for an action packed sequel so he would not have a need to explain anything the second time around. All in all this movie is definitely worth seeing just make sure you have seen the first movie and make sure you are prepared for 2 1/2 hours of pure action!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There can be no other credible explanation for why this weird cartoon/live action concoction was made in the first place. The producers of this movie must have gotten together and decided that they will make a movie suitable for a four-year-old but advertise it as a PG-13 movie and thus sucker in adults to watch this incredible cinematic mess. In fact, this film is so bad that no child should be made to have to watch this cacophony of noise. There are enough problems in this world that we do not need to add a movie that shows machines behaving like people and so-on-and-so-forth. Sometimes a movie is bad because of poor directing, sometimes because of poor acting, sometimes because of a poor script, sometimes because of poor cinematography and sometimes because of other creative factor. This movie combines the worst features of all the categories mentioned. This movie, which is part cartoon and part live action, seems determined to delete or play down anything that even remotely resembles a coherent and intellectually stimulating plot. The fundamentally infantile plot is overshadowed only by the gratuitous use of special effects that are so cartoon-like that it makes one wonder why this movie even bothered to use actors at all. But what ultimately destroys this movie as a quality work of art is a ponderous, pedestrian, witless and implausible plot that asks the audience to root for or at least care about machines, big, noisy, ugly, clanking, machines, which is definitely stretching literary license to the limit. A machine is ... a machine and to invest it with human qualities is an untenable concept that is bound to destroy the plausibility of any story and this movie is no exception. This would be like having the USS Enterprise become one of the characters in Star Trek or a tank or aircraft carrier having something to say in a war movie. But that is what this movie asks the audience to accept, and it does not work because it cannot work. Machines fighting ... settling grudges ... discussing issues of good vs. bad ... ugh! Now, the movie does make an intriguing attempt to mimic the opening scenes from 2001 A Space Odyssey, but quickly slides back to a level of intellectual sophistication appropriate for a child - a very young, preliterate child. It is as if the director had no confidence in the screenwriter or lost confidence in the power of cinema to actually tell a literate story, and instead opted to fill the movie with ridiculous special effects a la the recent remake of King Kong with its plethora of incredibly hysterical special effects that reduced THAT movie to the level of a cinematic joke. Indeed, this movie might have worked better if King Kong HAD made a cameo appearance and duked it out with one of the bad guy machines. King Kong vs. The Machines. But that's another story. This movie is so devoid of intellectual content that it makes one of Michael Bay's other movies, Pearl Harbor, seem like a first-class production of Shakespeare. Enough already. Just pull the plug on this noisy, pretentious, ludicrous, inane, boring, and decidedly obtuse clunker. Or better yet, just take it out of circulation and stick it in the junk yard with all the other rusting and worthless pieces of junk.","17 out of 48 found this helpful.

From IMDb.com to feedback from friends, I have been told it was too long, it had bad acting and wasn't worth it. There was a fight towards the end that seemed to be a little too easy to win (I won't mention which fight or any other details to avoid spoilers), but outside of a few cheesy lines, I would say the movie was OK. It sure wasn't as good as the first movie, but wasn't THAT far off from it either. The music was fun, the special effects were fun, the many lines where they were obviously trying to be hip...at the most...were actually fun (or funny). Someone in another review said there was too much special effects and too much Megan Fox showing her cleavage off....but hey!...sounds like a classic ""good"" movie to me! Sorry folks, but that kind of stuff sells and I don't think they crossed any lines or over played it. As for the effects....this is a CG-packed action movie with a dramatic revenge title...what else were you expecting? It sure isn't a romance. I would say that this movie is not recommended for younger audiences since it does have a lot of profanity. Then again, with the ""hip"" approach to the use of language, I highly doubt its not something they already hear every day in school (regardless of grade). That's all up to the parents and how they want to expose or censor such. To give them a little credit, I went ahead and gave the movie an 8 out of 10. Why? Because it made me feel that I got my money's worth, it was a great movie, I would watch it again, and I left with the feeling that I would want to see another sequel. The acting wasn't that bad, despite the few cheesy lines as I have already mentioned. If you liked the first movie, I say go watch this one. One of the only things that didn't make this movie as good as the first one...is the fact that it lacks the element of surprise (aka ""its already been done once""). These kind of sequels almost always fall victim to fallacies and/or generalizations created by such.","55 out of 99 found this helpful.

For those who are complaining that the movie was too long though, are you the same people who complain that movies are too short? For the price of movies these days, I'm glad someone gave me more than a 90 min movie.2) Special effects and action - they were terrific. At least in this movie, i'm glad he showed some of the robot fight scenes a little more. I felt a little cheated in the first movie.This is definitely not a kids movie. Parents with young kids, I would not recommend. It is overly violent for only a PG-13 rating.3) Character development - we could have used more of Capt Lennox and his team. Felt they were overplayed in the first one but underplayed in the sequel. Folks, we don't need a back story of every single robot who enters the movie. I think the explanation of, ""Prime invited them"" is sufficient enough. Some of them could have been given more of a ""personality"" and we could have used less of mudflaps and skids. would have preferred the trio of motorcycles.4) Story - It's no Oscar winner, but the story holds together better than people would lead you to believe. it's a summer blockbuster, something to pass the days of summer with.

The script is incredibly weak, the plot is full of clichés and can be summed up in several sentences, character development (if existent) is totally predictable and one-dimensional, and the characters are all genuine stereotypes - there are absolutely no ""normal"" people in this movie, every single person/robot that inhabits the world is a silly caricature of some kind. The number of bad things in this movie is beyond measure................except that I didn't notice a single one at all (!!!!) until later, when my friend and I went to grab a beer and pondered about the film a little... Yup....that's it. When you make yourself comfortable in your cinema chair, the lights go out and this whirlwind of a movie starts, it's something entirely different. Slowly, all of my senses became overwhelmed in a manner that my brain obviously decided to completely ignore every single thing that I look for in a (good) film in favor of pure fun. With my higher functions disabled like that, I just stared at the screen with my eyes almost out of their sockets and my lower jaw on the floor, and absolutely didn't notice the stupidity of some characters, plot holes and clichés, just incredibly enjoying this outstanding feast for my senses. Incredible, just incredible...With all the advancements in CGI, sound editing and cinema technology overall, I believe this film is (sadly or not?)the prototype for the future of cinema entertainment, where all the things that should make a good quality movie (like intellectual weight) will be dropped in favor of stimulating your most primitive senses to the n-th degree and pure entertainment value that goes straight up through the roof, a concept which is slowly developing in an art form of its own. Because of that, this is (all its numerous and gigantic flaws if you judge it as a ""film"" included) an absolutely amazing movie. If you're into some pure fun, go watch it. Now.","81 out of 151 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Michael Bay makes a serviceable film. Dumb, but fun.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2085624/?ref_=tt_urv","Burnoutsss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13214393/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2009","Michael Bay.Has any other name been as synonymous with big Hollywood productions besides Jerry Bruckheimer? He has been known for his legendary special effects as well as his utter lack of human traits in a film. If there was ever a classic example of preferring style over substance, look no further than Bay himself.Thus, imagine the surprise many felt when they actually admitted to liking Bay's Transformers. While his critics were still present, he had actually received several praises from several thousand fan boys and was green-lit to do a sequel.The plot starts off much later after the initial Decepticon encounter. Literally. Apparently at 17,000 B.C., there were also giant robots raging war with our ancestors. In the present, however, the U.S. military and the Autobots combine together to form NEST, a secret force made in order to defeat incoming Decepticons. However, after a messy battle, the military has had it. They want the Autobots to either cooperate or leave. Elsewhere, Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebeouf), leaves for college and tries to have a 'normal' life. Of course, when he accidentally touches a cube fragment, he sees symbols, thus destroying his wishes altogether.To be honest, with the exception of the giant opening battle, I found the First Act a bit of a bore. It's ironic because in the first Transformers, I found the First Act the strongest. It really had a sort of human connection with me that struck me the right way. However here, it has all these messy subplots which I didn't really care about. Like Sam's relationship problems, for example. It's the typical long distance troubles and new hot girl that really didn't interest me. I also didn't particularly care for the in-fighting of the Autobots vs. the U.S. Government. It's sort of that expected feeling you get from a sequel.Luckily, the rest of the movie follows up to what passes for an entertaining popcorn movie.All the vices of Bay's film work are here: the shaky camera, the 360 camera, the explosions, the loud noises, the heavy editing and of course, boyish humor. And just like the last Transformers, Bay always had to refer to one of his earlier works.What really brings the movie out are its actors. While the characters they play are a bit bland, they are given a lot of screen time and a lot of situations to express their acting range. Shia Lebeouf is as strong as ever as well as Peter Cullen as the infamous Optimus Prime. John Tanaturo is hilarious again, but credit should go to newcomer Ramon Rodriguez as Sam's roommate, Leo. He has some bright charm to him that compliments Shia's acting.The robots in the film are given a similar treatment in the first film. While Bumblebee and Optimus are given sufficient screen time, the rest of the Autobots don't really have that luxury. Add in the fact, that there are even more Autobots than prior, and you have a problem.An odd note I'd like to comment on is the Megatron/Starscream interaction. In the original cartoon, Starscream made it no secret that he wanted to overthrow Megatron and lead the Decepticons. Hell, he even tried to kill Megatron a couple of times. But in the movie, Starscreams kind of a coward, and begs at Megatron's feet. I kind of wished that Starscream would've back stabbed him, but oh well.The action of the movie is intense. If you ever find yourself lacking a reason to go see a film, just go for pure eye-candy alone. The battles are on a large scale, and bigger than ever. Contrary to what a lot of people said, I could keep track with all the action on the screen. Perhaps it was the color scheme, but I found myself engaged with a lot of the battles, and knew who was winning and who was losing.The humor is questionable to say the least. A large part of the movie is comedy and it comes from all directions. From speech to slapstick, there's humor to be found everywhere. Some of it works, such as slapstick from Rodrigez's part. Some of it is crass, like a robot dry humping Megan Fox. And some is just plain painful. There are two robots who are twins. Whether they are offensive Mexican Stereotypes or Black Stereotypes, doesn't matter to me. I just want them gone.In the end, you go in hating this film, you'll hate this film. If you go in liking this film, you'll like it. It's just another one of Bay's works that will appeal to a certain audience. The plot is serviceable enough, though with plenty of holes, to get us through and there are good moments as well as painful moments. In the end, I liked it just fine.Verdict: Go see it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

One of the worst directed and scripted movies ever and probably the worst Bruckheimer movie so far. And those nasty, sleazy allusions to the sexiness of Megan Fox, as if she were a sex toy and not an actress. LeBouf seems to do the same role again and again, and with his lack of good looks (or rather his ridiculous looks) I suspect his 15 minutes at the box office is to be soon over. I simply do not see what is interesting or talented in this guy, his looks are none and his acting range seems limited.

Michael bay has once again created a great ride, but (what a shock) critics did not like the film, since many reviews were more than hostile against the whole thing.Yes, it is true, the film lacks all the values that critics so much desire. It lacks in character development, the story, well, also the plot has holes. we might say it has a very low critical value. But who cares, most films that critics like are usually so boring that you ask yourself why are you tormenting yourself by watching it, just remember Monster's Ball, Brokeback Mountain and many other films.Well, Transformers is not this kind of film. It is the opposite. It is a great action ride with childish humor, which actually is not so harmless as it might seem at first sight. It has a few vulgar lines. And because of all this it ads to the mood of the whole film as a positive one. Whether you are a teenager or a grown-up, it does not matter, you will laugh to the jokes, no matter how primitive they are, because they actually work.The soundtrack is once again the winner. Steve Jablonsky, Linkin Park and many other musicians add to the tempo of the film, which is always at high speed. It never stops.Visual effects are once again spectacular, explosions are already Bay's trademark, but this time he even surpassed himself by making Transformers 2 one of the most explosive films of the year.So, if you are a person, who likes to relax in the cinema and wants to have a lot of laughs, and at the same time enjoy in an adventure full of action sequences, then Transformers 2 is the film for you. If you are searching for a film with a plot, a lot of twists and surprises, then you better stay away.But one is sure, Michael Bay never disappoints, if you are looking for a film that can entertain you, because he is an entertainer and not an artist.All in all, it is worth to see this film in the cinema on the big screen, because sometimes a light film to relax and enjoy is all you need to relax your brain cells for a while.-ENTERTAINMENT: 10-MUSIC: 10-CRITICAL VALUE: 4 (it does not really matter)-STORY: 8-PLOT:7------------------TOTAL: 9","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

Anybody looking for more mythology into cybertron, origins of Autobots or decepticons will be sorely disappointed. Then again, anybody with half a brain can figure out that Michael Bay has never been, nor ever will be interested in aspects of film-making that actually add depth to a story. The movie is 2+ hours of explosions, gunfire, and violence interspersed with pitiful attempts at humor.That being said, the special f/x in this movie are without question some of the best I have ever seen, the pyrotechnics, the CGI, the choreographed battle sequences are first rate, the movie delivers the punch in that department.

I honestly don't know why! Yeah it's got some dumb stuff in it, but so did the first one. And am I the only person who actually watched the original transformers series? Or the 1987 cartoon movie? It was PACKED with stupid scenes and bad dialogue! There was even a scene where a Weird Al song called ""dare to be stupid"" played and all the transformers broke out into a huge dance number! No my friends, this movie is loaded with action and humour. The only problem with it is that people immediately hate it because Michael Bay is at the helm. People were lining up to trash the first movie but guess what, to everyone's surprise it was actually good! This film is no different. The first movie developed the characters which leaves more room for action in this film. But due to the simple fact that people couldn't trash the first film because it was actually good, which meant it was open season on this film no matter what the quality of the movie.So yes, I am a Michael Bay fan, I love The Rock, enjoy both Bad Boys, always get a kick out of Armageddon, and so on. Do I expect any movies like this or any of his future films to win the best picture Oscar? No, I expect them to be entertaining, which so far has happened every time.So here's a tip for you, if you hate Michael Bay's movies STOP &*%#ING WATCHING THEM! I hate Uwe Boll's movies, so guess what I don't watch them anymore, same with Roland Emmerich (who is often compared next to Bay), Renny Harlin, and a few others.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

What I saw in this 145 minutes movie is all I ever wanted to see...Pure transformers. This time special FX are improved and you get to see whats happening when Autobots and Decepticons are fighting. The movie score is similar to the previous one but can't help to say that Steve Jablonsky did an awesome job. The movie has its pro's and con's but con's don't have such a huge impact as many people believe. Firstly let me address this, Of course and we don't see many human dialog in the movie..your are watching transformers. Second, you don't get to see many autobots but I believe that Bumblebee and Jetfire even the little guy or the twins steal the show. Now for real life cast, Hotie Fox is just another decoration in the movie without adding nothing to the story. Sam from the other hand is still the same character you've saw in the first movie which of coarse is good. To all the Bay haters out there and to culture geeks, this movie is not about realism or have a deeper meaning hidden inside, this movie is all about...the same thing that made us love the cartoon series and...

What do you expect?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2091837/?ref_=tt_urv","jediskippy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2245078/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2009","Is it the greatest movie ever? No. Is it a pile of garbage? No.Apparently the majority of people who write reviews and deem themselves God's gift to reviewing movies don't understand how to enjoy a movie ever. I am so tired of reviews that talk about nothing about how horrible the movie was.Complaints I've read:1) There were too many robots. It's transformers. It's supposed to have a lot of robots.2) I went to see it honestly wanting to like it. This is my personal favorite. You went in wanting to like it, but 6 seconds into the movie you found something that ruined the whole movie for you, so you ended up writing 2 full pages about every little thing you didn't like about it. That opening line is nothing more than you trying to pose as someone who is unbiased when you saw this movie when that is clearly not the case.3) Michael Bay is a terrible director. This is the movie that decided that for you? Michael Bay has made better films, but he has made worse ones as well. There is nothing in this movie that is out of character with what he has done in his other films. He makes movies that are meant to be entertaining on a basic level, not win scores of Oscars. Sorry for all you ""purists"" that believe if it's not made by Kubrick, Coppolla, Zwick, Scorcese, Tarantino, etc it's crap. How many of you went in to see this movie expecting it to be ""The Shawshank Redemption""? Learn to enjoy a simple fun movie for what it is.4) I disagreed with where the plot went. Yes, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but simply because it's not what you would have done doesn't mean it's terrible. Unless you are an esteemed screenplay writer yourself this complaint has no validation.5) There is no action until the end. What movie were you watching?I could go on and on, but I'll end there.Here's my bottom line opinion for Transformers 2.It's fun. It's entertaining. Do I like everything about it? No. But I still enjoyed it because I went in with a simple mindset of it's an action movie with awesome special effects a simple story and some humor thrown in. It's not trying to be anything more than that.I will say I wouldn't take my kids to this movie if they're younger than 14. The humor in there along with some of the characters tries to take aim at the younger audience, but comes up short. It is still more of an adult humor with language thrown in. The story is easy to follow and I didn't find myself ever wondering; ""who is that?"" or ""what is going on?"". It is easy to distinguish between the Autobots and Decepticons, so fortunately needless time is not spent on identifying who is who. The story is sufficient for the entertainment level the movie is trying to give. The goal here was not to win an Oscar for the screenplay unlike what a lot of people who have ""reviewed"" this movie seem to think.The special effects are fantastic. This really doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway. The special effects are the heart of this movie. Yes, they're on the screen for most of the movie, but that is to be expected. The effects are the subject matter.Some movies are simply made to entertain and not win awards. This is one of them. If you want it to be fun and just look for the things you like about the movie then you will enjoy it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This film caters to the lowest common denominator in society. I know its just a summer action flick, but c'mon, Mr. Bay, can't you do better than this?...apparently not. Look, I love a great robot fight, and explosions as much as the next immature 41-year-old, but please, at least make an effort to employ the context of a plot or at least some interesting characters. If I wanted to sit through a Saturday morning 2 1/2-hour long toy commercial, I would have stayed home in my P.J.'s and watched the adverts on Nickelodeon. Anyway, congratulations Mr. Bay, you have now joined the ranks of such great filmmakers as Paul Verhoven, Mc ""D"" (I mean ""G""), and Ed Wood. Uh,...never mind, at least Ed Wood made an effort,... oh, and he had no money...To sum it up, 1 star for the movie, and 10 Stars for Mr. Bay, as the worst Director in Movie History.Good Luck with Transformers III, Revenge of the Movie-going Public.

Second of all I remember there was only a couple scenes in which a human wasn't in so maybe you should pay attention next time. For all of you that hate the camera work, maybe you should try directing a movie then you can criticize Micheal bay until then shut your mouth. All you critics leaving crappy reviews maybe you should be in the prime target audience, if you even know that means. I'm sure it takes real skill to sit and watch a movie then write a review, you people are a waste of life god get a real job. Back to target audience everyone I have talked to which the age varies from 12 to 30 have loved the movie and seen it more then once. Everyone else I have talked to has at the very least liked the movie. It just goes to show how bad you guys are at probably the most unskilled job in the world; o obviously it was a bad movie right no wrong how much money did it make why don't you check.

I expected the same fantastic quality of the first one and while this movie is good, it does not ever reach the quality the first one did.In this one Sam goes off to college 2 years after his first battle with the decepticons. But adventure follows him there and he is led into the second major battle of good vs. evil.The story is alright although lacking in some places, the movie does use its long run time well though and never stops unless it has to. Although the special effects take up this one more, this was not the only problem. They added too many of the characters just for kid humour, something which was lacking in the first one (which is a good thing) and I hated the twins that talked give even though that has not been considered a cool thing to have in a movie in about 5-10 years.Overall, the movie fails to reach up to the standards of the first movie but is pretty good and well worth a watch for fans of the first movie and the show. I rate it 62% for being an entertaining popcorn movie. Nothing more.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I never thought I would see the day when they were brought to live in such a realistic manner as the first film. So naturally, I couldn't wait to see more Transformers from my childhood come to life in this sequel. Quite frankly, the plot was painfully thin, the action scenes, while exciting were waaay too difficult to follow. Virtually none of the new characters were developed beyond mentioning their names. And lastly, Soundwave. The iconic bad guy that most hardcore fans unanimously wanted to see make an appearance. I thought making him a satellite was a great adaptation, but the voice. C'mon man, it was the only thing that made him cool in the cartoon.At the end of the day, Transformers will make box office records, rewarding Hollywood for spoon feeding the masses with more dribble. It's a shame, because the money invested in this film could have gone a lot further. Instead, in order to build off the success of the first film and ramrod a new film into theaters ASAP, the screenplay appears to have been written in the cab ride to the first day of shooting.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The action was intense, the machinery was awe-inspiring, and Megan Fox is incredibly HOT! There was humor sprinkled in and John Torturro was a hoot.I guess if I went to the theater looking for character development, unexpected plot twists, and the unveiling of the meaning of life, this movie would not deliver.

Though not intricate, the plot is varied from Sam (Shia LeBeouf) going to college leaving behind the foxy Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Autobots landing out of a job protecting earth, and the rising of the fallen. Not one thread is deftly or deeply handled, but surprisingly in between the explosions are nuggets of humor if not lost to the noise. For example, on the college campus Sam's parents quip: Judy Witwicky: Look at this place! I feel smarter already! Can you smell that? Ron Witwicky: Yeah, it's the smell of $40,000 a year...Well, it's not great humor, but the moments of chuckles put it leagues ahead of this summer's Terminator Salvation for human interest if not depth of characterization. In addition, fleeting reference to swine flu and Obama remind us that even such a superficial sci-fi as this has hopes of greater meaning than just action. If you feel good about cars morphing into monsters, you may be the critic to see this film as an allegory about the monster car industry eating up bailout money or girl friends looking like Megan Fox dutifully waiting for college-bound nerds like Shia LaBeouf. The possibilities are endless, as are Transformer flicks, I suspect.Bay is Bay, a director who understands the taste of an action-lusting summer audience.Hey, it's summer.

The signature Michael Bay explosions are definitely there. The machinery and the cars were all a great sight to see, as well as Megan Fox. The robot transformations scenes, the chase scenes, the fight scenes, all very excellently staged and executed as far as visual effects are concerned.However, for this particular blockbuster, I think the main problem is story-telling. When we understand what the Fallen meant, it seemed insignificant already. Focus is seriously lacking. It seems that story telling fell secondary to the explosive special effects and occasionally lame comedy schticks (particularly from Sam's mom and his roommate Leo).Part of this problem is time management. Everything in the script took too long to tell on screen. One example of a particularly over-long sequence is the climactic run of Sam to deliver the Matrix to Optimus Prime. It was one very extended series of indistinguishable gun battles interrupted by seemingly endless scenes of our two heroes running. Of course, these running scenes had to be in slow motion in order to emphasize Megan's jiggling anatomy for the boys in the audience (haha!)As a whole, it is OK for a lazy afternoon with the kids, as we did so today. The kids found it awesome and extreme, as could be predicted. However, we know there could have been better story-telling by its director, who seemed to be more concerned with the superficial embellishments rather than the core spirit of the story.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was waiting for Optimus to snap and go Bas Rutten crazy since the first movie and now he truly delivered. Watch the scene in the forest.I am happy to say this movie keeps within the very essence of the Transformers that i grew up with. A lot of rockets and stuff shooting out from bodyparts and action sequences that captures the very soul of the original cartoon.It feels like the movieteam they really did their research this time around the myth, legend and personality of the transformers.From a Hollywood mainstream point of view i would say the the story is kinda mediocre, but from Transformers and Sci-Fi fans point of view, this is exaclty the kinda original story and problems you would find in the actual cartooon.Other than that i think the CGI is probably the best ever produced to blend in with human size ratio and with the natural envoirments of earth. CGI blew me away. They did a damn impressing job! This is way better than the first movie. This time they had a better and more interesting variety and line-up of psycho robots of all sizes, mechanisms and missions from the world of TF.I don't wanna spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet, so all i can say to is Sci-fi action fans, go and see it.PS..

Unfortunately it hasn't lived up to the hype for me as somewhere between the first and this they have forgotten their target audience.It was disappointing for a few reasons: 1. There were several characters in this film that were clearly aimed for a much younger audience than the M15+ suggests. Whoever was responsible for the two 'brothers' who talk like they are in a Disney film should be taken outback and shot!! It RUINED the film as I found it impossible to become immersed in the story whenever they were in a scene. 2. One of the aspects of the first film that I loved was the dialogue used by the Decepticons which would be translated at the bottom of the screen. This was absent in the sequel which I found rather disappointing.3. The degree of difficulty to kill an autobot/decepticon changed. In Transformers it required a massive effort to destroy one of these guys and suddenly it became much easier.Things I liked: 1. The acting was really quite good in my opinion. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox were as good if not better than in the prequel. 2. The special effects were brilliant. Loved every minute of the action and was exactly what I had hoped for.Overall it was a good film but had the potential to be great. I find it hard to understand why this film is only half a vote behind its prequel when they are miles apart.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

However talking about huge production that coast $ 200 Million the movie had huge and unforgivable problems:  Michael bay is known for his action directing career, still in his previous movies (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor & the Island) he paid great deal of attention to the human side of the character which was totally missing here except for cheesy few lines here and there and it was mostly made by the Robots; for me Megan Fox's lines were non sense and unnecessary at all considering the situation they were in the movie especially the ending part.  It's amazing how a whole make up department which included around 8 people in charge didn't notice Megan fox's perfect make up and amazingly glowing lip glues through the movie!! What's up with the full make up through fighting a whole army of Aliens in the middle of the Egyptian desert?? Seriously?!!!  Egypt and Jordan scenes: where to start with that?!!! I'm an Arab, and it's a shame to say that the American cinema still portraits the Arabic countries as a huge Desert with few barbarians and camels here and there, not to mention the dump midget police man, the crappy Egyptian and Jordanian borders and the 5 minutes distance between Egypt and Jordan!!! What's the deal here, why all this conspiracy from huge production companies to manipulate the Arabic image along with the Arabic countries? It's 2009 now and I think a 6 years old kid would know the truth if he googled it!! Honestly; I blame both the Egyptian and the Jordanian governments for allowing such movies to be shot in their countries with out any knowledge of the story contains.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

More like a huge gift on my most anticipated film of the year, my god what a film! Transformers 2 is non-stop action-packed, exciting, funny & visually stunning. Reprising his role, Shia Lebeouf does a great, great job (did better here than in this first) using his own comedic style and full of emotions. Megan Fox is hotter than ever, had a little more to do here than in the original and did barely OK but still NEEDS to work on her acting, needs to fire her agent pronto!! Newcomer, Isabel Lucas does fairly well with her part. As for others reprising their roles: John Turturro, John Duhamel and Tyrese does their part very well like they did in the first. The Autobots and Decepticons were awesome and cooler than ever.While, I loved the first Transformers, I loved this one even more. For those awful negative reviews, what you expect? Iron Man, The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2? Transformers is never known for acting or it's plot, just robots beating the crap out of each other, full of non-stop action & the spectacular special and visual effects which is all we probably need from a Transformers movie. Back to the movie, like I said the visual effects are spectacular and the action almost never lets up. Steve Jablonsky's score is not as epic as the first but still, it's outstanding, very different (in a good way) and ONE of his best in my opinion. Transformers 2 might not take the title for the best summer movie of the year with Up and Star Trek in front of it but it's sure hell one of the best this year!!","57 out of 105 found this helpful.

There's a few military scenes that take themselves seriously but the problem here is that you don't know if this film really is taking itself seriously with an over saturation of comedic relief.The introduction for some of the new characters most notably Skids and Mudflap are rather painful to watch at times, whilst they have their moments their personality seems way too troublemaker stereotypical. The Fallen who is portrayed as the big baddie over Megatron (of all things) in this film has very little to no character development and barely any screen time.The Deceptacons especially the ones that were given no name are problematic because I feel like most of their basic designs were recycled with some of the characters, their biggest problem is the fact that most of them have the same paint job especially Megatron and Starscream, at times it can be difficult to tell them apart especially during the climatic battles. This is quite a problem cause there are times where you think a certain Deceptacon has been killed only to realize that it was a no named one.Now onto the Fancruft stuffFirst of all the fact that Megatron is a servant for a bigger bad is a kick in the nuts, its well known in the Transformers universe that Megatron is loyal to no one but himself. It also sucks that most of the new Autobots got little to no screen time or lines for that matter, you'd have to actually be a fan to know who some of these characters are and what they can do but for non fans ... Oh and remember the classic transformation sound and the tie in of ""More than meets the eye"" from the first film? yeah no real fan throwbacks here during this 2 1/2 hour long filmBottom line see the film you you are both a transformers fan AND an action movie fan. If you're not both I'd suggest giving this one a miss or at least wait till the DVD comes out.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

I never go see movies on opening weekend but I just felt compelled to see this one on Friday night. We waited over an hour in line. It was worth every minute. We absolutely LOVED IT. There was so much more fighting in this movie and finally bumblebee kicks ass! There was so much more US and foreign military interaction involved, it was awesome! I'm probably going to go see it again, which I've never done for any movie. I liked it just as much as the first one, probably a little better. They finally used a little more adult language and some of the humor was more adult oriented which was great! The graphics were unbelievable and they left the door open for a 3rd installment.

But after watching this again, I believe it was totally unwarranted.A lot of work went into this film including one explosion that took seven months to set up for one-shot.The relationship between Sam and Mikaela was made stronger especially on her side, which was my largest complaint about replacing Megan Fox in dark of the moon.I hadn't realized that Peter Cullen has always been the voice of Optimus prime, I had been assuming that they chose a different actor that was able to emulate that great voice. But this is actually Optimus prime.And the state of the art for this film supersedes the first transformers film by an exponential factor. They were able to do things here that made the CGI much more believable, also the use of practical effects in a lot of places makes it very difficult to see what is CGI and what is not. Sometimes when a transformer was in the scene, it would be a real prop as was the case with bumblebee. Also parts of Megatron.The story itself was based on certain aspects of the 1984 transformers movie.It is too bad that the public reacted so negatively to this, so much hard work went into it. And it brings in new auto bot characters, some of which continued through the franchise.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

Some other comment gems I found: ""The Animation hadn't improved since the first one."" Well, I think a little research is necessary. http://www.cinefex.com/ and MANY other sources. The forest scene alone should make you feel shame for saying that. Some other highly intelligent comments ( insert sarcasm here )""This is a terrible film by ANY standard."" ""cinematography was poor.""This person = FAIL. Do you believe ""Documentary Style"" camera shake for no reason that appears on soo many Oscar contenders is cinematography? If so,it's time for you to have a nap.. a long one. ""Robots look alike."" The ugliest robot design I have EVER seen, The (animators)should've gone with something resembling the original designs from the 80s cartoon."" HAHA,laughable.Clearly a Visual effects wizard and an expert in production who could do all this alone,and wouldn't need the ""Animators"" to design the robots. Since animating big chunky robots would be impossible, and animators don't design on production,you are wrong and fail.. on sooo many levels.. :) Better to be thought a fool dude. By the way, the designs were bad ass. Well, I have to say, I would love to stop hearing about everybody's whining issues with this movie,and start hearing some positives,but I'm sure everybody will be mad at it for being ""too awesome"" for awhile. So what Iwill say is,you have to realize how many people out there kill themselves on a daily basis to bring you films at all.It's not all big money for all the crews out there.I DO think this movie deserves AT LEAST a nom for the Oscar in more than a couple categories. To everybody who hates this film and Michael Bay: Let's see YOUR movie. I can't wait to tear it apart.. Oh no wait,, you just talk the talk.. Transformers(both)were AWESOME!!!Congrats on a great job to the prod crew and to all the artists. To who said ""Too many Robots"" "" Too many explosions"" ..really!!??? Who ARE you? Can you HAVE too many robots? Is it possible? Do you hate bunnies? I'm off to dream about TF3. I CAN'T WAIT for MICHAEL BAY to make another one,and how awesome it will be if it's done with massive Bayhem!(With MORE robots and explosions of course.:)Enjoy yelling at me when I'm gone,but I will probably just be out having fun with a GIRL.Or doing digital effects so I can help people like Michael Bay make more awesome films!

Lots of big big explosions, special fx sequences, a few touching moments but you just keep feeling something is terribly missing and wrong about the film.

The good aspects I think most would agree were enough to give it great potential for a rebirth. If you researched many of the early episodes you would find some very intriguing character developments and plot points interwoven among larger universal themes. Hence the many fans of the show for which it stands head and shoulders above anything else that was directed toward kids in the 1980s. Of course the series also had it's shortcomings. There were plenty of poorly written episodes that relied too heavily on gunfights or oddball plots that really dumbed down the series and ultimately led to it's cancellation. My only explanation would be that the writers or producers of those episodes thought that kids were really stupid. Well what did you do with this storyline you were given to breath new life into. You decided to take those poor aspects of the show and run with them. This movie used every negative aspect of the show and blew it up 10 fold, namely the aforementioned over use (or bad use) of fighting, nonsensical location changes, human characters with vacant personalities, the obvious and aimless attempt of adults trying to guess what is ""cool with the kids"" (i.e. the inclusion of the two jive talking robots, this films Jar Jar Binks) etc. etc. etc. You took millions and millions of dollars and destroyed all credibility in something that could have been smart as well as visually intriguing. Either you are really stupid or you think your audience is really stupid or both. This is literally one of the worst films I have ever seen. If there was a jail for crimes against art, you guys would be given a life internment. Thanks for totally f#@king it up. I hope you enjoy your money, I'm sure you have.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

I hereby congratulate Michael Bay for his great achievement of ruining this movie since it really requires some talent. Lets start with the actor selection. The only difference between lumber and Shia LaBeouf is Shia LaBeouf can talk. Given this fact, I really don't see any reason for his existence on this (or any other) movie. I mean it, this guy has no talent at all, he doesn't have an attractive physic or anything that can justify his presence in a movie. Also, the female characters made the plot more cheesy and they were totally unnecessary. Lets put some sexy girls and silly jokes to make a teenage movie. Unfortunately it doesn't work like that. I have never seen a classical movie with cheesy plot. Especially in sci-fi, this cheap tricks are just ruining the movie. I don't want to hear a stupid joke when there is an action packed fight scene. If you want to make a remarkable movie, you should be serious (I prescribe the director some James Cameron movies so that he may see how sci-fi is done). The last battle was really great in terms of visuals but overall, there is plenty of room for improvement. It is so sad that the third one will be done by the same director.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is an extremely hot actress and good music in the soundtrack and the guy who voices Optimus Prime is worth the price of admission alone. People who say Megan Fox or Shia Lebouf are not good actors are just jealous lamebrains. And although I think somebody else would have been a better choice for a subject as daunting as Pearl Harbor, Michael Bay is perfect for something like Transformers. When all is said and done people will watch this more in their lifetime than most of the other crap out there because it is really well done escapist comedy action. If you've had a bad day and need to relax, popping in a DVD or Blu-Ray of either Transformers movie will help you escape and relax because it is just pure fun.","36 out of 64 found this helpful.

I finally got to see it at the cinema I manage last night. Overall I can say it was fantastic, I came out with that buzz that I felt after watching the 1st film. The film quickly got started and from there it never really let up, the action was constant with plenty of humour along the way. The style was very much the same as the 1st film just with more of it.The introduction of new characters brought new elements to the action however there was a lot more potential in this area I feel. The development of the relationship between the leads in this film reminded me very much of Armageddon, it made me actually believe that they were falling in love; no mean feat when Megan Fox's character is paper thin.Theis film wasn't perfect by any means, the story could have been developed much more and there are things which go unanswered. Normally this would drive me mad but this time didn't really bother me. Lets face it, the 1st film didn't exactly have a flawless storyline, thats not what its about. The point of the film was Michael Bay blowing sh*t up, which as expected was done well and often.Overall I loved this film, normally it wouldn't come close to a 9 but it has that incredible feel good effect present in the 1st.

What he was saying essentially is that I needed to simply lower my standards and ask for less. Note that I said this was a former associate.Michael Bay makes blockbusters. He makes them loud, crude, violent and profitable. He made 'Armageddon', about rocks that threaten to destroy earth. He made 'The Rock', about a terrorist that threatens to destroy San Francisco. He made 'Pearl Harbor' about how the Japanese destroyed a navel base. Are you seeing a pattern here? He makes profitable films in which things get blow'd up real good. His excuse is that he makes films for audiences, not critics. Well, so did Hitchcock, but at least Hitch wanted to play us like a piano, not like a set of drums.'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is a loud, crude, dumbbell action picture that has the appeal of throwing a set of cookware down a long staircase. The heroes and villains are robots from another world who can disguise themselves as mobile objects like cars, jets, tanks etc. They can even take the form of household objects like toasters or blenders. The reason they are here on earth is laid out in incomprehensible dialogue that I really I could not follow. It really doesn't matter anyway. The final scenes are an assault of noisy special effects and whip-cut editing that never allow you to get your bearings. Its like the movie was made to be a two-and-a-half-hour trailer for itself.The robots are seen early and often. There is no build-up or mystery about them at all. They are built of a convoluted mess of shiny metal pieces formed into something 40-feet tall with arms and legs. They have faces that aren't expressive but rather hidden by all the metal - it takes you a second or two to decipher where the eyes or the mouth are or if they even have them (why do they need them?). When they speak, they having nothing interesting to say. Their speech comes in three forms: Formal comic book boilerplate (""Die, like your brothers"") and pop culture buzzwords (""Punk-ass Decepticon!"").They make no logical sense in that you shouldn't ask how a 50-foot robot can contain enough metal to transform into a half-sized pick-up truck.Worse then trying to figure them out is watching them. All they do is fight, smash things and shoot lasers. A lot of things get smashed and a lot of lasers get fired. There are a lot of things that get blown up, a lot of things that get destroyed. The robot's bodies are made of metal, wires and gears. They look like moving scrap-heaps and when you get a bunch together to fight, you can't tell one from another.You have to ask why creatures from another planet would be metal robots anyway? Why is their speech such a mess of stale mechanical blandness? What do they have to offer besides weapons that can destroy stuff? What is their planet like? Where do they come from? Are there other organic beings out there? Do they know about us? Who built you guys? What's your technology like? How were you able to convincingly create a robot who was a human look-a-like? See, they wouldn't want to visit me because I would never shut up with the questions.The human characters in the movie aren't smart enough to ask those questions. The males in the movie are either college slobs or military archetype. The female are all gorgeous, smoldering in heat, and dress like Playmates. Shia LeBouf, the hero, runs through this movie looking dazed and confused while shouting at special effects. Megan Fox doesn't fare much better but at least I can give her credit for tiring of this material and bowing out of Transformers 3. The only romantic conflict between LeBeouf and Fox is the idea that he won't tell her that he loves her. Trust me, if a guy has the heart of a girl who looks like Megan Fox, the problem would be getting him to STOP saying it.Movies like this anger me. They are a determent to this art form that I love. They seem to have been made by people who don't know what movies are suppose to be about. Made by committee, they are filmed deals, made for box office, merchandise and beverage tie-ins. I like movies that ask something of me, they engage me and have a narrative that plays with my senses and my expectations and my sense of wonder. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is, I'm told, a movie that I am suppose to simply sit back and enjoy but, for me, that would be asking me to enjoy getting smacked repeatedly upside the head with a frying pan.* (of four)","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

In the first one, the general action had somewhat of a purpose throughout, and was more of a family-oriented movie reminiscent of the cartoon a toy franchise, but this offering delivered a weaker story where the action was more nonsensical and purposeless at times; the Megan Fox was just as hot as in the first, but was more ""sexed up"" in this one. In the first, the character was created to make a testosterone-prevalent ""guy flick"" more inclusive and watchable by girlfriends dragged to the movie. However I'm not sure why she was in this one. The parents, who were supposed to be the ""very irritating"" comic relief in the first, were an unnecessary, unwelcome addition to the movie. Mudflap and Skidmark or whatever his name is, the two bots who transform into a neurotic ice cream truck were flamboyant and racially stereotypical -- much like that Jar-Jar joke --, but weren't a big part of the story, so weren't as intolerable as most. The Sound was impressive as was the CGI and FX, but the addition of curse words was silly and extreme at times! It excludes a lot of its fanbase, kids who were enchanted by the first movie ie. my ""nephew"" probably won't go see this. If seen, see in theaters as to get the sound effects and the bombast of the movie! It is worth seeing once!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The effects were superb, and the acting wasn't bad either. The story could have used more depth, but that's forgivable.The main issue with this movie is all of the sexual innuendos. The first movie had one awkward scene that most people could only cringe through. This movie assaulted me from the beginning with a dog (Mojo) asserting his dominance on another male dog, and continued to have immature sexual references all throughout.Considering this is a film with a target audience of children as well as adults, I'm extremely disappointed with the writers and the producers. The level of immaturity is too great in several paces for me to allow children to see it. My little brother (he's eight) has been counting down the days until it came into theaters and was trying to convince my family to take him to see it at least a week ago. He's going to be absolutely crushed when we tell him he can't go.This could have been a really good movie that everyone in the family could see. Instead the writers decided that they would rather include multiple perverse jokes and bar children from the theater.I would have given Transformers a solid 8.5 or maybe even 9 out of 10 stars. As it is, I can't give it anything higher than a 7. It's so disappointing to me that Hollywood thinks a movie has to be loaded with sex to make it interesting to the average audience. There may be a time and a place for that, but that time and place is *not* in a movie based off of a children's cartoon.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Basically its the same as the previous movie with a few profanities randomly thrown in along fast - like eyes bleeding fast - paced action.Now, I like kitch but giants robots in the woods reminds me of a godzilla-type film made by bored billionaires... seriously ? Thing is I could have watched that kind of stuff in an anime 24 episodes long with a real work on the story instead a 2hrs mindless showdown, ID4 was pretty much the same but still there was people in it (I'd add lexomil acting but that's just me). In ROTF, characters are either robots or just a background to make you wait until the next bots fight. You've got a story going on but given the context, its worse than no story at all; it feels like being added from deleted scenes.I love being entertained whatever kind of flick it is; that movie just looks too random for me but at some point choosing between full CGI or enhanced by CGI movies is a wise idea. Still, kudos to the director for the best laugh I had during a ""lord of the ring-matrix-stargate"" story climax, having so heterogeneous plots in a single sequence is really impressive and needs to be noted. Though its not ""Weng Weng"" funny just yet.Lastly, acting ... well no one expected good performance so at least, I've got what I though I'd have. Could have been worse I guess - with some rehearsal though.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Sam is having hallucinatory episodes of Cybertronian symbols, and is being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named The Fallen (Tony Todd), who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process.The story is very incoherent, but I still watch this movie and like I said, this movie had a lot to go through before being released and I am not going to talk about this movie. My god, man. I can't hate this movie.If there is one thing I hate about this movie, that is a scene where Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron and I did feel some emotion in the scene, but I almost cried because he was killed and did not come back into this film until before the end credits come on and when he comes back, it is okay, but I just did wish they did not kill him off in the middle portion of the film.The visual effects on the Transformers are really amazing as hell and it was fantastic, but the CGI on the Fallen is a little off, but it is really amazing. The musical score by Steve Jablonsky is really amazing and the score is just fantastic as hell, especially with the other Transformers films and the scary movie remakes produced by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller, this includes the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday THE 13th remakes. The acting is amazing. Shia LaBeouf once again plays Sam Witwicky and he does an amazing job. Megan Fox is really hot and cool as Mikaela Banes and this would be her last TRANSFORMERS film, and I would have loved to have seen her play that character in the third film. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are cool in their roles, too. John Turturro is really funny, but there are scenes that the humor is taken way too far in this film.Isabel Lucas as Alice is creepy and hot in the screen time that she has. The other person, Ramon Rodriguez is funny as hell as Leo in this film and I would have liked to have seen him in the third film as well.This would be the last film to be distributed by DreamWorks Pictures as Paramount Pictures distributed future films in the franchise.Overall, with TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, I love and hate this film and that's pretty much it. I give it a 5 out of 10 because I have the two-disc DVD and I watched the special features and even the documentary and I felt sorry for the filmmakers and cast doing this film, but they made one hell of a sequel. Critics should have gave this movie a lot of critical praise for this movie.This is Michael Bay's worst reviewed films along with Pearl Harbor, Transformers: Age of Extinction and Bad Boys II.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has all the ingredients for a summer blockbuster; a good fan base from the first movie, great special effects, and a popular cast. However, Transformers 2 was just a good movie and not a great movie, which it very well could have been.The opening sequence is good and sets up the story quite nicely but the story that is set up does not get a chance to fully develop throughout the movie. The reason is because Michael Bay can't decide on what to focus on. Does he make this an action movie? A dramatic movie? An action/comedy? There are too many different movie elements in Transformers 2.Some of the problems were the inclusion of too many low brow jokes in the movie. There is a scene involving Sam Witwicky's mother shortly after arriving at college that should not have been in the movie. It wasn't very funny and did not contribute to the advancement of the plot. These jokes throughout the movie take up screen time where dialogue explaining the plot and advancing the story should have been.Transformers 2 builds on the stories from the history of the Autobots and Decepticons, but those stories are not sufficiently explained and too much has to be assumed. The stories still make some sense and does not make the plot confusing or impossible to follow, but it makes the story seem incomplete.Where the first Transformers movie thrived on a strong story and good action scenes, Transformers 2 relies on just action scenes. I did give this movie a 7 because the story was still good. The action scenes were enjoyable to watch and the acting was well done. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson did great with their supporting roles as soldiers. It is easy for everyone to try to vie for the spotlight in such a big budget movie, but those two played their roles very well which is one of the reasons this movie was good.Transformers 2 also uses many elements from the original television series and some from Transformers: The Movie (1986). That made the movie more enjoyable as it was more in tune with the Transformers many of the fans grew up with. Bumblebee is still a lovable robot and Optimus Prime is still everyone's favorite leader. Megatron and the Decpticons are still just as evil as we all remember and the transformation of the beloved 80's cartoon series to a live action big screen film is just as amazing as the first one. Once you walk out of the theater a few things will stick in your mind. Optimus Prime is still a bad-ass and a terrific movie hero, the special effects were great and so were the action scenes, and Megan Fox is gorgeous. But, maybe the most important thing a movie should leave you imprinted with is not stuck in your mind and that is an intricate story that you want to see over and over again... maybe just twice, I know I'll probably see it again","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"2","/10","A Nutshell Review: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2085281/?ref_=tt_urv","DICK STEEL","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0317399/?ref_=tt_urv","23 June 2009","The story, if it's any excuse to call it one, involves Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) facing some teenage existential romance issues, quite petty amongst the world's concerns that the Decepticons are not yet a done deal, with the Autobots joining forces with US soldiers forming NEST, an operations unit with jurisdiction just about anywhere in the world, because the world does not have soldiers, or competent ones at that – Jordan only has 2 choppers being swatted down like flies.Throw in more bureaucratic nonsense like a rehash of the first film, the return of Josh Dumahel and Tyrese Gibson giving a collective to soldiers on the ground, John Turturro for some weak linkage to the first film, and a highly irritating, immature Ramon Rodriguez in a nerdy roommate role who got caught up in situations he never bargained for. In fact, there are so many frat boy situations and lame jokes tossed around, that it made it seem that the scriptwriters and filmmakers all had some repressed teenage fantasies they needed to play out on screen. Needless characters, just like the Witwicky parents, just bloat the screen and the runtime, just to have more human presence in the story, but serving little purpose other than to elicit some cheap laughter.Sure, Michael Bay had responded to fans clamouring for more robots in disguise, but that had translated to a load of nameless, faceless robots either created just for laughs thanks to a renegade allspark fragment, or introduced so that they can be blasted to smithereens. Even the final assault of Decepticons were made up of unknown, generic looking robots that were there for cannon fodder. As for Devastator, what a big let down and a cop out. That on screen is not the composite giant robot I had known through the years, and reeks like the Americanized Godzilla where its orientation became severely changed, here to serve nothing more than a huge vacuum cleaner.Nameless, faceless robots extend to the Autobots too, with Optimus Prime and Bumblebee taking up most of the screen time being obvious fan favourites, with others being Ironhide, the newly created Twins, and supporting acts like Arcee and Sideswipe, together with loyalty flipfloppers like Wheelie (whom I thought all along was supposed to be an Autobat) and Jetfire (this stays true, in a way). The biggest let down of all would be the Fallen, supposedly one bad-assed transformer with a huge axe to grind, becoming nothing more than a lazy bastard whose threats he made get forgotten about totally, in between snarls.If there's anything of merit here, then yes, hats off to the CGI folks who have upped the ante with their numerous detailed transformations of robots to vehicles, and vice versa. There were action sequences intricately crafted, but alas some dodgy camera angles sometimes get in the way of their creative genius. There were a handful of action sequences which fell prey to extreme close ups and resulted in a huge mesh and mess of clanging metal being welded together and thrown about on screen, where you can hardly tell who's who, made all the more difficult when the Decepticons aren't as brightly coloured. The finale is some 30 minutes, but largely reminiscent of the old cartoon series where you have two opposing combatants occupying one side of the screen each, and firing everything at one another, and missing a whole lot. Then wash-rinse-repeat, or cue heroic Autobot who rips apart the enemy without dripping engine oil.Fans of the history of Transformers might feel a little mixed with the origins of the Transfomers explained here in a little bit more detail, a continuation of the allspark artifact seen in the previous film, with biblical elements like the fallen angel with the featuring of an important element such as the leadership matrix. Even a moment of the Transformers animated film found its way here, though I will not reveal what it is since it's a huge plot point and fuels pretty much the entire 2nd half of the film. And if there's one major gripe I have to make, it is this – Bumblebee is a four-seater Camaro (and we're reminded about this time and again), but to Sam, he'd rather pack his folks into the car, while opting to run some 4 miles in the desert dust to a common destination amidst a raging all out war. Right, yay to illogical heroic moment misconstrued to be sacrifice.I will unabashedly say that I've enjoyed the first Transformers movie, but this sequel is obviously churned out to milk the fanboys of their money, together with so many blatant merchandising opportunities with variations of toys. But that's what the fans want, and that's probably what they got and lapped up, given the reaction of the audience who laughed at every single unfunny moment, cheered at every robot death, and roared with approval with every shot of a military vehicle put in just because Bay could. One should be offended by what went on screen in a total waste of time and budget, and this goes down in my books as an over-hyped and stale summer blockbuster.","11 out of 30 found this helpful.

As a sequel the writers have developed plot lines for the human characters that give them an opportunity to grow as opposed to simply running away from evil Decepticons. Shia's character is asked by his colleague to help win a war and instead runs away from duty. When more people wanted action they got that as well as more character development than a typical sci-fi blockbuster.Sam and Mikela's relationship is explored further in this second installment and it delivers on what it promises. This and more is plentiful through out the movie. However more Autobot character development would have been a welcome addition to the movie, but this can be attributed to the writer's strike and the staff not having enough time to contribute to what a portion of the fan base wants. Let's hope we get more character development all around in the third installment.","35 out of 63 found this helpful.

Bay tries far too hard, throwing so many ideas at the screen that none are given the opportunity to stick, let alone breathe. Over 40 robots appear over the 150 minute runtime of the film of which 1, Starscream, gets any kind of character development beyond the 3 set types, good, evil, or annoying.The robots themselves are in dire need of some internal logic, what are their abilities? How are they made? Are their components sentient? As it is, the robots are so diverse as to defy any kind of movie logic explanation, some can disguise themselves, some are animalistic, some have opinions, some can break up into smaller pieces, some have apparent genitalia. The sheer number of them also cloud the issue, making it impossible to know, or recognise all the robots in the large fight scenes so that its very hard to tell whats going on and who's shooting who. Thats certainly not helped by the fact they all share the same shiny metal aesthetic and nearly everything is shot in close up shaky cam. Its symptomatic of a film that feels like it started with Michael Bay writing everything he thought was cool or funny on a sheet of paper and then trying to craft a script around it.That might have worked better if Michael Bay had any kind of sense of humour. Dogs and robots hump each and people's legs furiously, LeBeouf mugs gamely but even his talents can't make up for the drivel he is given, but even he fares better than the awful material given to his screen parents. A special mention goes to the hip hop lingo spouting twin robots ruin every scene they are in. The biggest laugh in the screening I saw was for a man wearing a thong which says all you need to know.The plot, such as it is, lacks coherence. I'm not asking for epic storytelling or multi-layered plots, I'm not even asking for emotional involvement, just a better explanation of what the evil guy's plan and why everyone is seemingly shooting everyone else in the desert. If I'm trying to snatch positives I could mention that Megan Fox is absurdly hot for the whole film, but thats partly because the camera ogles her curves at every opportunity, notably as shes bent over a motorcycle in the most gratuitous shot i've ever seen outside porn.Overall its a bad, messy, dumb movie that I wouldn't recommend even for the unreconstructed action film fan in all of us.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

The movie started off with a comedic edge, which was probably the most enjoyable part of the movie. Once the action started things got confusing.A big difference between revenge of the fallen and the first one is the strength of the deceptagons. Remember in transformers 1 where megatron was simply invincible until blasted by the cube? Not this time around. This time a few rounds from a human tank is enough to severely wound and transformer.This really took away from the fact that the autobots were so outnumbered by machines bigger then them. But once the action started, you couldn't tell the villains apart unless they were talking or you were close enough to see there face. The autobots were a little more distinguished because of there bright colors.The acting was once again pretty good, apart from a few tag-a-longs that were written into the plot.The plot had an obvious problem. One, there were too many characters for the movies own good, which resulted in almost an hour of unnecessary crap. Steven Spielberg crossed a few lines between producer and director here as he sent shia laboeouf to Egypt and had him solving riddles.Overall the messy (but fun) action sequences weren't enough to make us ignore the plot entirely. Not as good as the first, but good enough to make a sequel.6/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I guess it's hard to describe just what I enjoyed about this film so much, maybe it was the action sequences- all incredibly complex and freaking awesome. Maybe it was the many new characters and their badass designs throughout, or maybe it was its sense of sheer energy that just carries the film to an excitable level I certainly haven't experienced in a while. Lets face it, the film has its problems. It can be a bit choppy at times, and has been fairly criticized for its racist depictions through its characters of Mudflap and Skid Mark- honestly the worst part of the film in general- as well as for me it's incredibly generic old british man robot who has an accent even though he doesn't know what earth is? If you're able to put these facts aside, the film was very fun to watch. I enjoyed seeing all the returning character and honestly got emotional at some parts I won't spoil, but needless to say i'm surprised I nearly shed a tear for a Michael Bay Transformers film. In the end, Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a pure fun action romp with several issues. Its issues aside, it still makes for a fun adventure that is sure to please fans of the franchise young and old.My Rating: 7.2/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

An action-packed movie filled with special effects, slowmotion, and may i say, awesome fight-scenes. It has everything you want to see in a hot summernight. You can sum it up: 80% action-packed fight and demolition scenes. 20% storyline. - Or at least what i thought about it after.

It was just far far too long, in my opinion. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay, and the first Transformers film wasn't exactly the best but I voted it a 6/10. But the action sequences were so, so repetitive. I was glad that Bay chose not to film them way too close up this time, like he did in the first film, but it just seemed to be the typical Baysplosion sequence over and over again. Not to mention the now-overused Bullet Time sequence that seems to be in every summer action movie nowadays. It's so overused even The Simpsons Movie did it. If there were no slow-motion sequences in Revenge of the Fallen the runtime would be at least half an hour shorter. Another complaint I have is the same as one I had with the first film - too much humans, not enough Transformers. Shia's whole mental breakdown thing made me cringe, and all those pointless scenes with his mom at the start - if I wanted to see a stoner movie, I would have gone to see one.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

Whether it's the pristine CGI work that glistens with a glisten only glistening diamonds could pay for, or the high-name actors, director, writers and just about everything else involved in a production bigger and grander than your wildest imagination—well, sort of. You see, despite the fact that a single cluster of pixels within a single frame of Rise of the Fallen's two and a half hour tour de force of computer generated action, explosion and all abound balls to the wall ruckus fest is probably worth more than the car you drove to see the thing—despite this overarching sense of Hollywood spectacle, glamour and Event phenomena that so often surrounds major productions such as this, the overall effect is akin to finding a very large pastry that has taken the form of a succulent meat pie... without the meat.Yet following in the footsteps of an original feature that just about stunk to the high heavens in spite of its major budget and fancy effects, even the most optimistic of primes wouldn't be at fault for suspecting foul play at hand here. Even more unsurprising however is that Transformers 2 isn't by any means an improvement on its predecessor; sure enough, it makes everything bigger, blows more stuff up and achieves being a landmark in terms of cinematic effects, but is it any good? No, it's not. Following on almost directly from the previous feature, this follow up reintroduces the familiar faces of Optimus Prime, Megatron and Sam Witwicky and brings a few more into the game just to ""freshen"" things up a little. The story, which takes about the length of a regular film to actually get moving, is slow, plodding and completely uninvolving. As usual, the basic threat is that the evil robots want to destroy the Earth and humanity along with it, and all the humans, good robots with senses of humour and a Kid With A Destiny attempt to kick all those party pooper robots back to where they came from. Ho-hum, right? Well yes, but then again a lot of action blockbusters take on the same basic premise and make it work. So what makes Transformers 2 the flat pancake of ideas that it is? Simple; there are no real characters here, the plot takes far too long to develop beyond anything rudimentary, and the special effects—although dazzling—take up far too much screen time away from those characters and story-lines that we should be paying attention to.As much as I like to play the characterisation horn however, there remains the question of how, if even possible, these men and women that occupy an adventure story so grand as Rise of the Fallen could ever truly steal the screen away from those fancy pixels. Well, the answer lies not too far away with writers Orci and Kurtzman's earlier blockbuster hit of the summer, Star Trek. Although far from perfect, Trek was an example of action done at the whim of character and plot rather than the other way around. Sure, it might not be quite as dazzling as Bay's outing here, yet Abrams also stood on firm ground by revolving his tension and climaxes around character conflict and tangible action. With Transformers there's an unsettling amount of irreverent inconsequence inherent to its lack of will; the pieces on the board move around on their own, change shape and have it out with each other, and yet there is little emotion or thrill to all the gun fights and flying shards of scrap metal. The characters—if you can even call them such—are just as useless.Yet it could be argued that each franchise stands on its own separate ground. With Transformers you have Bay and Megan Fox and in Star Trek you have Kirk and Abrams. When Fox struggles most of the movie to make more of an impression than her CGI backgrounds (and rather ironically too often looks even less realistic than most of them thanks to her excessive makeup fit for a circus clown) and the many feigned attempts at romance between her and co-star LaBeouf feel overly stilted and blasé, it isn't hard to see that the very palette that the film-makers have to work with here is very different. But then again, Fox in a way perfectly embodies the movie perfectly—nice to look at sure, as long as you avoid the suntanned puffer fish clown face and the whole, personality thing that's missing underneath. When it comes down to it, Rise of the Fallen is certainly this year's biggest movie, but it's also one of the most disappointingly trivial. Between expansive fight scenes and wise-cracking robots, the landscape portrayed by mega-star director Michael Bay here is lifeless and completely uninteresting. Those who crave nothing more than CGI robot kung-fu will lap this popcorn-fest up with vigour while the rest of us will simply have to sit back and try to ignore all that cash going down the proverbial drain. Yet that is, surprisingly, Transformers 2's biggest success—the comedy. Again, Orci and Kurtzman provide an amusing amount of comedic relief for audiences to breathe within throughout, giving the movie lighter, much more engaging side. Yet even so, the biggest pun here unfortunately is the cacophony of nothingness that is Rise of the Fallen with its endlessly pointless and forgettable drivel that permeates this multi-million polygonal excuse for a movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

He seems to concentrate more on the action of the movie and less about story and character development. That might be good for some of you, but for the rest of us... Transformers 2 was Michael Bay at his best. All action and no story or character development. I must admit, I loved the first film and thought to myself, wow, maybe Mr. Bay is beginning to grow up. Nope. I was wrong. He butchered the Transformers franchise. The autobots that were in the first film really never had any kind of character development in this film. Most of the film they were missing. The movie was too long. A lot of the going to college scenes could have been cut out. They were irrelevant to the story. The fight scenes between the transformers were hard to follow because most of them were the same colors. Prime and Bumblebee were my favorites. A plus to the movie was the effects. They were great and really deserve to be nominated for an Oscar. You can tell they put a lot of effort into them. The beginning of the film was better then the second half. Still, go see the film. It's worth a watch. Just go to the bathroom before you see it. I made that mistake.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

When coming to watch this movie I expected to see cool alien robots, intense fighting scenes, amazing graphics and Megan Fox. Michael Bay and company did wonderfully in fulfilling these requirements, but the problem is they also added lots of useless subplot, bad jokes and too many minor characters. Acting was spotty at times, but heavily integrating a romance into the movie was extremely ineffective and lame. The minor characters are a waste of time other than a handful of scenes where they actually do something useful. There are new robots which I suppose are to make it seem more like a war rather than just a small feud, but they are poorly integrated and do not have interesting backgrounds or purposes. Add in lots of crude humor, very little suspense, and the movie becomes a strong but empty shell.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sam decides to put on his old shirt from the first film, when he takes it out, a piece of the cube falls out. He picks it up and it imprints a bunch of alien text into his brain. Anyways, bad robots are after this information, good robots must protect him, people run in slow motion, Megan Fox looks hot, someone wants to destroy the sun, they require help from robots so old they use walking canes and then Boom. Something explodes. This is Transformers in a nutshell. The film is so confused on what it's intentions are that it has to literally have one character ask the plot of the film from another. This actually happens.A sequel to Transformers has to be bigger and louder, or else what would the point be right? Michael Bay seems to be an advocate of ""We Can Fix It In Post"" or ""We'll Throw Some CGI At It"". This is never a good sign and this film is a prime example. For starters, the film is too long. It has unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the film. Seeing Sam's mother on drugs for comedic relief is not funny, it's rather eye rolling. This is screen time that could have been giving to develop a bit more of a story, or been axed all together and shave of 20 minutes of failed comedy.You simply cannot rely on Giant Robots Fighting as a draw for the audience. You need to give them substance, something this film lacks. For one, the main villain from the first one, good old Megatron, takes orders from some dude on a random planet. This guy is the ""Fallen"" and he returns to earth to destroy the sun, blah, blah, blah he has very little screen time. We don't feel the threat. Speaking of very little screen time, let's look at the main stars of this piece. No, not LaBeouf or Fox, the Autobots. The main reason this movie will make money is because of them and they get shafted hard here. Aside from Prime and Bumblebee, every other Autobot is basically background filler. With one key scene in the beginning, then nothing else. Why alienate the fan base that warranted a sequel in the first place. Oh wait, I forgot, they do focus on some Transformers. They are called the twins, speak jive, can't read and one has a gold tooth.The entire film feels like Bay is just trying to out due himself. I can picture him on the set thinking how to make things seem bigger and more hectic, without giving a damn about the script. A script that is full of pages that read character jumps from explosion here, character runs from explosion there, character screams. But hey, what did I expect from a Bay flick right? Well, he did do The Rock and the first Transformers was really good. The final battle scene in that flick had more going for it, here I couldn't give a damn.Megan Fox, sure she is hot, but can she act? Not if we are going on this performance. Her orange skin was distracting in the first flick, this time it's her big Jolie lips. Labeouf? His role consists of the aforementioned running and screaming. I didn't know who was who, a problem from the first film. The robots, now I consider myself to have basic knowledge of the Transformers universe. but I couldn't tell what was what unless they were specifically mentioned, like Starscream or Soundwave. I finally figured if I see a robot, it has to be an evil one because that's all they seemed to be focusing on. Where was Barricade? The cop car that mysteriously disappears from the first film before the climactic battle. I thought they would bring him back here and mention that, but nothing. Instead we get a 5 second cameo from Scorponok, the one who tunnels underground, before he gets lights out. There is a new character, who basically plays the role Anthony Anderson played in the first one, a tech geek. His only purpose is to re-introduce Turturro.I wanted more from this film. We all know going into a Bay film we will get this, has he given up on giving us anything more? Has it been dumbed down to us guessing just how many explosions he will use in his films now? Too many, for this one. Giant robots fighting each other is cool, but we've seen it once. Is the only thing you're going to offer us is the same thing in a different setting? Change the city to a forest and some pyramids and it's all good? In defense of the flick, the special effects are top notch, they are epic. They look great up on the big screen and that's where you should see this flick, if you have any interest at all. The big screen and loud sound was made for this flick. The fight sequences are interesting, even if the last one drags on too long. The idea behind the this film is good, the whole history and origins of the Transformers, but instead of diving deeper into that, they wanted to blow stuff up.Too many characters (did we really need a robot chick who looked like she belonged in Terminator 3), too many robots (and the ones we actually care about are left for background filter), and an overblown and overly long film. This film could have been 20 minutes shorter. Transformers feels hollow inside. The first film had heart, this one is just dread. It will please the target audience of teenage boys who want to see things blow up or Megan Fox run in slow motion. But for everyone else, it's just another summer blockbuster that is louder then the original","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma. Since the movie tries to put some sort of emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem.

Do we really need mom getting stoned off a brownie? Dog humping, robots humping seriously, and why did Fox have to do a wardrobe change? It made absolutely no sense other than ""let have Fox do a strip tease"".The icing on the cake was when Devistator (The big construction robot) was tearing apart the pyramid and the agent is ""below the ball sack"".

That's what Michael Bay does. He doesn't make wholesome stuff like Dark Knight or Wall-E. He isn't trying to. Why? Because we eat it up anyways. Should we expect better? Yes. Should we eat better? Yes. Are we going to stop? No. There will always be a place for popcorn and the Michael Bay film.Michael Bay. You either tolerate him or you hate him. He is who he is and he doesn't try to be anyone else. I don't care for him but don't hate him. If you've seen his other films you know what you're getting. They are all basically the same loud explosions and hot women. His films should be better, and would be if they were handled by someone else, but if you take them for what they are they're usually enjoyable.This film is more of the same. If you saw T1 you know what to expect. If you loved the first you'll probably enjoy this one. If you didn't care for T1 your opinion won't change. Some stuff is better, some is worse, and some is exactly the same.What's better?Now that we know the story the movie dives right into good old robot action. Now instead of five minutes of people being told what's going on they can just do things. They don't have to explain who Optimus is, he can just transform, roll out, and kick butt.Bay figured out how to show the bots fighting in the film. Last time the camera was five feet away and you couldn't tell who's foot or arm that was and what was going on. This time Bay pulled the camera back so we could see the robots in their full glory. A vast improvement.Speaking of robot action, Optimus kicks serious butt. In the first he had two fights, one was too short and the other he was mostly losing. This time he's taking on three at once and he's fighting enemies twice his size. Optimus fans won't be disappointed.The Decepticons actually get their own scenes and get to do more than just spout a line or two and randomly destroy things. Megatron and Starscream get more bickering. It's not quite like their original series appearance but they do more than in T1.In T1 the Autobot's dialog, especially in their intro, were too campy. This time it's much more real. They're not talking like an 80s cartoon anymore but like someone from today. There's no Optimus saying ""My bad.""What's the same?Plenty of big, fun, loud action sequences. If you don't like those things, why are you going to see a Michael Bay film? It's what he does and he does it well. The explosions and CGI look top notch.Megan Fox continues to be the best looking character in the film. Bay isn't afraid to show he is a man. He clearly loves making hot women look sexy. More than he likes making robots look cool.Bay can't figure out what to cut from the film. There's still too many scenes that distract from the plot and go on far too long. There was Sam looking for the glasses in the first, and there's Judy getting high in this one. Bay may love that character and think those scenes are the best but they could have been cut down and the movie would flow so much better. I just wanted those scenes to get over with and move on. There's a dozen scenes that simply go on too long that could have been cut down and gotten the same effect. A half hour could have easily have been cut.What's worse?The Twins will go down as Bay's Jar Jar Binks. Like Jar Jar you can't help but notice the racial undertones. Bay's reasoning that he wants more personality in the bots is a poor excuse for useless racism. Like Jar Jar they pull attention away from other useful bots. They serve no purpose in the story other than to be funny. Like Jar Jar their humor is poor and pulls attention from the successful humor of Bumblebee. Bumblebee was a great comedic relief because it didn't come off as stupid, but this time he has few funny moments.There's about 40 bots in the film but only 8 or 9 are explored in any way. It's nice that they included more fan favorites but not when you rarely see them let alone hear them speak. I would have much preferred that Arcee taken the Twin's places in the story. She might have given Mikaela someone to talk to rather than complaining. While Starscream and Megatron have more time all the other returning bots have less.This movie is all over the place in terms of plot. The first was simple: find the Allspark and protect it. This film they're trying to defeat the Decepticons, protect Sam, find a couple of different objects, destroy some machine, and defeat the Fallen. Problem is there's so little plot to begin with that dividing it up makes it worse.The first one blew me away because it was so much better than I thought it would be. This one is about what I expect from Bay. I enjoyed it but not quite like the first one. The first one I wished that there were a few things better.

I can't believe I got ""forced"" into watching this *beep*. The first one was OK but by the end of this one I was almost asleep.Lets start with the basics. The characters were mostly empty as hell and uber-cliché. The humor? I'm not even sure retarded monkeys will laugh at some of these jokes. I'm not a Michael Bay hater, in fact I like most of his films but this one was an extreme step down.The only light spots were the always amazing John Torturro and a comic relief old-timer robot. Oh and the special effects were great of course, I have to give it points for that. But the action was so over done. If you get excited by explosions and gunfire this could be the film for you but there was so much of it that it became extremely tiring.My advice is to do what I did for multiple months. Stay the hell away from it. If you see a copy scream, run and hide. This can't possibly be worth 2 and a half hour of anyone's life. This is a bad movie. 3/10.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

This Movie is by a long stretch the best Block Buster of the Summer. It is superior to the very good original in almost every way. Michael Bay does a fantastic job of building suspense throughout the Movie to the extent that by the time the final battle comes you are literally on the edge of your seat. Anybody who I spoke to after said they thoroughly enjoyed it, some went so far as to say it was as good as the Dark Knight (not quite in my opinion), which should go some way to explaining how enjoyable this Movie is.

While this sequel to the previous action-packed thriller may have had an okay story, it was not all that well directed. The action goes a little to far (or at least feels like it if it hasn't compared to the first film) and seems to have enough military hardware to start, like World War III AND IV. Honestly, it's cool and all, and I really like these action thrillers, but sometimes it's just not all about the action or the cool sound effects itself that makes a good movie of it's genre. Long story short, I like these movies as cool visually-stunning fantasy war zones, but not as much in a ""movie"" type sense.

The first Transformers movie was a so good adaptation that I was completely delighted with it... but this one... this is something else. Like first, there is suddenly a bunch of funny robots that are doing too much human things, and too much stupid things so they easily insult you intelligence, the least what I expected to see is an old robot which we see as ""old"" because he needs a walking stick and he has a metal beard?! And suddenly a character in the movie dies but later they find a way to revive it, and then another character dies so they find a way to revive him too, and some of the characters that died in the first Transformers movie get revived also... and then, big finale, another character sacrifices himself to give power to another... too much dying and reviving for me. Sometimes I had an impression I'm watching a drama. (I do not want to say what characters because I don't want this to be a spoiler)Well, the positive sides... the visual effects are very impressive indeed. Actually, they are right as I expected, but they are somehow buried under all this boring drama atmosphere. What I also noticed, in one scene that lasts for a few seconds, the rendered robots (autobots) do not fit the camera-recorded background perfectly... but let's say we can forget that. The humor is pretty good too, but just as I said, because of that humor, the sci-fi part paid it's price.The best, and most original characters in the movie according to me: Agent Simmons, Optimus Prime, and the little remote-controlled-car decepticon.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

From childhood onwards I have seen a lot of Michael Bay's films and almost all of his films carry the same tone, the tone of teenage spirit, the exciting rushness of doing this or that plus the teenage aspirations. Transformers 2 is also no exception. The only difference between this film and his rest is that of the topic chosen. This time the topic chosen is technology, yes electronics to be specific. All throughout the movie it depicted more or less the obsessive traits for electronics generally seen among teenagers. The statement 'If God created us then who created them ? ' in somewhere reflects well about it. The creator is ofcourse Hollywood or Michael Bay and his crew. When all these passion for electronics combines with the extra terrestrials, imagine the heat of restlessness, not to mention about Bay's likewise much needed intellectual cinematographic appraisals, action cuts and splendid visuals.Transformers 2 is a well thought out plan as a sequel, where exciting level is at a high zone, characters all been possessed by the younger traits, reflecting their thirst for genius attitude, lacks the serenity because of sudden appearance of wisdom oriented science in one of the most beautiful and happiest places of USA. Bay didn't stay confined in it rather included the wonders of the world like the great Pyramid, the place where spirituality is preferred higher than technology, at least in modern times. In climax all these creative aspects of High scientific truth, religio-political scenario, the wonderous landscapes with ancient myths fuses into one in the desert where Bay even remembered to point the resurrection concept. The seriousness within the film in some scenes well reflected seriousness but most are not like that, rather are funny. Only Autobots and Decepticons are serious in the film, nevertheless the film has strong logics behind all the tiny situations going around. But a few has flaws like Sam entering the security of Egyptians police etc, whichyou better ignore to enjoy the film.Technically the film is awesome, impresssive camera works, stunning romance and action, with BGM at an average. The performance of Shia la beouf is enough to entertain you, atleast I would say he saved the spirit of the film. My most favourite funny scene is that of where one character says 'A place of peace, - Shut up Grandma', and serious stuff like transformation into futuristic gadgets. For an entertaining film like this, I have written the review a bit seriously but you don't need to be serious, neither you should expect seriousness from this movie. It's a total entertainment film with tiny bits of almost everything you could think of, family friends, science, faith, myths, action, romance, politics, cars, women, sacrifice, extra terrestials, good, bad etc. Though I liked it, I reserved it for specific moments, not for genuine experience, due to lacking the serenity of progress but rather for getting relaxed and fun. A film satisfying teenage fantasies combo into one, intended for entertainment only and I was entertained in the 1st-2nd watch.A 7/10. A 73/100.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It found the right balance between the human and Autobot stories. Yet here, we get treated to a teen movie with the Transformers taking a support role. It's really grating and the first part of the movie is just terrible.Mid-movie, it starts to come together yet we still get dragged into this stupid love story. It really starts to come together when John Turturro makes an appearance. He's a wonderful actor and is a funny counterpart to Shia LaBeouf - who is pretty woeful up until that point. Megan Fox feels lifeless through-out and is there purely for male fantasy purposes - no surprises there. While both LaBeouf and Fox have little to work with, they don't ever try to excel in their roles either.Going into the last act, we finally get treated to what we all wanted to see. It's pretty wonderful to watch it all unfold and will satisfy the true fans to some degree, but it by no means saves an average action flick.I'm not sure if the kids will like it. It's a weird one. It has violence and swearing that I would not expose a child to. Yet the theatre was full of them...it really doesn't seem to know if it's doing the whole adult thing or if it's aimed at the kids. It really is detrimental.I was expecting more from this sequel. The music is nice, the graphics are awesome and some of the shots we are treated to are delightful. Yet poor editing rears its ugly head at times, both in terms of errors and the tempo at which it moves; it often feels disjointed.Nevertheless, it's okay. This isn't must-see stuff and I don't think young kids should be exposed to the language and violence nor should it be aimed at them in the way that it is done.Transformers fans won't get much out of this either. But the final act made all the terrible build-up worthwhile. 6/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The effects on the Transformers are good but they don't have any definable personalities.There are a lot of unnecessary scenes or scenes that don't connect to plot, while also not following the rules they set up in the first movie. This made me question a lot of moments.The action scenes and fight scenes would cut a lot making it difficult to understand what is going on. There was a cool fight in a forest that was well shot but most of the scenes were hard to look at.The movie was 2 hours and 29 minutes, but it felt longer when I was watching it.

I thought it had some cool moments in it and I did enjoy it, but thought that the movie had a little too much out of place comedy and that their coverage of many of the robot fights wasn't too hot.In Revenge of the Fallen, Bay's moved on from showcasing intensely blurry closeups of Optimus Prime's ankle to providing proper titanic scale battles that aren't covered using MTV's camera crew. The level of action really blew me away and I was quite impressed with the visual effects which I thought were way beyond what they were able to do in the first film. Granted there's a good deal of human drama in there too, done in Michael Bay's typical cheesified style. It's fun to watch, the new ""girl"" providing a nice twist to the standard love triangle idea.Revealing the ancient history of the autobots and decepticons further was interesting and even if they were a bit nauseating at times, I liked the hyperactive minibots that they brought in. My only problems were the runtime, which was a bit excessive, and the lack of characterization with the Fallen guy.Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think it's got the energy and feeling of excitement that the first one lacked a little. It feels more like a proper film than an overly long montage, and thrilled me much more than Terminator 4 ever could. Definitely recommended for all action and sci-fi fans out there!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'd say the special effects, good acting, canned laughter, and well laid out story line bring it up to at least a 5/10.Honestly, there isn't really much to say about this film, it's just like all of the other big summer action block busters designed to transform (er dumb down) our brains and let us just sit back and enjoy the eye candy. With the seamless special effects, the smoking hot actress, and non-stop action, this movie delivers in spades.Though you have to wonder how the industry is producing these types of movies - in other words, they are forced to dumb down and play safe bets. This was a big budget film and hence had to see big profits to turn around the costs - perhaps ironically at our expense.Both Transformers movies have a quality - they take us back to our childhoods. My problem with this was I felt more like a fool instead of child by prescribing to any of it. Between dealing with the movie-zombie packed parking lot (weekday late night), the Facebookers raving reviews, the audience laughing at the dumbest one-liners, human emotions of the robots (including dry humping), the low IQ 'jive' Negro robots, etc etc. developed a very obnoxious social meme around this film. Call me high flatulent, but this was simply too much for me to take, or accept.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

If I examined this movie like a critic or a film-student (you know who you are), I guess I'd be inclined to knock off a couple of points.That aside, I found the movie to be enjoyable. I have several problems with the movie (i.e. lack of story and general poor direction), but that did not take away from how fun it was to watch. Sure the humor was sophomoric, and the acting a bit labored, but how is it much different than most (if not summer movies)? Don't use the example of Dark Knight or Ironman, those movies involved ""real"" people. Can anyone make a movie about super-giant robots and hope for the depth that movies concerning human beings could? I seriously doubt it.Not every movie is meant for us to re-examine ourselves and figure out why our lives suck or is without meaning, sometimes we go watch a movie to have fun, watch stuff blow up, see a hot chick, laugh at dumb jokes, etc.For all of you who are ""above it,"" (i.e. every film student and twenty-something college dweeb who thinks mainstream = evil - thankfully most of us grow out of that at some point) need to get over yourselves and stop taking everything so seriously.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was forward to this one so I seen it on the IMAX and I hated it right from start to end. There was absolutely no story and so painfully boring throughout. The movie had so many ridiculous jokes (mostly sexual) that were not even a jot funny and they actually embarrass you.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen tried its level best to be as entertaining as possible but it actually had the opposite effect. Anyone who has liked this torture device should go see a doctor.This is probably the second movie after The Dark Knight with IMAX scenes and even those scenes were awful, they were not well made and were merged to normal scenes. So there was an IMAX scene for a few seconds then a normal scene then IMAX until it drives you mad. The Dark Knight had amazing IMAX scenes. Anyway after I seen this stupid movie I had a headache for about a few hours. Overall it is the biggest let-down of the year after Spider Man 3.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

There are just a few issues that really stood out in my mind after the screening. I would have to say that the film makers must have decided to ignore geography. We the audience are not stupid. I know that it is a movie, but when you make a movie that takes place in the ""Real World"" you can't exit or enter a building in one city and all of a sudden be in a totally different ""obvious"" location. Or even time of day for that matter, without some sort of explanation. On top of the lack of correctly placing world landmarks in the proper geographical locations and distances, there was a serious sense of forced humor. In the first film the humor was just there, it fit... in this film it's forced on you and feels a bit off-putting. Transformers 1 (2007) and for the most part this film, depicts the Decepticons as a serious threat to mankind and tries to take it seriously. That makes the dialog for some of the characters need to really be re-written. It didn't fit with the overall feel of the films.In addition, I noticed throughout the film that several sequences ended or were somewhat out of order without being explained... It left me asking, ""whatever happened to so and so?"", or ""Why did they say that?"". I could understand if those were the parts in a film that would be answered in a sequel... but these weren't those types of situations.Also, in the first film each transformer was unique. I could not tell who was who in Transformers 2. I was really hoping to see somewhat recognizable characters. It almost seemed like they did a bit of cut and paste to fill some sequences. I thought I even saw characters used in Transformers 1 that had been killed off It made me wonder ""did they get brought back and if so when and how?"" It did make for more action on screen, but I could have dealt with less and still been okay with it.I think with a few additional scenes that explain certain situations as well as a re-edit and a bit of re-scripting (can you say ""re-scripting the Twins""), I could give this a 10. It was good... The fight scenes were cool. I am probably going to see it another time to see if I missed anything... but, it could be SO much better with a little more work. Go see it and let me know what you think of it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, there are a few things I saw that I did NOT like. #1, near the end, I know I saw a short, maybe a few seconds, of 2 scenes from the first movie. A shot of the Raptor (that should have a prop-engine but has a jet) and a shot of the AWACS radar plane. Also, that same scene looks like it was filmed in the exact same spot. #2, how did they break out of a door of the Smithsonian in DC into a plane graveyard in the desert? #3, I know movies are not allowed to have perfect military uniforms, but as in the first Transformers, they really, really messed up the Army uniforms, BAD.

Incomprehensible both visually and narratively, devoid of characterisation with a script that might be the worst of the year. And completely over-sexed, which is a pretty weird direction to go in for a film about asexual alien robots. Somehow offensive and boring at the same time. None of the actors involved get away without embarrassing themselves, and the handful of robots who have any kind of personality are horrible racial stereotypes. Others have invoked the name of Jar Jar Binks in reference to this movie, and if you're masochistic enough to go and see it you'll realise why. And, painfully juvenile, the film also has a dirty mouth, likely the explanation for the 12a rating here in the UK. It's not for kids.

They seem to be saying something along the lines of: ""this is an awful film and I can't believe everyone is still going to watch it and it will still make lots of money."" Well really, what did they expect? This is not full of drama and amazing acting, this is not going to teach you a moral lesson or change your view of the world. This is a popcorn movie intended to show you lots of explosions and exciting action scenes, and on that count Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen succeeds brilliantly. Why should every film be about perfect acting and drama? Why can't we be allowed to enjoy a popcorn movie without being called stupid? Why are the so called 'smart' films so acclaimed, while the popular films that keep the movie business running are ridiculed? I could complain about this forever, but instead I'll describe the film. Firstly, the storyline. You don't need to have seen the first film to understand what's going on, although I suppose it would help. The plot is certainly not simple but as with most films like this you don't need to follow the plot to understand what's basically going on: bad evil robots trying to destroy the world while the good robots and humans try to stop them. It's far more complicated than that, there were a few moments when I lost track of what exactly was happening, but you can still enjoy the film nonetheless.The acting is alright, there were no moments that felt out of place. The parents were both superb, completely hilarious at all the right moments yet able to switch to serious and terrified when required. The two leads were also good, Shia LaBeouf felt natural while Megan Fox was perhaps used more for her looks than anything else. There were a few moments that were obviously placed just to show off how perfect her body is, but I'm guessing the male half of the population won't see that as a fault. There are also some fun new transformers added to the cast, and the voice acting is excellent. There are a lot of supporting characters, many of them get some great one liners, some however felt a little unnecessary, but they're all played well.As for the CGI, it's simply astounding. The mind boggles at the thought of how much work went into this film and how much it must have cost. Every detail is perfect, every action scene gloriously orchestrated. This is a film with so many explosions, so many guns and tanks and jets and, of course, transformers, that not a moment goes by when you're not entertained. Is it used in excess? Are the special effects the only reason to see this film? Perhaps. But why should that be a bad thing? I went in to the cinema expecting to be amazed and I was.It's not all positive. There are some jokes that fall a little flat, some moments that feel contrived and the end is a little predictable. It's probably not as good as the first movie. Yet the critics are wrong, this is not a bad film. It set out to be an action film with great special effects and it is certainly worth seeing if you enjoyed the first or just want to see explosions. Maybe the fact that everyone is going to see it and it's going to make a lot of money should prove that the critics' definition of a 'good' film is sorely lacking. Whatever the case, I for one am looking forward to hearing the inevitable news that there will be a Transformers 3. If the special effects are getting better and better, I can't wait to see what they're going to do next.My score: 7/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Special effects - you can really see the money they spent.2. John Turturro - his performance seemed incredibly credible (pun intended) and he outclassed the other actors.What I didn't like about the movie: 1. Script - there was almost no story and the story that was there (a battle with a pretty bad ass villain) was put aside to make way for a big dose of unfunny comedy (for every joke that worked, 50 other didn't), unnecessary subplots (noone gives a damn about a romance between 2 cardboard cutouts, we want giant robots fighting) and bad dialogue (it looked like they were making this up on the spot).2. The cast - everyone except Mr Turturro gave an average performance at best and the 2 leads were the worst actors in the movie (Shia has made a career out of shouting one-syllable words repeatedly and Megan Fox really is as untalented as the critics say).3. The characters - you know a movie is bad when the characters are 1-dimensional (Character development? What's that?), most of them are comic relief but none of them is funny (again, the credit goes to the script writers) or necessary (this movie could do fine without the college roommate crybaby or the idiot from the government).4. Action sequences - whoever choreographed them has no imagination (You can do ANYTHING with that budget and you go with this? Especially the final battle was weak).I can't say anything else about it because I don't remember much, even though I saw this yesterday.My opinion: hire professionals for the 3rd one.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

Clearly. Simply wanted to say a few things..... Firstly, anyone who would go to see the sequel of a movie that they didn't like, must be beyond idiotic. Also, comparing any incredibly influential director(i.e. Hitchcock, Welles, Kubrick etc.) to modern day directors is just plain ridiculous. I'm sick of hearing it. Really. To me, that's like comparing Alexander Graham Bell to Steve Jobs. In a way they are similar, but in many more ways they are not. Same thing goes for a classic cult film and a brand spankin' new cinematic blockbuster. Two different beasts. If you have expectations that an action movie would be nothing less than a masterpiece, especially one with fictional robots, then I would be overjoyed to know that you are disappointed. Just don't ruin it for most everyone else by giving low reviews, and justifying those reviews with nonsense. You don't go to McDonald's awaiting nutritious, healthy eats only to be surprised when they hand you a greasy cheeseburger and fries. Seriously people, just use your heads and form your own opinions.

Totally a Jar-Jar Binks character the two of them, lame idea. It was almost comical that the Hot Megan Fox was airbrushing a bike while straddling it, I laughed along with a lot of other people behind me. Just make it original PLEASE! She would of looked just as hot if she were painting it like a real person! The effects were awesome, the forest fight was by far the best part of the movie. The only time the movie theater was silent really! The rest of the time there were to many people laughing. Some comedy is good, to much and it really disappoints. And I can't leave out the sissy roommate cyber computer guru that was a total sissy, can you edit out his character as well as the two lame Chevy robots. Maybe in the third one they will add a bonafide Alien from area 51..LOL..um Spielberg! He could transform his saucer and turn into a robot Indiana Jones with a laser whip. Overall it was a great movie for effects and new bad robots they previewed, but I would edit out a lot of the movie. I would of shown more of the robots and less humans. But our military kicks A@#!~~","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.So there it was. The trailer. Played on the silver screen. It looked darker than the previous film. The tagline ""Revenge is coming"" reinforces that aspect. It excited me. This could really be a serious, dark movie, like THE DARK KNIGHT. I was wrong. So wrong. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I was insane hoping for a serious, dark, gritty action flick from Michael Bay. In fact, the trailer doesn't show any of the crude and sexual humor throughout the film. And you know what? I found the jokes pretty funny. Sure, some of the jokes are just disgusting (you'd be surprised what lays hidden in this movie), but I liked the laid back feel.The plot was...confusing, I will admit, but in a film like this, does it really matter? The movie never ceases to be entertaining. The action sequences are amazing, but directed by Michael Bay, it's not surprising. If there is one thing I have to say about him, he knows how to entertain audiences. And he was right when he said there would be more action scenes in the film. You thought the first movie had a lot of action scenes? Oh, God, I wouldn't even begin. To keep it simple, the special effects are nothing short of being flawless. I loved the score by Steve Jablonsky, most of it being brought back from the first movie.In an interview with Megan Fox, the sexy actress said the following: ""This movie is not about acting."" And she's right. I can go on saying that the humans in the films were actually the robots, but that's not particularly true. You have to give credit to Shia LaBeouf's part, at least. He does a swell job, given the material. I found John Turturro to be quite annoying in the first film but the producers or writers decided it was a good idea to bring him back. I still found him annoying in the film and I especially rolled my eyes when he was doing a serious scene.This goes along with Sam's parents in the film, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, although I don't find them quite as annoying. In fact, I enjoyed most of their scenes. They give some good comic relief throughout the film. I just didn't like them being serious because you just can't take them seriously. The writers apparently thought Ramon Rodriguez's character was a good idea. I just really hated him. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also returned for the sequel, although they don't have much to do. Overall, the whole cast pretty much had one thing to do: Run in slow motion.With all the positives, there was no doubt some negatives. The most obvious is the overly long running time. I don't think Michael Bay ever made a movie less than two hours. I would've liked the movie if it were thirty minutes shorter. It was until the third act that I realized how long the movie was going to be. It started to meander a bit after that and there came a point in the film that there was just overkill. The movie was just really long. Another thing that annoyed me was a pair of twin Transformers. Actually, add another Transformer. All three of them were yelling profanity throughout. Not my thing.If you walk into the movie with the right mindset, you'd be surprised that you had enjoyed most of the film. The action sequences are just fantastic but the plot is lacking. The actors don't have much to do but to run around and scream. But really, what are you going to expect when you walk into a Michael Bay film? A plot? Great performances? A delightful script? Nah. You'd expect action. Action. And did I mention action?","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

A movie that was trying to be adult (hence the swearing as well as the drug related and sexual scenes) but ended up being even more childish then the cartoon series.Obviously, it was a teenage boy's movie. Action, explosions, ball jokes and Megan Fox were all delivered along side a paper thin plot which moaned with an awful number of references to ""destiny"" and ""fate"" to try keep the whole thing noble and 'King Arthur'-like. It failed no doubt. The villain was a disgustingly overseen stereotype (which character wasn't?); he was evil for the sake of being evil, and able to be destroyed with a slight push. Everyone saw the ending coming, which to be fair, was expected even before entering the cinema. Huge holes became apparent in the plot 'How the hell did the parents get to Egypt?'. I don't care if there is some long-winded, off-screen explanation, it didn't fit at all.All the comic-relief robots (including the small robot with the New Jersey accent and the two wannabe-ghetto twin robots) were highly irritating and only added more to the juvenile delivery of the movie. 'Oh, how hilarious! A fire-farting robot is humping Megan Fox's leg!! And Megan Fox doesn't even look surprised at all by it..' Even the parents reached a new level of trying to be outrageous in order to be even more hilarious then they were in the first movie. Mother on drugs did you say? How awfully outrageous! Apart from: no plot, the rapid overuse of boring stereotypes, pointless and repetitive action scenes, the over-selling of sex via Fox and the robot-lady. It was okay. It did keep my attention through the duration of the movie (even if it was the gawk in astonishment at the resistance of Megan Fox's indestructible make up which did not smudge or wear off at all during the entire course of the film) which is the primary goal of a movie. Well done....","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Don't expect an Oscar performance because frankly your not going to get it neither are you going to get a solid plot line, but thats not the point. Its a sit down and brain off film which its perfect for, a fantastic summer blockbuster.

I finally had the chance to see it yesterday and I have to ask, what is everyone's problem? Everyone is blasting this movie left to right with comments on how it's too long, there's too much action, there's no story what-so-ever, there's gratuitous sexuality, there's blatant racism and stereotypes and so and so forth. This leads me to my next question: what's so different in this movie than what's in other action or sci-fi movies? This movie has a simple storyline with no twists or turns, it's got great action sequences, impressive visual effects, decent acting, and some good chuckles here and there. I agree that there were scenes that were crude or unnecessary, and content mature enough to warrant a 14-A rating rather than PG-13, but find a movie for me that doesn't have at least one instance of racism or crudeness, no matter how ""light-hearted"" it may be, and whether it be a movie for everyone or one for older audiences. Again, as for the action, there was no more or less action in this movie than there was in the first. The acting, storyline and humour was about equal and the visual effects were just as impressive. The problem is that people were expecting 1st prize when really all we were getting was an honourable mention. That honourable mention was exactly what I was expecting and I got exactly what I paid for. I don't want to ramble on so I'll just say that if you're a fan of Transformers, watch this movie. If you love action, watch this movie. If you're bored and looking for something to do, watch this movie. It may not ""wow"" you, but it won't disappoint. It's just another summer blockbuster. Enjoy it. I did.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A lackluster sequel that disappoints on almost everything","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2089371/?ref_=tt_urv","DonFishies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1622466/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2009","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is this year's version of The Dark Knight: the big summer sequel that everyone knows and feels the need to see. Undoubtedly, with the possible exception of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the enigmatic and potential game-changer Avatar, Transformers will be this year's highest grossing film. But looking past these two similarities (and a handful of scenes filmed to take advantage IMAX screens), Transformers and Dark Knight have absolutely nothing else in common. While Dark Knight was a masterpiece and is one of the greatest sequels ever made, Transformers just may be one of the worst.Taking the old adage of bigger is better; Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen revolves around the continuing battle between the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Once again, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is thrust into the middle of the war after he accidentally finds a shard from the AllSpark that was destroyed in the first film. The resulting pulse the shard gives off gets the attention of the surviving Decepticons, as does Sam's weird habit of writing ancient messages that is read mainly by Transformers. And that is where the titular character of The Fallen, the leader of the Decepticons, comes in as he wants to kidnap Sam to use as bait against Optimus Prime.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a busy film that is filled to the brim with ideas and subplots. Virtually everyone in the film has their own storyline and it makes for a movie that has just too much going on. For one thing, it introduces plenty of new Autobots and Decepticons, but the majority is either killed, or does one thing in the film and then is never seen again. They barely even get the time to say one line. New additions to the human cast like Ramon Rodriguez as the conspiracy theorist Leo Spitz, Isabel Lucas' alluring college bombshell Alice and John Benjamin Hickey's punching bag of a government agent Galloway, get very little backstory and are taken out of the film almost as fast as the robots are getting killed. But even the returning cast members (read: practically the entirety of the cast from the original film) get so very little to do that one wonders why they even bothered coming back in the first place.Because the film is so busy, and Michael Bay seems so intent on filling his explosion and action scene quota to quadruple the size of scenes of exposition and explanation, the film virtually moves from point to point on a whim. A character is introduced late in the film merely to explain everything that has happened, and everything that will happen. He has no development; he is merely a plot device. So very little is explained that it gets to the point where things just happen for no reason, and then the audience is given all of a minute to digest what just happened. Characters die, yet no one seems to really mourn for them. They just pick up and soldier on to the ending. And then when scenes actually do become emotional, they get so melodramatic that you wish there was no focus on them.There just seems to be no middle ground in the film. Characters, no matter if they are main or supporting, are saddled with horrible or non-existent lines. I realize the film was cobbled and stitched together during the Writer's Strike, but two of the three credited writers are coming off the excellent redo of Star Trek, which ironically was made by the same company as Transformers. But it was affected by the strike too. How can one film be littered with such a wealth of thought out exposition, while the other is basically hobbled by almost none? But what mangles this film even further is the insistence on being funny. The first film had a bizarre sense of humour that got in the way more than once, but this film is just so over-the-top ridiculous in some scenes that it almost becomes parody. John Turturro is brought back simply to be zany and off kilter and the Autobot ""twins"" Skids and Mudflap are so overtly annoying in their quest to be comic relief that they make Jar Jar Binks look like Brando in The Godfather. But these two examples are just the tip of how much ""funny"" is added into the film. Sex jokes and innuendos are tossed at random (including a scene where a small Decepticon humps Megan Fox's leg), an entirely needless scene with Sam's mom Judy (Julie White) eating ""green brownies"" becomes the focal point of an entire scene, as does a scene involving LaBeouf's odd screaming like a girl. Some of the laughs are genuinely funny, but the majority either fall flat or are totally out-of-place.What is done right, again, are the incredible special effects. It is still amazing to watch these Autobots and Decepticons face off against each other, and even more so when the newer, larger Transformers come into the fold. The entire opening chase scene in Shanghai is simply marvelous to watch (and such a downer by the end since nothing matches up to it at all). Some of the scenes looked incredibly fake however, especially scenes involving human and robot interaction. Not all of these scenes look the same, but it still makes for a bit more added disappointment.If you go into Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen hoping for anything outside of awesome effects, just do not even bother. It may look great, and have amazing effects, but the lack of a cohesive plot, too many characters, and its inane humour is so horribly done that you may insist on getting your money back. So little is done right that I genuinely fear for Transformers III.4/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

However, while it certainly provides a visual spectacle, the film falls short in terms of plot coherence and character development.The story picks up after the events of the first film, with the Autobots continuing to work alongside the military to protect humanity from the Decepticons. When Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf) discovers a piece of the AllSpark shard, he becomes targeted by the Decepticons who seek to revive their fallen leader, Megatron. As the battle between Autobots and Decepticons escalates, Sam and his friends embark on a globe-trotting adventure to uncover the secrets of the Transformers' origins and stop the impending doom.From a visual standpoint, Revenge of the Fallen is a triumph. The CGI effects are stunning, with the Transformers brought to life in breathtaking detail. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and exhilarating, showcasing Bay's talent for creating epic spectacle on screen. The film's larger-than-life battles and jaw-dropping set pieces are sure to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.However, where Revenge of the Fallen falters is in its storytelling. The plot is convoluted and often feels like an excuse to string together action scenes rather than a coherent narrative. Character development takes a backseat to explosions and special effects, leaving many of the human characters feeling one-dimensional and underdeveloped.Additionally, the film has faced criticism for its juvenile humor and racial stereotypes, which detract from the overall experience. While the humor may appeal to some viewers, it often feels out of place in a film that is otherwise focused on epic battles and high-stakes action.Despite its flaws, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen still offers plenty of entertainment for fans of the franchise. The sheer spectacle of the visuals and adrenaline-fueled action sequences make it a thrilling ride from start to finish. However, those looking for a more coherent plot and well-developed characters may find themselves disappointed. Ultimately, Revenge of the Fallen is a film that delivers on its promise of epic robot battles but falls short in other areas.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was exciting watching the great battle sequences, but when the plot slowed down to incorporate the human characters it was just uninteresting. Megan Fox's character was nothing more than eye candy, like the first film.The story revolves around the earth and the transformers having met before the all spark. Megatron is revived using one of the remaining shards from the cube. And he apparently is no master, but the apprentice of a fallen Prime, hence the Fallen. The plot has little coherence with the previous film. The story is completed when the decepticons attempt to activate ""The Machine"", which collects energon and is capable of similar feats to the all spark. Optimus Prime is the only one who can stop the fallen, being a Prime. He does so in rather handy fashion and the movie is left open for another sequel.Beyond the action sequences, the addition of the twins, who act much like rednecks and receive far too much screen time, and RC, the only female transformer, has no influence but to create a more congested world of transformers. The film, just as the first one, must be watched moving from one fight sequence to the next, the in between muck is not worth paying attention to. If you expected more out of Michael Bay you would be sorely sorry with this attempt to create a masterpiece from a beloved franchise.The action sequences balance out the lacking back story and below average acting. The CG is still amazing.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't wanna forget all robo-humping.

I enjoyed seeing Jon Torturro again as crazy former Agent. There is a lot of plenty CGI Action in it and typical for Michael Bay Explosions en mass. The Humor, Dialogues and Plot are made that everybody round the world can easily follow it. It's more difficult to find out which transformer is fighting against whom as to understand the movie.

This was because the first movie was really ahead of it's time with the special effects and the slapstick humor. This put my hopes up for the sequel. I have to admit, however, that when i sat in the theater and the movie progressed, it was quite different from what i initially expected. In most ways, it exceeded my expectations. In other ways though, I have to admit to the various critics, there were some turnoffs. The motion picture was edited in such a way that it became hard to see what was happening. It was fast moving, which is usually OK, but with the combination of the blockbuster special effects, it became sometimes hard-to-follow, not knowing what look at first. Before you realize what's happening, the shot changes to a different angle, and your mind needs to adjust itself yet again. All in all, a VERY tiring movie to watch in one go, but a fantastic movie if there's an intermission thrown in. About 15 minutes should do it, giving you time to relax your brain. That way, this motion picture is worth every penny to see in a theater if you're a fan of the infamous 'bay-ness'. I'm sure that when this film is out on Blu-Ray and DVD, it'll be a must-have for every HD home-cinema set, just like the first movie. And because everything is quite complicated, it will allow you to watch this movie a zillion times without getting tired of it. All in all, a fabulous picture if you like racking your brains from time to time, but not a good choice if you want to relax after doing any stress-related activity.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Took my four year old to this because he loves transformers. He could take a little over an hour and a half and that was about my limit also. Some of the computer generation is well done, BUT 1) you also need interesting plot and characters (the autobots outshine any person here), and 2) this quick-cut music-video directing style during the battle sequences makes it impossible for me to figure out in the least what is happening. I can't imagine my four year old getting it either. Maybe the quick and constant cutting is done to mask some other problem with computer-generated graphics, I don't know, but whatever its reason it really does not work. And besides which, wasn't Michael Bay the guy asking if they could take their ""brewskis"" to the basement in Mystery Men?Hard to figure the target audience for this - the language is above smaller kids, but there ain't much for adults either so I guess it's whatever's in between. This movie reminds me of the decline of computer gaming in the 90s -- when better graphics became available the actual games themselves became much less compelling. This seems like a waste of a lot of people's efforts.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Its the only reason I actually went to see the second one. Cause I knew they would be hilarious and the dynamic that they had between them was perfect.CON's - The robots. I mean they took all the fast moving unsteady shot ideas from the first movie and then over did it again. I mean really bad, then they tried to create gangster robots. (wont tell you more) but really they took professionalism and through it out the window to try to appeal a wider audience. And they also through in some rather crude humor which at first was funny but then kept re-using it and just came off desperate! As far as the plot, well its kind of the same ol same ol, and as for the beginning of the film you get 10 minutes into it and it was still like ""what exactly is going on?"" the film is 20% acting and 80% something whether it be metal, stone, or rocks exploding in fast or slow motion and of course the camera spinning around.I saw this film at an IMAX and I gave it 4 stars cause I haven't had a movie made me that motion sick ever, not even the blurry witch project did it. I know Michael could have done better, they just needed to focus on the plot and story, and not show off the Robots.Kind of like what Spielberg did for Jurrassic park, tone it down and keep it cool! So Id say the first one was better cause it focused on the story and the family was just hilarious, and of course the ""O can do anything I want badge"" fellow!","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Boring, tedious, long, and not that much fun...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2083557/?ref_=tt_urv","the_rattlesnake25","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4038332/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2009","Michael Bay's first 'Transformers' film gave the audience an  entertaining blow of knock-out proportions and I (like many others)  left the cinema with a childish grin from ear-to-ear after watching two  and a half hours of robots beating seven bells of scrap metal out of  each other, however the sequel 'Revenge of the Fallen' felt like  nothing more than a soft jab into the abdomen. I didn't particularly  enjoy it, I found it tedious, incredibly boring at times, and apart  from one or two sequences, the action felt very stale and was concerned  more about how each explosion could out-do each other for the extended  destruction of our dear planet.  So I will start by addressing what made the first film so enjoyable for  me; the action! With the colossal budget and the build-up of  how this was going to be 'bigger' and ultimately 'better', I was  expecting a computer generated onslaught of pure, unadulterated robot-o  et robot-o brutality, but sadly only found two scenes out of the whole  two hours and thirty minutes running time that matched the first film  for childish squealing and prolonged smiling of excitement. One came an  hour into the film as Optimus Prime battled his way spectacularly  through a forest of evil Decepticon Robots at a vicious pace, while the  second scene was at the very end of the film as Bumblebee had a very  short, yet enjoyable tussle with Rampage. Aside from these two; battle,  fight, action (what-ever you wish to call them) sequences, Michael Bay  seemed to be more concerned with how he could create larger and louder  explosions with every rocket being fired, or bomb being dropped. The  perfect example is in the drawn out final sequence in which we are  continually blocked from seeing the actual robotic destruction take  place as the screen fills with copious amounts of dust, smoke and sand  due to the amount of explosives being thrown around! With the  entertainment value slightly eroded for myself, I found little joy in  the rest of the film.  From viewing just the first thirty minutes of 'Fallen' I noticed  Michael Bay seems to have somewhat of a penchant for the use of  pointless long-angle shots and slow-motion sequences. If you removed  all the pointless, unemotional, tedious scenes involving the sour  intimate embraces by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox (which takes the  biscuit in one scene as the camera constantly revolves around both  parties around forty-three times before eventually ending, not only the  most annoying scene of the film, but also my suicide attempt due to  boredom) then the film would be considerably shorter and a lot more  engaging. This is another problem the film comes up against, a running  time at nearly more than two and a half hours, yet it could quite  easily have had at least forty minutes of 'filler' material trimmed  (such as various incredibly unfunny acts involving Judy Witwicky), and  some of the cringe-worthy jokes toned down or removed (however, maybe  it's just me, as some of the jokes did get a good reaction from some of  the younger members of the audience). Oh and there is that much  information thrown at you during the time that the film is on-screen  that you'll be hard pressed to understand everything that is going on,  that is if you are actually trying to follow the plot and the  history/motives regarding the new characters entwined within the Bay  universe.  I went into 'Transformers 2: Revenge Of The Fallen' with quite low  expectations, I wasn't expecting to see a great film, nor was I really  expecting to see a good film from the King of the Cinematic Explosions,  but I was hoping for one thing; to be entertained with violent robots  hacking each other to bits in a blaze of beautiful destructive glory.  But this was unfortunately not fulfilled for me. When I saw Michael  Bay's first 'Transformers' film I was sat on the edge of my seat  throughout as every action sequence made my jaw-drop a few feet, it was  something different and something special, however during 'Fallen' I  found myself for the majority of the film propping my own head up with  my palm, trying to keep myself awake...","46 out of 95 found this helpful.

It has been almost universally panned. Panned by critics everywhere . . . The movie earned $500 million worldwide as of yesterday. What it is, is not easily known. It is a strange film. The pacing is so relentlessly frenetic and certain. Everything falls according to law. The message of the film, if one should choose to believe there is one is not even known by the film itself; that is to say it, as a film, has no awareness of itself. Every scene is vividly and painstakingly detailed. We are immediately presented with two distinct worlds. A kid going to college and an intergalactic dispute involving two rivals of a robotic alien race. There is not a dull moment in the film. It jumpcuts through ludicrous transitions. Everything is over the top. The stereotypes are overblown. If you have not seen Megan Fox, you will not forget the way she was introduced to you in this film. It also possesses an unmistakable 80's feel while also seeming like it came from the future. Everyone is intense, paranoid and certain. Every scene is some completely different venture. It falls into bizarre, hypnotic, Dawson's Creek sequences. Everyone in the movie is on stimulants. One thing that took me my surprise was how committed the characters were to this alternate reality. Some evil robots called Decepticons are trying to obtain a dark artifact on earth to revive their old earthbound ancestors, hence, the ""fallen"". Meanwhile, Optimus Prime and the Autobots are hunting for the last of the Decepticons and trying to protect the artifact. The immense detail and variety we are presented with in this film places it on a separate pedestal. There are goodies everywhere. We are made to understand the story, and there isn't a single bit that slips by. I am truly perlexed as to what sank this film in the minds of intellectual America, i.e., the critical elite, and how they failed to see the sweeping clarity of the ideas and what the whole picture is. The movie has a strange, supernatural relevance and I would not be surprised to see it become a cult classic. There are just too many great lines, insane ideas, outrageous reactions, society commentaries and amazing robot battles. It's also funny and the humor in the movie is just, what is the word? Yes, that's the strangest part of the movie: the humor. The range of jokes and events we are presented with, electric shocking, moms banging into hanging pots, lines like, ""Whoa. We shouldn't share stories with each other. Ever."" not to mention, ""I'm under the scrotum!"" and an appearance by John Turturo who was the last person I ever expected to see in this film and had no idea was going to be in it. Rainn Wilson, also (Dwight from The Office) has a turn as a smarmy lecturer who says ""I have reached the climax of my lecture."" The cinematography. It flows at a strange pace. It's always perfect. Too perfect? On topic. Too commercial? One huge commercial? Do you know those commercials you see at the beginning of movies at the theater for Pepsi or some other company that has enough to spend on a feature budget? This film looks like that all the way through. This film is 9 different films spliced into one. It rambles down a bunch of pathways a long way. There is a Methamphetamine quality, or Adderall tone to it. The focus is so sharp and unwavering. Optimus Prime is the great American. Red and Blue with white eyes. Turns into a truck. This movie catapults so far into bizarre territory that any review of it by current standards would not make any sense. It is one, long, continuous epic American commercial for America itself, but I think it plods into a new consciousness that is as terrifying to get used to as some of the robots themselves. The detail and thought and consideration that went into this film adds up to something that explains something larger than life. It is like an endless infinity Pepsi commercial. The exaggerations, the puns, the absolutely bizarre dialogue. This is not a normal movie. This is not a summer blockbuster, although it was masquerading as one. The movie strikes at the heart of everything, on all cylinders, and when it's over, it's done. It didn't forget anything. I have read many other reviews of this movie, baffled as to how anyone came to such conclusions. I think over time many prominent reviewers will recant and write a new review. As for an explanation of such a violently divided movie experience, I can only suggest it is something to do with consciousness. The widespread reaction to the film is as peculiar as the movie, and sometimes applause is not all an indication of success. But there is a wild artistry and current of madness and abandon running through this picture. It's markedly different. It is succinct and separate from any other film in its neighborhood. It tries a crazy thing. I should hope prominent reviewers such as Roger Ebert and Peter Travers watch the film again and write another review.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

There was something for everybody and this is probably why the first transformers did so well.This sequel however had everything part 1 had and more. The story line is as expected at first with Sam (Shia Lebeouf) trying to live a normal life by going to college and trying to make his relationship with his hot girlfriend (Megan Fox) work. With the everyday struggle of a adolescent on his shoulders, Sam still has to hide his pass role in assisting an alien species of transforming robots to live on Earth. He also has to hide the fact that his car is one of these transforming robots. All though this seems easy, it is actually quite difficult as the director and producers of the film will show.After having contact with a piece of the all-spark, Sam begins to see visions of a secret language of the transformers. Despite these effects on him, Sam remains in college trying to live a normal life. Meanwhile, the US army work together with the Autobots in tracking down all possible Decepticons still living on Earth. A breakthrough is made when the assisting Decepticons discover where their leader (Megatron) was hidden. This is when the film kicks to another gear.Great cinematography in the action scenes and special effects, nothing like most have seen. As this is possible the most expensive movie this year with a outrageous 300 million dollar price-tag, expect to be blown away.A very good movie by today's standards as the anticipation and wait created by the announcement of this movie being made will be rewarded. One downside to the movie, boredom and restlessness may kick in towards the middle as what is expected to happen is prolonged. This is all worthwhile however with the stunning actress's in Megan Fox and Isabelle Lucas providing visual entertainment for most parts of the movies.Good acting by Shia and Megan allow adolescents to relate and include themselves in the situations which is a bonus for the movie. Great camera work and special effects makes this movie one of the best and worthwhile films of the year.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first transformers was total tripe, a special effects orgy with an underlying movie so thin and poorly scripted that I felt somewhat conned and underwhelmed by the whole experience.In this regard, Transformers 2 is a big improvement. The number of human characters gets reduced, there is far more meaningful dialogue. The robots, as with the first, looked great. The humour was much better, although still too many overly idiotic scenes. The human character development was a marked improvement.It does fall short in many areas. Several scenes look impossible (think big robots superimposed onto rooms / roads / scenery that they are too big for), the CGI often doesn't blend totally with the real scene (giant robots walking on sand do not leave footprints and a sand sucking robot sucks up imaginary sand whilst you see the actual scene unaffected underneath the digital sand, and many more examples).Where Michael Bay really fails is in tying together humans and robots in death defying action. The worst point is when we are expected to believe that our intrepid antagonist Sam (Shia Le Bouef) can run a mile with his girlfriend Michaela(Megan Fox) in tow in the midst of a giant battle. Apparently the Decepticons can't run much faster than their human foes, nor aim their guns at them. It was all a little unbelievable and you would have hoped that a better story writer would have come up with a more plausible way (and there were many) for the plot to unfold.Add to that some incredibly corny moments, and some terrible ideas like humping transformers, terminator-3-like transformers, and generally the movie flowing simply from one special effect to another, and it's just hard to actually get drawn in and take the movie seriously.Don't take this movie seriously and you'll enjoy it. Expect any depth and you'll simply hit the bottom almost straight away.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Decepticons and Autobots both search for something of great importance, Sam Whitwicky helps out and the US Army get to blow A LOT of things up. A lot cheesy moments but nothing too bad, at least I didn't think so. Great things about this film were again, John Tuturo, the Whitwickys and HOT girls. The scenes involving the transformers were again absolutely spot-on and IMHO a lot better than the first film. The action scenes are incredible, something which Bay has down to a T, while all other scenes and dialogue are merely used to explain the next set of events. The plot itself is solid if a little drawn out, much of the crucial information is squashed into brief dialogues, while many pointless scenes are overly drawn out. The transition of the film is also another issue as it is constructed in such a way that there are 2 distinct acts as it were, each one on its own could be a film although obviously the 2nd part is WAY better. Don't leave the film early or you'll miss the best bits. The new transformers were all pretty cool but they were woefully underdeveloped. For example the auto bot who turns into the silver Chevrolet concept car is in A LOT of the film but is never named. The new Decepticons, apart from one have no background, which is a massive disappointment to those who are familiar with the Transformers universe. Bay really needed help on this one, or just a better script.Overall this film is a 7.5/10 mainly due to the fact that it didn't fulfil its potential, some of the scenes were unnecessary and could have been swapped to further character development and that I'm not sure what Bay was getting at with the college scenes and most of Megan Fox's scenes, who bless, is so ridiculously hot but can't act. I always think that the 2nd film in a trilogy is the most important as it is the one where most of the plot gets unravelled, we find where allegiances lie and characters really get developed. Bay has missed a trick from Star wars here and has made a skin deep but beautiful, awesome action film. I will obviously buy the DVD for the commentary to find out what his intentions were throughout the movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

What about cinema being an escapist's zone where he leaves all his worries and indulges in PURE entertainment?? When did cinema cease to become an arena of one's psychological entertainment?? Why does a summer action flick have to be dark and deep like the Knight of the previous year in order to be entertaining??The truth is that even if times change, cinema remains an entertainment haven and when you go into the theaters to find your money's worth, you need TO BE Entertained!! So here we have the epitome of Hollywood's entertainment value – Michael Bay's most definitive work to date, as true to his style as it can be Transformers 2 cannot be weighed by critical reviews or by questioning whether it's worth your ticket price.. This movie goes much beyond. It stimulates enough senses to ignore the color of money as we see it. The $700 million Transformers introduced us to the alien civilization of Robots which were toys for the generations of yesteryears. Now, Bay takes them to another level that its creators couldn't have dreamed of. Shards of the All Spark are found and the knowledge of an old and powerful secret is possessed by Sam. The Decepticons are already in his pursuit and the Autobots who are in a secret alliance with the Government to protect mankind against these elusive enemies, may soon be outnumbered. Revenge is coming There are multiple sub-plots with Sam's family, which cause nothing more than annoyance in the otherwise sturdy plot, Sam and Mikaela's love story that has all the traits of a college romance, the return of Agent Simmons as an aid to the unraveling of the secret and Leo Spitz who is teasingly referred to as a 'shrimp taco' by the hilarious robotic twins –Mudflap and Skids. Shia LaBeouf will surely be unable to count the worth of his 2 movies which will surpass $1.5 billion. He delivers what is expected of him in the movie. Do not expect the intensity of Christian Bale or the suaveness of Robert Downey Jr. or even the innocence of Tobey Maguire. Having said that, he has played his part to his standards. Josh Duhamel as Major Lennox is outstanding in his role while the others play their limited parts well enough. Sam's Mom is the most annoying character in the film and she does that in a seemingly natural manner. Linkin Park, Green Day, Nickelback, The Fray and Staind are the other important stars in the movie and you shall hear why..Bay takes the clash of metal to New Mexico, Egypt and Jordan in spectacular locales that form the perfect arena for the mega battles. The action is breath-taking, heart pounding, jaw dropping, fist clenching and eye popping to say the least. Tranformers 1 seems like just a preview to this movie in terms of visual effects and mega action sequences. What George Lucas did with 'Star Wars', Spielberg did with 'Jurassic Park', Peter Jackson did with the 'Lord of the Rings' and Pixar did with 'Wall-E' and 'Up', Michale Bay has done it with Transformers. He summarizes all the technology, skill, talent, creativity, mega bucks and powerful imagination that Hollywood is famous for, as symbolically projected in the form of 'Devastator' – the Decepticon formed as a combination of construction machinery. The high-octane sequence in Shanghai in the opening moments is a powerful introduction and if you thought that the clash between Megatron and Optimus Prime in the first movie was epic, wait till you watch Prime battle it out against numerous Decepticons in the forest!! Did the critics talk about the lack of a meaningful, soul searching story and a 'human' side to the movie?? WHO THE #$%@?!! CARES!!! When you have a Gargantuan finale in the desert with Decepticons, Autobots, soldiers, warships, tanks, helicopters and fighter planes all over the place will give you enough reason to shriek with excitement. There is more explosion, gunfire and clang of metal in Transformers 2 than one can handle So what did you expect out of this movie anyway?? A Robot's journey through human experiences and its realization that the planet is just about dominated by a bunch of dope heads who have forgotten what sheer entertainment is all about??!!Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen cannot be measured with a ticket price or by the words of some #$%!@ minds who would rather be thrilled by the advent of a 'High School Musical 4' . For the others who would wisely watch it on IMAX, hearts will pound, pulse will race, laughter will roar, fists will be tightened, the fury of the testosterone in you will elevate to epic proportions like never before in theaters and in the end, Applause! Indeed, there is more than meets the eye with The Transformers.","36 out of 73 found this helpful.

"7","/10","HK Neo Reviews: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2086153/?ref_=tt_urv","webmaster-3017","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17092303/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2009","Tagline: Pure eye candy entertainment Review by Neo: Smack bucking, loud, noisy, big, and robotic and smashingly hot are automatic words that storm out of my mouth. Seriously, what more does a twenty something guy wants in a movie, hot girls, hot cars and the backdrop of Egypt? If this film is the answer to what works in Hollywood, then the art of commercialism is answered. Director Michael Bay (Bad Boys) is no stranger to big budget special effects flicks and for sure, Bay leaves no budgets unused and no stones unturned. In fact, the transformers are so complicatedly designed that some member of the audience may even watch it a second time or quite simply as my friend puts it, ""let's buy the toy just to see it more clearly"". Pure marketing genius in my opinion, but putting all that aside, this Transformer sequel actually works and despite being 30 minutes too long, it is ultimately entertaining and it leaves my eyes candy coated.The film follows on from the first film with Shia LaBeouf (Eagle Eye) moving on to college and leaving his super hot girlfriend (the irresistible Megan Fox) behind. As predicted, his college affair will be short lived, as the bad transformers goes after him for some metal specimen that can bring ancient transformers back to life. So together with his hands down sexy girlfriend, Sam goes on a journey and fights a battle alongside the good transformers with the bad transformers.To be perfectly honest, I was no big fan of the first Transformers movie; the simple fact is that I managed to fall soundly asleep in the midst of the transformers fighting it out. So for me to remain soundly awake, it must really be something. Perhaps it is the very presence of Megan Fox running around the desert of Ancient Egypt that got me fascinated, but then again, she really is the next Angelica Jolie.Shia LaBeouf reprises his role as Sam, the boy who conquered the bad transformers and the one with the super hot car and girlfriend. LaBeouf is a steady improving actor, and since the first Transformers, he has got himself involved in Indiana Jones and Eagle Eye. The only problem with these roles, is the very fact that they are the same, they all require him to be the hero as some sort, and quite frankly, to act like he is intense around his surroundings. Clearly roles that are hardly difficult, but it must be said that he handles them well and even if he somewhat does not deserve Megan Fox or Isabel Lucas, that is actually another story.To the new Hollywood goddess, Megan Fox, it really doesn't matter that her role in the Transformers series is irrelevant or even unimportant, as she is simply the perfect eye candy solution. When the picture gets a little dull, one glance of Fox lightens up the screen. It's been a while since an actress have that kind of sexiness on screen without even stripping down. It is not hard to see why the world is going crazy over Megan Fox, as she is easily, the hottest actresses in Hollywood right now. Not to shame, Aussie girl, Isabel Lucas (who used to star in the Home and Away series), but she pales in comparison with Fox. She is pretty and perhaps even hot, but when you pit her alongside, Megan, it is just impossible. Fox is bigger in areas that are meant to be and the lips are just plain sexy.All in all, Transformers is easily a good guilty pleasure to watch and it is probably safe to say that director Michael Bay is the one that can always deliver big budget special effects that works commercially even if not critics' friendly. With more transformers than ever before, adding in the Hollywood myth of Ancient Egypt pyramids being built by Aliens, Transformers is really a lot fun. Yes, the film is 30 minutes too long, it is not believable, but really who can resist a sport car that can transform, the joining power of several transformer, the beauty of Ancient Egypt and if all fails, we still have the undeniable, Megan Fox  (Neo 2009) I rate it 7/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As well intentioned as the humor was for the movie, I think they tried to make it to funny and some of the characters both human and transformer just seem to be there for gags and serve no REAL purpose which drag the film down a bit.

(don't ask)I think they have done what all respectable movie makers will do and make the movie as long as they want it to be, unlike some movies, which end abruptly because they try to cut down on time and cost (Alien Vs. Predator:Requiem was an example of a movie which should have gone on for at least one hour more). All our favourite characters were there from the first movie, plus a few new ones, and we got more action, bigger robots and more (or less) subtle double entendres... (Giant Robot with balls, for example). The one thing lacking, though, was intensity... All points for trying, Michael Bay, but looks like you've tried too hard this time. Too much intensity usually leads to corniness, which this movie had a bit too much of for my liking.As for the performances: Shia LaBeouf (Samuel James Witwicky) reprised his role as geeky, awkward every-neighbourhood-in-America-has-one type of guy, but this time, he was wiser to the ways of the world, due to the events of the previous movie.Megan Fox.... Need I say more?Kevin Dunn and Julie White were Sam's Wacky parents, obviously going through an awkward phase in their marriage, but are not admitting it. (this follows on from the first movie as well).John Turturro was the real scene stealer of the movie, for me, as he took his role as high-strung sector 7 operative Agent Simmons and turned it as comedic as he possibly could. Outside of an Adam Sandler Movie, this is his best role, and he seems to get better with every movie he makes.Ramon Rodriguez turned out to be the obnoxious blabbering character (Leo) who worked well with Turturro to make some memorable scenes together.As for the robots, I thought their parts were robotic, to say the least, and I guess they would take that as a compliment.Overall movie ratings: Acting: 6/10 Plot: 6/10 Direction: 7/10 Comedy: 6/10 Action: 8/10 Intensity: 4/10 Memorability : 4/10Overall : 41/70 = 59%","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, however, was absolutely terrible. This is not to say that the action scenes are not spectacular, because they are. The special effects and CGI were incredible, as expected. Unfortunately, special effects alone do not make a good movie. You need a good plot, good writing, and believable acting. This movie provides none of these. The writing was absolutely terrible. It was cheesy and juvenile. The plot was very weak, and the acting, probably mostly because of the writing, was not very good either. I normally like Shia Labeouf, but in this movie, I found him hard to watch, despite the fact that his performance was probably the best in the movie.

The first fight scene in Shanghai with Lennex and the Autobots was pretty awesome, I wish there'd been more of Arcee though. (That's the chick Autobot!) A lot of the exposition after the college scenes and the race across Egypt were too drawn out, scenes could have been cut or shortened. The ""I love you."" and its ""your destiny"" were way too clichéd and just cheesy. The very ended was cut short and felt rushed. Bang we won! Now one sentimental message and no after footage, oh movie's over. Sequel coming, you can tell.The best moment in the whole movie was the way they worked Simons back in. That was brilliant. Jetfire was also incredible. At last a ""I'm too old for this."" from a guy who was still easily winning the fight. Mikaela' pet Decepticon was also cool, and hilarious, but he vanished in Egypt. I missed him after that.Overall: Too much exposition, too many random robots with no explanation, too many Decepticons, too much Mikaela, too much room mate, too long of a fight across the desert.

The theatre was packed and the anticipation was high. At the end of the movie, not one person was disappointed. This movie was awe-inspiring.STORY The story was decent. There was no true flare of creative brilliance but in an action movie like this, it was still quite good.CGI The CGI was unbelievable. At times I had to remind myself that the Transformers don't actually exist. Everything (the robots themselves, the way the environment reacted with them, the actors talking to them)was fantastically done and made it seem like the robots were real.ACTING The actins was better done in this one. Shia was great in the other one and he is ven better in this one. Megan Fox is beautiful and she has also brought her acting up a notch and I was quite impressed. The other actors did their jobs well. Even the Transformers voice acting was great.MUSIC The musical score, written by Steve Jablonsky, was amazing.

What made this movie no greater than average, as compared to its solid predecessor, was a lack of plot, brainless, inappropriate humor, and no originality in that it seemed to be almost a carbon copy of the first ""Transformers."" This film was painful in its sexuality jokes, nonstop the entire film. The plot was extremely choppy and very stretched, and for a movie of extraterrestrial robots the size of buildings smacking into each other for months on end, it took itself way too seriously. The Dreamworks studio, Michael Bay, Spielberg, and anyone else involved in this film's production needs to evaluate its large audience comprised of children and realize that it's wrong to expose them to such inappropriate humor, much less adults. And, if they're going for adults as their target audience, than provide a plot with substance. They seemed to have missed the mark on not one, but two demographics. Lasers and special effects are always entertaining, but without anything significant behind it for two hours can become a bit of a time-waster, especially considering the sexual filth that littered this particular sequel.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Despite Potter 6's $1/2 billion dollar international take on opening weekend, Transformers 2 is the better movie! Shia LaBeouf is a much better actor. He receives and delivers better lines than an insipid Daniel Radcliffe. I suspect the next Harry Potter is the end of his serious acting career. Yet Megan is a Fox! Her overt beauty and ""never get dirty"" tight white jeans dominates the movie. As an adult, I prefer the outright sexuality of Megan Fox to the silly childish crushes of teenagers that never kiss.Potter 6 squanders a cast rich with talent, while Transformers 2 milks a few nobodies. Although they never have any lines worth repeating, Transformers uses the compassion of Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro and Kevin Dunn to advance the tale of humans caught between a battle of advanced alien robots. Potter 6 however, kills off Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) and practically ignores the talents of Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Helena Bonham Carter and the slithery Alan Rickman.Plus, the direction and action of Transformers 2 is better. And its stupid plot twists are just as believable as the magic that infuses Potter. Alien robots that never die is just as believable as evil wizards that never die. In both movies the special computer effects make the entire movie. In Potter, computer generated images create the Hogwarts castle with its rich architecture. In Transformers, CGI creates a mess of metal clashes as robot battles robot. In both, the repetitious computer generated pattern wears the eye down, making the CGI seem like it goes on forever. To its credit, Transformers seems to have a lot more on site scenery with locations in New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Egypt, Paris and Jordan.Potter was like a magic potion; I wanted to sleep through its poetically slow tale. Transformers 2 was a classic ""bang bang shoot em up,"" with high tech weapons. Much easier for me to enjoy. I can't say Transformers 2 is good enough to spend your lunch money on to see it in the theater, but I think only Harry Potter fans should rent this franchise's sixth release. Suspend belief. Ignore the faults. This is no Spiderman. This is Terminator meets Gremlins. Sit back, enjoy.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This film is the worst excesses of his style, and its biggest strengths rolled into one.The story in the original film was admittedly slight, but in this sequel it is basically non-existent. Megan Fox has lost any vestiges of character and is here simply playing a brunette barbie doll, but she does look good lying across the frame of a motor bike and we salute Michael Bay for bringing this to our attention, though question whether the 10 year old and youngers who make up the primary audience of this film are as enamoured with a denim clad female buttocks as we are. Shia Lebeouf's character is displaying almost no growth at all from the first film and some of the new support Transformers you will want to see atomised, particularly the ones that accompany Spike in the desert. I do like the idea of the fallen, and the new character Jetfire. Jetfire was in the original TV show, toys and comics, though his back story here, and indeed entire character are so different he might as well be a new creation. Starscream is again wasted, though his attempts to suck up to Megatron are funny.The nano-bots are well realised and there are a lot of breath taking action sequences, including the desert eating Devastator, but as in the last twenty minutes of the original it is often hard to tell who is who, and some of the characters are such grotesque stereotypes, that there isn't any tension in seeing them in peril anyway.John Turtorro returns to lend some interest to proceedings. His appearance in the film is like a breath of fresh air. He loses some of his edginess from the original, but is still easily the most interesting human on screen. The ending is a text book anti climax.Michael Bay is very good with set pieces, special effects and action sequences, but vulgar characterisations and story telling devices also litter his films. When he mixes them all together right, as in the Rock, the results are ridiculously entertaining. When he gets it wrong, as he did here, the results while watchable due to the sheer scale, are disappointing.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

We should have got up and left.Although there were a couple of funny moments in the movie, the script was so poor that the writers felt it necessary to fill time with bad ""one-liners"" to add more comic relief to the film. Ramon Rodriguez would have single-handedly brought down the entire film with his weak acting performance had this been a quality production.

Yeah, you know it is. Despite critics (myself included) complaining about almost everything except how cool the special effects were, the first one was a huge hit so Michael Bay brings all of his toy cars back to the big screen in ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" This newer model comes with some of the same problems the first film had, a few improvements, and an altogether more cohesive and entertaining experience, albeit slightly longer than one would really like out of such a popcorn movie. This one picks up two years after the events of the first film.With Megatron (Hugo Weaving) buried beneath the ocean and the allspark in a secured location, Earth is safe for the time being. The autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), now fight alongside the American military (Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson included) combating remaining Decepticons hiding out on Earth. While cleaning up in Shanghai, Optimus is told by a dying Decpticon that the Fallen will rise again. It doesn't mean a whole lot, but its enough to put everyone on alert. Meanwhile, Sam (Shia LeBeouf) is heading to college, his hero status an annoyance to him now, as is his guardian Bumblebee. Then again his girlfriend is Mikaela (Megan Fox) so life ain't all bad. But as Optimus so nobley says, ""fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing."" Sam begins to see cyber code to the point where he has a mental breakdown. Mikaela comes to Sam's aid but what they don't know is that Megatron has been brought back to life and he is now reunited with his master, the Fallen (Tony Todd). They invade Earth, demanding that Sam surrender to them, for the code he sees will lead the Fallen to a machine that blows up the sun while renewing life on the Decepticon planet. Of course Sam, Mikaela, and the rest have to stop that from happening.Ehren Kruger joins screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman but I'd be hard pressed to tell you what he brings to the writing, the plotting being essentially the same, just swapping the allspark energy source for the machine. I doubt fans will mind. More to the point, the action is wall to wall, all-out mayhem and this time its not so hyperactive to the point where you can barely make out what's going on. Optimus and Bumblebee each get their moment to kick some major ass, lots of destruction (cities, fleet ships, pyramids, etc), and the guns blaze and robots rock'em-and-sock'em-each other with major intensity. While all this is good, I still contend that Bay could go bigger though, especially with these special effects at his disposal. A really well planned action set-piece (ala the car chase in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" for example) could really elevate this series from good to grand. This hurts the finale especially, which is hectic and all-over-the place but offers nothing incredibly cool. The finale also suffers from battle overload, at this point the guns-blazing and robot fighting going on way too long. Cutting a half hour wouldn't have hurt this movie.What helps this time around though is more Megatron. He's a ferocious villain who rightfully deserves more screen time. However, one wonders why so little screen time for most of the other autobots. Other than Optimus and Bumblebee, the rest only have brief moments in battle scenes, except for the Twins, Mudflap and Skids, who sound like Katt Williams and are probably the most annoying comic relief since Jar Jar Binks. Most other robots are mainly used for exposition, a long-winded detailing of the machine is just one of many overly talky scenes. Just show us the special effects, which stand as some of the most technically superior I've ever seen. Slicker, bigger, and badder, just looking at these magnificent robots brings out the kid in me. It's here that the movie is really inspired, as different types of robots fill the screen. Cougars, sattelites, preying mantis, and one that looks very similar to the alien in ""Species."" From a design stand-point, this is awesome.Acting isn't a major priority here but the cast does it's job well enough. Shia is the new sorta nerdy, sorta brave techno hero. He also has good comic timing and gets some very good laughs. Megan Fox, introduced in a sexy pose leaning over a motorcycle, is probably the most incredible looking non-robot in the movie and there are even occasions where she comes through as a decent actress. Kevin Dunn and Julie White, as Sam's cheapskate father and naïve mother, get the bulk of the hilarious laughs, as does a loopy John Turturro reprising his role as the quirky Agent Simmons, this time working with Sam. The characters played by Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson, and Rachel Taylor have wisely been deleted and things move along a lot better now that its not so top heavy with extra characters who serve no purpose. The voice acting for the robots is well matched, especially from Hugo Weaving and Tony Todd, adding more dread to Megatron and the Fallen, and Peter Cullen giving authority to Optimus. There is also a nice ode to Joe Pesci in ""Goodfellas"" that's pretty funny.""Revenge of the Fallen"" is not without its flaws, but the good outweighs the bad and this is by far right behind ""Star Trek"" as the blockbuster of the summer.For more reviews, check out Leesmovieinfo.com","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Michael Bay has out done himself again by adding more CGI effects than character development and obtaining more military support than a mission to Iraq. As all these preteens gawk and wet themselves at the thought of Megan Fox's curves, adults do the same, so everyone wins here. But where the movie really plummets is in the acting. Over-the-top, cheesy, and pedantic are words that come to mind.The plot doesn't matter at all. Why? It doesn't make sense. You could drive a train through some of the plot holes in this movie. So if you go see this movie you'll have to sit through pointless dialog and ridiculous plot resolutions. There was one right at the end of the movie that made me fall out of my seat. No, scratch that. There were two. At that point, I was ready for the movie to end, which it soon did. So thank you, movie. You pulled off the band-aid quickly.Besides all that, it wasn't too bad. The opening scene is so bad-ass that Samuel Jackson gave it a 12 of the B.A.M.F. scale (and that scale only goes up to 5). The action is intense and slightly nauseating at times. For some reason, Bay felt it necessary to have the camera completely zoomed in on the robots whenever they fought each other. Which is ALL THE TIME! If you have motion sickness, I'd recommend that you sit in the back of the theater.However, this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. The movie is just a fun summer flick. Just ignore everything besides the action and you'll be okay.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I am a special effects sort of guy, and this was packed with some amazing sequences.It is a long movie, branching around 2and half hours, but to me that's value for money. I hate it when people say its too long. I bet the same people complain when its only an 1 hour 45 and say its to short.This movie is brilliant I believe, but it does have its flaws. There are a lot of Unnecessary scenes that did not need to be there, which could have shortened the movie, or left more space for some character building on some of the newer characters. Complaints about explosions? I've heard many critics say the trailer looked like an explosion fest, but what on earth would you expect when giant mechanical robots are fighting. Its going to be a lot of big explosions, its not a movie about peace and negotiations. I expect some of the die hard fans not to like this movie, as it probably doesn't follow exactly, to what ever story arc they have taken to adopt this movie from. For anyone else, when it finished, the whole screen I was in clapped, which to me proves that to the average movie goer it is a must see.There loads of new transformers in this movie, some are signature characters like Skids and Mudflap, the twins, Jetfire and the construct-icons, with many more as well. If time was taken to delve into these new signature characters you would be sat there a lot longer as there as plenty. It is a shame that some feel 'popped in', and i do understand when others cry out for character depth, it is a missing part of this movie, but then the movie would last even longer. Maybe some should not have been introduced? probably but it does not detract that much away from the movie. You still get the big bots out there kicking robot ass, which I loved.The human element is decent with Shia back as lead, the parents are back too but really should have only been in the start of the movie. There are many light heart-ed, comic moments that I enjoyed, even if i thought they should not be there, they actually fit well. Megan looking as good as ever, not the best of actors mind personally, but she does well. Leo was a slightly unnecessary I thought, and I believe was there for a more comic role then anything else, or maybe to have a future role in another movie with his own guardian like Shia and Bumblebee? Simmon's is as quirky as ever and was nice to see him back. Lennox and his military pals play a very good role as the US military and they really add to the final scenes.The storyline is clear throughout, or so I thought, its pretty basic to be fair. Keeping to it through the whole movie make have a bit lax, with some of the chopping and changing of what everyone was doing, the story only comes into play in certain scenes, but it is there, and I thought it was a clever one to have as it may lead to a sequel or hopefully will! There are some some major points scored for some areas of the plot, when you see it you will know, i'm not here to spoil anything! This gets 8 of 10 for me, the reason I gave it 8/10 was due to some of the scenes been a tad pointless as they were really not needed, and just seemed to be there to fill some space, but even so most of the time they were pretty comical. Critics complained last time about, there not been enough Optimus, or robot fighting, then when Bay does what they ask he still gets slated for doing to much, he cant really win. It is a popular franchise to try and get right, the die hard fans may not like it, I did I used to watch the cartoons and loved seeing some of my favourite characters back on the big screen. It is a must see for anyone in my opinion even if its just to satisfy your curiosity. For those that know a bit about the transformers world, and the average movie goer it is a definite must and you will enjoy it.This is my first review, and I hope it helps those waiting to see it, I have to tried to show flaws of the movie and make it unbiased, but I did really enjoy watching it so I found it hard to rip to pieces like others do.","42 out of 88 found this helpful.

I've heard people defend the first film by saying 'it's a big summer action flick. What were you expecting?' Well, I was expecting, at the very least, some thread of emotional connection. I didn't get much of it from that first movie and I got even less of it from this movie. The idea that a two and a half hour movie has absolutely no character development, plot, coherent action or good humor baffles me. It feels like a kid given unlimited access to a toy store; too many robots flying across the room mindlessly. Then again, that kid could write a far better film than this one.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

The Negatives are so apparent its laughable.1. Dear Megan Fox, you are indeed hot, but frankly you really have no talent at all. Michael Bay uses Fox as a piece of meat for the horny teenage guy audience. The second you see Fox in the movie, you will laugh, Apparently to fix a motorcycle you have to straddle it in a sexual pose its like Michael Bay is screaming at the audience (Megan fox is hot)!!! Thank you i get it . Believe me you will laugh when you see it.2. Dear Ethan Kruger and Robert Orci( writers)......wow i must say you wrote a piece of crap script with stale unimaginative dialog and plot points. The first Transformers i actually kind of liked, but this movie is nowhere near the first one. I really just find a major fault in this movie to be the screenplay.3. Dear Michael Bay, I leave my worst criticism of this movie at your hands. You focus primarily on visual effects without any attention at all at the horrible plot holes and performance of your actors. Did you really think it would be dramatic to have Shia Lebeouf scream Optimus!!! ( believe me you will laugh even harder at this poor attempt of a dramatic scene) Michael Bay needs to learn that you use special effects to enhance the environment for the story and the characters. But sadly the actual story takes a backseat to getting a cheap thrill with a robot fight. Frankly like Pearl Habor, Bay loses any sense of a cinematic responsibility.In conclusion, this movie is simply terrible, you will only be impressed by the visual effects, no thanks to Bay. For a Big Dumb Movie you have indeed found one in Transformers 2.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

We pick back up with Shia LaBeouf (Disturbia, Eagle Eye), reprising his role as Sam WitWicky, two years after the first Transformers film preparing to head off to college. Megan Fox (Transformers, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People) returns as his girlfriend, Mikaela Banes. Sam stumbles upon a fragment of the Allspark, which broke off and was hidden among his things after the final battle of the first film. This discovery will lead to the Autobots having to battle their oldest foe the Fallen.There are two things that can define this film, or any Michael Bay film, explosions and slow motion. In fact the explosions at times happen when it doesn't seem possible, like when a robot flies through the wall of an apartment. This pales in comparison to the blatant ethnic stereotypes that are two of the new Autobots, Mudflap and Skids. These two characters are grating they are such awful stereotypes of ""urban"" people. Add to them the needless shots of dogs humping and the repeated use of profanity for a cheap laugh and you see the age group Bay was aiming for: 13-18 year old boys. He also relies on Judy Witwicky for comic relief when none is needed, and in fact abuses her for such a purpose. Comedy and slap stick just do not seem to be something Michael Bay really understands. While these elements were able to get the 13 to 18 year old kids in the audience to laugh it fell very flat to me. In fact he seemed to be trying too hard to get me to laugh with his attempts at comedy.One of the things Bay gets right in the film is giving us extended fight sequences of the Autobots and Decepticons. However, while we see long takes of these battles the actions of the humans in the scene seemed forgotten as they would seem to magically get from A to B without the audience seeing anything. This made the film seem jumpy and almost fractured to such a degree that it began to make it hard to follow even with such a plain plot. Also it seems that Megan Fox is employed as a distraction for the audience in the film from what is actually on the screen. It was effective as the 13-18 demographic cat called at the screen whenever she bent over or did anything slightly sexual. It is almost as if Bay knew he had a weak story and tried to use a type of slide of hand to distract us from the flaws throughout the film.The strongest part of the film actually was Shia Labeouf's performance. While it won't be remembered as his best work he shines through the film and actually pulls off his role. Sure the dialogue was not always great and the editing left holes in the film, but LaBeouf overcomes these with his acting. In fact his acting is far better in the sequel than in the first film when a good number of his lines were reduced to, ""No no no no!"" However, the chemistry between Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox just left me wanting more from them. It came across very flimsy and flat to the point that it made me wonder why they bothered calling each other ""Babe."" Even with that the film is beautiful in visual terms with special effects that dazzle the eye and led to many ""Did you see that!""'s being spoken in the audience. It is to Michael Bay's credit that he uses so many explosions because at least it gives us something to watch that works in the film.In the final rundown Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen simply falls short of the intended goal. If you aren't looking for much from a movie you won't be disappointed, but in the end the only things working for the movie are the special effects, Shia LaBeouf's acting, and Megan Fox running in slow motion. Aside from that you won't find much here. In fact this well is dry, very dry. Even with it being a dry well Bay manages to stretch the film a good 30 minuets longer than it deserves with it's plot. The only way to describe the plot is as shallow, and fun, as a kiddie pool.Written by Josh for www.overcranked.net","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Despite much critical panning and even outright derision, I cannot understand why this would be consider a let-down in any way, shape, or form.For a basic plot summary, ""Transformers 2"" sees Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) entering college and leaving girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind. When the Decepticons cook up another evil plan to destroy Earth, though, it isn't too long before Sam and Mikaela are once again teaming up with the Auto-Bots (as well as the U.S. military) to once again save the world.Simply put, this is the classic cinema case of ""same concepts, different packaging"". The amounts of humor, pulse-pounding action, and plot (or lack thereof) are pretty much the same as the original, but director Michael Bay is able to keep the proceedings remarkably fresh. Never once did I feel as if things were becoming ""old hat"".The key to enjoying this franchise (and even more so this film in particular) is this: have the ability to not take it seriously. If you view these movies as strictly ""escapism"" entertainment, they will entertain you thoroughly. Do they hold up to dissection? Heck no. But that isn't the point.As usual, LaBeouf pretty much steals every scene he is in as the young Witwicky. He has the type of acting talent that perfectly meshed with the numerous ""just passed adolescence"" characters he played during this time period, and this makes Sam very relatable to the audience.Overall, I enjoyed ""Revenge of the Fallen"" nearly as much as its predecessor. While the ""newness"" factor may have worn off a bit, this second effort (if viewed in the proper light) repackages the key elements of part one and lets us enjoy them again. Despite all the negative publicity about this one, the Transformers fan who can fully immerse him/her self into the experience (without too much ""thinking"") CAN still have a blast watching this one.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Alleged director Michael Bay, a firm believer in the throw-everything-at-the-wall theory of film-making, manages to overwhelm the senses with a teeth-rattling soundtrack and a blistering, epilepsy-inducing barrage of metallic imagery. Oh, there's a story in there, something about preventing an evil robot from destroying the sun, but it's almost completely irrelevant.Since the movie is a direct follow up to the last Transformers film, some background is necessary. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBoeuf) is preparing to go to college, away from his new sweetheart Mikaela (Megan Fox) and his new alien robot best friend, Bumblebee. Meanwhile, Optimus Prime (a good robot) is helping the world's armies take on stray Decepticons (bad robots), who are trying to revive their old leader Megatron, find Sam, and aid another bad robot named The Fallen (see what they did there?).Most of the scenes involve Sam (and Mikaela, and others in their posse) running from place to place, getting shot at by apparently the slowest giant robots in the universe. But not like in films like National Treasure or Angels and Demons, where a mystery was being solved and the protagonist was running from place to place because time was almost up for them to solve said mystery. More like running around just so that more robot battle scenes could be included. I mean, it doesn't really have to have a point, right? One big problem is that the robots are sort of hard to distinguish from one another. Some are pretty easy, like Optimus Prime (he's blue and red) and Bumblebee (he's yellow), and the Twins Mudflap and Skids, or even The Fallen, who has an elongated faceplate. There are gray-metal robots who are Decepticons (colorless = evil?), but then there are some who are Autobots. Add to this confusion the fact that the fight scenes move at a breakneck pace, so even if you can tell who's fighting whom, you really can't tell what specifically is being done.The movie is also about an hour too long (it's two and a half hours total). There are too many battle scenes anyway, and there are too many characters to keep track of. Slice it down to a manageable running time and chop out some secondary characters - keep the battles to just the most obvious players - and maybe there would be a coherent, cohesive movie. But Michael Bay directed this, and he's known for doing the opposite of what a good filmmaker would do.As for the acting... well, I don't want to be negative. I'm kidding, of course I do. Being negative is easier than being positive. But it's double-plus easier for a film like this, because it's so clichéd and so overwrought. The acting is subpar; everyone hams it up, probably because they don't want to be overshadowed by robots. (They are anyway.) LaBoeuf is not a good actor, never has been. He's not a good action-movie type, frankly; you don't look at him and see hero, you see nincompoop. He doesn't inspire so much as react. This was never more evident than in the latest Indiana Jones movie, when sixtysomething Harrison Ford - not a great actor, but an appealing one - was far more convincing than LaBoeuf. You're supposed to look at LaBoeuf and think he's a guy next door, and instead you look at him and think he's a self-aggrandizing little twit. Or maybe that's just me.Megan Fox is in this movie basically to look pretty - check out, as I did, the endless pans over her young, lithe body, and you know exactly who's in the intended audience. (Note: It's not sixty-year-old women.) The appropriately named Fox is all pouty lips and gleaming teeth, and she's likable enough, but she's given little to do other than dote on LaBoeuf awkwardly.As for the rest of the cast, it's a clash of acting styles. John Turturro returns as Agent Simmons, and he's wackier than ever; Ramon Rodriguez plays Sam's new college roommate, web entrepreneur Leo, and he's deranged and a wuss. Sam's parents are played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White, who shamelessly mug - White's character in particular is needlessly loony. She was probably supposed to be comic relief, but she comes off as annoying.This isn't a great thrill ride, as the previews might lead you to believe. It's not even a Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. It's more like the It's a Small World ride, a ride that ceaselessly repeats the same refrain just to irritate the pants off you, figuratively speaking, resulting in a desperate wish for it all to be over.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Bay certainly caught my attention and this sequel to the 2007 live-action adaptation of ""Transformers"" is no exception.Familiar characters old and new, new storyline, and better character development are what really makes this sequel become a movie worth staying in your seats.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is off to college, yet he is not aware that the battle he faced before is far from over. When new Decepticons come rolling in, it's up to him, his human allies, and Autobots to put an end to their tyranny.With its stylized action sequences, impressive visual effects, awesome voice actors, and amazing filming locations, Michael Bay has done it again! I'll admit that one of his films in the past was a dud and that very few particular scenes in this movie were not necessary, but Transformers is what defined Bay's directing much further.

The Characters in this movie take on a whole new level of personalities, unlike the first one which was more BOOOM! BANG! SWISHHHHH! than actual dialog between the robots themselves. I'm not sure if this movie was a action movie or a comedy. You spend as much time dying with laughter at the sheer hilariousness of this movie as you do clinging to the edge of your seat with your but-cheeks holding your breath and wishing you had a photographic memory so that you could reply that wicked sick combo that bumblebee just did to a decepticon. Great Movie everyone needs to see it once or even twice...i know i will be.PS: who ever wrote this movie rocks and i'll definitely be looking forward to transformers 3. Although i don't think there's anything left to do that wasn't done in this film. It brings me to tears how good this movie was....","24 out of 47 found this helpful.

What were they thinking. So, if you like the characters created in the first movie; if you like stories; if you would like at least that you ears and/or you intelligence don't be hurt by the most stupid lines ever told by a human (or robot) in a movie, be careful with this movie.But, if you want to see a lot of spare parts fighting each other, would like to see great battles, don't care for story, dialogues or continuity, you'll sure like this one, because it has great battle scenes, bigger and faster than the first one. Then, maybe you'll give and 8 instead of a 2 to Revenge of the Fallen. Myself, i like that action scenes be part of the movie, not the movie itself.And, with how much money this movie is making, I am too afraid of Transformers 3. Because THERE WILL BE a third one. Bigger than this one. Maybe they'll add the Transformer Planet Unicron, who maybe could try to destroy earth itself. I'm sure Michael Bay's eyes would spark thinking about a giant hand smashing Manhattan, while it's leg sink in the pacific and destroys Japan with a Tsunami.So, be careful with the movie. Don't get any higher expectations except some time to eat popcorn.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

And I don't understand all the annoying comments. What they all expect? Too much action? The name of the movie is Transformers. It is an action movie. A very good action movie,i must say. I recommend a drama movie all who don't like action movies. Or a comedy. Or maybe some soap opera TV serials. These days you can't please anyone. Some say that seeing this movie was a waste of their time,but i think the only waste was that they wrote some shi@y comments. Now that's a shame and a waste.What I don't like,I don't watch. It is that simple. Maybe watching a trailer could help. All who watched and did not liked the movie, and now crying about it, are denailing them selves. Because they watched it,and now they are saying to other people not to watch it. That is sad.Everything is great in the movie. Megan Fox is great,not because she is sexy...just because she is cute :) And knows to act. Also LeBeouf is great. I love all he's movies! This one is no different.This movie gives a full charged,action packed,blow up feeling.That is the point!Special effect's are amazing!So. I had no trouble watching and enjoying this film. I am thankful to all who made this film. Very good work. Michael Bay made a fantastic movie! Giving it 10/10 I recommend it to everyone :)","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

Dogs humping, countless pussy jokes by those moronic twin robot, in fact that whole college scene which lasts like an hour is just awful, When the mum got high and jumped on the guy i just cringed.Shia is a really one dimensional actor, all he knows is smart mouthed Punk, the way he interacts with his parents, the way he reacts in times of despair except when there's a really cheesy love scene....in fact and this goes back to the first film why in the hell was there a need for a love story in a transformers film? Megan Fox just runs around in slow mo for pretty much the entire film You know what really irks me the most though is the fact that all the Decepticons are this metallic grey, you cant tell them apart! its just plain annoying and i have no idea why they did this....in fact it really bugs me when film makers don't stay faithful to the original source, i mean if they want to make films to a wider audience then hell just make a different film the only thing Bay has done impressively in this film is blow things up, dunno if its just me but this does not constitute in a good film! I couldn't stop laughing when there was a shot of a plane coming over a sunset horizon, you couldn't help yourself bay could you!

I have noted through other's comments that this movie was 2.5 hours or so, and I just don't see how that was possible. I quit after one hour cuz my girlfriend was drinking wine and losing attention on the movie; naturally this stole my attention for a good reason. After a while I decided I would check IMDb, hoping this movie was below 5 stars, proclaiming I would never read IMDb again if it wasn't. 6.1 stars!!?? I am outraged. So this is my first IMDb comment and rating on a movie yet. 1 star will suffice, and hopefully knock this garbage down below a 5 where it belongs. At this point I hope I reached my 10 line quota. My vote is all I'm interested here, and I will stay away from anything Michael Bay does in the future.

I think morons are infesting the internet ten fold these days. Now - I do welcome idiots, they make me feel superior. But why must you fester on a website such as prestigious as this one? Now, let me smother the resulting comments with some simple logic. If you are going to see transformers to see some Fitzgerald epic or a in-depth adult drama, you first of all, need to ensure you never breed. Movie-entertainment was made to make a medium of entertainment even more simple for the lazy and illiterate. If you cannot make the simple differences between let's say - Body of Lies to Transformers series, there is a problem with your brain and I suggest you have yourself checked for tumors immediately.Transformers is a fun movie. They don't take themselves seriously (which as it would seem many basement-children do). The movie is made for three basic things. Action, Comedy, and Comic-book melody. All of which are great.The movie is great for fans, (and this is to also reflect away the morons who are incapable of seeing a plot), as they bring back Primus/Unicron/TheOne mythology into the movie. Now they do have some points that are inaccurate - but nothing is perfect. They bring back in (and this is not a spoiler, this is common knowledge to the Marvel Comics Lore set over 24 years ago) the Matrix, the seven Primes, the Fallen, and the constructions. Oh and of course as you may have heard the real deal - Soundwave.The movie has a great mix of Robot on Robot, Human on Robot, and all that action. The opening sequence does a great job of summarizing the relations on Earth and the new Robots to be starring in the film. Michael Bay and the genius' at the CG studios learned from their earlier mistakes and fixed all the lighting and panel/vector problems to make the robot fights easier to follow and thus way way more epic.The movie also has a great brand of humor that makes the movie even better. Sorry, if you're to mature to laugh at a stoned mother on a college campus tackling Frisbee-kids, then you need to get a monocle and move to South Africa, because you don't belong.Again, if you go to see this movie as a moron (read above) then you'll hate this. If you go to see the movie as an Old Transformer fan or simply a person looking for a FUN movie. You will like this and probably suggest it to your non-idiotic friends. And yes, I'd like to take this moment in suggesting over 400 people on this site lack the ability to watch movies as a critic.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

I have never left a movie feeling as mad as I did when I left Transformers 2. The movie is too long, well over 2 hours and 20 minutes. And in those 2 hours and 20 min., Michael Bay barely uses the dialog to tell a story. Instead he tries to make the audience laugh. Actually it seems as if the dialog is intended to just make the audience laugh, because almost none of it helps the viewer understand what is going on. I really wanted this movie to be good because there weren't many movies that I wanted to see this summer. I think that the reason this movie is doing so well in the box office is because there is no other action movie that can compete with it this summer. A lot of people like to give summaries for the movies they are reviewing. Here is a summary for this movie...good special effects. That is all the movie has to offer. Please if you are reading this review and have not seen the movie, please do not pay 8 bucks to see it. Wait until it comes out in the dollar theaters or just wait to rent it. If you pay the full 8 bucks then you will just encourage Michael Bay to direct equally horrible films.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

The reason I hated it was because I had very high expectations for the movie. Being a fan of the cartoon series, I expected it to have a somewhat serious tone and a coherent story. The movie could have been so much better in the right hands. I couldn't understand at that time why anyone would enjoy this crappy excuse of a movie. The first movie also lowered my expectations for the sequel, and the all round bad reviews that the second movie got when it was released in theaters didn't help either.And after watching Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen on DVD, I am surprised to say that I enjoyed the movie a lot. The silly jokes somehow worked for me this time, and the nonsensical story actually made sense to me (at the time i was watching it). Now it's the opposite, I can't understand why people hate this movie so passionately. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's a summer action movie that delivers what it advertises.If you are going to watch this movie at home, make sure you watch it in HD. One regret I had while watching the movie was not getting the Blu-ray version of it. The DVD version just isn't comparable to the Blu-ray version I saw a little of. This movie is made to be watched in HD. The action and and special effects are what I enjoyed most about the movie and it needs to be seen in all its HD glory to truly appreciate it.They have toned down the use of the ""shaky cam"" technique compared to the first movie and as a result, the action was more discernible this time. You actually know who's fighting whom most of the time and which limb they are using to beat each other up. Plus, the use of slow motion for ""cool"" action set pieces helped too.My advice for anybody that's going to watch Transformers 2 is to turn off your brain, get in mood to see lots of explosions and huge robots fighting each other with some juvenile jokes sprinkled in between. You'll be rewarded with two and a half hours of pure unadulterated fun.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

Yes it has errors, as to be expected with something made by flawed humans. I started reading the comments but quickly became annoyed with the very first one, so I stopped reading and began scanning and saw that most of the first page ones are annoying. If I allowed errors to spoil my entertainment, I'd have to cease trying to be entertained. It would seem error spotting has become a hobby unto itself.Now as for what I find entertaining versus what I don't find entertaining, well, I'm not going to be a perfect match with anyone else.By the way, the enjoyment of a nice set of breasts does not end at age 14! I appreciate them where ever I see them and I have since I was 5 or 6, but for different reasons of course. If suddenly making it past 15 made them no longer enjoyable to see, well, where's the fun in that?These two live-action movies are a different continuity from any thing else that existed before them. What would you expect, a live-action exact duplication just so you can say, ""Oh okay, now I know how that looks as live-action rather than as mere animation or a drawn panel!""?Am I the only one over the decades who has realized that aspect of adapting from one creative format to another?This movie showed me things I've enjoyed before in movies and things I hadn't seen before in movies. I give it a 9 out of 10, to account for the minor flaws.

Entertain! The original transformers, comics or TV show, very rarely ventured into a great story or even exceptional originality. But what made it work was its simplicity and entertainment value. Two opposing sides of an alien race that can each transform into various vehicles (or weapons, in the case of Megatron) and battle it out over planet earth, whether they were fighting for the Autobot matrix or energon the concept was the same. And, one of the best things about the impact of the original movie was how Optimus Prime ended it with 'a lot like us humans are more than meets the eye', which gives the film and gave the cartoon depth.Much like the cartoon, the first film took that concept and introduced these Transformers (both Autobots and Deceptacons) as their own characters and gave them a bit of space to develop. The story was the simplest and correct one, both sides wanted the allspark and a young human is caught in the middle. Let the action do the rest...This time, the Autobots and the military have joined forces to make a special unit to hunt and destroy the Deceptacons on earth. Optimus Prime informs the military chiefs that he believes the Deceptacons are looking for something, which is why they are still on Earth. Meanwhile, Sam is about to depart for college and discovers that he has a small shard of the allspark. Once the Deceptacons discover this and the location of Megatron they set about retrieving the shard and the secret it held which was accidentally unlocked by Sam.So, the plot is basically the same as the original, the young boy has the key to total destruction of earth and the only ones in the way of the Deceptacons and him are the Autobots.This is not a problem! The problem is the rest of the story, which i got lost in quite prominently, i didn't know who i was meant to be following or why and even when i was sure the whole scene seemed to move to a completely new area without any acknowledgement of it.The development of the overall story needs to be kept in check, in this case the story lies with its human stars who don't have enough of a formal interaction with the Transformers to develop. Also, the new Autobots and Deceptacons come in from nowhere and we are supposed to know which side they are on. The thing is we want to know about these transformers, we enjoyed learning about them in the first one it just didn't happen enough, here it doesn't happen at all and it is a huge problem. The fans of the Transformers will know who's who but for a basic audience they have no idea who or what is going on. The new Autobots are never introduced, they are simply there, we don't even know what there names are by the end of the film. I know of Arcee, who was a rather popular member after her debut in the Transformers animated movie, and the twins, who actually manage to get some screen time to themselves, but we want to know a bit more of them.As for the Deceptacons, its more or less the same thing. We are subtly introduced to the Deceptacon Hound, which is actually quite nice, but its first scene leads to nowhere and leaves a huge loose end in the story. The character of The Fallen is the only real introduction we get, which at least is one of the tings that works in this film. The resurrection of Megatron kinda speaks for itself and does work.It goes without saying that the special effects are amazing! If there is any reason that people should see this film it is the scope of the action and how well the special effects make it happen. The action itself is too simple, which i was so surprised at considering its a Michael Bay film. Nothing really happens for long enough, the best action scene is a very nicely filmed battle in a forest which is easily the most exciting part of the film. The rest is not looked at closely enough and contains too much fast cut editing between military commanders giving orders and not what we paid to see... Autobots vs Deceptacons! The film is supposed to be about the Transformers, not the humans who are stood in between (or around) the Transformers. The humans take up too much screen time and don't let the robots have any.The film is much darker and more focused on the evil force of the Deceptacons, not in the best way however. The action scenes are more intense, i will give it that, but when it meets with an unbalanced story to action ratio the problems start to arise. The very little story thats there is attempted to be thickened when its not necessary, if it was kept simple and all the loose ends were tied we would have had much more fun from this film, but as it is we don't get anything that is worth the hype.Better luck with the next one Mr. Bay...","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

An incomprehensible two and a half hour orgy of stupefyingly crass nonsense, this garbage substitutes loud smashes, rapid dialogue, insanely fast editing and a tidal wave of CGI for actual talent, the result being one of the least pleasurable film experiences of my life.In addition to the digitally-enhanced audio-visual maelstrom that constitutes the bulk of this mess, the film also boasts a lousy script (featuring ridiculous comedy relief robots and a randy chihuahua) and some really wooden performances, with poster-boy-for-Dreamworks-SKG Shia La Beouf being the worst offender (let's hope that appearing in Lars Von trier's Nymphomaniac kills his career), and gratuitous eye-candy Megan Fox coming a close second.My ten year old son, who presumably falls slap bang in the centre of the film's demographic, bailed about halfway though, bored to tears by the endless drivel being served up to him; unfortunately for me, I always insist on watching a movie in its entirety before slagging it off, and stayed to the bitter end.

This movie is cinematic diarrhea, it has nothing to say so it shouts as loudly and confusingly as it can. I was dragged me to see it in the theaters by a buddy, and I am confident they will some day have to answer to their maker for that misdeed. ROTF is a visual cacophony of a million moving parts all over the place on top of shaky-cam. It's incredibly stupid, it stands for nothing and inverts itself on its morality time and time again - especially for our ""heroes"" - its so-called plot is nonsensical to a degree that is mind- numbing, it's base and cheap and racist and ugly, it uses its camera to leer at every woman in the cast under the age of 30 with an eye-rapist manner, it's unholy bloated, and even its helmer - Michael Bay - called it ""crap"" despite having an active loathing for the audience who he says will go see it no matter how bad it is. It's not clever or creative or interested in the franchise it's representing or concerned about the audience whatsoever, it is a 2.5- hour long slugfest to sell GM cars and toys and tie-in merchandising opportunities and it doesn't care a lick about entertainment beyond the lowest common denominator. It is a dump truck full of Lucky Charms and McDonalds hamburgers and Twinkies, slowly turning rancid, being poured over the audience until they eat so much that they hate the taste of that junk food which they used to crave. It made action scenes and giant robots and explosions incredibly boring by their utter lack of novelty or restraint.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

However, what I got was an hour and a half of a teen romantic comedy/drama, followed by a couple of brief scenes with robots who were CALLED names that I recognised then a battle which looked like a load of splinted metal crashing against each other.Surely they wouldn't do the same again? Oh, wait - they did, only much, much worse. This is the second time I've watched 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' and it hasn't got much better with age. It's a long film (2.5 hours) and dare I say 90% of it is dedicated to the humans. I know I harp back to the eighties cartoon which did also include humans. However, they weren't often the stars of the show (and if they were for a SINGLE episode, I tended to skip it). Here, I'd quite happily skip every single scene with only humans in it (and therefore reduce the film's runtime to about half an hour).The film follows on from the first, i.e. the good robots (Autobots) are now settled on Earth and are working with the humans to pick off any remaining evil robots (Decepticons). To me, that premise never really worked. Decepticons are huge, nearly indestructible machines of death. An entire army of humans wouldn't really stand a chance against even a single Decepticon. And they don't. It's the Autobots that do all the fighting, meaning what's the point of humans even trying to help in the first place?Anyway, what you get is about two hours of annoying humans and badly-forced attempts at humour. The Transformers are never really used, other in the action scenes which are so badly-shot that it's impossible to tell who's fighting who. You may just about figure out who Optimus Prime and Bumbebee are, but that's only because of their colours. However, every other Autobot and Decepticon looks exactly the same, i.e. a bunch of silver metal thrown together. If you know the characters from other mediums, like the TV show or comic, you'll know all robots have very distinctive looks and personality. In this film, all is thrown away in favour of generic robots who you never really get to know (and example of this is the Autobot 'Sideswipe' who's always been a red car. A RED car. Here's he's silver and on wheels in robot form. Just... why?The robots themselves are the stars, however they never really get to shine in the way that they should. Peter Cullen returns (fortunately!) as the voice of Optimus Prime, but even he's not in it for as long as the LEADER and most recognisable face of the franchise should be. I won't spoil it as to why he's not in it, as the film-makers have spoiled the film enough.I know pretty much every 'Transformers' film has made a tonne of money and this one was no exception. Kids probably love it, but I always feel that films/stories/characters that have been around for a long time with established (and now older) fans need to be handled with a little more care. I'm all for bringing the Transformers to a new generation, but surely it wouldn't be that hard to come up with a way of doing so that appeals to fans, old and new.I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on the film. The youngsters of today clearly lap it all up. I guess I'm no longer the demographic for these 'robots in disguise.' And I haven't even touched on the way the director, Michael Bay, lingers on Megan Fox's body at every given opportunity and the borderline racial stereotypes applied to some of the robots (when they're allowed on screen!).","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Undoubtedly it was a Michael Bay vehicle too, but there he kind of had his s*it together, so the whole thing was bearable while you actually had some time to take in the effects. Now this is the same stuff but with Bay directing it on a pound of cocaine while having an epileptic seizure, it's a catastrophe.The plot is a logic paradox, the cinematography is confusing, everything is constantly spinning and/or exploding. The audio is deafening and the whole thing just keeps going and going, there is no escape from this pandemonium. The stupid, banal, bull*/it comedy element meant to take the edge of this noise and give you a break from time to time is just bashed in randomly EVERYWHERE and misses the mark completely. Not even the effects keep this above sea level as you simply are too busy with dealing with your motion sickness and cleaning the blood out of your ears to make out what is actually happening. There was some eye candy but to be totally honest I simply don't remember any of it. I praised the incredible production value of the first one which hasn't changed here, but the whole thing is just so raging with mindless content, it is not enjoyable anymore. The only thing I was longing for throughout the whole movie was to see a transformer just sit down for a damn second and silently sip a f/ckin diet coke.This is a showcase of everything Bay is so infamous for, I have no idea how a mess like this is able to happen at all at this scope. And note, this is the most expensive movie produced so far. Behold capitalism.3/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

In box-office terms it's the success of the year, reaching 400 million domestically and cracking the top ten highest grossing movies ever. It would appear shallow to consider numbers, but I doubt that Michael Bay or the producers or studio chiefs would mind. At the end of the day, whatever the f*** is up on the screen is probably moot compared to the vast amounts of the almighty dollar made at the expense of a product that can be whatever it wants to be. In this case, what it is is a fiasco of incredible proportions. There's barely a moment I cared about what was going on, who was who, what was fighting what, where the sun (yes, the sun) fit into all of the ballyhoo going on, and frankly, I'm not sure if Bay did entirely either. It's what the ""worst-movie-of-the-decade"" title is all about.Oh, I'm sure Bay thought he was making a good movie, probably a HELLA-GOOD movie by the look of things, as he always does. He has a frenetic eye that has, for better or worse, given him the clout to go wherever and do whatever he wants in his films. But for Revenge of the Fallen he goes further with the stakes of incoherent storytelling/film-making and wasted characters and (some) wasted potential. It's hard, or just not really necessary, to talk about the plot of the film, except that a piece of the Aulspark (sic) is at stake in bringing an enemy force of Decepticons to fight Autobots and the Fallen, a real baddie alien-robot, is out to destroy the world and maybe use the sun for something. How did I come to this conclusion after watching the movie? I looked it up online. That's how bad it is to figure out.But what wasted potential, you might ask? Well, doesn't giant robot battles fused with a plot to use the sun to destroy everything sound like a kick-ass escapist flick? Oh boy, not in Michael Bay's hands it is not. And let's not forget it's not all on him either - the writers, who just this past summer also scribed the new Star Trek picture (perhaps a sign of how crucial a director is in the process of film-making on a massive scale), throw cliché-feces at the audience in a mind-numbing two and a half hours. It's actually an endurance test just to pick out all of the crappy things about the movie, and it all build up, sometimes at astronomical rates. And it's not just Skids and Mudflap being *stoopid* (not racist caricatures so much as part of the cultural f***-all psychology omnipresent), and not just the rampant ludicrous spirit that has no soul or inspiration to it (save, perhaps, for Rainn Wilson as a professor).No, it's just... EVERYTHING! This is a movie where, despite all of the hard work put in by the crew and all of the hours put in and high-flying action scenes choreographed, its makers seem to have something against its own audience. Everything is amped to 11 - bad sex jokes, bad drug jokes, horrible 'inspirational' dialog scenes, and awful ""new"" ideas such as Robot Heaven and robot balls - and all put to Bay's trademark camera-work and editing style, propelling a viewer into scenes that have no proper flow or reasoning, and action that cuts away too fast to get engaged or for us to have reason to invest ourselves in the characters fighting.Even simple things like TIME and PLACE are shot to hell. Take for example two transitions, where our daring-do heroes (i.e. LaBeouf, Fox, Tuturro, Skids/Mudflap, etc) come upon the Smithsonian museum to find some old first-gen Decepticon that's really a jet. They find it and a scene (sort of) happens, then they walk outside and it's... not Washington DC, or is it, since there's a long field and planes. Then, a teleportation happens sending all of the characters to Egypt. Fine, one supposes, until one realizes this is in present time, and day is still day halfway across the world! It would seem one would try to think things through as simple as the logical geography of where the characters are, or the logic of how fast they might travel (Mikaela going from LA to New York in ten seconds, not just movie time), or about what sense there is in the who's who in the robot battles. But there's very little thought put into logic, because Bay has little interest. One almost has to admire how dumb, loud, annoying, idiotic and poorly (or barely present) acted is all turns out to be, like a burrito in a blender spun to a speed of super-volcano-nausea of all of the clichés and formulas of action spectacles that Bay can think of or just pull out of his ass. One may have a few laughs at some of the things in the film, but if it it is never intentional or pleasant... that is, depending on the viewer. One also has to remember how BIG an audience the film had, and how it did, if only in theory, obtain repeat business. It may also sell quite well on DVD.But there is a fact that should be acknowledged: no matter who wins in Transformers, we lose, even if people don't realize or want to fess up. The first film was, as I recall thinking, not a horror-show but just a soulless marketing grab-bag for the line of toys. This time is different. Bay goes past the likes of Armageddon and Bad Boys II. He's entered a league of his own in the I-don't-give-a-crap strata of cinema auteurs. It's a mind-boggling vad of cine-vomit you can take or leave. I'd be surprised to meet the one who takes-takes-takes. For realz.","14 out of 60 found this helpful.

Yes the movie is long, and some of the transformers are rude, but the action is great and we are given more character development for the transformers this time around, and the story was more about the transformers and not just about Sam. But there's still room for Sam's character and all the other humans as well.What more can I say?

It really took Michael Bay as a director to a different league and Steven Spielberg's awesome attention to detail really put the icing on the cake.As an owner of the film both on HD-DVD and Blu-Ray, again unbelievable to watch many times over.So I set myself up to go watch it at the IMax in Westminster and half way through the film I thought... ""What the _ _ _ _ is going on? This cannot be happening. The trailer looked amazing. These guys cannot act. There is no humour and we're half way through the film. Sure the special effects are good but pointless. What's the story - What trash is this????"" As you can imagine being over 2 and a half hours long, being disappointed half way through already meant the rest of the 2nd half was utter torture...I really wanted to walk out - really - but was with a whole group of friends so decided to play the polite game.Absolute Nonsense. I had to go back home and put on Transformers Part 1 to remind myself how good that movie was...What a potentially fantastic franchise killer! Kind of like Seeing Spiderman 3 after seeing the first 2. What is wrong with Hollywood and how can Steven Spielberg put his name to this??? Now its all about PROFIT than classy film making that would live forever.$800m at the box office worldwide - insane - obviously the world is made up of more morons than intellectuals. But then again, in all fairness, I have to be counted in as one of those morons who sat through the film...albeit alongside millions of others thinking to ourselves - ""CRAP FILM"" :(","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Yes you heard right straight in at the top of my chart for worst film ever made is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen a film (and I use the term very loosely) which I can only describe to you by saying imagine the Muppet show starring huge overcomplicated robots re-enacting American Pie, with explosions, lots of explosions. Two hours too long and never quite sure what it wants to be the film is a cobbled together mess of toilet humour, effects and very little in the way of plot and it even seems to have transformed Megan Fox into some sort cheap soft porn star all fake tan and pouted lips that's are never without a ton of gloss. Sam is back as the reluctant hero/nerd who's parents have gone from being really annoying to 'oh my god why doesn't one of these robots just stamp on these idiots'. Just like having the option to view recently released DVDs of 3D films in either 2D or 3D there should be an option to watch this film at half speed just so you can actually see what the hell is going on, the camera just cant seem to stay still for five minutes, my god what am I saying that would make the film even longer. With a budget that could save a third world country from starvation its easy to see where it was all spent as everything from Sam's house to the pyramids is blown to smithereens and then blown up again for good measure, in fact after about thirty minutes of flattening Egypt I was wondering if there was anything left to level? But, ever the trooper, Michael seems to find a constant supply of things to reduce to rubble. Wearing its right wing views like a badge of honour, Transformers manages to disguise its American bombast in all the confusion, but look closely and you will see that Optimus Prime with his Red, white and Blue colours is leading a team against the Decepticon terrorism threat, all of whom are dark and gravely voiced I could go on but it already seems like I'm wasting my time and I already did that by sitting through the damn thing. Needless to say that there are so many things wrong with this film that I could write for days, like how they nicked bits from other films i.e. Terminator, how the oldest Transformer (who is Scottish for god knows what reason) can jump through space but none of the newer models can and why the giant Transformer needed a huge pair of metal Testicles? I kid you not. Two days after I witnessed this and I still feel violated, all my senses feel raped and I still cant quite believe how utterly utterly pants this overblown waste of celluloid was. The first one was bad and so I went in with very low expectations but even so Michael 'I'm a violent sex starved patriotic boy trapped inside a man's body in a creepy way' Bay managed to leave me completely speechless, well until I felt the anger well up enough to start telling anyone who would listen that under no circumstance should you ever ever put yourself through this torturous ordeal.","36 out of 78 found this helpful.

That plus the American military extravaganza/Chest thumping that is embedded in every movie incl The Rock. They should have called this ""Keep transforming"" or something like that.Pathetic!

Yes, Megan Fox is phat, but phat can be classy as well.The story was good and had plot holes like fantasy movies always have, but it was fun, fast and exhilarating. It always amazes me when people watch a movie about things that don't exist and think it doesn't make sense.Except for the Turturro part of the story, there was less humor and the little robots were not very funny.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Coupled with the immensely irritating small-scale Deceptacons which appear numerous times and do nothing but attempt to make any 8 year-olds watching have a giggle by dropping some ill-timed slapstick humour into the mix and talk in an infuriating garbled attempt at endearing themselves with the audience.This is only half an hour into the film, which follows the pattern of immense CGI action scene followed by human interest segment followed by immense CGI action scene followed by, well, you get the picture...I lasted an hour, which is an hour of my life that I'll never get back.

However, the main plot and the historical set up was muddled and somewhat stupid, the characters were even more cartoonish and the dialogue even more fragmented, unprovoked and out of context. The humorous parts from the first movie were replaced with a series of misplaced and increasingly inappropriate p###s and urination jokes with the only successful comedy being delivered from the ever reliable John Turturro.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed 2007's TRANSFORMERS and so went into the theater with high hopes for this action-loaded sequel, and wow...we're my dreams ever crushed. When the film begins, the Autobots have been working with the US government as part of a ""top secret"" program known as NEST since the Mission City battle but the government's getting fed up with the constant Autobot/Decepticon battles. So, while the government tries to shut down NEST and send the Autobots packing to a new planet, the ancient Decepticon known as the Fallen is searching for a long-lost source of Energon on Earth in hopes of using it to raise an army.Wow, looking back at that paragraph, that synopsis does sound as if it'd make for a fun movie...but it doesn't. There were so many aspects of this movie that bothered me that I probably won't even remember to mention them all here. For one, the plot does seem to have some major holes; I cannot understand how, after such a massive city-spanning battle with hundreds upon hundreds of witnesses at the end of the first film, the Autobots are now a government secret. In addition to a shaky plot, the film also suffered from some cringe-inducing performances from characters that I didn't feel were at all necessary and could've easily been scrapped. Ramon Rodriguez as Sam's new college roommate, Leo Spitz....what was the point of him? I was fed up with his childish whining within minutes and yet got to spend the entire movie with him. And, while on the topic of useless characters, the Autobot twins Skids and Mudflap were just aggravating. From the moment they arrived, I couldn't help but picture the crows from DUMBO and I kept hoping that a Decepticon would do us all a favor and take them out.The remainder of the cast failed to grab my attention any better. Megan Fox didn't really come across as well as she did in the first film; I suppose now that the ogling from the first film is over it's easier to see her acting doesn't quite hold up as well. Shia LeBeouf spends the majority of the film moping, hardly his usual wisecracking self. The only ""highlights"" were John Turturro (returning as former Sector-7 agent Simmons) and Kevin Dunn & Julie White (as Sam's parents, though even they wore out their welcome after a while). The only real compliments for the film should be directed at ILM, whose visual effects and Transformer designs are just as amazing as they were on the first film. I just wish I'd had more of an opportunity to appreciate it seeing as how the action is all shown so close-up and so fast that there are points where you can't ascertain what exactly is happening in battle.The second TRANSFORMERS film tries it's hardest to be epic in scope, but fails miserably and you can't help but feel time slow down as you sit through the exhausting 2.5 hour runtime (especially during the seemingly never-ending final battle). As I'd said, I know there are even more grievances that I'm neglecting to mention here but believe me when I say this movie was terrible compared to the first. Since it happened to nab more than $400 million at the domestic box office, another sequel is inevitable. Let's just hope the filmmakers get their act together and bring us another TRANSFORMERS movie we can be proud of.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The same goes for those who are fans of the mythos.With all that said I feel this movie has received too much criticism. If you've seen the first then your expectations should be in line for the second one.On to the movie itself... It's bigger, louder and more obnoxious this time around. At times there's so much going on it seems like I missed a movie in between revenge and the first. It really feels like the ending to a trilogy than the middle.The CGI is great, but Bay added TOO Much to this film. It's like quadruple the first as far as roster of actual transformers as well as the types included in this film (such as insecticons and constructicons) The biggest negative I have for this film would be some of the bad taste in humor. The twins with their gold teeth, street slang, and foul tongues really made me cringe, especially with all the kids in there. It really takes you out of the film when you hear a supposedly sophisticated alien life form saying the word p*ssy. Forthmore, the big robot that you see in the trailers sucking up the sand has testicles which are represented by 2 wrecking balls.Completely unnecessary humor aside, the movie is a lot of fun!","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

The bad news is that effects and music are the only good news.Almost the entire movie was over-acted, though I honestly don't think the actors can be totally to blame when they're given such awful lines. In addition, they're working with a plot that has holes so big, I could drive Optimus Prime through them. I can handle chick-flicks any day of the week, but the ""romance"" in this movie was almost painful to watch; it was so unbelievably cheesy. As for its comedic elements, I only remember laughing once or twice despite repeated attempts at humor. Probably 65% of the movie was action and fight sequences, so I have a feeling that (in a feeble attempt to maintain some balance of plot, action, drama, romance, humor, etc.) the writers overcompensated, trying to cram everything else into that remaining 35%. The voices for most of the Transformers are over-the-top stereotypical of certain groups and races of people, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were downright offensive to many people. At 2.5 hours, the movie is pretty long, and though I am easily entertained, I was actually bored by the end of the movie and wanted it to end.Now, bad acting, plot holes, sappy romance, etc. are all fine if it's a kids' movie or something, but it can't even be classified as that because it is so needlessly crude- I think I saw humping no less that three times. There were several unnecessary butt shots and references to balls, testicles, and a scrotum. There was drug material, and there was twice as much foul language as the first movie. I mean, come on- these are hardly elements of a kids' movie.On top of all that, I fail to see how this movie has anything to do with the classic Transformers universe. They just took the basic premise and the classic characters and completely fabricated a new universe and storyline. How disappointing for people actually familiar with the original!...Anyways, to sum up- for all of the ridiculous hype, I would have expected this movie to be at least on par with the first movie (which was at least average), but it failed to reach even that mediocre level. I'm a sucker- I paid $10.25 to see this film, and I seriously regret it. Please learn from my mistake and do not give this movie anymore money. If you must see it, please wait for it to come out on video, then rent it. Then you will see what I am talking about.I give 3 stars instead of 1, simply because the special effects rocked.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The numbers speak for themselves: the movie made over 700 million in a mere 3 weeks. Its easy to say bad things about the movie but Mr. Bay understood the concept of making a box office hit perfectly and thats what its all about here. Obviously its not the movie with the best acting and the finest story but although there are some flaws, its decent enough. The story is actually not that bad and explained in a decent way throughout the movie. As for the jokes: some are lame but the crowd in the cinema had a good laugh so that says it all. The special effects and computer animations are off the chart. I think this movie sets a new standard when it comes to cgi. This is a movie you must see in a cinema to enjoy it to the fullest.

Enlarging the scale you consider these things, you strangely find out that in most parts of the world (actually just about everywhere except North America and Western Europe and perhaps Australia & NZ) the word 'stalker', for example, doesn't even exist (any translator would have hard time trying to explain that word to a local). I suppose, only the stalkers (and the sexual serial killers) would be enough to show, somewhat consistently, that the American type of early-learning sexual education have failed. OK, they learn how to do it (guess what: the humans have multiplied themselves long before the American education), then they learn to do it safely, but they also become obsessed. Think, for example, of all the super- close shots of sexual organs in a porn movie. That's not erotic, that's sick. If you stick your eyes into your girlfriend's butt or sex, you are sick.Bay & Co. had also some sick stuff in the first 'Transformers' movie, but the ones here are simply inadmissible. Again, don't forget that this is a movie children are interested in most.Now, I lived 23 years under dictatorship, so I'm among the first ones to tell you that that's bad (putting it VERY mildly). But a good side (perhaps the only one) indeed was there: sick (and contagious) people like Michael Bay were never left at large.So, enjoy your popcorn. Meanwhile, I had to explain my 12 years old kid why he can't see this movie (I first watch all movies he's interested in; have to do that, in this post-modern world - read: post-any-values world). And I can't explain. And he hates me. Now think about that: someone getting millions for bringing hatred between a son and his father, who only tries to raise him to be normal - if normal is anything this world can stand.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Many criticise the ""Lord of the rings"" films for being over-long, but at least in those movies things happened, nothing happens here but a far from fantastic cast sometimes spouting awful lines while some of the worst action ever directed is poured by the truckload onto the screen. Who would have ever thought that two massive robots smashing ten bells out of each other would be as tiresome as watching a TV shopping channel? Then there is Mudflap and Skids that make Jar Jar Binks look tolerable, the ""plot"" that mostly involves the cast running over there, driving over here, flying over to this place, doing this then doing that and none of it is ever clear why, they just do it. This really could be the worst film ever made simply down to the fact that it cost so much money to make, but then again it did make a fortune back in the box office, and the worst part is that some of that box office takings is my doing. They never got me in for the third one though so that is at least something.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Maybe the only novelty in the film is the new robots like ""The Fallen"", the twins and others. The special effects are awesome and the CGI is amazing. The cast is really good, Shia LaBeouf repeating as Sam Witwicky was good, in this movie he is more like an action hero. Megan Fox looking extremely hot and with a decent performance.

"1","/10","Typical Bay flick - big explosions with NO story","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2089704/?ref_=tt_urv","dobstyle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21388599/?ref_=tt_urv","2 July 2009","I just saw this last night. I am a fan of the first one; it may not have had the deepest plot and story-line but there was some substance to go along with the fun special effects laden action.I was very excited for the second movie - I'm 25, Transformers was a part of my childhood.Once again Micheal Bay ruins what could have been a good movie by relying on big explosions and effects to mask a dreadfully boring plot and story. The entire time I kept thinking ""Well what is the significance of this part? Well who is this robot? WHY are they fighting? HOW does this scene relate to anything? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!?"" I'm talking about even within the opening scenes. And the swearing? Out of place! The Jar Jar Binks-esquire comedy relief just added another layer of disappointment.Loved the first one... but my god this movie flat out sucks. I didn't believe the negative reviews on here and went to see this garbage anyway when I could have saved my time and money. Don't bother with this one. Get the first on Blu-Ray and avoid this kick to the brain. If you have any taste you'll wait for it to hit DVD to rent. At least then you're only out a few bucks.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Michael Bay is a douche, yet also AWESOME","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2085918/?ref_=tt_urv","loreal_boy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15654052/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2009","I'd like to say my 10/10 may have been an exaggeration, but this film is definitely an IMDb 8.Most of the comments I've read have been justified, this film is over the top, there are limitless explosions and the acting is mediocre to poor.HOWEVER...One must remember that the basic premise of Transformers is about alien robots who turn into machines, characterisation and subtlety where never going to be the film's strongest points, let alone Michael Bay's. Nevertheless if you take this film for face value, i.e. the most epic summer blockbuster of all time you're in for entertainment not experienced since the dark knight. (I emphasise the use of the word entertainment).I'll start with the plot, whilst some describe it as incoherent and confusing one must remember this is a SCI-FI film. Without ruining anything Orci and Co create a mythology to capture the titanic struggle between Decepticon and Autobot (involving yet not as philosophically interesting as Jedi and Sith). Whilst the human development throughout the film is weaker (and the acting doesn't make this any better), it's entertaining nonetheless, but I definitely think it's a strength to the film that it takes a back seat to the perennial clash between Megatron and Optimus Prime.A common complaint of Michael Bay is his ridiculous cinematography and score, detached and unemotive at the best of times. However in this film it work, the panning shots and stylistic themes as the US military ""brings the rain"" definitely add the appeal of the film, it makes you feel like an excited 10 year after watching a rocky montage; excited about the action of the next scene.Then there's the CGI... Many have ranted about it's awesomeness, whilst others have complained that it represents the worst of Hollywood. Both views are justified but one cannot help but marvel at the sheer elegance by which the robots move. The fight scenes could be better choreographed - there seems to be no consistency in spatial or temporal battle, but then again I remember thinking the same thing about Star Trek or the Dark Knight. I must say regardless of yours views on Michael Bay, the transformers franchise, or explosions (and there are lots of them) I think it would be impossible to come out of the cinema without a smile and thinking ""that was seriously cool"". It is definitely not a waste of time or money and I personally found the pacing absolutely fine.To conclude, Revenge is an unapologetic Michael Bay epic. The scale and plot are at least entertaining, and at best ridiculously awesome. You could either love or hate this film, however if you try and appreciate it for what it is, you will feel 8 years old again, full of imagination and excitement. Bay captures the feeling of getting your first set of transformers and playing with them all day long in your bedroom, creating elaborate story plots and set piece battles. The difference is he creates a titanic bedroom!","18 out of 37 found this helpful.

It isn't the worst film that has been made or could be made but it certainly isn't good. It was just a sloppy thrown together mess that lacks the heart, emotion, or fun plot of the first film. The first Transformers movie was a perfect example of an excellent film while ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is a perfect example of a bad film.My two major complaints are this: 1) The Transformers were very undeveloped. It was just a bunch of huge machines thrown together smashing each other's block off. The action was just sloppy. Things were being thrown around and there were huge explosions for absolutely no reason. It was almost impossible to even see what is going on during all of the explosions and action. Since the characters were not developed I did not feel any connections with them besides the main characters(Shia Labouf, Megan Fox, Optimus Prime, and Bumblebee). So my point is that it was just a bunch of giant metal men that we did not care about beating the crap out of each other for what seemed like hours.2) The film did not have the heart that the first one had. The first film had everything from action, a good plot, mystery, sci-fi elements, romance, car/race/chase scenes, adventure, great acting, and a feeling of dedication and heart that radiated from the film. This film had hardly any plot at all and definitely no heart. Nothing in this film worked.So in conclusion this film felt sloppy and an excuse to make a lot of money and have big explosions. Stay as far away from it as possible.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

This isn't a film for those looking for a smart plot or realistic story lines and physical motion - this is something to visually gawk at, and sonically admire.

Bay delivers a 150 minute spectacle featuring a wide array of shiny cars, military vehicles, and of course, giant, transforming robots. Even though the film lasted two and half hours, I felt like my sensory receptors had been fried beyond repair.The film picks up right where the last film left off. For those who haven't seen the first film, it is of some importance to see it prior to Revenge, but it is not completely necessary. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is off to college to try and lead a normal life. Mikaela (Megan Fox) stays behind and tries to maintain their long distant relationship. They might be ready for a normalcy, but they aren't quite out of the woods just yet.Meanwhile, the Autobots have been working with the military to try and stop the Decepticon's from taking over the planet. Lead by Optimus Prime and Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel), the secret squadron stumbles upon a new plan to take over and could result in the destruction of the Autobots as well as the entire planet. The Autobots call for Sam's help once more, for he holds the key to Earth's safety and the destruction of the Decepticon armada. The answer has been imprinted onto his brain (don't worry how, it just was).The following is a wild goose chase that spans the globe. When we're not watching giant robots destroy everything in sight, there are only a few things left to do. Bay has mastered the art of distraction. He uses his characters and settings to fill up the gaps in between the action scenes. Fox's character in particular has a number of shots that have nothing to do with the scene or even the entire film. We all remember her pose looking under the hood of Sam's car in the first film. Well, there are about a dozen or more of those here. Yes, Megan Fox is attractive, but we can see her in magazines and on the Internet if we want pictures like that. The movie should be restricted to what is most important.Another distraction and time waster Bay uses are the car and military vehicle transitions. Whenever the transformers are driving around, it looks like a commercial for Chevy or GMC. All that is missing is a disclaimer on the bottom of the screen in regards to the low APR financing. These shots pale in comparison to the military shots. I know Bay has connections with just about ever branch of the armed services. He wants us to make sure we know it, too. He uses virtually every possible piece of hardware the military has to offer from ships to planes to tanks. There is even some water/hovercraft here. Why? Do we really need to show off what our country has? One or two might be okay, but we see a new one every time we change locations or start a new mission. It is a bit ridiculous.These distractions aside, there is a glaring flaw with the film and it lies within the screenplay. The story is too strung out and goes on way longer than it should be. This film doesn't have to have the greatest of plot twists or things like that. It needs to take us from one robot fight to the next. Let's face it, Transformers is not about the humans being saved but about the giant robots who run around blowing each other up scene after scene after scene. In between those scenes needs to be decent filler, something the first film had. The in between scenes here are annoying, poorly written, and could be condensed.With all of that against the movie, there is one major upside (that saves the movie) and it is the Transformers. They are big, loud, and full of energy. Here is an example of a film where slow motion is used positively. It's fun seeing Optimus Prime headlock and gut an enemy Decepticon. It's even more fun watching it in slow motion. What Bay accomplished in the first film was a sense that these fights were taking place in real locations with real people and environments interacting with the robots. He applies the same conditions here and on a much more epic scale.So it's not a great movie. It's too long, too cheesy, and confused at times. What it does offer is some guaranteed entertainment that just might make up for the near eleven dollar ticket price. If you don't expect a masterpiece and are looking to see some giant, killer robots wreak havoc on the world, enjoy.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The plot is exceptionally awful. Basically Sam Witwicky is going off to college. At the same time the Decepticons are planning an attack on the Autobots and a whole war is starting up. Sam finds that he still has a piece of the Allspark cube that was destroyed in the first movie and when he looks at it the symbols get imprinted into brain, which the Decepticons are after. Also, another unrelated part of the story involves a robot named The Fallen who wants to destroy the sun with a machine hidden in the pyramids. I didn't fully understand the plot, therefore I won't be able to explain the entire plot. These elements in the script are really not related and you can tell one story being completely dropped and forgotten about.The acting in this movie is never a requirement but I'm still going to comment on it. I thought that Shia LaBeouf actually gave a great performance in this movie and he's definitely overqualified for Transformers. If he were to be in a drama, he would be great.Now, Megan Fox is only in the movie because she's hot and that may be true, however she's a terrible actress.John Turturro who actually has a much larger part in this movie than he has in the first film. He's clearly in the movie as a comic relief and the jokes involving his character are sometimes very absurd.Getting off the topic of performances, I would like to mention that the action in this movie is bigger and better than the first film. There's so much more robots fighting if that's what you're into. The CGI is also incredible with the very detailed robots. There are many parts to them, but this could be a disadvantage because a lot of them look like a bunch of metal pieces stuck together with faces. However, you could tell that the budget was very large on this movie because there's practically a new thing exploding in every scene. By now this is Michael Bay's trademark and it can really get old quickly.There were some improvements in this movie that really bothered me in the first movie. The major improvement was that Michael Bay actually managed to keep the camera still for a lot of the movie, so I can actually tell exactly what was going on in a robot fight. In the first movie, he would constantly be moving the camera and you wouldn't be able to tell what was going on. However, there was one scene where Shia LaBeouf's character is saying goodbye to his girlfriend played by Megan Fox before he goes to college and the camera constantly circles very fast and it really wasn't necessary.The difference is that the plot was a pretty good in the first movie around all the action sequences. In the sequel, the story is much worse as I have mentioned before. One part that bothered me is when Shia LaBeouf left college suddenly and never came back after only being there for a few minutes. We never saw that again and it was never explained if he ever even went back.When I was reading the reviews before I saw the movie, everyone was mentioning The Twins who were extremely racist stereotypes. A lot of the things they said were too offensive and crude but they didn't offend me that much. I didn't like the addition of the gold teeth and the fact they couldn't read, but other than that they made me laugh. They just didn't need as much screen time as they were given.The biggest problem with Transformers 2, is that it is way too long. It's about 2 & ½ hours and just six minutes longer than in 2007. This movie could have easily trimmed out a half hour just from the useless comedy scenes and maybe it would have been bearable. I started looking at my watch about an hour and a ½ in. I would even stop paying attention to the action sequences because I had become so bored near the end that I just wanted it to be over.I would also like to talk about the IMAX. I honestly can't say that it's a good idea to watch it in IMAX. You assume that it's a bigger screen and more enjoyable but for most of the movie it's only using the middle of the screen with some specific scenes that are shot with an IMAX camera. I'll have to admit that the IMAX shots were incredible and really made me feel like I was actually there with them in the desert. When it's being used, it's even more impressive than 3D, it's just that it's not used enough to pay five dollars extra for a ticket.Overall, I can't honestly say that I enjoyed the movie more than the first one, so I guess that means I believe the first movie was better. I'm fine with that, it's just that I still didn't like the first one because it was boring and had similar flaws this movie had. Overall, this is just a bad franchise and I actually wouldn't mind if I never see a third one. Even if they improve it, there's no more stories left to even keep it interesting.So, that's my review of the film. I give it a 5/10, and I personally don't recommend it. However, if you're a big fan of explosions than this is the movie for you. What should you see instead if you don't like explosions? Probably The Hangover again.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

In the first movie the autobots just got trashed by the decpticons but in this movie the autobots also put up a good fight. They have shown more variety in the robots and their forms. I know that the human form of the robot clashes with the original transformers but still....... I also liked the robots combining together. The thing i didn't like about the movie is that they haven't focused more on the new arrivals like Arcee and sideswipe. They were really cool and deserved more attention and credit. The movie became a little confusing because of the drones.

It is a summer blockbuster on steroids: you'd like to laud the accomplishment, but it feels like cheating. In other words, ""Fallen"" appears to be the greatest spectacle of visual effects and stunts ever made, but simultaneously the most overproduced screaming pile of junk Hollywood has served us in this computer-generated era.You have to give Michael Bay credit, the man sticks to his directorial convictions: explosions, chases and more explosions. Despite getting reamed for years for his overkill style, he seems to feel like it's not worth making a sequel unless you're committed to visually dwarfing the first one. What his approach, and the approach of this entire film should have been, was not to overload this thing and instead hit the audience hardest where it counts most. ""Fallen"" is more than overly ambitious: the script is a barreling mack truck and the audience like roadkill stuck in its grill.""Fallen"" enlightens us that humans and transformers actually have a history on Earth, the only plausible way to harvest a story after a straight-forward, sensible and enjoyable first film. Two years later, the U.S. Military and the Autobots have joined forces to eliminate the surviving Decepticons that threaten Earth. After the opening scene ravishing China, however, it's not that simple. Our human hero, Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), has discovered that a shard from the first film's All Spark, an energy source giving life to Transformers, has been with him all this time, and now it's suddenly transferred crucial information to him that contains the whereabouts of another energy source somewhere on Earth that could give the Decepticons their revenge. As with the first film, that's not all. Dozens of characters and subplots (Sam going to college, the Obama administration trying to shut down the operation between the Army and the Autobots and of course the sexiest woman alive, Megan Fox, trying to get her boyfriend to say three small words.As for new Transformers, it seems as if Hasbro, creators of the hit action figures for decades now, put a mandatory quota on needing x number of new products appearing on screen for toy-mongering children to beg their parents for. ""Fallen"" is loaded with new bots, including the famous Devastator, a five-transformers-joined-into-one monstrosity that resembles a living junkyard and is even equipped with ""testicles."" Yes, that's part of ""Fallen""'s obnoxious and horrific sense of humor. It was pretty even hit- or-miss in the first movie, but this film is even more insulting to its audiences comedic intelligence. Take ""the twins"" for example: idiotic gold-toothed stereotypes in the form of those compact Chevys (GM, how fitting) throwing insults at each other. They are second to only Jar Jar Binks. The writers also seem to think adding Sam's new college roommate is a good idea -- when John Turturro (also pointlessly back) stuns him to sleep to shut him up, it's almost as if they knew what an annoyance he was. It's hard to believe that at least Orci and Kurtzman, who delivered an awesome ""Star Trek"" script last month, were behind such frivolous dialogue. I can't fault them for the absurdity of the plot and lack of themes -- they were paid a lot and their hands were tied -- but the forced humor? Terrible.Still, as easy as ""Fallen"" is to rip on, it gets a few stars out of respect for the man hours it must've taken to turn this film over in less than two years and make it as much of a visual masterpiece as it is. Though Bay could have made it less frenetic with not as many camera circle-arounds, you can tell every sequence had to have been planned so far ahead and done perfectly on every take. Let's hope the next one, Bay or no Bay, condenses quantity into quality and gives this franchise back its storytelling dignity. At the least, let Hollywood learn, in the peak of the CG era, that less is more. ~ Steven CVisit my site: http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

This second part repeat the same formula, consisting of showing outstanding special effects and dismissing any trace of a solid story. Like in the first one the plot was so ridiculous that even the amazing figths between the robots could save this movie from the disaster. In this occasion Mr.Bay, at least, has the vision of not using some stupid characters from the first one, the only trouble was that he changed them for other stupids characters, plus the fact that he made more stupids other characters that on the first movie passed as mediocre fun characters (f.e Sam's parents). Another weak point about the movie is that is so long that if you're not an eight years old kid you won't be able to avoid feeling sleepy in the middle of the movie and It's because after the first fifteen minutes you keep watching until the end credits a non interesting succession of images. Don't misinterpret me I can enjoy funny movies, I liked Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and others and I do believe that you can do a fun Sci-Fiction movie with great special effect and also a great story, if you don't believe me just look The Matrix.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Transformers 2 did an excellent job at what it is suppose to do which is entertain its audience. It had funny moments, over the top character actors, incredible graphics.Michael Bay did it again with Revenge of the Fallen, he created a fun packed action film with some of Hollywood's young superstars who are becoming cash cows for the industry, such as Meagan Foxx who every teenager and grown up adult wants to fantasize about.The story is filled with many plot holes, the characters are written very cliché, the 360 camera use and constant slow motion on screen were all there but if anyone can have those in a movie and still make one hell of an enjoyable film its these film creators they have done it before and they will do it again. Don't go into this movie expecting and serious relatable human people because everyone is exaggerated to the extreme and the fights are very chaotic when at times it shouldn't be and some parts you can't believe happened the way they did but during the movie this doesn't cross your mind.This film is a summer blockbuster, it will bring enjoyment to those who watch it, it delivers state of the art CGI, action and a hottie on camera who oozes sex every second she is on screen. The movies that make the most money are rarely if ever the Oscar winners, they are the ones you enjoy the most and this movie delivers, if they had a most fun, enjoyment movie of the year, Transformers 2 would be a clear favourite for this year.8/10 ~XTC","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Most transformers fans disregard the transformers ""haters"" comments as irrelevant as they fail to see what this movie was made for. It was not made to be a cinematic masterpiece, but a blockbuster which would entertain the audience for 2 hours and 27 minutes. So does it succeed in being entertaining? In my opinion it does not. Watching action sequences can be entertaining for a while, but unless there is a reason for the viewer to care about what happens during the action sequences, they quickly become boring. In my opinion, this movie does not leave the viewer with any reason to care about what happens during the action sequences, and the initial fascination quickly turns into boredom, especially in the last hour of this movie. This is also why I think other Michael Bay movies, such as The Island and The Rock were decent movies, while this one does not deserve a second viewing","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

However the movie is far from sci-fi greats such as Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, and Jurassic Park. Now its highly unfair to rate this movie to those but I want to make perfectly clear that most people outside the target zone will find this movie a bore.At 2 and half hours long this movie could easily be cut down in length, and while watching it the viewer could pick out scenes that could be thrown out to do just that. The movie's constant random humor (from parents getting high to a giant robot having balls located in certain region) greatly takes away from a decent story and beautiful action scenes and computer visuals. I feel that if the movie would have removed those scenes I would be giving this a 7 or 8. But when a movie has not 1 but 2 jar jar binks in it, I struggle to give it a good rating.As for the fun factor, if you're looking for time to kill, or are dying to see this movie, See it in theaters. The visuals wont hold up at home so find a day where your theater has discount days and see it then.This movie is far from the best i've ever seen but its not the worst. If you're looking for an awkward blend of comedy and slow-mo, then try not to pay more than 8 dollars seeing this movie.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

A lot. I saw it four times at the cinema. It tapped into something inside me, the child that used to play with the action figures, and brought the way that felt right out. Revenge Of The Fallen was good, maybe not as good as the first film, but still well worth seeing on the big screen.The Autobots are now working with the two soldiers from the first film (Josh Dushamel and Tyrese Gibson) in a covert alliance to fight the Decepticons, whilst protecting the general public from knowledge of the robots' existence. Needless to say, giant robots are kinda conspicuous, and on a mission in Shanghai they screw up and a Decepticon is set loose. It's final words: The Fallen will rise again.... Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia Laboef) is going to college and has to leave Bumblebee behind. As he is leaving, he touches part of the Allspark (from the first film) and begins to have visions and write down symbols leading to a source of Energon, which puts the Decepticons hot on his trail.What I love about this movie is the fighting between the robots. They are much more epic than they were in the first film, and the audience can actually see whats going on. The effects overall seem more polished and clearer, and the Transformers themselves look like they fit into the scenery. We also get to see another world, which looks very nice. With the exception of Star Trek, these are some of the best special effects I have seen this year.Story-wise, its a little too convoluted. The films comes out at around two and a half hours long, and my god I started to feel it after around one and a half. There are a lot of clever elements, the concept of The Fallen was very good, and the relationships between characters seem a lot better. For example, Megatron and Starscream have a much more venomous relationship with each other than in the first film, which works really well. The human characters are pretty much the same as they were in the first movie, not really that deep, but not blank or vacuous either. The movie has a little bit less heart than the first, the only time I really cared about the characters were when Sam and Bumblebee were on screen together. The Transformers themselves had a degree of charm, but I wasn't feeling it as much as the first movie.This was written by the same guys who did Star Trek, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and its really nowhere near as good. Its got a lot of the charm and action it needs but it really overdid the humour. There are way too many jokes, and around 70% of them are really not funny. The film also falls really flat about halfway through. This is not as disappointing as Terminator Salvation by far, but not as mindblowing as Star Trek is. I'd give it a 6 out of 10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

On this site I gave the original movie 7/10 and called it a good popcorn movie, even though the early part of that movie was really bad and took a while to improve.Did start hearing bad things from movie reviewers which made me think I should give this movie a miss...but a cinema chain here in Australia had a promotion where I won a discount ticket, so I waited until this movie was off the No Free List category to see it.So, where does this movie go wrong? Well, at least the original movie had humour going for it...it took a while to get going, after initially being cringe-worthy. The sequel doesn't have any humour worth noting. It's not even cringe-inducing. You just have a blank expression when they try it on.Worst of all, in an effort, perhaps, to compensate for the mechanical characters' lack of charisma and empathy, the movie goes down the awful George Lucas route, creating a couple of mechanical characters (known as ""Don't Know"" and ""Don't Care""...just kidding on that, although I really don't know these characters' names) modelled on Jar Jar Binks...loosely based on racial and ethnic stereotypes in the human world. Not being American, I can't say that I really find their brand of American jive-talk very entertaining at all. It's really awful...small boys may like their humour and machismo though.What is watching this movie like? Well, it's like spending around two and a half hours with drunk, spaced out, self-obsessed teenagers talking about EVERYTHING...or, watching small boys play in a sandpit with Transformers toys, and listening to their running commentary-for two and half hours-...or watching teenage boys playing the new Transformers video game...for TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!Sure, there is LOTS of action in this movie. But to tell you the truth, this series ends here for me. Enough is enough. Director Michael Bay would really have only one way to 'improve' on this movie next time round...two and a half hours of a single Transformers chase where pretty much everything en route gets destroyed. Even if he did this, I wouldn't watch it...because this is just one big, stupid, action packed movie. The destruction wreaked in the first movie was entertaining. And the ads for the sequel seemed even more exciting, in this regard. But it just doesn't impress as much when married into this tedious movie.Like the first movie, the film makers either seem to not know who they are pitching this movie at, or, more likely, perhaps, they are trying to appeal to all ages, which makes some of the material in this movie inappropriate to young children (there is much leering camera work in this movie of young bodies etc).With regards to the sexual aspects to this movie, I must say I have been misinformed...seeing girlie calenders in motor mechanic garages, I always thought that the scantily dressed beautiful young women draped over motorcycles were being sexually exploited...turns out they were putting artwork on the bikes instead! Megan Fox's character demonstrates this early on...and you get a nice, leering shot up her shorts...think you see panty too.In other words, this is about two and a half hours of things blowing up (for small boys) and titillation (for teenage boys).Do yourself a favour-record the ad for this movie when it plays on TV. And when you think you want to watch the movie, watch the ad instead. It's really good!Three words: T.D.S.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The actual object that brought this movie downward was the continuous stooping to this immature level. They kept stopping but the romance was never built and so the story couldn't keep tempo.First of all, I wanna to discuss on the visual effects and action scenes which are superb but unluckily you hardly see any action in the first half, and then it's is divided by pointless and boring romantic scenes. I liked the first Transformers and I was very anxious to see this 'Transformers 2' but after may be an hour, I was anxious to walk off. I went to watch the Robots battling and that's what I saw for about 90% in this movie. Therefore, if ""Transformers 1"" didn't please you, then this part 2 is not worthy-watching for you.The major problem with the movie is that it doesn't carry anything new to the blend. The cast is about totally the same.It is mainly a war among the robots with humans trapped in the middle in different places. There is some great acting, particularly by Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Megan Fox and Josh Dunhamel.But overall, this movie is visually vibrant and possesses the most terrific special effects than the previous Transformers. It was legitimately interesting. This movie is not a complete spoiler, but I do let drop some stuff. Overall it's a good movie and gets a deserving 8/10 by me.For all Hollywood Leather jackets, visit desertleather.com","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's like Bay didn't know if he wanted to make the movie a comedy or an action, so he decided to do ""teen comedy"" and half ass the action. If i wanted to laugh at some ""teen humor"" i would have watched The hangover again and laugh my ass off. I wanted to see some transformers not some sub college storyline. The story was to slow pace for me and i almost ended up falling asleep. (probably not from the movie but from me only having three hours of sleep.) Overall, i didn't like it but that doesn't mean other people will. The midnight crowd i was with absolutely loved this movie and gave it a standing ovation to close it out. When i was walking out the theater, i could hear other people telling their friends that ""it was the best movie ever"" and things like ""Nothing can top this."" So if i can leave you with one thought about this is that go watch it and make up your own mind about the movie. Love it or hate it, definitely Transformers 2 is going to make some M-O-N-E-Y","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

So don't walk into the theater thinking your gonna be blown away by a masterpiece, because you won't . But trust me, you'll have a good time, and a lot of people say the same.

The film gave the audience everything that was already seen in the first film, this time just in a much more bigger scale than before – it was like an updated version of the first Trasformers (2007) with no original ideas to add.Where the first film was OK brainless fun, this one is not; the jokes, the action, the story – everything feels very much forced and pre-calculated, there's no surprises or any signs of imagination or real effort. I consider Michael Bay to be a decent director and great in making what he does best; cheesy Hollywood action movies (like The Rock (1996)), but Transformers 2 just feels so tedious and breathless that it was even a bit of a surprise considering who was holding the reins.There's not much to the story: Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LeBeouf) goes off to college, comes across with some important information about the Transformers' ancient past and then get's chased by all kinds of shape shifting robots... A lot of explosions accompanied with cheesy music ensues. The rest of the cast from the first movie makes a return, though most of them having little if anything to do on the screen, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) being the most obvious example. The cast does a decent job but the enthusiasm found in the first film was all gone, the often ridiculous dialog possibly being one reason for that.Transformers 2 lacks a real script and real effort which made the film unsalvageable even by the good visuals the film has to offer through-out. The explosions and the robots all look good but made hollow by the mindlessness of it all: the film's like a picture gallery or a showcase of what's possible to do in today's CGI with no meaning beyond that point. I had a horrible experience with the film. 1/4","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I did have some gripes with it (Mainly being that the transformers themselves didn't seem to have that much screen time, much less fighting each other). But I figured, hey, Michael Bay will take the time to learn from the first movie and make an even better sequel!BOY was I wrong.First, I will give you some of the positives about this film.1. More giant robot action 2. More slomo Megan Fox (If you're into that kind of thing) 3. More interaction between the decepticons, Particularly Megatron and Starscream, giving them a truer G1 feelAnd now Lets get to the negatives1. Most of the autobots that I looked forward to seeing were basically ABSENT the entire film. I want to say that besides Optimus and ""the twins"" (More on them in a bit) no autobot had more than two lines the entire film. Yes we did get more robot action in a sense but none of it really mattered to me when I barely knew any of the characters fighting. Some of the new additions had virtually no lines and were barely even featured in the movie. To complete the ensemble we also have Simmons and Roommate who are almost as annoying to watch. Overall very disappointing.2. ""The Twins"". I'm sure if you haven't seen the movie, most of you have heard about this lovable duo. WOW are they annoying! Just blatant stereotypes of uneducated hood rats, complete with a gold tooth and little to no reading skills. Truly a pain too watch throughout the movie, especially considering they could have used the screen time to focus on much better characters they already had.3. The humor. They took the humor from the first movie, and basically cracked that baby all the way to 11. And if you think that's a good thing, boy I wish I had your sense of humor, cause all I got was a load of static. Seriously though at times the humor seemed so forced and unnecessary I wanted throw something at the screen. Needless to say a majority of the jokes includes robo-balls, old man behind, robo-humping, dog-humping, robo-genetalia... You get the picture. Crude, rude, and 100% unoriginal4. The Plot. I won't spoil much of anything, but I just want to say there are some parts that still have me shaking my head. The writing was not exactly top notch either, suffice to say I had to cringe every once in awhile to think ""Did he/she really just say that?""Too top it all off, the film goes on for a long time, long enough where near the end I had a head-ache from watching everything going on. In the end, I really didn't care too much what happened because the best of the movie had already past and I was just waiting for it too end. Some may like this just to get their daily dose of intense action scenes,which were fantastic, but not enough to save this movie from being entertaining for anyone that wants more than a mass of cgi and lame sex jokes. Oh and before I forget5. Devastator, Nothing like the original version and completely useless at that. Seemed more like a slow dying gorilla.See this only If you do not have to pay money.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Michael Bay does his usual trademarks shots but with more o.t.t action, it doesn't stop. The SFX are so impressive, you can see where Michael Bay used the money. The robots are very well done, much like the first but shows a more in-depth look at them transforming. The story is enjoyable and even thought it is 147 mins long, it flys by. Shia Lebouf is back as enjoyable Sam and Megan Fox (hottest women on the planet) shows off the goods. This is the best film of the summer. And yes, I loved Star Trek but i'm more a Transformers fan.

It had everything from Optimus Prime to Megan Fox. What's not to like? The answer: plenty.Don't get me wrong, I'm a Michael Bay fan. I loved Armageddon and Bad Boys, and I was a fan of the first Transformers film. But Bay messed up big time with the sequel. Normally, I'd try to find ways to defend Bay, but this is his fault. The skill he showed in his previous summer blockbusters is gone. Even though Bay screws up big time, it's not entirely his fault.While the robot cast is terrific (Peter Cullen should get an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Optimus), most of the human cast is dreadful. Don't get me wrong, I like Shia LaBeouf, but he's really trying too hard in this flick. He stutters half his lines and when he's not doing that, he's just yelling nonsense. As if that's not bad enough, he gets more Razzie help with his annoying parents and an equally annoying roommate. On the contrary, the Transformers girls, Fox and Isabel Lucas, are great additions to this film. For the ladies, there's Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, but he barely gets any time. And John Tuturro, genius in the first film, is superb, but by the time he hits the screen (about an hour and a half into the film) it's a lost cause.Even the robots are not safe from error. There's these two annoying robots who are bound to stir up some type of controversy. They are annoying, rude, and unnecessary. In addition, the main villain, the titular Fallen, is introduced, but then forgotten about and not revisited until an hour later. Rest assured, this happens numerous times, which also leads to questions about the length (a crappy 2 1/2 hours) Overall, Transformers 2 was a big, loud mess. As far as robot movies go, Terminator Salvation was much better. Call me what you will, but I did not like it. Everyone I know loved it, but maybe that's another thing. The hype machine was overflowed, so maybe that's why I was disappointed. But who knows? Maybe you're asking the wrong guy. Need proof? While my friends waited for this, I'm just counting the days until Inglourious Basterds comes out. But heed my warning. Don't transform your cash into a ticket for a crappy movie","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Major props to the guys at ILM.My problem is and has always been with Bay and his brand of films. Now I fully understand why he does what he does, it's a tough task to create a film that generates $700+ mil that appeals to every demographic. However, in this and every one of his previous films he compromises on story.He wastes too much time developing these useless human characters that add nothing to the story (i.e.: Sam's parents?), where the focus should be the TFs! I want to know more about the TF's background, I want to know more about Ironhide, Ratchet, and the rest - not about some loopy 50 year olds.I also thought the gratuitous use of 'sex' to 'sell' is ridiculous. I'm a guy, but if i want to see sexy girls I watch a porno - i paid to see giant robots saving the earth.There are also a lot of little things that annoyed me and just didn't make any sense. Like the Jetfire character, i was completely disappointed as he was my very first TF toy as a kid. Why would a robot age like a human - hunch over, need a cane, have bad memory, etc? Does that make any sense to anyone? Wouldn't a robot, a machine, function like he did 1000yrs before? Enough rant. I'm a hard-core TF fan and enjoy a great story. Bay at the helm of this franchise is just very disappointing for me. I just wish that they found a director who understands how to create a financially successful film that appeals to the masses, but weaves together a compelling story that makes sense. A film Where everything has a purpose and nothing is gratuitous. We really needed a Chris Nolan, JJ Abrams, or Peter Jackson on this one. I think even Jon Favreau would've done a great job.Regardless, I think this movie will be well received by the general public - I mean my 7 yr old loved it.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The first movie in this franchise was pretty good with a passable story and direction, that isn't the case for this one. The direction is so annoying it almost becomes unbearable. The people that wrote the script to this must have not given any thought, because the plot and direction is very terrible. This movie is a insult to the audiences viewing it, it was sad to hear couple of my friends say this is a enjoyable movie when we saw it in theater. There was just way too many plot holes in this movie and the plot holes become so annoying because they are too obvious and there are a lot of them in this. Sequels tend to suck but this movie has no excuse, it had a huge budget and there was almost no thought that was gone into writing a good or even a decent script. The build up, climax and conclusion was all terribly done. The reason I am giving this movie a 4 is because of few of the good fight sequences. I give zero credit to Micheal Bay for this but only to the people that worked on the special effects. I could care less about Shia LaBeouf character in this and Megan Fox was just there to make the male audience drool over, she has become a sex symbol. Micheal Bay literally decided to go Micheal Baywatch with her in this. Some people that liked this movie a lot might say ""turn your brain off while watching this"" and even goes as far as to bash on people that give the right review and make legit negative criticism. After watching this horrendous piece of crap movie it seems those people had a major brain damage before or after watching this flick. This movie is most definitely a pass, but to anyone that really want to check this out, just skip to the robot battle sequences. It don't matter how big of a fan Linkin Park is of of the Transformers, it's sad to hear there music is played for this garbage, not that there new stuff is great or anything like that. The special effects was good and I give props to the team that worked on it, but no credit will go to Micheal Bay for this. The action sequences should be a part of a movie for these type of genre, but for this one that is the only thing that just slightly saves this movie from just getting a 1 for me.4/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Bay did it again, he manage to double the sabotage of our childhood. I am not sentimental, maybe I think that G1 cartoons are the best original series and they have quality. I don' want to rant here, I ranted enough in the review of the first film. What to expect from Bay, explosions, funny camera angles, shallow characters and performances, US military... America f**k yeah... and all of that crap, the entire film looks like every other Bay film, a giant commercial. Bay didn't want to make a stupid toy movie. But, he didn't make a toy film, just a stupid film. Now, this time, autobots are taking care of the remaining scum of decepticons on earth, but they soon found out that Megatron is alive and he wants Sam (It's Spike! Spike!) because Sam, accidentally memorized a code that is of great interests of The Fallen (voiced by great Tony Todd, best known as Candyman), one of the last primes in the universe. Because, by the stories, transformers were earlier on earth and turned humans in their slaves to build pyramids and all that crap, what a dumb cliché story... someone watched AVP too much I think? Nothing to say about Bay, he was in his own element.Actors... well Shia (irritating, but not bad), Megan (hot as always), Tyrese and Duhamel (nothing special, they were there just to show that they will fight side by side with autobots, America f**k yeah!) Kevin Dunn and Julie White (nothing, just a silly comic relief), we have some new characters: Leo Spitz (Sam's roommate from college), he was there also as a comic relief. I don't understand, why using too much comic relief? Isn't one actor enough for that? Isabel Lucas? She was there to be hot... It's incredible how Bay uses actor only because of their looks and type... that's insulting.Robots... well no change here... they looked good outside, but inside... retards without any personality. Optimus was only good. While some important robots like Bumblebee and Megatron are missed and neglected. I am glad that Starscream got a little more screen time, I think that Charles Adler is great as Starscream. We also have some new robots... like Arcee for example, Wheelie and Skids, two impossible, retarded, boring robots... and wanted them dead. Soundwave was there, he was OK, and thanks to Frank Welker, he was even better, we also have Sideswipe and Devastator... Devastator looks very funny, ridiculous to be exact, we could see Devastator's anus, his anus, his anus, his... ANUS! Bay really made fun of these robots, we also had a scene in the first film, where Bumblebee is ""lubricating"" on John Turturro. So, if that is for entertainment purposes, i really don't know... I rest my case.So, that's it, the good old G1 fans are gonna be disappointed, while the new generations are gonna enjoy worse and worse movies of this decade..","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

The movie isn't finished yet, and you can tell; there are some funny awkward jokes strewn around, and there are a few minor narrative holes here and there, but I can see where they're heading, and I LOVE it. The plot is very interesting to explore, including the history of Transformers and the lasting effects of that legacy that transcends time. Also you will not find better action in any other film than in this one; the action is nonstop and visually appealing and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. All in all, my childhood favorite and an actually enjoyable watch.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not strange as in the sense of say, ""Clockwork Orange"", but in the sense that it's a combination of awesome sci-fi epic and total mess. The action, the special effects, the cgi, are without a doubt top notch (more on that in a bit), but something just didn't feel right.....and i can tell you what.This go around, in what will probably become an endless franchise, we get brand new characters.....possibly TOO many new characters. A good 20% of them go nameless. Even one who has a couple of lines and some great battle sequences isn't named until 10 minutes before the end. I jump to the end for a reason; in true Micheal Bay fashion, he has no idea how to end a movie. Everything we see in the forty plus minute final battle is without question unforgettable, but seriously Mr. Bay, please get to the point..... Another main problem is the humor. I feel that since the first movie ended up being funnier than expected, they felt the need to make us laugh, and sadly went mostly juvenile. This isn't to say there are not any laughs, in fact there is a great number of them, but also a large share of groans too. The plot is much darker than the first, so there really wasn't much room for the laughs, and this should have been the series' ""Empire Strikes Back"".I have now brought us to the plot. Seeing as how Transformers in general doesn't need much of a plot to begin with, and the first movie was close to sans plot, this one is much more fleshed out (if you will). However, going into detail of the plot would kill a lot of the story's development. I will say that it's clear the production staff listened to die-hard fans and incorporated all that they could, even involving fan-favorite characters and the much missed ""Matrix of Leadership"".The writing left something to be desired, unfortunately. It almost feels like for the last third of the film that the script was abandoned, or the writers were fired half-way through and the cast and director just made it up as they went along. Again, like i mentioned about the humor, this does NOT mean it is a total bust.By now I'm sure you think I'm saying skip this movie, I am not. I only wanted to get the faults out of the way. Overall, ""Revenge"" will stay in your thoughts for quite some time and will not be forgotten easily. I can't say it's on par with it's predecessor, but is chock-full of so many mind-blowing eye-carnage that it would a waste be a of your time to blink. If The Transformer universe is just not your cup of tea, or your not to caring of amazing FX, skip this movie. However, if you wish to see some of the best action sequences to be rendered in quite some time, while still being entertained, go give this one a look.three out of four --That's my opinion, I'm Chris Peed","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

He is one of the best at what he does. But he has become a posterboy for the right-wing moviegoers. I have a problem with his cinematic integrity. His movies are commercials instead of films. Now, Transformers isn't The Great Gatsby. I know that. But Transformers has no story, no soul and has such a dangerous underlying militaristic tone: it presses all the wrong buttons with me.The movie is aimed at video-gaming 13 to 17 year old boys, with hormones coming out of their ears. Bay sells his movie to these kids with a hot Megan Fox (yes, I agree to that. I am still human), shiny robots and a lot of military showing off. You know, I really don't think the locations in the Middle East and Egypt are coincidence. It conditions young minds that the US can fight battles there. I've read that the DoD wants scripts upfront and can say no to producers when they request hardware for their movies. The producers of movies like Jarhead, Full Metal Jacket etc. got no help. Think they said no to this movie? If the propaganda machine of the DoD thinks it's a good film, what do they think is good about it?Judging it purely on it's cinematic merits: it has a lot of explosions and pretty good action scenes, even though I couldn't tell what was going on half of the time. That whiny kid from Suburbia looks like a 30 year old playing an 18 year old and Turturro's comedic timing leaves a lot to be desired. The comic relief scenes are sometimes awkward and again: the story is really thin.I compare this movie and the message in this movie with the prettiest girl in class: She looks fantastic. You can't take your eyes of her. You love her tanned legs, the way her skirt is barely long enough and when she pouts those lips, you just dream away. Just looking at her brings up almost primordial urges inside you. But when you start listening to her and then really looking at her: you will realize she is not that nice, pretty dumb and really a bit dangerous in the way she changes the behavior of the guys around her.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It is loud, explosive and noisy. Transformers 2, in short, is very entertaining with big robots smashing one another. It is also intense and epic especially at the last battle scene. Michael Bay does what he do best. Big explosions, more bigger explosions and the biggest explosions. Transformers 2 is a non-stop action fun romp where you just have to sit and wait for it to unfold. You do not need to do anything else, like thinking and pointing out goofs.Story: It is almost like the first one where story is just hidden in the amounts of explosions and CGI robots. But in Transformers, why do I care about plots that are intelligent? I am watching it for robots smashing each other. That is one thing a critic is never going to know. If Transformers has a twisted, dark and complex plot and the robots just appearing in a few scenes, it won't be called Transformers. Transformers means fun, explosions and robots. The music is even epic. Explosions are cool. The cast are hot. The director is insane. But one thing I do not like is that it has too much comedy and some lame characters trying to funny.Overall: It is a good summer movie. Take a break from watching the usual genres, and watch something different. What is not fun seeing robots destroying everything in their path? Let see if G.I Joe is as successful as Transformers. Maybe not.","17 out of 40 found this helpful.

James Cameron can do it, George Lucas (I know he didn't direct Empire Strikes Back but he wrote it), and just last year Christopher Nolan proved he could do it too. With Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Armegeddon) proves that he definitely cannot do it.The film is set two years after the first ended, where the US Army and the Autobots have combined to form a unit called NEST. It is NEST's job to hunt down the evil Decepticons left on Earth. It appears that Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons in the original, is actually just a peon and The Fallen, an extremely old robot, is the leader and begins another assault on our world. Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) meanwhile leaves his family and his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind to attend Princeton University, which appears to have become populated with the hottest girls on the planet and is now an insane party school. Sam once again becomes hunted by the Decepticons because he holds the key to their past in his brain, and he teams up with NEST to destroy them.The first scene is by far the best part of the movie, which isn't saying much. NEST tears through Shanghai as they hunt Decepticons, which leads to some spectacular robot fights and shows off the new and improved Autobots. Like the first movie, these robots have pretty creative designs, especially a trio of motorcycles. Finding any other positives in this trash heap is a chore. There is a good fight scene in a forest, and the girls in the movie are definitely easy to look at. especially Fox, but that's about it. Let me remind you this is a two and a half hour movie, so it becomes real boring real quick.The writing, plot, and characters are so bad it makes the movie near unwatchable. This time around it is absolutely impossible to make any connections with the leading characters, whether they are human or robots. The plot is even worse. It is so random, full of plot holes, and boring that most of the audience had no clue what was going on, they were just hoping there would be a robot fight soon, and there wasn't. The climactic battle is a big joke. The humor is nothing more than surprisingly graphic jokes, like a college professor hitting on the girls in his lecture like its no big deal, or some stereotypical black robots complete with gangly ears and gold crooked teeth.Even if you loved the first movie, it would be hard to like this one. Megatron, who was the biggest baddest robot that destroyed everyone else in a fight, gets turned into nothing more than a sissy little henchmen, which will leave many fans disappointed. The diversity of the robots in the first one is completely gone, and by the end of the movie the Decepticons are nothing more that generic silver robots with a gun.Overall, this film takes an extreme fortitude to be able to get through. It is like a boring class lecture, where minutes seem to take hours to pass. It absolutely fails to grab the audiences attention and hook them into the characters, making it impossible to focus on the confusing plot. If Bay took two steps forward after making the first Transformers, and he took 100 steps back with this sequel.3/10","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Those who previewed this film as awful or close to it actually have sense whilst those who loved it...well that's your choice.Micheal Bay as it goes for an incompetent director has to be one of the worst. Despite the overwhelming evidence from fans of the first film, action fans or just anyone else who happened too see this on this website that this sequel is utterly crap and that it was a flop with film critics. Bay says he dosen't care what anyone else thinks.This attitude he has displayed reveals everything about his character and the way this film has been portrayed.This sequel has made millions and has become one of the summer's biggest hits but it shouldn't be.The first one was brilliant with a clear story, decent enough acting with character development and a chance to see what was happening on screen. One big problem being the first of many is that target market the demographics are aiming is contradictory.For example Bay has claimed this is a family film, yet it's full of sexual innuendo like a small bot humping Megan Foxes leg, a female in disguise as a Decepticon if that is the right name has a tail come out of her arse and Fox herself with her boobs swaying as she runs.And this is meant to be for teenagers? Frankly it's degrading, insulting in particular for women and downright shallow, which brings me to this film's second cock up no character development.The script is a sham Megan Fox has nothing to say or do apart from running away from pointless explosions except to be a piece of eye candy. Whilst Shia LaBeouf who made the most of his part and whose acting was solid enough was stuck between a rock and a hard place. There was no chemistry between him and Fox. The idea when he says he loves her was nauseating. Meanwhile all the other characters like Sam Witwicky's parent's and the auto-bots including two sidekicks were there to provide comic relief unfortunately all they gave me was one massive headache and feelings total frustration with old, recycled and lame jokes.And don't even get me started with the camera-work, all over the place. Action sequences are meant to be entertaining but it's impossible to enjoy if you can't see what's going on, bots stomping about and explosions not knowing what bot was on whose side as I just didn't care.The editing is atrocious of where Fox arrives in Egypt likes she's in Paris one moment and bang she's now in Egypt as were several other parts which I can't be bothered to go into.The plot though thin in itself and very simple just dragged on forever making this two and a half hours, it was barely tolerable after the first hour.In th end Bay comes off to me as an arrogant man who just loves to make money. He shouldn't be allowed to make movies and I was astounded to learn that Steven Spielburg even took part in this film! Bay must have drugged him.In the end I just came out extremely disappointed and frustrated with one big headache. Now wheres the paracetamol?","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

I know I'm buying a copy of this excellent movie on blu-ray whenever it hits stores. Also, if you guys happen to have a copy of the first movie on blu-ray, then check out the bd-live section for new special features.Otherwise, go see this movie, and don't bring your kids, it has swear words and sexual jokes in it, which are very funny by the way.

It had everything a summer blockbuster should: great action, great visuals, just a fun time at the theater. And yes, I can understand why some people hate it, but just as a film itself, I thought it was an amazing picture. So I was pretty excited when they announced that there would be another Transformers film. However, when the reviews started coming out, I felt a little discouraged. Then the film made so much money and I thought ""Maybe this won't be so bad."" Unfortunately, it was great either.There is a lot to love about Revenge of the Fallen. The action scenes are better, the visual effects are more stunning than they were in the last film (which surprised me, seeing as the visuals in Transformers was some of the best visual effects in history). The scenes between Sam's mom and dad made me laugh like crazy in the theater. Linkin Park's song New Divide is a really great song, though many will disagree. We have two really hot women, Megan Fox as Mikeala and Austrailian hottie Isabel Lucas as Terminator babe! (I gotta get me one of those). The things I loved about the first film were better.But there was also a lot to hate about Revenge of the Fallen sadly.Okay, for one thing the film is two and a half hours too long. I literally almost fell asleep in the theater. They should have cut it down and gotten rid of some things we didn't need to see. And even the last battle took a while to wake me up.As well, there are two characters named Skids and Mudflap, and they are one of the most stereotypical, annoying characters I've ever seen on screen. They both sounded like autobots being voiced by the Wayan Bros. And the character of Weelie, which is basically a Joe Pesci robot, is just as bad. He is loud, obnoxious, and just a pointless character.I'm fine with humor, and the humor in the first film was great and wasn't done throughout the film. In this film, pretty much every word of dialogue is followed by a punch line and some pretty awful ones at times. Dogs humping each others? WTF? The devastator has testicles? Come on.Megan Fox is a beautiful thing. She has been crowned Earth's finest woman, and I agree she is. But she also does a terrible job in this movie. I'm not saying she's one of the worst actresses on the planet, and I'm not judging her based on the films she's been in. She was actually fine in the first film (even though I spent more time looking at her than listening to her words). But in this film she's not great at all.There's this character, Leo, who is Sam's roommate. And he serves no purpose to the story, does nothing but yell and scream.The first hour of this film is the best part, but the rest of the film gets weaker and weaker and weaker, and unfortunately I can't say I liked it. I didn't hate it, but I can't say I liked it. It's sad, because I loved the first film so much.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

What these people don't seem to understand is this is TRANSFORMERS, not a movie about some sort of serious political issue from our past.Transformers: RoTF is a movie bent on showing the combat and rivalry between the Decepticons and the Autobots - it isn't intended to have some complex plot and story line. The robots are truly the stars of the movie as they are the premise of the film and they are the reason it exists in the first place. The (human) characters lack some pizazz, of course, because this movie isn't about them.Personally, I cheered, laughed, and loved the f*ck out of this movie. Yes, I did. Do I feel like it was some sort of brilliant piece of cinema? Of course not, because it wasn't intended to be this years Slumdog Millionaire. This movie delivered exactly what 99.9% of the movie-goers and fans of the Transformers expected - unadulterated robot destruction, crude humor, and of course, a scantily-clad Megan Fox.There are racist stereotypes in most movies this day, any one who takes them seriously needs to realize this is a movie - oh my god they called a woman a 'b*tch' - I'm a woman and I wasn't offended by that at all. As for the 'Twins' racist stereotype, all of the African-Americans I saw in the theater were laughing along with the rest of us.In conclusion, this movie was an amazing piece of just pure action and I felt like a 5 year-old kid as I skipped out of that theatre with a grin on my face.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

However, the loud and wild approach goes too far, to the point of being dumb and banal.The action scenes are anything a fan of the Transformer comics could ever ask for. The characters look real, and seem to actually interact with their environment. The CGI animations are interesting to look at, and the robot duels are choreographed with fervor.However, the violence and destruction are not backed up by any useful plot. Instead, there are monotonous ""human interest"" subplots that fall completely flat. There's a yawner premise about the guy from the first movie going to college, and trying to distance himself ""from his destiny."" The whole bit about inserting the hero's parents, and how they're always making retard comments is dull. The hero himself acting emo like that guy in Close Encounters; what's up with that? Then he makes weird faces and throws a fit in a science class. In fact, there's always somebody making lame comments that I guess are supposed to be amusing. Right in the middle of battle scenes where people are dying. There's a stereotype soldier, making the usual Eddie Murphy babblings, and (so original:) all army officers are depicted as clods. The actress doing the sultry femme-fatale Decepticon spy needs acting lessons, to put it mildly. As for the villain's desire for revenge; poorly contrived. In short, a mess.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

In a year where summer blockbusters can be a refreshing change of pace like STAR TREK, I may be expecting something more in TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN other than, well, more. More explosions, more action, more Autobots (and Decepticons), bustier babes, louder music. All that and possibly (sigh!) more are in this much-anticipated, most attended new sequel. But in a way, all this can't mask that the movie lacks the same bite of its predecessor. I enjoyed the original TRANSFORMERS for two things: First and most obviously, it absolutely rocked! Second, it gave me the thrill of being wrong. I initially suspected TRANSFORMERS to be a big and obnoxious CGI-fest with everything bad about Michael Bay in a nutshell. Obviously, it wasn't all bad. But unfortunately, I didn't feel that my entire initial impression on this sequel were wrong.Perhaps I'm expecting too much. TRANSFORMERS 2 wasn't exactly made to have a strong story, convincing characters and even the slightest moments of subtlety. It's about explosions, action, special effects that outdo God and, of course, Bay's promise that it would be bigger and better than its successful predecessor. Well, to put it honestly, TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is merely bigger and louder than its predecessor, but it lacks the amount of effective wit of its predecessor. The original is loaded with action, but it also had a lot of laughs a long the way, as well as a likable charm that touched our inner child. This new movie had the action, and it did have humor, but they feel more like Bay's kind of humor. I'm pretty sure he's laughing every time he gives us as scene where dogs are continuously humping each other (and later, a robot humping the Megan Fox' leg!). I, on the other hand, feel like he was pulling my leg. Not contended with that, he also throws in not one, but two jive-talking robots! One street-talking Jazz in the original I can handle, but two transformers (both voiced by Tom Kenny) talking in jive is one time too many. Thankfully, there are more effective jokes halfway around the movie, when John Turturro's (former) Agent Simmons reappears (sharing some noisy but admittedly hilarious banter with Ramon Rodriguez).Almost all the characters (robot or human) reappear in this one, but sadly they don't come up with the same amount of charm they did in the original. Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam, and he's still in his usual quirky self, but Bay eventually abandons do develop him further once he plummets him to the action-laden story. His love story with Megan Fox (never appearing in the film without wearing really short shorts and shoulder-less shirts) doesn't exactly light up some city blocks, no matter how hot Bay wants it to be. And, a similar complaint in the original, the movie is just one hour too long (and if my information serves me right, even longer than the original!). Long movies are nothing to me, but what to fill in those hours is something to point out. The original TRANSFORMERS is too long, to be sure, but some of the excess hours are spent right. In this sequel, Bay just couldn't resist how neat his fight sequences are, so he merely repeats them, only bigger the second or third time around, again and again, until he wraps it up with the biggest he can pull off. The film could have been easily be trimmed for better effect.Still, although I had a lot of nitpicking to do, it is what it is. Loaded with special effects and non-stop (whether I like it or not) action, TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN did make a lot in the box-office (which might guarantee another sequel sometime in the future). Suffice to say, if you liked the first, this will be your cup of tea. Rating: ** out of 5.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

""Transformers 2"" is only half way over; you won't need it anyway.""Revenge of the Fallen"" is huge, loud, and meaningless. After an entirely overlong and comparatively jokey first act, the endless string of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot level fight sequences will beat your consciousness within an inch of its tolerance. Your eyes will glaze over, unfocus. Is director Michael Bay an artist, a con artist, or a hypnotist? Is there some deeper creative implication behind the trivialization of human (and I guess robot) worth? It's unclear how many people die in the film, but there is a clear lack of sympathy, or even fetishistic pathos to the destruction. What transpires enters and leaves the frame leaving no impression on its viewer whatsoever.The film is in turns harmlessly dumb summer action fare, and more troublingly numbing and nonsensical. It's an impenetrable spectacle, a two and a half hour kaleidoscope shifting every permutation of guns, metal, and girls. Bay is a hypnotist, but not akin to, say, Godfrey Reggio, the director of the non-narrative documentary ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" but rather a figure unparalleled in film-making for his ability to induce a disconnected vegetative state amidst flying iron fist fights, interplanetary espionage, and rippling firestorms.The film feels in many ways as though it takes place during one continuous explosion. There are maybe fifteen minutes of hard plot that get stretched, slow-moed, doubled back, and reiterated over the course of the film, and still come out making something less than sense because our protagonists, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) are being hurried from set piece to set piece faster than the speed of logic.Worst of all, ""Transformers"" is not only desensitizing, but is a dangerous template for future ""family"" action films. The colorful characters and the innocent source material make it seem a safe bet for little Joey, but the film earns its PG-13 rating and then some. There's an unspoken sexual frustration behind the joke writing, explicitly of the most juvenile variety, which I suppose, when examined, fits well with the overall aesthetic, given that the film is little more than a 200 million dollar realization of a thirteen year old's classroom doodles.There's nothing remotely resembling substance in the picture, and the mind-meltingly repetitive action choreography coupled with the ludicrous running time (its biggest fault) prevent the film from passing even as pure fluff.But ultimately, these criticisms can be applied generally to the modern blockbuster, and perhaps it's somewhat unfair that ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" happens to be the vehicle to weather the brunt of them. It's just as intellectually flaccid as last month's ""Terminator Salvation,"" but if the box office numbers are any indication, it has much broader commercial appeal. It's an easy punching bag because it exemplifies so many of problems with films of its kind, and after a retrospectively decent first installment, there's no justification for how stupid and stupefying the film is.So when the credits finally roll and you pinch your temples as you stand up to leave, just be sure not to slip on your brain on the way out.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The problem with RotF, besides many unnecessary and often crude jokes that weren't even funny, mostly has to do with the pacing of the story. I guess there was a story in there, but trying to find one amongst the slow motion explosions and clanking metal is like trying to find a piece of hay in a stack of needles.The pacing was so off it was nauseating trying to keep up with anything. The battles, which I will add were pretty intense, just seemed to happen all at once with little or no build-up, and were further marred by multiple camera changes which added to the nausea factor. Half of the time, I couldn't tell what was going or who was fighting who.And then there was this love story the writers shoe horned in to try and make us care for the characters, but that only hurt the pacing more. Coupled with the sub-par acting from the cast and even worse dialogue, I couldn't find myself giving two shits about anyone. I was half hoping the Decepticons would have won and end this sorry mess of a movie.I really won't go into how a couple of stereotype based characters were really annoying and bogged the movie down even more than it already was, and how just about any female character in this thing were really just brought in as eye candy in an attempt to distract us from this train wreck of a movie. Seriously, I like T&A as much as the next guy, but geez, dude. This is ridiculous.Also, seriously, did we really need not one, but two, instances of dog humping? I could have gone without them completely. They added absolutely nothing to the movie. And neither did the (unfunny) joke about Transformer testicles. Sometimes I really have to wonder about you, Mr. Bay.Although there are a couple of bright spots to be found within this mess. The visual effects, for one, were really well done. Every time I saw Optimus Prime transform I was like ""Cool!"". Soundwave being in this one was really good, too, although I really wish he was in the first movie (which I actually somewhat kinda enjoyed). But cool visual effects, Optimus Prime transforming, and Soundwave just weren't enough to save this one.I will say with the utmost of honesty that I tried to enjoy this one. Really, I did. But there was just too much going on that I couldn't get into the movie.Thumbs down.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The humor in these crap flicks are aimed at 12 year olds who like jokes that rappers make with cuss words just randomly thrown in.

Nothing wrong with big explosions and robots beating the crap out of each other, I still get a kick out of that, but I'm twenty five now-a-days and I like to see a good story with interesting characters and a good script to boot it all up now too. This movie lacks that. It's a shame too because the first movie was pretty good. Sure, I didn't like the fact that the original transformation sound was only used once and was absent from that point out in both movies, and also that you can't really see what kind of vehicle a transformer is after he is transformed with the millions of parts shifting in all directions during transformation. But overall it was a good movie in itself. The acting was fine, the build up was exciting and the storyline was good too. Revenge of the Fallen on the other hand does the the complete opposite. The first part of the movie consist mostly of bad acting between people with an even worse script and the second half of the movie is action packed with metal flying everywhere. Nothing wrong with that last part, like I said before, but it's not really that versatile. In many occasions it was just a little to much. It really seemed it was more important to make the explosions even bigger just like the robots and put in more chaos than put time in a good storyline, better characters and a good script. But hey, it's Michael Bay so you shouldn't be that surprised.

It's the definition of a Friday night movie: lots of action and adventure, but a plot that can only be examined on a microscopic level.There is just so much about this film that's all over the place, it's as if the script is relaxing through half the movie, wakes up for every five minutes and then falls right back asleep. To say the dialogue goes a mile a minute would imply that there's something that actually needs to be heard.The cinematography isn't bad in some of the more foreign locations, but they do take a backseat to things like CGI. On that note, the visual effects remain just as impressive as its predecessor but because of the large number of characters in the film, they have more usage.Unfortunately, the number of characters turns out to be another flaw for this film. There had to be, AT MINIMUM, 30 different robots with more than half of them having zero relevance to the plot and zip personality. The only significance they seem to provide is a certain craving in the audience to drive the latest sports car. Shia Labeuf's performance Sam Witwiky has only lightly progressed compared to the first film and has little character development. Megan Fox's character Mikaela seems to suffer a similar fate, with very little to do but be pulled behind Sam like a trailer hitched on to pickup truck. Though they are tolerable compared to such stomach-twisting racial stereotypes as Mudflap & Skids.If the Fallen wanted to take his revenge out on cinema, he has certainly left its image in ruins.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Instead of building upon previously established plot threads, Transformers 2 decides to throw everything out and plonk in a whole new mess of plot threads. The whole backstory about thew ""Primes"" coming to earth eons ago seemed like it was just conveniently inserted into the plot as there was no mention of this particular story thread in the previous movie. The motivations for Megatron have also changed, from chasing the allspark to earth in order to seize its power in the first film to coming to earth to find his ""Master"" whom we are introduced to as ""the fallen"", an ancient decepticon that came to earth a long time ago. Already, inconsistencies with the first film and plot holes the size of Saturn's moons abound. Next we have the characters. Instead of developing the already underdeveloped robot cast from the first movie, Hasbro decides to include even more robots. Some of them are not even named in the movie and just end up becoming cannon fodder at the end of the day. The already decently developed character of Bumblebee gets sidelined after a rather embarrassing bout of crying with the plot thread of Sam and Bumblebee's strained friendship left undeveloped. Optimus Prime himself takes a dive down from being a level headed and compassionate tactical commander to being an impulsive and brash bully with a bad attitude. He ""talks down"" to humans now instead of treating them as equals, he rushes headlong into a battle without as much as a tactical analysis and he needlessly puts his own team in danger more than once with his impulsiveness. The Fallen, the seemingly new and more menacing villain, comes across as having more bark and no bite; being able to ""use the force"" and throw things around with his mind or something but barely holding his own in actual hand to hand combat. The humans don't fare any better either. Whatever witty humour there was in the first movie got replaced with terrible, and even offensive sexual jokes. Done in moderation, sexual jokes are fine. But Transformers 2 takes the innuendo to new heights of unnecessary offensiveness. I highlight ""unnecessary"" as many of the jokes could have been replaced with better ones or done away with no effect to the story. It is just so counter productive to have so many sexual jokes in a film made for all ages. It offends the kids and the parents. Heck even me as a teenager felt offended by those jokes. The acting takes a turn for the worse. At times it gets so over the top that the characters some across as caricatures of their former selves, especially John Turturro's character, Agent Simmons. On the other hand, the voice acting from the robot characters keeps more true to its cartoon roots than the first film with more time devoted to dialogue interplay between the autobots or decepticons. The acting of the human characters is only thing that takes a turn for the worse. The CGI is highly inconsistent in this movie. You got great scenes, very nicely rendered and animated, mostly in the first half of the movie. But once the movie moves to Egypt and toward its climax, the level of detail and fluidity in the CGI robots starts to dip. Its lowest point is at the final battle between Prime and The Fallen which looks like an X-box game cutscene with lighting and texturing on the robots that look really out of place among the physical background.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a wild, unrestrained misguided practice in EXCESS. Everything is just so overblown, from the action, to the acting, to the budget. Even the media coverage and publicity was overblown and it resulted in Transformers 2 NOT living up to the hype.If anything, Transformers 2 feels like a extra long running toy commercial. All that matters is CGI graphics, action, explosions and new robots. Story, characters and what not apparently do not matter anymore. The sadder thing is that so many people LOVE this kind of shallow and excessive shows that it would just encourage movie producers to make more. This is an pretty but offensively silly excuse for a film; Big and brainless.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

After the first Transformers (which I've watched75+ times) I waited in huge anticipation of this movie. I ended up severely heart broken. I am pretty sure that the camera was stuck in zoom for the first part of filming the movie. Most of the shots were so tight and so close up, it made me want to scream! I felt like I was missing most of what was happening. But my biggest issue was the grade school locker room jokes and the language. The first Transformers made me want to applaud because they kept it so clean and safe for all 3 of my kids to watch (3 yrs, 7 yrs & 10 yrs). There was a little bit of dirt..but not much. Revenge of the Fallen is chock full of very crude and unnecessary sexual jokes. And then there's the language! I am pretty sure that it averaged a swear word every 20-30 seconds in most parts. I am by no means a prudish parent. But I do believe in reducing their exposure to unneeded vulgarity. I left this movie feeling like it was written, directed and produced by a boy just discovering his sex organs and his ability to swear for the first time. AKA..an 8th grader. I was so disappointed and my kids will be even more disappointed when I tell them they won't be allowed to see it. So much potential and such a huge waste. :-(","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I haven't seen the 1st Transformers movie but this was really good. Great effects, intense fighting scenes and Megan Fox. Megan Fox is well fit, she's probably one of the most sexiest actresses I've ever seen. The one bad this about the film is that the plot is unclear. Apart from that, well done Michael Bay for making this good piece of work. If there is a 3rd Transformers movie coming into cinemas and I sure hope there is, I'm going definitely going to watch it. Many people who have seen the 1st Transformers say that this is not as good but I haven't seen the n1st one and yet I think this is really good.8/10","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

The graphics look stylish and extremely cool especially in the fight sequences while the story lacks at everything the first one did right. The acting from Megan Fox, especially, was stupid and idiotic because she thinks that she doesn't have to try so she lets her body do the work and believe me when I say her body fails. I don't put all the blame on her but the script writers as well because it is all clichéd and it has heavily borrowed from fellow action movies. The character development was over the top and that is really sad because it left out some important things. The movie is somewhat predictable at times and the outcome is so predictable that you can become an oracle. Shia Labeouf was pretty okay along with Tyrese and Duhamel but the rest could suck my balls. The movie is melodramatic and it will have you laugh out loud. The humor is okay and some new faces pop up, for instance, The twins, a funny pair of twins who kick butt and laugh, and a fresh new little robot pops up as well and that is Wheelie, a little monster truck with a wacky attitude and a mouth full of swears. The movie can not demolish the first one because the first one was a interesting summer hit while this one is overrated piece of garbage. The film was pretty bad but it did enormously good at the box-office and Michael Bay should make a third transformers. The villains make a good impression in this film as they kick-a*s and get their ass*s kicked back.Sam WitWicky is living a perfectly normal life along with his girlfriend and his favorite car, BumbleBee. All that goes to waste as the baddies leader, The Fallen, awakens Megatron and unleashed hell on earth. The story unfolds and gets interesting but due to the lack of good storytelling it fails almost completely. The Fallen is going to use a device called the Sun Harvester, a source of energy for the energon by destroying the sun, and it is up to Sam and his Autobot gang to stop this mayhem once and for all. New friendships will be formed and a lot of old faces will be shown once again as the Autobots unleash the fury.The voice cast for the robots is well-done and the voices of Wheelie, Optimus Prime, The Twins, and Acree ar the best because they offer seriousness and humor combined. This film will appeal to almost every kid but the adults will be saying ""WTF is this movie"". (Spoiler!!)The story is stupid and lame because it uses pyramid as the location of the Sun Harvester and it just is effed up. The film is over-long and a lot of scenes were unnecessary, so my warning to you is don't get over excited and prepare for some brainless action flick. the film is as boring, maybe more, as G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra and they both had a sh*tty story and lots of action. I recommend this to anyone who loves the animated series of Transformers and are car lovers for it sure contains tons of that.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Ofcourse the original from 2007 is still rock solid and terrific, but this sequel is the WORST and most BORING and MINDNUMBING of the entire franchise.Somehow I think the first 3 Transformer movies are (quite) a bit silly and childish. Perhaps these first 3 movies are better suited for a younger audience, while (on the contrary) the last 2 editions are perhaps better suited for grownups because there is more serious (and better) acting.The bad; Shia LaBeouf. I liked this actor in the original first Transformer movie, but in this edition his acting isnt convincing me, on the contrary his acting is often annoying me. The supporting actors are way below mediocre as well. Bummer.The good: it's entertainment and it's big! And loud. And fast. It's everything director Michael Bay and Hollywood are good at.

Judy is just annoying, Leo is worse. Then there are the twins added for comic relief but they're just idiotic and not funny. They also bring in Jetfire but he's now a geriatric who's lost his marbles, again probably to serve comic relief.It also annoys me that Bay's Starscream is a sniveling, grovelling coward instead of a sneaky back-stabber out to usurp Megatron. Then there's Soundwave, voiced by the great Frank Welker, but doesn't sound anything like Soundwave and just sounds terrible.Then there's the Constructacons, who could have been fleshed out, but instead they're just soulless beings who combine to make a soulless Devastator (and why do we need to see his testicles?).If they made this a more serious movie with a sprinkling of humour, this could have been great.

This is THE greatest movie I have ever seen, I'm not afraid to say it, I have never been so amazed and in awe while at the cinema, it simply blew me away.The story is far better paced and less complicated than the first. One of the things that bugged me was that there were too many human elements and subplots screwing with the action, this time its more robots, more action and just an overall 100% improvement. The other main gripe I had with the first film was that you just didn't see enough of Optimus Prime, THE greatest Transformer of all time. He just wasn't on screen enough for me. Thank god Bay listened to the people and gave all the autobots far more screen time.Anyway, to get to the point, you've never seen a blockbuster like this before, its sooo much fun and there is soo much excitement that I just could not control my emotions! I never thought I'd live to see a film like this, when I sat there as a 6 year old watching the original cartoon movie I could never have imagined that a film based on Transformers could be this amazing, this entertaining.This is the greatest summer blockbuster you will ever see.And I just learned that the film only opened in the UK and Japan?

Nope, not to be. He keeps having dreams, and vivid, mysterious, dreams that feature mysterious writings? Just like with the first outing of this franchise, the story drags the young couple into a battle between the ""Autobots"" and their foes, the ""Decepticons"" only this time the rehash of the hidden power-cube story tries to immerse itself in ancient Egyptian mythology as a means of making the never ending assemble/disassemble/reassemble fight scenes emerge as something less repetitive and, frankly, dull. There isn't really a script to speak of, and at 2½ hours this really does feel like you could have actually built one of the pyramids in the time it takes to come to what is the inevitable tee for another sequel. John Turturro steals his scenes as the ultra-hammy agent ""Simmons"" and we have Josh Duhamel as the eye-candy in an uniform but as with the first film, Fox is as wooden as a skateboard. Although there is pretty much non-stop action throughout, I still couldn't tell who is fighting with whom nor is ""Bumblebee"" getting any better at the close protection game.

This one is not the case at all. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the kind of sequel that just wants to be like Terminator instead rather than to actually be legitimately creative. Honestly, I wouldn't call this the worst of the franchise with some effort on the visuals in terms of the designs on Autobots and Decepticons. But that won't be enough to make up for its painful writing that has given a massive downgrade with a boring plot, obnoxious human characters, bad directing, awful comedy, and nonexistent action. If I have to recommend this movie, it'll probably those that love the first film. Otherwise, even if you're a super Transformers fan, there are better options than having to watch the sequel like the shows or even Bumblebee (since that movie is actually more enjoyable). Michael Bay's Transformers was fine the first time. But by watching the movie, this is a valid argument how low the franchise is gonna be from here. I know my rating does make me sound a little generous to this movie.

I saw the film in the cinema a couple of days ago and came out feeling great. The film has flaws, that seem like they could have easily fixed but it didn't detract from the fun. Another thing I have been reading in the reviews is people calling the film boring, the film was far from boring. I hope the people in the general public are able to see that these so called ''critics'' are just full of **** and nit pick at every tiny detail and don't get to enjoy the movie for what it is. One last thing I think I should mention the CGI in this film was so good.And come on who saw the ending of that film coming? I certainly didn't I was like there is only like 4 minutes left how are they going to end this film but they do in a way that made me go ''really?''

But this surpassed even my expectation and created a new low.Directing and story telling give you a feel that whoever was doing it was constantly on cocaine, and wanted more speed, explosion, kill, shoot, die, boom, more, more, more. Story is non-existing, it's just there to give the good guys reason to shoot at the bad guys. The characters are SCREAMING their lines for about 75% of the time. Acting is terrible, of course. Autobots speak jive (''yo, yo, wazzup, byatch?!?!''), Turturro shows his old-mans-ass, Megan Fox never closes her mouth throughout the film, robots fart (which is supposed to be funny, but it's not), Megatron is a comedy sidekick, Egyptians are dumb clichés, soldiers are firing with machine guns and pistols at GIANT ROBOTS, good guys can teleport themselves around the world but can't teleport the bad guy onto the surface of the sun or in a volcano or whatever, and so on...Avoid at all cost.

When I was a kid watching Transformers the Autobots were personal...not just some special effect only for viewing. As kids we loved Prime and Bumble Bee. We thought Starscream was a little punk that was funny when he got beat down at the end of almost every episode. We loved seeing new transformers. This movie made me see the personality of the Autobots. Other than ONE time Megan Fox was not made the center of attention for sexuality...that part being when she was leaned over on the motorcycle. Myself and the audience laughed our butts off at their jokes. The plot was the Deceptacons trying to get Energon...that's back to basics. The Transformers battles was better than Part One. Not just a bunch of metal monsters crashing into each other...they actually fought this time. So you have your action...your humor...basic Transformer plot line....Megan Fox...and a few of those emotional tear jerkers. I may not know who the director is nor do I really care. The movies is Definitely worth seeing and for the FIRST time in a long time I was FAR from disappointed at the end. My opinion is this is a must see for any TRUE Transformer fan and even for the newbies. But when it comes down to it...it's up to you.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

It plays out like a montage of previous movies in its vain, disposing of the parts which slowed those movies down, you know, boring things like dialog, character development and plot. What we're left with is thrown together array of action sequences where the talky bits in between simply act as segways.Despite this however, what little character and plot development there is is rather contrived and trite. You are simply waiting for it to be over so you can get back to watching over-sized robots smashing the nine levels of hell out of each other. The attempts at comedy come off as forced and generic, which left me laughing more at how bad the jokes were rather than the jokes themselves. Come on, do we really need the stereotypical comedy-relief duo that speak entirely in Ebonics? All I have to say about LaBeouf is that he's as annoying as ever, the nerdy socially awkward sch-tick is starting to run thin, so unless he starts taking parts in proper movies rather than glorified SFX demo's I'll be avoiding his movies like a case of swine flu. Megan Fox is as pointless as she was in the first movie. Her role consists of standing around and pouting a lot, giving the filmmakers the opportunity to get some, ehm, ""intersting"" shots, but the few attempts she makes at actual acting comes of as laughable. John Turturro returns to spout yet more unfunny dialog, as do the Witwicky parents, but the less said about them, the better. There's also some Mexican kid who cries a lot, and ehm, some other guys who, talk and shoot and stuff...I think.I have a hard time remembering anything about this movie except for explosions and the sound of grinding metal. So while this movie may only do action, it does it very well, everything else that constitutes a movie in the traditional sense? Forget it.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

What I was hoping would be the movie of the summer ended up being one of the worst I've seen so far this year. Michael Bay is a beast of a director, don't get me wrong, but I have lost some respect for him after seeing TF2 (Please lets spin around Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox ONE MORE TIME!!!). The first Transformers actually showed that Michael Bay can make a damn good movie, it had the perfect combination of live action and CGI. While filming the sequel he must have forgotten that movies are made with a camera, not a computer as the special effects, while stunning, are overcrowded and overdone.When the movie began I thought it would be much like the first in its style and greatness, but that ended very quickly. After suffering through about an hour of non-stop tasteless jokes, the action really started going, and going, and going. There were so many robots and subplots being thrown around that it was hard to keep track of who was who and what they were doing. I had a better time watching the fallen asleep surrounding me in the theater than I did watching the fallen in the movie.The worst part about it is that this movie is going to do well, simply because the original was so amazing, and everyone is hoping to see something as good. But the only thing that is as good as it was in the first is Megan Fox... hot damn.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Well, for one the first movie was well the first movie. I had not seen the Transformers on the big screen and not even bigger action scenes can make up for the freshness of the first one when also the story and some parts of the movie were not all that great. The story goes here and there and near the end when I knew the final showdown was looming the movie kept adding stupid dialog scenes such as Shia and his gal talking and trying to figure stuff out. Two of the new Autobot's were so annoying that I cheered when one appeared to be eaten and then there is Soundwave, I can roll with him being a satellite, but why did he have Dr. Claw's voice from Inspector Gadget rather than the voice he had on the cartoon that would have been rather easily duplicated as all you need is a voice modulator of some kind. Still, there were some humorous scenes once again involving Sam's parents and the action scenes were very great I loved all the major confrontations involving Optimus Prime that is for sure, Bumblebee too gets to kick some major booty as well. The story could use work, it is not quite as hard to follow as some claim, but it is overly complicated in areas. Basically, for the most part the movie revolves around what appears to be the Decepticons true leader known as the Fallen and his desire to use a device that would be very bad for us on Earth. So be prepared to be a little annoyed as the twins will talk, Sam's new roomie will annoy as well, and look forward to a runtime of over 2 hours and twenty minutes twenty minutes of which could have easily been cut, but with all the bad comes a lot of good too. Loads of very cool battles involving the Autobots and Decepticons, and let's face it that is the reason you want to see a Transformer's movie.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

The plot was predictable at nearly every turn. The subplots made you say ""Please, God, let's just move on."" The fight scenes were utterly spectacular... for the first 10 minutes; after that, CGI robots beating the snot out of each other and the US Army special forces (also usually computer-generated), just got old. It was far too much like the third Pirates of the Caribbean Movie: extended battle scenes which do nothing but say ""look what our animators can do!"", too many people trying to be funny (with astoundingly cheap laughs that I would have expected out of a Jack Black movie, not a Michael Bay film), and a plot so convoluted, that even if you do get it, you really don't give a crap. On the plus side, Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas are their usual hot, astoundingly slutty, parts, and the jokes in the movie, which I found incredibly cheap (getting hit in the testicles, an embarrassing parent under the influence, etc.) seemed to make several people in the audience laugh. The fight scenes were indeed amazing, but they just seemed to drag on after a while. Overall, an utterly mediocre movie. If decent acting, good special effects (a LOT of them), a convoluted plot, sappy and predictable subplots, cheap laughs, and Megan Fox almost showing her breasts 1,000 times is your type of movie, I strongly recommend this second Transformers movie. Personally, however, I believe you would be better off renting the Three Stooges (in terms of humor), a Die Hard movie (for pure action), and a cheap porno (for most of the female actresses in this film).","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Giant robots fighting.Lots and lots and lots of robots. Giant ones. Fighting. Constantly.If that's what you want, that's what you get, and you'll leave happy.Beyond that, the movie walks a weird line between quality and crap.The fights are frequently stunning and exhilarating, especially at an iMax. On the other hand, the confusing robo-thrashing shots remain, and calling the climactic action scene ""overdone"" is a cosmic understatement.The human characters are much more likable than they were in T1, and the time we spend with them is more entertaining. Shia and Megan can both actually act. Well! I'd even go so far as to call Shia excellent. Sadly, the ill-conceived ghettobots deeply damage the film's credibility with their shameful, unfunny Jar-Jaring.The plot is simple and focused on driving the action from one fight to the next. To me this is enormously preferable to the endless, pointless politicking of the first film. On the other hand, it's still really silly stuff, and the plot holes are so frequent and enormous that you basically just start ignoring them.So ultimately, Transformers 2 is a success of comparability. It's better than the first. It's better than your average blockbuster. It's smarter than you might expect but dumber than you might want.But remember: it's a movie about warring robots! And it does that better than any other movie I can think of.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The second half left me confused, many scenes are fumbled around and edited badly and slightly reminded me of ""Dune"" (what the hell was going on). And why were LaBeouf and Fox always holding hands, WHY!

"3","/10","""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a solid sequel. Inferior in terms of story and acting, but vastly superior in terms of action. Worth seeing on the big screen...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2085782/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2009","Director Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" was a summer-surprise in 2007, and certainly left me in awe. It had everything you could want in a special-effects-spectacle and was definitely more than what meets the eye- it head a big heart at its core.Now, in 2009, a year that has seen some great hits, and some only-decent hits, we get the follow-up, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" And while this is technically the second ""Transformers"" film, they could have just called it ""Transformers 1.5"", because for the most part, it really just feels like more of the same. But that isn't a bad thing necessarily.At the start of the film, we learn that Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the rest of the Autobots (""good-guy Transformers"") have joined forces with the US government- their goal: to hunt down the remaining Decepticons (""bad-guy Transformers"") who are threatening the human populous.At the same time, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is heading off to college, but chooses to leave his Autobot companion Bumblebee behind, much to his disappointment. He is also setting up a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox, sexy, 'nuff said). However, while packing, he finds a tiny fragment of the destroyed AllSpark device from the first film that splintered into his clothes, and upon coming into contact with it, strange symbols of an ancient language of Cybertron (Transformers' home-world) are imprinted in his mind.Soon, the only other remaining piece of the AllSpark is stolen by Decepticons and used to resurrect their leader Megatron (Hugo Weaving), who immediately begins plotting with HIS master, an ancient Transformer called ""The Fallen."" The Fallen wants to track down an ancient doomsday device located on Earth, and use it to destroy the planet in a plot to harvest ""Energon"", the life-force that powers the Transformers, in order to allow for the birth of new Decepticons! And so, a game of cat-and-mouse begins, as the Decepticons track Sam, whose visions from the AllSpark hold a key piece of the puzzle to their plot, while the Autobots must protect him, as he tries to thwart the Decepticons.That's basically it. There are a few other details he and there, and a few subplots (such as Sam going to college, only to bring much destruction and chaos), but they really aren't all to important. This is a movie about robots socking each other, and cool looking backdrops getting blown to smithereens, and on that level, this movie delivers.I will say this, Michael Bay knows how to make an entertaining action flick. His direction is kinetic but coherent, unlike other modern action which can sometimes be so kinetic, you lose track of what's going on. I actually experienced that problem with the original film, but this time around, I was able to fully understand everything I saw. I was also more easily able to differentiate between the Autobots and Decepticons, which was almost impossible during the final forty minutes of movie one, thus making the action much more enjoyable this time around.Also, on the robot CG, overall, the photo-realism of the robots hasn't really improved, they appear about the same as the first film, which was fantastic, so I can easily forgive they they don't look dramatically better. But there was a huge advancement on SCALE, which is where a lot of research and development appears to have gone. When a Decepticon known as ""Devastator"" Transforms, you'll know what I mean.On the acting... Well, the voice acting (Particularly Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving) was excellent. The human acting... Mixed for the leads. LaBeouf does an OK job, but Fox really just comes off as the ""hot chick who kicks butt"", and her character-type has been played a lot better many times before. Some other returning characters (Ex. Major William Lennox, played by Josh Duhamel) are only OK, whereas others (Ex. John Turturro as Simmons) are a lot of fun to watch. Also a blast are Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), returning with a larger role this time.Another thing to watch for in this entry is the multitude of new Transformers, Autobot and Decepticon alike. Overall, they are a mixed bag. We never really get to meet the new bots, they are just there, but after a while you get used to them. Some are very cool (the three Arcee bikes give a nice, unique scale, and JetFire is just awesome), while others are downright irritating. (most heinous offenders being the Twins Mudflap and Skids, who despite having an adorably cute design, just have comedy that falls flat as a pancake.) Also, I take issue with the lack of character development. Bumblebee was a joy to watch in the first film, and had great interaction with Sam, but this time, there are only a few scenes of them directly interacting as friends. Also, the romantic element between Sam and Mikaela is watered down slightly, because it has already been established and is now just a plot device to get you to like the characters.I guess in the end, it boils down to this- this is a sequel inferior in terms of plot and character development, but vastly superior in terms of action and visual effects. And this is meant to be a big, loud, fun movie, so that uneven balance works.While not quite as good as the original, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" still works, and is definitely worth seeing on the big screen. If you can honestly say you watched this film without being thrilled during the action, or very amused by the humor, then you need to lighten up. A decent 6.5 out of 10 (I have to round up to ""7"" for IMDb) from me- enjoyable. See it with some friends and a LOT of popcorn.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

He plays a boy who is cautiously looking for adventure. His pretty friend Mikaela Banes is played by Megan Fox. Both of them, as I know, became even better known through this series of movies. The actors are pushed into the background because the stage belongs to the big robots called Transformers. They are very well done, I have to say.

Thoroughly enjoyed it, and from what i gathered so did everyone else in the screening, kids and adults.The film is amazing for action, and its pretty constant throughout. Really liked the cartoons as a kid, and enjoyed the first movie, but this really was fantastic.For the people slating it due to not having a story etc, generally, they are the usual moaners and wanna be critics who think the godfather series are the greatest films ever and judge everything according to that film!! The idea of a blockbuster film is to be epic and entertaining, and when its associated with Bay then you kinda need to expect lots and lots of great action. It delivers! As far as story goes, there is one. Why people seem to think there isn't is beyond me. As i said, its the typical morons who think every film has to have a ridiculously in depth story and character development. Every film is different and should be judged against similar genre.In my opinion then the story, acting, action, graphics etc etc etc (everything) was great.Expect an action packed roller-coaster of a film, and go in to have fun and enjoy being blown away and you will be far from disappointed!!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I'm not overly politically correct or anything, but these characters were like some of the awful stereotypes you see in movies of the 30s and 40s.

Tons of them exist. Movies can make 100s of millions and be just average movies (or even technically bad movies) Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, Matrix Revolutions, The Phantom Menace, Indiana Jones: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.The only people rating this 8 and above are looking just for cool special effects and action. And that's fine. But the majority have spoken. Most of us want something beyond just that. We want good acting (after all our money is paying actors millions), we want a good story, character development, etc.None of those things exist in this movie.Let's look at Michael Bays Body of work here. Tell me what Oscar monsters or Great 10 out of 10 movies are in there.Bad Boys, Bad Boys II, The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, The Island.There's a theme here. And it's not Great movies or Oscar winners. It's ""I will show the American Public Mindless Cool Special Effects, get relatively good actors to believe I'm making something, and get paid to show my child like directing abilities"" I'm sure Will Smith, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, Ben Affleck, Nick Cage, Josh Hartnet, Alec Baldwin, John Voight, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Scarlett Johanson, Ewen McGregor all look at these movies as their best work.Are some of these movies ""Good"" - Relatively. I mean yes, some are cool, kinda funny, and have some semi-interesting stories.How with 4 straight directing Bombs, the Transformers folks fell on Michael Bay as their savior is beyond me. Armaggedon 1 out of 5, Pearl Harbor 2 out of 5, Bad Boys II 1 out of 5, The Island 1 1/2 out of 5. But hey...most of his movies make ""some"" money. (Though Bad Boys II and The Island were both considered commercial failures) On the Acting Alone, you have to deduct 2 if not 3 on a 10 point system. There's no character development of the Transformers...and that's vitally necessary as they are the main characters. You don't see Pixar movies not developing their animated characters.Shaia Lebuff is a ""good"", young, talented actor. But it's mostly potential at this point. Megan Fox we can all agree has the acting range of string cheese. Honestly, how did this girl say ""I don't want a career like Angelina Jolie"" - What you mean a beautiful woman, successful actress, Oscar Winner, Nominated, etc, etc. Complete Acting Range. I mean talk about talented, look over that woman's career. Acting range is ridiculous, she's played pretty much everything.You mean a career like that Megan? Or one where they tell you to just shut up and look hot? Don't forget Tyrese, you all know he's a giant. My other deduction comes from the story telling, which was just terrible. The plot wasn't bad, it was the execution, which falls on the director, so what did we expect.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is like below rock bottom for a film to go. There is no plot, the acting sucks, the visual effects whilst being complex don't make for pretty sights for the eye. The Autobots are CGI-ed excretions of effects whenever they're fighting Decepticons. This film promotes cinematic ugliness instead of cinematic beauty. It doesn't even try to show 'beauty through ugliness' like The Elephant Man did; Revenge of the Fallen is just ugliness incarnate.Thankfully, there are thousands of other movies to watch readers, and I promise you that THEY don't offer headaches like this one did for me. If you want a real movie, watch Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained.

Firstly there are those that are 'deep and meaningful', often driven by Oscar-worthy acting or plot. And those that are just plain fun; an adrenaline ride and 'popcorn entertainment'. This movie naturally falls into the latter category!Having read many average-to-poor reviews of movies like this in the past, I also believe that some critics cannot appreciate both classes as an art form. I like to think that I can, and that's one reason why I love both Transformers movies thus far! Additionally, the packed showing I saw yesterday suggests I'm not alone. No, it's not a 'classic' but then most movies aren't anyway.It is rare that I go to a movie on release day (mainly to avoid the crowds),but sometimes I cannot contain my excitement! From the moment the Paramount Stars came flying around (accompanied with the 'Transformer Noises' of course) I was in entertainment heaven. This film is packed with insane action, genuinely funny comedy and enough military hardware to start a World War! Bay uses many of his usual camera tricks and techniques, making some of the action 'close-in' but generally better that the first film. The sound design is outstanding, and of course ILM - I bow down to your technical wizardry!While I believe it is common in the US, I can't remember the last time the credits rolled and a UK audience applauded. I would highly recommend this film to most people. Yes you can pick holes in the plot and yes it's not all hugely original. Obviously if you're dead inside, cannot have any fun and details like this will grate on you, don't bother going. Otherwise, sit back, relax and let Michael Bay blow you away with this audio-visual trill ride that will not leave you disappointed!","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Ow man this movie sets a new standard to sci-fi action movies... Transformers legacy is a treasure and Michael Bay is a first league artist, one of the best movies I saw in my whole life ! I'm 30 btw... anyway, even my girlfriend liked it, same goes for my other friends who were there !It just kept going... it lasted 2hours 20 minutes... Pity it ended... can't wait for number 3 ! And that's the only bad thing you can say about the movie it's that it even had to last longer, an half hour extra would have pleased the enthousiasts but would have been too much for the majority of people.Thanks Michael Bay, thanks to all the cast and crew, thanks hasbro for bringing the transformers legacy back to live !","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

And, I was wondering when it would be over.Shia LaBeouf did stand out as an actor. He was able to deliver his incredible humor, straight faced frantics and even a very soft lovely eye/face look when in a mini love scene with Megan Fox.Fox on the other hand was able to stay too pretty and sexy while barely getting her white clothing dirty while shrapnel and dirt covered everyone else. Why didn't she have a few bloody cuts and scrapes on her face and much exposed bod? Make it real Studios! I don't want to be aware of actors ""acting"" when watching a movie.

Seems simple, but not for Michael Bay. I can only assume that M.B. grew up playing with the plastic transformers. So WHYYYYYYYYY all the senseless crap!!! Take a cue from Peter Jackson or George Lucas on how to create an epic film without nonsense. I do not wish to spoil this movie for anyone without kids. If you do not have children and understand the difference between right and wrong- go ahead, my review cannot save you from yourself. If I had not seen the first movie and rationalized the PG-13 rating based on that criteria, I would not have taken my children to see this movie. I am by no means a radical conservative. The very fact that I took my children to see this film should attest to that. But I could not enjoy this movie because of the massive quantity of humorless vulgarities and the inescapably shallow characters. My kids seemed to enjoy it just fine, they whispered amongst themselves just about every time one of these scenes came and went. I almost walked out, and I should have, but I spent 40 bucks getting in and I kept thinking the action would keep the characters from additional dialog, which it didn't. The first movie was funny and witty with action intense but appropriate. This movie was juvenile and stupid. The action, while good, leads you into sensory overload about 1/2 way in, and there's still over 1 hour of it left. Bottom line: Michael Bay got my theater money, but he won't be getting my DVD money. And in the case of Transformers 3- Rise of the Pornobots- He won't get either.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It would be a gigantic stretch to even call this ""film"" tolerable.It's 2.5 hours of explosions, screaming, and running. In between that, you have HORRENDOUS ""comic relief"" that would only tickle the funny bone of a 10yr old. Plot? Who cares. The point is to see robots fighting each other right? There is no plot, only an ending to set up another sequel. Even a 1-900 # psychic could see that coming.If you like shaky cameras, horrible dialog, 150 minutes of plot holes, fight scenes where you can't make out who's hitting who, elementary school jokes, no appealing characters, hugely annoying characters, and wasting money...then this is the film for you! There is absolutely no excuse as to why this film is 2 and a half hours. I wouldn't have been so hard on it if it was 90 minutes.

Well, it's both, quite probably. Having not seen the first film I hoped there would be a sufficient introduction to get me into the Transformers world, but I don't think the filmmakers could really be bothered as it would have got in the way of whatever explosion happened to be going on at the time. Now, don't get me wrong, explosions are lovely and all, but there was so little by the way of character exploration in this that in no way did you care about any of the protagonists; the almost complete lack of plot didn't help much, either. Well, I say there was no plot - there may have been but I can't be certain because my eyes started to bleed and then I fell asleep.So, what was good about the movie? Well, Shia was likable in the lead role, Megan was always watchable (although I couldn't tell you what her acting was like), there were a few scenes with Sam's parents that were entertaining, much (although not all) of the effects work was effective but that was about it, I think, because come the end, I still wasn't sure exactly which of the robots were goodies or why I should care. Oh well.As it is, I think they missed a trick with this one; had they cut down on the swearing a bit they'd have made a PG rating rather than 12A/PG13 and so their prime constituent of eight year old boys could have had a field day without having to drag their poor parents along. And, as I sat there with my low expectations I thought, ""this really IS just like a Saturday morning cartoon"" and so on that basis it was just about tolerable, which is especially odd because I was bored stupid by this kind of mindless cartoon as a kid.All in all, then, I'd say skip this and go watch Star Trek instead. However, if your only demands are to watch large robots fighting for your gratification towards an ill-defined but doubtless noble cause, then this is the movie for you.","12 out of 86 found this helpful.

I have seen this film on its opening night in the UK, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt any of the negative comments written are unfounded and undeserved. This film rocked, it was amazing. I'll admit I am somewhat of huge Transformers fan, only hooked however by the amazing camera work of the legend that is Michael Bay from the first film. This film takes everything to the new level, the humour, the action, the robot duels, the story, blowing stuff up etc. is now on a new level compared to the first. As far as I am concerned 2.5 hrs is not even enough, I could happily have sat and watched another hour of the film - needless to say I am now counting down the days until the release of Transformers 3. No spoilers here - the magic is watching this film on the biggest screen you can find, I enjoyed every second I was at the cinema (so much I'll be going back again to see it) and I'm sure that this will be the opinion of many who see this film and enjoy what Bay has done with the franchise.

Yet despite this film failing in every way possible it still became a huge success at the box office. Micheal Bay is one of the worst directors ever. His action scenes are always are too shaky, and the writing in his films are so bad it barely counts as writing. He doesn't have any care about what he is doing at all. I hate this movie.

Having seen it thus on a normal screen, I am sure that the Imax version would have been a terrific experience! I think that this sequel keeps all the great things of the first movie but all the bad things as well.The positive things: the excellent cast with the teens, parents, the agent; the comedy moments; the amazing effects and the incredible tempo of the action: it is 100% adrenaline; the opening sequence at the parents' home or the car abduction left me speechless The negative things: the sound effects too loud, especially the robotic ones which mute the speeches; a fragile story which isn't told simply; the last part of the movie for its length; and above all, the design of the transformers which could have been less detailed. I like the simple, pure design in the cartoons, toys, comics and they should have kept this look instead of this highly mechanic, blurry,confuse design.

It is convoluted and full of plot holes. The romance felt forced, as did the college singular dimensional roommates. Is it just me, or is Shia LaBeou more annoying, then usual in this movie? He tries to act like this tough kid but he comes off like a punk. In every movie he is in, he has this short fuse. I just want someone to pop him in the face and knock him down a peg or two. Maybe a few more DUI's should do it. The sexy Megan Fox is and should be set dressing. Her acting can best be described as wooden. While I know in real life she is a sweet girl that is dedicated to her family, she is in no danger of winning any major acting awards. Maybe a razzie, oh wait, she got nominated for 2 already. I guess this movie was made for 12 year olds? Mr. Bay should really be a second unit guy because he is very good at visual details and action but seems to pay no attention to writing.

So I will now write a non-biased review. But really, I can't see that happening.So how about this? If you see it as a usual type of movie, of course, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an epic fail. There were no character development. The storyline – I won't even call it rushed – was a mess! So much plot holes that you can shove Optimus Prime in them and back again. There was too many missed opportunity for a better plot such as the ""Sam-as-a-fugitive"" storyline which could've been more in depth or even ""Jetfire, the old Decepticon turned good"" deserves a better story than that. And a lot of WTF moments. And one more thing, I remember the filmmaker saying that they had to write in Shia LaBeouf's hand injury -- that was also one of the WTF moments.But the only way to write a good review for this movie is that you have to see it as a ""Michael Bay type"" movie. Then this is the best movie ever made. His best effort yet. There were plenty of explosions that your ears could go numb, slow-motion sequences that most probably made up half an hour of the movie, and some more explosions! There are also random Transformers running around that you won't even know who is fighting what.I don't think anyone is capable of making a better ""Michael Bay type"" movie than this. Heck, I don't even think Bay himself can top this.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I don't generally like outdoor movies. The atmosphere is kind of neat, kind of retro, but with modern sound design, you're really missing out on something by going to them nowadays. I didn't really care about Transformers 2, though. The first one wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good, either. Its main problem is that the giant CGI robots were horribly designed and hard to tell apart. They don't look so much like the Transformers that came out of the package as I bought them as a kid as the Transformers that came out of the microwave after my little brother cooked them a little. The action sequences were somewhat incomprehensible, especially the ones with multiple Transformers fighting. The sequel is far worse in this respect, and pretty much all other respects, as well. I think all the action sequences are made up of multiple robots fighting, and you can't tell who they are. Not that it matters, since none of them have an ounce of personality. There's two exceptions to this, though, that provide the film's only entertainment, as prurient as it is. The twin Autobots are the two biggest racial stereotypes that I've seen in a movie since the 1980s. My God, one even has a gold tooth. I think their names are Mantan and Sleep 'n' Eat. This offensiveness amused me to no end. ""Damn! He got et!"" Other than that, there's a couple of humping dogs, a small robot that humps Megan Fox's leg, and a Decepticon ""scrotum"" to laugh at. You have to be pretty juvenile even for that, and luckily I am. If you're not, there's nothing else. And this movie runs two and a half hours! How? The plot is overcomplicated, but still pretty simple and easy to follow. Whenever a character needs to get out of some seemingly impossible situation, they're thrown a special power which has never been mentioned previously. The people who wrote the screenplay need to be shot. Bay doesn't deserve much better. I'm not actually a Bay hater, but he has made a handful of really awful movies. This isn't even his worst - that would be Armageddon. But this is pretty close to as bad.","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

Not mega budget Hollywood movies that we are supposed to take seriously. For real fans, here's another spin-off that actually makes sense: a Limited Edition Transformers Jacket from Core Gear.

The twin robots were absolutely hilarious and I was upset they didn't shoot more of the little robot that was captured he was hilarious. The only other complaint is the roommate.

The cavalcade of comic reliefs they bring on screen is unbearable and their jokes are terrible. And they're all annoying on par with Jar Jar Binks. It wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't going on -all- the time but the assault of pointless 'comical' characters is unrelenting.But it's not the jokes you're after in this movie anyway, now is it? It's the action. Well, the action isn't very good either. It's really hard to tell what's going on as all the Transformers are just a mess of CGI metal. The robots are still incredible acrobats, fast as lightning and completely lack the feel of being massive machines. Or being anything but digital images, really.I won't even touch the plot. It makes no sense at all and is all over the place. With a runtime of around two and a half hours the movie is way too long to sit through without a decent plot. Or any plot at all. Had they shaped off about ten comic reliefs and an hour of runtime the plot wouldn't matter while the focus stayed on the (albeit, flawed) action. Unfortunately, this is not the case.I really do enjoy a no-brainer action flick once in a while but this is one of the worst I have ever seen even in that category. What a waste to a legendary franchise and $200 million.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Before I begin, I would just like to state that I am in no way taking a defensive position; opinions are opinions, thus we say what we wish....Now, let's do some motion picture history. As I can remember from my very brief film studies, the first motion picture that people were able to view was a 20 second clip of a train coming to a complete stop toward the viewer, and only one person viewed it at a time since the screen was very small and house in a covered structure that could only fit ones head if they desired to view this amazing achievement. And what an amazing achievement it was as it made people oo and awe for some time. Inevitably, this became the staple of motion picture: to make people oo and awe and entertain so they would inexorably come back for more.So it would appear that most people seem to be ignorant of this fact. Does a movie like Transformers not allow people to oo and awe and be entertained? One thing that is interesting, is that the majority of the less than approving reviews of this film fail to mention it NOT entertaining them. Rather, they bore themselves with the obvious bad review drivel of ""no story"", ""no characters"", ""too many sexual suggestive shots (which there are few)""... etc, so forth. And I find it interesting that so many people desire there to be some lush, intriguing, thought provoking story with well written character arcs from a Transformers movie.... Is there something strange there? IT'S A TRANSFORMERS MOVIE! Large, talking robots waring with each other for possible humility, dominance, and survival that all began as toys. And it's also not fully meant for a young audience, rather an audience that chooses to watch a Transformers movie, keeping in mind that young people might like a loud movie with fighting robots.Lastly, there is plenty of character, nostalgic story and Autobot/Decepticon characters to allow this film to be what it is. So I just think that too many people are exhausting themselves these days by expecting, and wanting so much more from modern action movies. Rather, these films should be taken for what they are: Tansformers movies that rely on our senses to be ooed, awed, dazzled by the effects, and to be entertained. So if all you wish is so much more than what these films will offer you, than it's simple: Don't watch them. But if you're able to simply allow these films to give you what they can only offer, than sit down and have fun, because that is what Transformers is all about. And the only reason that I gave it 8 instead of 9 (nothing deserves 10 - what's beyond perfect?), is that I was kinda hoping for some Dinobots - oops, did I just contradict myself? ...","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I mean can one really go into a Michael Bay movie expecting genuine artistic vision? The answer to that riddle is ""NO"".While I highly enjoyed this film for it being a tale of the Transformers I have to say this was a movie with amateur all over it. Prime example the whole college scene. Why would anyone need to see Sam's mother running around baked on brownies when if they were making a joke it could have been simple show the baggy and end scene? Another problem was having this 90210 cheesy music playing in the background while Sam and Mikaela have some Laguna Beach style love dialogue. Even though every guy will cheer, Megan Fox does not need to pose in every scene simply because everyone already knows she is a bombshell. Last, while I enjoyed Jetfire's appearance it's disappointing how he was personified to resemble an old wise man while in the animated version he was made to look powerful more than old. Those were just a few problems that were in the film but they were the ones that bothered me the most.Transformers and explosions are what make up most of this movies credibility. The fight scenes in The Fallen were shot much better than the first due how the scenes were shot to where both bots could be seen on screen and slowed down enough at times so the cgi would not distort. This can all be seen simply in the battle seen in the forest. This movie probably would have been better if it was just shot from Josh Duhamel's and Tyrese's side because it showed the alliance built between the humans and Transformers. Plus it would have been better, in between action, than hearing some love chat between Shia and Megan. On the Transformer fan side one will jaw drop at the amount of bots that are involved with the plot especially when the constructicons are brought to the screen.Overall, the movie itself if you're prepared for the fact that you will be watching a Michael Bay film you will enjoy it. Me being a huge Transformers fan is why I gave it an 8 because as a film its a 6 at best. It seems like all Bay did was phone is script while focusing on action. One can only wonder why they don't higher a credible director for the basic scenes and just use Bay for the action scenes. In the end it sucks to see an amazing heroic story that is the Transformers turned into a summer popcorn flick.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Upon facing a collision course with the 2007-2008 Writer's Strike however, Bay and a trio of writers were in a rush with the production process. The evidence of their production difficulties is greatly shown in this final product of this bombastic 150-minute metal-on-metal action extravaganza. While Bay keeps his promise of spectacular visual heft involving heavy battles of giants robots sparring against each other, the script is the bumbling disappointment. The movie is underplotted, scarce of interesting characters, and signals a decline in the spirit of what the original film is wildly entertaining hit. Of course, hoping for a firmly groundbreaking story in a Michael Bay would probably be a lot of ask for consider the director's past endeavors. This does not stray from the shallowness of his bruised continuation of the Transformers saga. Set after the events of the predecessor, Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf) has graduated high school and is now heading off to college in attempt to live a normal life away from the Autobots and Decepticons. Kissing his girlfriend Mikaela (played by Megan Fox) and his parents (played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White) good-bye, Sam embarks on his college career, only to be haunted by mysterious symbols printed on a piece of the Allspark. Soon on, Sam finds himself pulled back into the war between the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons who set out to wreck havoc on the human race. In the process, Mikaela and Sam's geeky roommate Leo (played by Ramon Rodriguez) are along for the ride. This film cooks with roughly the same ingredients of the first entry, although it appears a plot may be the very last item on agenda. The story intends on picking up not far from the where the previous film left off and continue the epic saga between the Autobots and the Decepticons. There was some fair potential at hand. Unfortunately, the majority of that potential is squandered on a thinly developed plot that not only fails to properly explain a few elements such as why the Decepticons are still after Sam, but occasionally dives into some absurd plot elements. If you need an example, one of which propels from Sam's sexual encounter with a college girl. After all, the film, even more so than the previous entry, takes heavy advantage from some awkward sexual innuendo including some racy dialogue uttered by the robots and a shot showing John Turturro in a G-string that place some moviegoers (particularly parents who bring their kids) at heave. Some of the humor is surprisingly funny, others are just flat-out crude and out of place. On the plus side, Bay boasts a somewhat commendable aptitude in special effects and visually alluring action set pieces showcasing the autobots and the decepticons going head-to-head and ripping each other apart in a loud explosion galore. The climatic battle set near the Pyramids of Egypt where military tanks are blown up, the pyramid is nearly decimated to pieces, and the explosion racks up a number nearly impossible to count; is sets stone in the film's biggest enchantment. If there is even a minor improvement from the predecessor, it may the performances by both Shia Lebeouf and Megan Fox which really isn't saying much, especially as the latter is once again recycled as a one-dimensional character delivering sex appeal for lingering shots of her body. The rest of the characters are sadly fall short of interest as well, particularly Ramon Rodriguez who's whiny personality and goofiness resembles more of an obnoxious caricature than a compelling character. Even when he lands maybe a few attempts at humor, his character can be quite a vexing device.Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is a boisterous sci-fi action eye candy for those who are able to dive into the visually stunning action set pieces to distract themselves from the thinly written plot and characters. For everyone, this one may not be a your cup of tea. By no means is this big-budget sequel an abhorrent disaster. After all, there is plenty of visual heft that is destined to keep the youngster occupied. But it is a disappointing entry in this freshly born saga.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

As far as story and characters, this was about as bad as it gets.In Transformers 2, Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) is going to college on the east coast where he will be separated from his stunning girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) who's lipstick always looks freshly applied on a pair of lips that seem unable to close. It was as if Michael Bay said, ""Keep your lips apart and pouty-looking the entire movie.""Sam Witwicky's college experience gave us two Shia Labeoufs, which is not a good thing. Instead of Lebeouf being the motor mouth comedy relief, we got him and the guy playing his college roommate, Ramon Rodriguez. It was like the two of them were dueling to be the silliest and the chattiest.Sam had a small piece of All-Spark which imprinted an alien map in his brain to a doomsday weapon. This machine would be able to suck the power of the sun in order to give Transformers the power they need to survive as a race. A major badass and bad bot called the Fallen (voiced by Tony Todd) wanted to find this machine and get it going. The only one standing in his way was Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen). If he could be rid of Optimus and get the map from Sam's brain he could go about destroying humanity.LIke I said, the CGI and the slo-mo battle scenes were something to gawk at. With that came far too much melodrama and an attempt to make the movie seem weightier than it really was. Remember; this was a Saturday morning cartoon. The more dramatic they made the movie--even with the addition of naval carriers, tanks, F-16's, and other weapons that made the movie look like one long U. S. military recruitment video--the more put-off I was by the movie. It would've been a lot better by being less pretentious and more light and funny minus the Ramon Rodriguez character.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the Cinema or I probably would've asked for my money back.I fast forwarded through so much of the start of this movie. The whole college thing was honestly just really crap. You think people making that much money could write something with some decent story line to it. You write writes could make new things rather than rehashing their own previous substance into a totally different movie. The whole star wars thing can be seen so obviously it made it unbearable. I mean when Megatron was talking to his boss like Darth Vadar was with the Emperor the boss guy uses the whole 'much to learn my apprentice' lines. And the dead brothers appearing to Sam saying 'its your destiny'. Might as well been Luke skywalker having yudo and rest of them appearing saying its your destiny. I mean come on!!! Even if you can get past the really really really bad story, failed character development, failed romantic sub story which was just plain hopeless and the fast forward through pretty much over half of the movie I still wouldn't want to pay to see this.What's worse is that it made so much money that they all think they did an awesome job and going to make another one! I really hope the rest of the population that found the 'same old, same old' action scenes and CGI entertaining in this movie don't do same again on next one so they finally get the picture that just cause you have a big budget with big flashing special effects doesn't make it a good movie! I couldn't even finish it because it just got so retarded and far fetched and that's saying something.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the second live-action movie based on the Hasbro toys. It is directed by Michael Bay and stars Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox. The story is set (I'm guessing) two years after the original and tells the story of Sam Witwicky going to college, and the Autobots fighting the remaining Decepticons, and a giant alien-baddie who (surprise, surprise) doesn't like humans, and who knows what else. So first off I want to say that when I saw the first Transformers on Blu-Ray I was impressed at how much I enjoyed a movie based on car action figures, granted I wouldn't say it was one of the greatest movies ever but I was pleasantly surprised and I genuinely enjoyed it. Unfortunately I can't say the same for Revenge of the Fallen. That's not to say I hated the movie, the action was really fun, some of the scenes were really cool, and I was never bored. However as a whole it was poorly crafted, lazily written, and filled with gags that might as well have been written by Middle School Boys. Now before I get anyone saying ""But it's a dumb action movie, that's how it's supposed to be!"" Allow me to point out first, that with our recent streak of Smart action movies (i.e. The Dark Knight, Star Trek, Casino Royale) that excuse doesn't hold as much water, and second it is possible to make a ""dumb"" action movie that is well crafted and doesn't have to resort to immature sex jokes to get a reaction (i.e. Terminator Salvation, Iron Man). The story of the movie just went where ever it wanted and felt like it had no direction aside from ""Hey wouldn't it be cool to have robots fight in China? Yeah! Now let's have them fight in Egypt!"" Also the characters were all one-dimensional and had no development, and many acted in ways that contradict the way they had been established in the first movie. For instance: Megatron, the nigh-unstoppable menace from the first movie spent two hours of this movie being the Fallen's lap dog. The absolute worst thing about this movie was the incessant immature humor. The first film had one scene that, while embarrassing, was forgivable because it only happened once, but this movie couldn't get through ten minutes without including an unnecessary and unfunny sexual or racial gag. And speaking of racial, two characters called ""The Twins"" were terrible! Imagine Jar Jar Binks times two plus horrible racial stereotypes. I'm normally one to reach for my barf-bag when someone uses the term ""politically correct"" but these characters felt more like they were designed for Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs (look it up on Wikipedia) than a modern action film. When I found out that this movie had several scenes filmed in the full IMAX aspect ratio my mind instantly went to the amazing IMAX work done with The Dark Knight, so I payed the extra money to see this in IMAX and to my disappointment only one sequence was filmed entirely in IMAX and only two others contained any IMAX footage at all, a huge let down when compared to the extensive IMAX work that Christopher Nolan had done with The Dark Knight. So if you are considering seeing the IMAX version I recommend saving your money (although watching Optimus Prime fight 4 or 5 decepticons solo in the middle of the movie was pretty epic in full IMAX). This movie was by all means terrible, but it did have a few redeeming qualities. Yes, it was poorly crafted and embarrassing at parts but it was a fun movie to watch and I am glad that I saw it. However I would not go out of my way to watch it again. Let's hope that Michael Bay will take a little more care in making the next film (probably not just looking at the box office scores, but here's hoping).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This installment of the series has, a priori, a good starting point. The special effects are fabulous, both regarding the robotics, and also the real-life city scenes with fights.What made the first film successful, beyond the X-effects, was its freshness, a decent story line, sense of humour, good-timed action, and the acting was at least OK.The freshness is gone in this movie, the pace of the film is like a constant unattended spasmodic heart-attack and the acting is pedestrian on all parts. LeBeouff and Duzamel are not making themselves any favor, like cut from cardboard. Megan Fox should take some acting lessons because she is terrible in this movie, her ""acting' reduced to posing in tight pants and be the accessory of the other characters; that is not her fault, the lack of development of the character, but she is not even good at that. She was acceptable in the first film, so I don't know what happened to her in between. At least the actors who play LeBeouff's parents were OK.My first half an hour was a raw roar in crescendo. I was getting upset. Why? Pedestrian acting, impossible non-believable happenings in the story, poor stunts, poor development of the story, poor dialogues, lack of freshness, bad pace, and too much pretentiousness. A real put off for multi-million movie.Then, I caught myself laughing, not laughing because the movie makes you laugh, but laughing at the movie, because some things are so bad, that despite the gazillion dollars spent on this film, this movie felt like a B movie, actually a Z movie. There is fun in the Z. I found that if one watches this film as a comedy, it is way more enjoyable than if one watches it as a science-fiction adventure multi-million film. An unintended comedy. So I ended having a good time!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen follows suit from its prequel by showcasing great effects and scenery, and also by lacking sound logic and interesting characters. However, this movie takes one step down in the latter category as the first half of the movie is filled with downright absurd situations and a lot of sexual innuendos which feels extremely pushed and wholly unrealistic. It is not until the second half of the runtime that Transformers 2 elevates itself to a similar level of that of the first movie.The characters can also be perceived as being more extreme, in the sense that there is rarely any moment where characters develop but stay with their ""for or against""-conviction. Their interactions are also noticeably louder, which could be fatiguing for some after two and a half hours.Conclusively, if one liked the first Transformers, the same won't be too bothered. Nevertheless, if another person spends his or her time watching objectively better movies, that person will be, at which point Transformers 2 stops being entertaining whatsoever.My personal grade: an annoying 4/10.

There can be no denying that this movie delivered exactly what its producers and director wanted it to deliver.This IS a Sci-Fi/ACTION movie. You will not find depth of characters, deep emotional tugs or a real intricate plot, but that's not it's intended purpose. This is a fun, sit back in the movie theater with your popcorn and enjoy the visual spectacle kind of movie. And truthfully, that's where it matches the Generation 1 episodes, because aside from an elaborate advertisement for action figures, that's all it was.I was pleased with the amount of Decepticon dialog in this film that the first one was lacking. Both sides of the fight get their just camera time and the action sequences (which are 90% of the movie) blow you away! And we don't get a good introduction to many of the robotic characters, but this is about all-out WAR! There's no time for introductions.As for the comical moments, yeah, the first part of the movie went a bit over-the-top, but it worked out and was well placed later in the movie. Speaking of which, this movie IS rated PG-13, so if your kid is younger than 13, seriously consider whether or not they should see it as there are noticeable amounts of foul language and scenes that are a little risqué and others that are extremely violent or freaky.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Since this is a sequel it can be forgiven for not spending too much time introducing the characters or explaining the back story of why the two groups of robots are at war, even so it was not difficult to figure out who was good and who was bad and what they were trying to achieve. If the idea of watching CGI robots beating the living daylights out of each other while Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox try to prevent the bad robots achieve their evil aim then you might enjoy this. Unfortunately the story never really grabbed me and I found my self thinking ""is it nearly over?"" when there was in fact another hour to go and while the action was pretty much non stop the fact that is was CGI made it feel unreal. I may have missed something but I was also rather confused by the films geography; one minute they are in the Smithsonian in Washington the next they are in an aircraft storage facility, another time they are in Petra in Jordan then after a bit of running about they are in Egypt, it was as though Michael Bay just wanted to destroy some well known Middle Eastern landmarks and assumed viewers would think they were within walking distance of each other.It is hard to comment on the quality of the actors as all they had to do was run around avoiding the bad CGI Robots. The good robots were somewhat annoying, some of them were given characteristics which were presumably meant to be funny but just made me hope they'd end up scrap metal. It is clear that Michael Bay's expertise is in action set pieces and not in characterisation or comedy although the fact that his films rake in vast amounts of money suggest there must be lots of fans for this type of thing; I'm not one of them though.","3 out of 21 found this helpful.

This means that he will have to live separately from his parents, Judy (Julie White) and Ron (Kevin Dunn), leave his girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) and explain the situation to his friend and protector Bumblebee, as he intends to take a normal life from now on. At the same time, the government deactivates Sector 7, resulting in the dismissal of Agent Simmons (John Turturro). In its place is created NEST, an agency led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson), who works in conjunction with the Autobots. However, NEST faces resistance from Theodore Galloway (John Benjamin Hickey), the national security consultant, who considers it superfluous.The structure of the script remains similar to the formula that made the first a great success, maintaining the humor and action, however the great defect of ""Revenge of the Defeated"" is in its total exaggeration and imbalance in the narrative. The plot starts back in time (12,000 BC) to justify the existence of robots in the early days of humanity and then go back to the present day and talk about the partnership between Autobots and humans in the fight against the Decepticons. As it should be, there is the childish love between boyfriends Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela (Megan Fox), and also the eternal ability to save the world from the American armed forces. And add robots, lots of robots. I can't say that the excesses of Transformers 2 are a surprise. Michael Bay would be no different. The only thing usually ""less"" in a typical Hollywood sequel - although there are several honorable exceptions - is a script. After all, coherence, logic and intelligent dialogues hinder robot fights, don't they?While Transformers (the first), is an introductory tape of this universe with some level of quality (some, not much), but that simply does not allow us, with its mind-boggling cuts and shaky cameras, to understand what is happening or even to differentiate between robots and even among humans, the second film is more of the same, or rather, much more of the same. Michael Bay went crazy and created the two and a half hours more incoherent as possible and look that there is no need to go into the question of the geography used in the tape, as it is laughable enough to say that the robots go from the pyramids of Egypt to Petra, in Jordan , as if they were literally next to each other. Transformers is a production clearly aimed at male teenagers, as it combines three elements that always win the attention of this group: robots, cars and hot and unattainable women who, for some obscure reason, seem attracted by awkward nerds who ... like of robots and cars. Instead of focusing on the main plot, the film wastes time on ridiculously useless, pseudo-funny and inexcusable profanity and eschatological and racist jokes. Thus, the public has to endure sequences with copulating dogs, crazy middle-aged ladies, robots with iron testicles and incontinence problems and, mainly, the useless twins Autobots Mudflap and Skids. The problems of the script for the first film, such as the disconnected subplots (there were hackers and the minister, there was Sam, there were the military, etc.), are fixed in the worst way: putting all the characters in one plot. So expect to see Sam's relatives all running from the slow-motion explosions.LaBeouf again embodies the ordinary youth in an unusual situation, a role that the actor lives with charisma. Megan Fox has the job of being ... well, hot, with the feature exploring her ""natural attributes"" as much as possible, including shots that resemble the series ""Baywatch"". What about the scenes with the physical gifts of Megan Fox, which Michael Bay knows how to exploit in the same way that porn directors do? Her first scene with her rear end painting on a motorcycle is embarrassing. Megan Fox does not seem to mind being used as a simple sexual object throughout the projection, even changing clothes in public and without any explanation just to make a declaration of love to her boyfriend (or ""affection"", since one of the subplots) ridiculous of the feature lies in the fact that Sam and Mikaela resist the word ""love""). Employing the old crutch of interpretation of her mouth smeared with red lipstick and her lips always parted (I believe this is what Fox understands to be ""character building""), the beautiful actress also does not seem to be bothered by the fact of Mikaela, despite from initially being presented as a strong and independent young woman, then being forced to embody the old cliché of the young lady who needs to be protected by the men around her - and just note that, throughout the film, there is always someone to hold the girl's hand when it is necessary to run away from robots. In the ""hot"" item of the film, Megan Fox has as a competitor the beautiful Australian debutant Isabel Lucas, who ""plays"" Alice, a college friend of Sam who basically shoots himself at him.Despite the confusion of the montage by Michael Bay and team, it is undeniable that ILM's computer graphics work is a delight to the eye. The movement of the robots is fluid, believable and perfectly immersed within the environment in which they are inserted and the combat scenes are impressive when merging physical scenarios with beings created entirely on the computer. Watch, for example, how Bumblebee gesticulates nervously when Sam scolds him as he leaves the garage to face some angry appliances. On the other hand, the transformations of the creatures occur so quickly and confused that we can never understand the relationship between their alternative forms and the repositioning of their parts, which is unfortunate, but, I believe, necessary: after all, like a 3-car. meters long could it plausibly transform into a 10-meter-high robot?New characters like Jetfire and the main villain Fallen have very interesting concepts, although extremely poorly explored. Jetfire, a dodgy decepticon and source of valuable information, becomes a transformer with Alzheimer's, while Fallen never justifies being so dangerous as to be adored by Megatron. Even so, several transformers appear only in the background, even some quite popular ones like Arcee, Ratchet and Ironhide. The classic Bumblebee continues to stand out.Let's say that Michael Bay wants his films to climax all the time. However, the big problem is that there is no expectation at any time, and everything is meaningless. Twice worse, twice loud. The film has great moments in action, going through the hallucinating start in China, the chase on the college campus, the fantastic fight in the forest (high point of the film) and the final confrontation of the Egyptian desert. In fact, the ""final"" battle in the desert should easily be an hour long and you can't understand almost anything that's happening. Visually, we can only identify good robots from bad ones because it is simplistic enough to avoid any confusion about their personalities: Autobots are always depicted with strong colors and blue eyes, while Decepticons appear in metallic gray tones. and with red eyes. In addition, the work's internal logic begins to crumble completely, with robots that are super powerful a moment before starting to fall easily with half a dozen shots a few minutes later. Even with a completely flawed script and full of holes, it was to be expected at least to maintain a cohesive narrative structure. When the English title Fallen arrives, which in theory is the most powerful of the Decepticons, just two punches of Optimus Prime are enough to destroy it without any ceremony, demolishing the gore of history and all the suspense created around it and creating an anticlimactic and disappointing ending.All of Michael Bay's habits are there, of course: the backlit maiden, the boring circular travellings until the excessive use of slow motion and low-angle framing that try to overestimate the heroism of the characters. In addition, there is no more ""authorial"" element in Bay's work than the explosions - and every five minutes something seems to be destroyed in an immense fireball in Transformers 2, which ends up becoming monotonous and commonplace. Populated by boring characters (from Sam's parents to his college roommates, past ex-agent Simmons from Turturro, ""cute"" robots and any creature with a single line throughout the film), Transformers 2 still proves the Bay's notorious egocentrism: if in the original he made a self-reference to Armageddon, here it is his turn to include a Bad Boys 2 poster in the college dormitory, which indicates that those college students have a bad taste proportional to their lack of intelligence.""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" contains special effects and common defects. It is definitely not a transformative film (with a pun), but a large patchwork of well-stitched pieces, but without finishing. If you pull the thread of the script, it will drop the end to everything that is on the side because the primary idea is to have fun. The big problem is the spectator leaving 150 minutes of projection with absolutely nothing to emphasize on a work from the technical or visual side. Bay may not know how to make movies, but he knows how to film chaos, explosions and the military like no one else, especially considering his customary aversion to the use of the green screen, making the incendiary show of adventures that appears on the scene even more worthy of applause. And it is only the pyrotechnic and digital spectacle that makes this second endeavor of the franchise in cinemas something worthwhile for the general public to see this feature film (extremely long) in cinemas.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

It is has been highly publicized so it will inevitably be a blockbuster but I personally did not like it.I actually find it quite boring, usually explosives and awesome digital effects aren't boring. But when the movie is all that, yes it is. I almost fell asleep! There was no clear story, it's obvious the movie is just about showing off effects. But I won't say I didn't enjoy it at all. The characters are awesome, I enjoyed when they actually were involved in talking to each other (Probably 10-20 lines each, that's for the main characters) Other than that they were just running around with explosives everywhere.By the way there is a huge error in this movie, apparently the two main characters ran -on foot- from Jordan to the pyramids of Egypt in like an hour. Are they serious? Those to places are not even close, it would take DAYS or maybe WEEKS to go there on foot.5/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

All i have to say is this movie is a huge disappointment. I saw it in thetres waited in a three hour line up just to watch it from the front row. NOT WORTH ITThis movie kind of takes off from the first one it still has Shia and Fox who are dating by this point. Now one thing i hated about these movies was they did not explain much about the transformers in the first one so i assumed they were going to get right into it in this one. Boy was i wrong. This movie is about 40 minutes of explanation and then about a hour and 45 minutes of explosions and fight sequences. This is mostly because of the directing talents of Bay. He tries to replace story line and substance with explosions and noise.So I walked out of the thetre feeling bored and frankly a little motion sick from all the fast moving action that never seemed to end.Frankly i did not enjoy this movie after the first 40 minutes and im sure the 3rd will be the exact same. 4/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now here we are in 2009 with TF: Revenge of the fallen, All I can say is just...Wow, the movie was just pure perfection and everything I was expecting, new characters, lots of explosions, outstanding special effects and great battles from our beloved robots in disguise.Plot wise I cant really complain all that much since I have seen quite a handful of negative reviews saying that this film's plot is abit dry, but I think the plot is decent for all can be expected.The Transformers themselves always seem to be perfectly made in CGI and once more the voice actors give there outstanding performances, Great to hear Peter Cullen as Prime & Hugo Weaving as Megatron, also great to hear Frank Welker (the voice of Megatron & Soundwave in the original series) make his big break into the film series as the beloved Soundwave again.Also Megatron & Starscream bring there infamous squabbling into the movies and it's done perfectly to no end and Megatron has more lines in this film ^_^ Then we move onto The Fallen (who is voiced by Tony ""The Candyman"" Todd), a character who appeared mainly in the War Within Comic and let me just say he is a great character who means serious business. Originally there was a rumour that Lenord Nimoy was gonna play him which would have been nice, but I think Todd was a much better choice. Sorry Nimoy.Also some characters like Sideswipe, The Constructicons, Arcee, Wheelie & Jetfire (who is now a cranky, old coot ^^) make there first theatrical appearance and they finally managed to make this film more focused on the robots than the human characters.There arn't really any flaws that stand out in this movie that much except for Sam's Parents & Leo, I don't even know what they are doing in this film to begin with.Overall though, this film was simply beautiful. Truly everything that a sequel should be with so much heart and motion from all the cast with 100% outstanding special effects! As a die-hard Transformers fan I will say this now, Ignore the negative reviews now! This film is a cinematic masterpiece!! If your a fan of Transformers or just getting into it, Go see it now!!!","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Come on, its a damn shame and worse way to spend a Saturday night to see this horrible sequel and its so bad that it puts itself into Status Lock.

I was pleasantly surprised a little but not that much. It's always easy to say a movie is very good because it's not as bad as I expected, but this certainly wasn't a very good movie.First of all the dialogue didn't suck near as bad in the first installment (thank God Anthony Anderson was not asked to come back) Next I actually did laugh a few times, only once though I think it was intended. Great visuals, decent story, some good performances.Now the bad. I think most will agree this was WAAAAAAY too long. This would have been a much more effective film if at least 45 minutes was left on the cutting room floor. There were a lot of scenes that served zero purpose for the plot of the story. In fact most of the first 30 minutes could have been shot in one or two short scenes.Overall: I think 5/10 is about right leaning more toward less than half. This is definitely a case where less would have been more as far as quality. Mostly it's like a beautiful woman who's a complete moron, who's dumb enough to be a turnoff but so gorgeous she can't be ignored.Final Thought: Isabel Lucas WHOOOOOOOOAH is she hot.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I believe that's about it. In a way, those shards of ""un-obtanium"" metallic figures brawling themselves to pieces leaves big to the imagination (and confusion): Who is that battling whom? Who the heck is winning? Why, oh why, with all that technological advancement and ""alien"" heritage some come to have such ""saintly and humanly"" conscience?Stereotypicism was aplenty: a pair that act like some Wayan brothers comedy, a scantily-clad and suggestively-positioned (more often than not) eye candy, an education-oriented fellow who suddenly flips and decided he wants to be the next Indiana Jones, etc.All is not lost though.

Firstly, it's a movie you HAVE to watch. I mean, all the hype, and the special effects, you can't not see it.But having to sit through a script that insults your intelligence no end was pure torture. I couldn't be more relieved when that crock of manure they call a movie ended.And it's so sad it had to be this way. To see what utter rubbish talentless people can produce with such a great legacy like the Transformers.If you think a movie about giant robots can't be any good, you haven't seen the cartoons. They were so well written! Each Transformer had distinct personalities - from the wise and patient Optimus, his loyal lieutenant Ultra Magnus, the kind hearted Bumblebee, the maniac Megatron, his conniving Starscream, the faithful Soundwave. Their different characters and voices made them so believable, there was little need to involve actual humans into the story.Then there were some really cool Transformers like the giant Omega Supreme with his deep booming voice and Fortress Maximus, a whole base that could transform!There was one story called the Key to Vector Sigma, which I still remember to this day which had so much drama, humour and a thrilling climax between the Autobots & Decepticons! Wow! You don't need big budget, you need creativity, passion and well, you need talent!Coming back to Transformers 2, all those are lacking. What you get are really, really stupid jokes.

The action scenes were awesome, especially when Optimus takes on three Decepticons in the forest. The CGI was also very well done.Now, the bad stuff. Where was the plot? Last time i checked, MOVIES NEED PLOTS!!! Otherwise its total anarchy. Pretty much up until Optimus Prime dies, there is no plot. Suddenly, they are whisked off to Egypt for the Matrix of Leadership (which sounds very cheesy by the way). I was very upset that the other Autobots were rarely given dialogue. It felt like the movie was mainly meant to be about Optimus more than the other Autobots.Now, for the humans in the movie. Shia LaBeouf again did a good job, but i cannot get over the fact that he comes back to life after being killed. He has a vision of the Primes and he's suddenly up and kicking. Like seriously, WTF?! The parents i felt were overused and they perhaps should have been limited to another cameo role, like in the first movie. Josh Duhamel didn't contribute anything new. As did Tyrese Gibson. They weren't given enough dialogue in the movie.A generous 5/10 for the awesome action sequences, nothing more.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There was no moment to stop and take in an action scene and I personally loved that. I thought they kind of rushed the beginning scenes because the movie was already 2.5 hrs long, and truthfully I wish the whole movie was longer. It seemed like they rushed too much and could have put in a lot more, for example, the bad guys could have caused a lot more damage to humans and big cities like NYC. I'm also glad there were more scenes with the soldiers. Thank god Megan Fox is so damn gorgeous because her acting isn't the best but Shia rocks. Third film is a definite possibility. Over-all it's an amazing, have you at the edge of your seat all night, action packed movie.P.S. Thank you Linkin Park for making that amazing song for this movie. It Rocks!P.S.S. If you want a movie that ""is intellectually stimulating"" and ""makes you think"" then why in the name of hell are you going to watch an action movie based on a cartoon?!???!

I think I have that right. They have names, but Speed Talk isn't my strength and I didn't catch the names. It must be pointed out here that no pyramids were harmed in any way. What you see is CGI so no worries, eh?Let's see, there is speed reading, speed dialing, speed dating, and now we have Speed Talking. The characters talked so fast I had no idea what they were saying or they spoke in such husky whispering voices that nothing came across with that as well. I was left with just watching CGI most of the time. And, since Michael Bay doesn't know when to stop these action scenes I drifted off to La La land several times. When I awoke, I realized I had not missed a thing, well, except for the story, of course. Some say there was one. Indeed?If Michael Bay spent as much time with the story, dialogue and the acting performances, as he does with the CGI, he might have an Oscar on his hands. But, sadly the acting was wanting (except for Josh Duhamel, and Rainn Wilson. Both are pros and did good),and the story was lost in all the explosions/transformings, and I couldn't care about anything except when this was over. Two and one half hours of T2 is like 14-hrs of T2. Yes, it is still tedious, goofy and way too long as T1 was. Way too long. Did I mention that is was way too long? Oh.As for the CGI, it was terrific and is the best I have ever seen. But, when it goes on for too long, it becomes old hat, boring, been there done that, and then it becomes quite annoying too. I am sure an Oscar has Michael Bay's name on it for Best Director or Special Effects. And, to be honest, it is deserved. Say what I will about T2, the directing of the CGI was pretty good. The CGI is terrific. There was just too much of it. Did I mention that T2 was way too long? Oh.Now, I will go to bed every night and pray there is no Transformers 3.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Well, for some unknown reason we see two dogs going at it in several scenes. Have no idea why. Not funny. Nudity: No.Language: No. There may have been some some when I was in La La Land.

Transformers Revenge of the Fallen delivers on all of this plus more.The movie again is packed full of humour and of course the delectable Megan Fox returns for a different kind of visual treat.What I like about transformers is that its not trying to be serious, it isn't trying to come across as something it isn't. It is immense fun to experience and a beauty to watch.Hardcore fans will be pleased by some of the touches made, Soundwave, and Ravage were particular favourites of mine, the Constructicons, Matrix of Leadership, and Jetfire are all up there too.Personally, I didn't notice the length much, and anyone who enjoys transformers won't notice too.

Perhaps because I saw it in IMAX my opinion of the effects is nothing short of WOW!!! AS for the plot, it not only had a solid one, in my opinion, it tied in nicely overall with the first movie. I'm not going to give any spoilers. I don't need to, the movie can be recommended without any. First of all, I feel it made a logical step in what Earth would likely be like 2 years after the first movie. Familiar characters from the first movie were back in logical ways (versus, ""Hey let's just throw THIS character in from the first movie for fun!""), it was explained quite effectively in the opening narration everything we needed to know to understand everything that was to follow. The story (or PLOT, as some seem to feel was missing) was actually layed out in THE FIRST THREE MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. If you simply watch and listen to the first few minutes, you'll see it all fall into place throughout the movie as more gets explained. The effects were spectacular! Some even had me catching myself with my mouth wide open (SERIOUSLY!) The personalities of the various Autobots, in my opinion, was refreshing. You had personalities ranging from goof-balls, to show-offs, to ""military"" serious, to playful-yet-hardcore. Which is actually what you would find in ANY U.S. Military Platoon filled with guys who've worked together for the last 2 years. The main story, though not FULLY explained from A to Z, gave enough detail to keep things flowing without making your brain hurt from too many details. Yes, I did find a couple of scenes out of place (a couple of scenes are in ""high octane"" mode, yet cut away to a much calmer scene that is not connected in any way to the scene we just saw, only to cut back to the ""high octane"" scene"" again) which is why I took away one of the stars. I removed another star because, as kick @ss as the climatic scene was, it should have lasted longer for all the build-up leading to it.Oh, and personally, I actually grew to really like Bumblebee in this movie (was NOT a fan of his in the first movie!) He was as goofy as in the first movie, but in my opinion he showed he was a worthy dude to have on your side when some serious....um...""stuff"" hits the fan.The graphics rocked. The story flowed. And ultimately, I feel it surpassed the first movie. Again, I saw it in IMAX, so that might be the3 best way to truly experience this movie.That's My Opinion, But You're Welcome To It.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The audience left the cinema murmuring about what actually happened and the different ways it should have ended. It was surprisingly anti-climatic, especially after the huge build up during the film. It is filled with senseless dizzying action, that were very hard to follow due to the fact that it was transformers fighting, so the clash of mechanical imagery was confusing at best. The film was flooded with a downpour of debris, bombs and random bits of robots flying all over the place. Spectacular action but it does get tiresome, especially in a 2 1/2 hour film.. The film had quite a lot funny and witty moments, but even this was overdone with its repetitiveness. What made it worse was the cliché characters that continuously made me cringe. As a guy, the best bit about the film was Megan Fox. She is a stunningly beautiful actress and has definitely upped her performance from the first instalment. However, the writers chose to make her simply the eye- candy of the film, rather than something more worthwhile. Shia LaBeouf was amusing to say the least. I'm not sure how much acting he had to do to pull off the awe-filled eyes every time he had a scene with Megan Fox :) Lucky guy.. So if you want simple.. confusing.. fun.. senseless.. action (with hottie Megan Fox) this movie is for you. If you're expecting a more well-rounded plot with surprisingly clever twists, well.. that's not happening.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

However I soon realized my mistake. This movie was immature, underdeveloped, and somewhat promoting of racial stereotypes through a robot persona. The parents were retarded. The love story was lacking and overly dramatized. The music was ridiculously dramatic turning everything into a huge ordeal. No character development took place and there were some predictably bad characters as well as some pretty uninspired acting. The two added robots were stereotypical and fairly racist as they were the ones who carried the brunt of the immature humor. The reason I even give this a 3 star rating was that the graphics were immersive and the sound effects too. The reason ONLY three is because of the aforementioned, and because special effects cannot be a selling point for a movie. Sure they're cool to see, but I'd rather not have to deal with awful robot penis jokes (why do they even have a penis? or care of there existence...? but i wander...) and bad characters with generic, over-hyped, and unrealistic personalities. It was almost like watching an alternate universe where everyone is retarded.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Witlesswikies are back and more irritating than ever. Their behaviour is not that of a normal family dealing with a serious issue of national security, but rather escaped mental patients whose every utterance seems to be an attempt at humour. Megan Fox is an attractive girl. Too bad her character is written as a bi-polar sex doll. But maybe that's the kind of girl that would be attracted to a blithering idiot like Shia? I still don't get the robots, and why they do 75% of the things they do. I don't get how people can be in the Smithsonian one minute, and then crash out into a country airfield in the next.

Michael bay can't write black characters.Transformers is a film series derived from a cartoon and toy range. Despite this Michael Bay doesn't mind including words slang word for female genitalia in the dialogue, and featuring a hot lady cyborg (with a tail no less) trying to seduce the hero. Michael Bay does not have a sense of what is appropriate for his target audience.Michael Bay is very good at displaying all things military.

Infamous for his deliriously excessive action films, Bay tends to polarise audiences, with them either outrageously entertained or hit with fits of nausea and rage, and his latest robotic slugfest is no exception. Those repulsed by Bay's first Transformers will hardly be won over by its sequel, as Revenge of the Fallen feels less like a new narrative than an overblown retread of the first, with Bay's grandest ambition seemingly to be how much more of everything he can stuff into the template of the first film, as if assuming that more can only mean better. Predictably enough, it doesn't, as Bay's flagrant excesses go beyond guilty pleasure entertainment to simply being too much, capsizing the film through an overwhelming cascade of content, carnage, sound and CGI. It is clear by the film's most common defense, ""what would you expect from a Michael Bay movie with giant robots"" that it is hardly going to be award winning dramatic material, but when such a defense is repeated ad nauseum with no other redeeming factors stated that the quality is increasingly suspect. Indeed, Bay's film feels less like cinema than being strapped to a roller coaster upside down while being shot at - an all out, chaotic visceral assault on the senses which forgoes coherence past the usual action film lapses to a complete disregard for any sense whatsoever. The word at hand is gratuitous, as if blatantly pandering to the 13 year old boy in everyone (as his comical quantity of 'Megan Fox running in slow motion shots' prove testament to) while bathing in cliché and jettisoning any sort of story cohesion. Laughably underdeveloped characters come and go with no explanation, with far too much time devoted to inane comic relief sidekicks while leads have seemingly little purpose (for all the hype regarding Megatron's resurrection, he does alarmingly little once back, and titular primary villain The Fallen has a similarly elusive role). The plot is reduced to characters screaming or babbling nonsensical exposition, and logic is dropped to the point of there being a twenty minute sequence during the final battle where it is near impossible to gather any sense of what is going on, making for a surreal, alienated feeling rather than giddy enjoyment. All of which might normally be markers for a triumphant guilty pleasure were it not for the fact that the film is simply too much to even enjoy in a purely superficial way, coming across as maddening to the point of being boring. While Bay is clearly gunning for a movie 'experience', his film is far too long and obscenely self-indulgent, bulging at the seams with numerous sequences (particularly protagonist Sam Witwicky's early college scenes and the climactic battle scenes) needing not a judicious trimming as much as a vicious hacking. Obnoxiously loud and nasty, Bay's film lumbers all over the place too much to enjoy, feeling despite the frantic movement and noise, as if nothing is really happening. All the while, it would seem Bay somewhat loses track of his film's own mythology, offering not so much plot holes as chasms. Similarly, as ironic as it is to complain about such a film having too much complexity, the narrative is simply too frantic with too much going on to possibly follow, making the already nonsensical plot amplify to frenzied levels. Instead of even a shade of a story, Bay offers absurdly juvenile humour, as if sheepishly fishing for laughs to distract from the overwhelming stupidity. Suffice to say, humping dogs, robot testicles and a very out of place thong joke are hardly adequate substitutes for narrative. Even the jaw dropping special effects which propelled the first film feel somewhat stale, with many battles shown in jittery close ups preventing the viewer from fully drinking in the gloriously realised spectacle.Similarly, while one would be foolish to pursue such fare for the sake of quality acting, the collection of Bay's actors manage to be even worse this time around. Shia LaBeouf substitutes aspiring hip mumbling and whining for charisma as harried protagonist Witwicky, coming across as simply annoying and often utterly irrelevant to the plot. Similarly, Megan Fox is even more overtly reduced to eye candy than previously, with no characterisation apart from leering attempts at being cool or seductive. John Turturro at least operates under fewer delusions of seriousness than the last film, going wildly but amusingly over the top and having a lot more fun with his character. As such, it is up to a screeching Ramon Rodriguez to derail the film even further with an astonishingly irritating and pointless attempt at comic relief, leaving the viewer continually praying he is at least granted a cathartic brutal death by Decepticon. While the return of Peter Cullen sonorous tones and Hugo Weaving's snarls as robotic rivals Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively are a high point, both of their characters are granted insufficient time to punctuate their deathly binary, making the emotional centre of the film feel even more imbalanced. While any sensible viewer would correctly expect the film to be cheesy, dumb and politically correct in every possible way, what surprises is the film's soulless lack of fun factor, with all components amplified to such garish levels that it transcends into a world of sensations, the viewer utterly overwhelmed by the cacophonous excess of spectacle being thrust in their face. Demented but hardly entertaining, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an entirely vacuous spectacle, rendered nearly redundant by its predecessor, and making it only worth viewing for those desperately craving vastly more of the same. -3/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

While that's not a great feat to accomplish, it can be mentioned that just a few short years ago he made Pearl Harbor, so he's definitely come a long way.I am shocked, to say the least, with all the negative feedback that has come from so many people who've seen this movie. It F*ckin' rocked! It was everything you'd expect from a Michael Bay film and then some surprises. I find it baffling that so many people walked into the theater expecting anything more than a Michael Bay movie. There's a reason it's a summer blockbuster! It's supposed to be loud! It's supposed to have no plot! Did anyone watch Transformers from back in the day?: Lots of pretty lights, explosions, strung together by a micro- plot. Robots are supposed to be loud! They're freakin' robots! They're made of moving parts that clank and explosives that go boom.There's a reason Good Will Hunting didn't have Transformers in it, and that's because you'd be dumb if you thought Transformers was anything other than loud explosions, lots of visual effects and modern slang to appeal to 13 year-old, ADHD-riddled boys - its target audience. If you can't appreciate this movie, then you obviously didn't like the original Transformers cartoon or the comics, and should therefore not watch a movie you won't like just so you can complain. Apparently many people forgot that Robots were loud and exploded when being hit with explosives (exploded from explosives being shot into their circuitry? who could've seen that coming?) and they needed Transformers to remind them that Robots don't sip tea and recite poetry. They are programmed to kick A$$. That's what they do. They don't need to be pretty about it.It's a summer movie. It's about Robots with explosives. Quit acting like you are shocked and horrified to find out that a movie about robots fighting has... robots fighting in it. Grow up. Watch The English Patient if you want to watch a movie about Robots not Exploding, obviously that's what you meant to see in the first place if you came to a Michael Bay movie expecting to see a Orson Welles film.(p.s.: Orson Welles was in Transformers back in '85 too. Apparently he understood that a good movie can also have explosions in it. What a crazy concept.)Transformers 2 ruled. Quit being pretentious. The end.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first Transformers movie relied upon a time tested formula for the action movie genre: Action, sexy women, hot sound track and light hearted comedic moments.This time around follows the same basic formula however this time it just doesn't come together with the same result. I think the main let down lies in the story which sees Shia LeBoeuf return as Sam - still the socially ackward teenager this time starting college - but on the way absorbing knowledge about the location of a second Transformers energy source. Megatron is revived (remarkably easily) and the race is on once again.The plot line has so many holes in it as to be considered swiss cheese. Introduction of new characters fails entirely by making the new characters incredibly annoying (Autobot twins); and favourite old characters are not given enough screen time to be considered important.There isn't much positive about this film - even the ever lovely Megan Fox cant do much with her role. The action scenes are even faster paced than the original making them at times hard to follow.I understand that a Transformers 3 has been inked. Lets hope they can focus more on the story and characters than on cheap thrills and low brow humour. The cinema going public just expect more nowadays!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Granted the movies aren't left on cliff-hangers like the lord of the rings they are left on cliff-hangers by the fact that the war between the two cybertronian factions have yet to be reconciled.

If you are a little kid to a teenager, you will probably like this movie for all it is worth. I was just really upset with the whole thing because I was expecting something cool like the first movie.

It was filled with massive explosions and ferocious battle scenes which left you on the edge of your seat squealing like a 3 year old.The humor was not hit in miss in this film, and the robots were genuinely funny (especially the Twins). The points of comic relief were genius and I have to say gave the movie nice vivacity.The score was the second best part of this movie. In the background of the action scenes I could hear music such as Linkin Park's New Divide and Nickelback's burn it to the ground. It vexed me slightly that some of the songs were greatly edited (for short bursts of music), but all in all the songs they used were wonderful and fit the movie.The most amazing part of the movie were the special effects. The explosions were on a scale never before seen and made you nearly jump from your seat. The humongous transformations that each robot did was absolute eye candy. The only bad camera use was when the tried to make a shot epic by circling around the actor a few times. That was dumb, but a minor flaw in comparison with the awesomeness of the movie.Megan Fox was as usual stunningly gorgeous. Her acting doesn't bother me, but a lot of people criticize her. Realistically she is Sam's hot sidekick. So she really doesn't need to act, just be hot. Personally I think her acting is satisfactory to add to the epic aspect of this movie.The rest of the cast also did an excellent job acting. They were spectacular. No moments of cheesiness, like in many other movies.This is without a doubt one of the top ten movies ever made.You have to see this movie!","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

It didn't disappoint.More robots, more action, humour and tension gave the film emotion and allowed you to almost believe it was real.Sam and Bumblebee's relationship was developed and the plot line between Sam and Optimus showed a softer side to these huge robots.The screening I viewed had an audience made up mostly of children (some who were possibly under 5) so some of the language made me a little uncomfortable but the action sequences allowed for the comments to be lost as quickly as they came.The introduction of the Twins, Skids and Mudflap, were a welcome release from the tension of the overall story and very much appealed to the children in the audience.The film is rated a 12A in the UK and whilst I agree with this rating I would suggest you think hard about taking an under 5 year old. Whilst they love the toys, and probably have watched the first film on DVD there were some scenes that were very loud, very explosive and could scare a younger viewer.Having said that I loved the film, the special effects were amazing and I was at a loss to try and remind myself that the robots weren't real. The action was compelling and the story line was easy to follow. Given that children will be watching this film I felt that scenes where people were hurt or killed were superbly handled and therefore you felt genuine empathy for the outcome of the Sam/Optimus plot.By far for me Revenge of the Fallen is the best family action film of 2009, as long as your family isn't too young!","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

It was just special effects with machines fighting and the humans were after thoughts, just shown running through smoke and explosions. Megan Fox has nothing to do and it's good she won't be wasting her time in the third film. The parts I can say were good were in the beginning with Sam's parents, both at the house and when they go to his college. The soldiers brought back were pointless and the FBI agent is back. He's a butcher with a web site about aliens. And somehow this old robot transports them to Egypt???

The Transformers movie was basically a set up for the first sequels. Here we get another CGI bombastic fest by Michael Bay.Set 2 years after the first Transformers film, a multi-national military team, NEST has been created and with the Autobots hunt down Decepticons. After a mission in Shanghai Demolishor warns that the Fallen was coming to Earth. In America Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is preparing to go to an East Coast University. Which packing he finds a piece of the AllSpark and by touching it he starts to have images in his head. At the University the sexy Alice (Isabel Lucas) is attached to Sam, who is still loyal to Michaella (Megan Fox). Unknown to Sam, Alice is a Decepticon spy.In the Decepticon camp, they plan to get the reminding bit of the AllSpark and use it to resurrect Megatron. By doing this Megatron serves the Fallen who a plan to make more followers by stealing the energy of the Sun and thereby killing Earth. After the Decepticons make their present known on Earth and demand that the people of Earth give up Sam. Sam and Michaella become fugitives and with the help of the Autobots set out to save the world once again.Let's start with the good aspects (or what there are of them) of the film. First the CGI and action is of a high standard and they are fine action sequences, especially with everyone's favourite Transformer, Optimus Prime in the forest. Michael Bay has a flair for this type of film and he also uses less shaky cam then in the previous film. I also enjoy the military aspect of the film and the film should have shown more of this. There are also some fan favourite put into the film, like Soundwave and Ravage. The Fallen is a good villain and Megatron and Starscream have bigger roles, and it is good to see their rivalry on screen. Plus Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas are hot.Now the bad: the film is way too long. Many of the scenes with Sam, Michaella and Sam's parents were not needed and dragged the film out. The audience don't really care, all we want to see is robots beating the hell out of each other. The story is paper thin and their should have been more effort in the script. The attempts at comedy were poor and the creations of the characters Mudflap and Skip is the worst in the world. They have been criticised for being racist stereotypes (which they are), but the main problem was they are really, REALLY annoying and I was rousing for the Decepticons to kill them. They attempts at comedy was terrible and they were on the screen for way to long; the fans care about characters like Optimus, Bumblebee, Ratchet and Ironside, not the crappy Twins. The film also has a number of plot holes: one great example is that in Transformers Las Vegas was a battleground for giant robots and the American military, and yet the filmmakers expert us to believe the American government was able to cover it up?The filmmakers should have accepted Transformers for what it was, robots fighting each other, and just made it a fun 2 hour action film. At least the first film had some heart in it.A poor blockbuster.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is the perfect film if you just want to shut off your brain and just enjoy massive explosions, huge robots fighting and amazing visual effects.The visual effects were just absolutely stunning! The amount of work that must have gone into creating the fight sequences must have been immense, but they did an excellent job (the transformation of Devastator was a definite highlight!)For me, the comedy element was a bit too much, however it did provide a few good jokes here and there. It's always good to have humour in films like this, but this was mainly very slapstick and annoying at times (Sam's mother and those ridiculous twin robots for instance!). The plot seemed quite ludicrous, but hey, it is an alien robot film (and a Michael Bay film).It's a very typical Bay film, with vast amounts of action, cheesy comedy, dramatic camera techniques and intense music, but ticks all the box of what a summer blockbuster should be.

The film seemed to actually hold some promise that Bay was able to tell a story that could allow the audiences to maybe 'care' moreso for the people who generally came and went with the same rapid-fire emotion of a television commercial.""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" was touted as being bigger and badder than the first film (though almost all sequels try to outdo their predecessor). However, it feels moreso like a Transformer who keeps melding with more and more Transformers, until it's so large, that it can't function properly.Bay's visuals and storytelling aesthetics that seemed to have grown slightly in the first film have been severely limited as he tries to weave a story involving Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) trying to grow up, as well as come to terms with his relationship with Mikaela(Megan Fox). This is also further intertwined with a Decepticon-destroying branch of the Army working in conjunction with the Autobots, as well as a plotpoint that tries to bring some deeper information regarding Transformers lore to the big-screen.With so much going on, even some of the Autobots that many had grown to like in the first film are severely underused, such as Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Front and center for much of the 'Autobot screen-time' are a couple of jive-talking bumblers named Skids and Mudflap. Bay has claimed that he developed them for humorous purposes, but very little of what passes from their lips is humorous, instead seeming annoying(if there's anything positive about them, it's that they have slightly less voice-time than Jar-Jar Binks in 'Episode 1').In the end, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" comes off as being summer eye-candy, as your brain rushes to absorb myriad plotpoints, people talking incredibly fast, disorienting camera moves, and humorous word and sight gags that would make any 10-year-old boy burst into laughter, but cause most of those who are older to cock an eyebrow.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I wonder if the critics who have appointed themselves the geru's of the movie industry, if they have truly forgotten what they review movies for. Movies are about entertainment, if that has changed then I need to give up my DVD collection. We have Drama's, Suspense, Comedies and then we have Action to name a few. Maybe I am just a low maintenance guy who has the sense God gave a coaster, or maybe I am just a person who wants to go to a movie that entertains me on a very simple level, be it I laugh, or cry or there are plenty of explosions I want to be entertained. Transformers entertains and then some, I am a childhood fan of the cartoon series and I applaud the writers and director for adding some references from the cartoon series. The critics said it was loud, have you ever heard of a soft bomb, or soft mechanical robots fighting? The critics said there was no human element, I think the critics need to check their pulse. Movies are about entertainment on a simply level, you want action Transformers has it. Is it loud, do they fight in a big way, are there loads of things going on? Yes, yes, and yes and guess what... It's Entertaining.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

But, they are transforming robots from another planet. I believe that in itself is a plot hole. The CGI is pretty cool. I think it may have been better than first Transformers. The action is fun to watch, and I thought there was just enough story to keep you at least interested in what was going to happen next. Please people! Let's not over critique this movie.

"5","/10","Entertaining but dragged down by heavy flaws","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2089705/?ref_=tt_urv","Monotreme02","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3112639/?ref_=tt_urv","2 July 2009","I'll start with the pros: There's no denying it – the movie is irresistibly entertaining. Michael Bay has received much criticism throughout his career, but one thing that must be said is that the man knows how to shoot an action scene. And how to shoot a movie in general – his over-the-top, hyper-stylized style, featuring smooth camera moves, slow motion and lots of sunset photography is among the best and most satisfying in the action genre. The action set pieces featured are wildly entertaining and quite imaginative, and are shot and present exceptionally well, really highlighting and emphasize everything that is purely and totally cool about them. I mean, the film sets out to depict giant robots fighting other giant robots, large-scale action scenes, explosions, destruction and high octane, no-holds-barred action sequences – and it delivers completely on these promises. Many scenes in the film, especially the action-oriented ones, left me sitting with a huge, childish, gleeful grin across my face, and were just as exciting and thrilling and heart-pounding as I could have asked for and then some.Another element of the film that I really liked was the cast. Another example of a film personality getting perhaps more criticism than I think he deserves is Shia LaBeouf; I praised his performance in the first film a couple of years ago, applauding his irresistible and inherently natural charisma, screen presence and ability to superbly combine great comedic chops with more action-oriented feats and even likening him to a young Tom Hanks in terms of his fast-talking, highly energized, hilariously neurotic performance. Well this time around, LaBeouf matches and even surpasses his performance, augmenting the comedic elements with uproarious results while still managing to perfectly deliver the average-guy-turned-action-hero persona. Megan Fox hits her marks and plays her role as eye candy with expert professionalism, and the supporting cast members including John Turturro, Kevin Dunn and Julie White round out the comedic elements to mostly satisfying and quite funny results – although the movie would definitely have benefited greatly had Jonah Hill accepted the role of LaBeouf's college roommate/sidekick.And yet, the film is not without its flaws, and this time around, they are plentiful. After it ended, I realized what that familiar sensation I felt throughout the screening was – the film suffers from the same fundamental flaws as another high-profile sequel from a few years back, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. And it's no wonder when one notices that both films were written by similar screen writing duos. My assessment of the flaws of that 2006 release, especially in relation to its immensely entertaining and hugely satisfying predecessor, are effortlessly applicable to this sequel as well. It all starts with an inexplicable urge to multiply almost every conceivable element from the first film, without realizing that quantity is never preferable to quality. Wanting to outdo and improve upon the previous film in a series is an understandable and agreeable aspiration, but scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman must realize that this does not have to be achieved by bombarding audiences with burgeoned elements from the first film. So sure, some of these multiplications are acceptable: more robots, bigger action scenes, and longer runtime are by no means bad for the film in this case. But what suffers most from the ""quantity over quality"" mindset is the plot. Both the first Transformers and to a slightly lesser degree the first Pirates of the Caribbean films benefited from ambitious but relatively straightforward plots, while both sequels suffer from heavily saturated, over-detailed and totally convoluted multiple plot lines that, quite frankly, feel like they were made up as the filmmakers went along. Couple that with some truly dismal lines, some of which derive from the unnecessarily labyrinthine complexity of the plot (such as John Turturro's character exclaiming to himself as he climbs the pyramid, ""That machine will destroy the sun if they turn it on. Not on my watch!"" just because by this point audiences are so lost in the plot that they've forgotten what the machine is even there for and why everyone wants to get to it) and some distractingly glaring geographical and continuity errors (the pyramids at Giza and the palace façade at Petra, Jordan are actually hundreds of miles apart, and not adjacent as presented in the movie) and you get a script that ultimately drags the film very heavily down. And the dues ex machine near the end would drive screenplay gurus to suicide.The first Transformers movie was extraordinary stupid: and yet, it so completely succeeded in its admitted aspiration to be a purely, completely enjoyable spectacle and entertainment that delivers everything it promises in terms of robot action and fantastic set pieces while never taking itself seriously, that its ridiculous plot and silly, campy elements were easily ignored and perhaps even complemented it. The plot of Revenge of the Fallen is beyond stupid, but the difference is that while in the first film the brainless plot is ignorable, in the sequel it's actually quite distracting. All these elements are easily comparable to the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and similarly, both franchises took something of a fall in their second films. Like Dead Man's Chest, I felt that Revenge of the Fallen suffered from an overly dense and extremely convoluted plot which not only damaged the quality of the film, but more importantly, failed to retain the novelty, the magical sense of wonder and discovery that the first films in these franchises benefited from so wonderfully. So while this sequel was still immensely and unquestionably entertaining, I still feel that much of what made the first film so utterly enjoyable was lost. And considering the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise's track record, I'm not particularly optimistic about the inevitable third Transformers film to come.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"3","/10","What could have been a good film ruined by Bay's totally incompetence .","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2088883/?ref_=tt_urv","Fenris Fil","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1157510/?ref_=tt_urv","30 June 2009","I was totally addicted to Transformers as a kid and I really wanted to like this, but instead the film just upset me at how wrong so much of it was. If only this was directed by someone with actual talent it could have been the most awesome blockbuster ever. But Michael Bay is frankly an incompetent hack with virtually no respect for his own source material.Of the many things wrong: * The film was still dominated by the human sub-stories and excessive comedy relief moments that mostly fell flat. The one comedy moment that actually made me giggle involved the ""Wheelie"" character, which I won't ruin by giving detail on. Almost all of the comedy was juvenile (including the bit I found funny).* Bay constantly spins the camera round and round during ""dramatic"" talking scenes. That stuff is what people that don't know how to build tension do to fill in for their lack of actual skill. It just makes me dizzy and want to vomit.* The Power balance seemed all wrong in this movie. The deceptions pretty much seem to be complete pussies and the big scary ""ohhhhhh how can we beat him"" Megatron from the previous film has been replaced by a wimpy lackey Megatron that needs help to fight Optimum Prime (who he soundly pummelled in the first film). Even the weaker autobots seemed to be kicking butt while the decepticons seemed to drop like flies.* The focus for both Autobots and Decepticons seemed to be mostly on the comedy relief bots. Megatron and Starscream had some good moments between them and Optimus was cool as always, but it seemed the other decent characters were pushed so far into the background they were just miscellaneous background fodder. I really don't care that much for a non-talking Bumblebee (that's Wreck-Gar's gimmick anyway) and the ghetto twins (who seemed like superimposed cartoons half the time). Plus there just seemed to be way too many of them to really do any justice (especially the decepticons).* I really didn't have a frigging clue what was going on at the end with the action. I'm sure I saw the same deception die about 25 times. Most of them look and sound so similar and the action was so all over the place (and of course not really focused on the robots) that I just found myself baffled as to who was fighting who half the time.* The whole idea of using the Fallen just overshadowed the rest of the decepticons, especially Megatron. I remember in the animated Transformers movie, Megatron/Galvatron always planned to betray Unicron. He answers to no one, at least not willingly. If that version treated the enormous planet eater like that, I find it hard to accept the movie version so willingly serving the Fallen. Not the the Fallen is actually used much as a character, he just seems to be there to make the rest of the deceptions look like Tools.On the positive side I like the use of Soundwave and Starscream in this and the way they worked Jetfire into it. Overall there was a good film in there but there was a couple of really bad ones mixed up with it. A few bits I enjoyed, a few bits puzzled me, a few bits made me want to cry they were so wrong, but most of it I just found boring.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Although the movie had some faults, I did enjoy it. I think the movie could have been about 20-30 minutes shorter. The last scene was far too long. The dialogue of the Skids and Mudflap could have been more enjoyable without the potty talk. I do not mind them (Skids and Mudflap) acting smarter than they actually are, but the potty talk was annoying. The biggest flaw of this movie is that Michael Bay has tried to introduce too much over a short period of time. Anyone who is familiar with Transformers knows that there are over 300 different robots. I think Michael Bay probably feels pressure to introduce as many favorites as he can, but this leaves us with characters who appear for one or two scenes and never develop. The good things about the movie include the fact that Megatron is back (only giving him 20 minutes in the first film was not enough), getting to see more of the robots (a big improvement over the 2007 film), less product placement (it is there, it just doesn't seem as common) and despite what people say about no plot, there is a plot and story. Sure there are mistakes, but the film should entertain long-time fans.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

It is non-stop eye candy from beginning to end, and every CGI sequence is gorgeous! ILM has truthfully outdone themselves this time.Another point I would like to make is the public's outlook on the story. Hopefully, everyone was watching the same film as I was because this movie has a step-by-step plot. It's not Oscar material, but what summer blockbuster is? Not even the well-reviewed and fan-adored ""Dark Knight"" received a nomination for best picture, and this is no exception! It is pure summer entertainmentI'd like every fan of the original 80's cartoon to watch episodes of that show, then compare it to this movie.There is no comparison... Michael Bay and his team have turned a seemingly ""stupid"" TV series into a full-fledged, action-packed, head-throbbing experience that keeps you wanting more action after every robotic punch thrown!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I don't recognize at all the series and one movie I fell in love with back in the 80s. Lame decepticons, even more lame autobots, story is awful, the acting is even worse. The only thing which is partly OK is the score, which sometimes drives the action more forward than everything else on the screen put together. I'll just leave it at that.

My older brother did and I was able to watch the cartoon somewhat when I was little, but it was not enough to make me a huge fan. Enough to make me like it, but that's about it. When I saw the first Transformers, I was impressed. Yes, the robots played second fiddle to the human characters, but the movie had a plot to follow. The humor was there but not in your face and the comic-relief characters were actually funny. Now, the 'fanboys' of the Transformers cartoon had a tendency to hate the movie because there weren't enough Transformers and said they wanted more of them.Well, they got their wish.""Revenge of the Fallen"" definitely has more robots than the first one. Where they came from is briefly explained before it is dropped, however, and unless you were a die-hard fan of the cartoon, you wouldn't know who these new characters were because the audience is never completely introduced to them! My brother had to tell me the names of most of them. Not only are they not introduced, but, except for a handful of them, they only get a short time on screen. The Autobots from the first film, except for Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, only appear briefly, if at all. The new Autobot Twins fall short of doing their job. I'm sure they were meant for the kids and for comic-relief, but they were just annoying, even to me and I have a high tolerance for annoying characters (I actually did not mind Jar Jar in Star Wars, to give you an idea.) They served no purpose to the plot whatsoever. They were fine when they were introduced in the beginning fight, but they never left. They just tagged along with the protagonists and were pretty much ignored by everyone. Wheelie, a small Decepticon with a smart ass attitude, wasn't really annoying, especially compared to the Twins. He would have been good for comic-relief and he actually has a role in the film. Not a large one, but he does do something for the plot.Speaking of plot, this movie has a poor excuse for one. It's there, but it's difficult to follow. The first thirty to forty-five minutes or so was decent. It was a nice setup and connected well to the first film. But once the conflict was introduced, everything became chaotic. The romance is not engaging at all as any issue Sam and Mikaela have to deal with is solved within a scene or two. Issues and characters are dropped with no explanation as soon as they have no importance to the plot anymore, while characters like Leo stay in the entire movie yet contributes nothing to the film. The plot builds up sloppily and the ending is anti-climatic. They obviously wanted to wrap up the plot completely at the end and they are obviously setting up for a sequel. The anti-climatic ending could've been fixed, I feel, if Micheal Bay would have left some plot points, what few there were, open to conclude in the next film, similar to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."" It wouldn't have save the messy and weak plot, but it might have made the ending less of a disappointment.One thing that bothered me more than the lack of plot was the excessive amount of swearing and sexual humor. If the first film would've been similar, this wouldn't bother me. But because the first film had only a handful of scenes dealing with swearing and sexual humor, it comes off as very immature in this film. No, this is not a kids film, but considering its popularity with children, you'd think Micheal Bay would've toned such things down, not jack it up. It adds a very tacky dimension to the film.There are a few redeeming qualities. Visually the film is wonderful. The robots are just as impressive as the first film and the fight scenes are just as epic. The music was good. Those who wished for more robots than humans got it. There are many nods to the cartoons which fans will appreciate. The acting isn't horrible, in fact it's pretty good, even though the characters are flat.Overall, this is what I expected the first film to be like. I'm sure many people did and when we all saw the first film, we were blown away at how surprisingly complex it was for a film based on toys and an 80s cartoon. This film, however, is no where near that impressive. Is it worth seeing? Sure, especially if you're a Transformers fan, but don't waste your time and money to go to a theater to see it. Wait for it to come out on DVD and buy it then or rent it. It's nothing amazing, but it's not the worst movie out there. It's a good movie to watch on a rainy day, but not one to see over and over.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Having a couple of flaws in the script, having 99% action and 1% storyline, I felt the movie could have used a couple of extra minutes, dedicated to maybe creating an enjoyable atmosphere, like some more high-school life, some friends, you know...The second movie, unlike what some of my friends said, had the perfect length (personally, I hate movies that last 90 minutes or less) great action and a decent storyline (again, it was acceptable, but I didn't go watch the movie for the storyline... if I wanted that I'd have gone to see a psychological movie or something) and I really had a great time watching the 5-10% storyline and 90% action in this 2.5hr movie.If you haven't watched it, when you do, make sure you're ready for science fiction and a lot of robot related action. It's what the movie is about! If you're not ready for that, don't watch it (a lot of people are actually putting up bad comments, because they were expecting realistic stuff. It's not realistic, but sci-fi, nor is it a detective movie where you have to pay attention to the storyline, but it was never meant to be that and it's absolutely awesome as it is).

Is it the very poor dialogue, the lack of character building, the terrible plot that had more holes than I can possibly list here, or the fact that they somehow managed to string it out for nearly 2.5 hours? I'll pick on one aspect, to illustrate how poor this movie is in every regard: the complete lack of research that went into the film. Somehow our lead characters, who lacked any kind of depth whatsoever and are therefore completely interchangeable, so I won't bother using their character names, travelled through Egypt extensively, somehow managing to drive from the Pyramids of Giza (in Egypt) to Petra (in Jordan) and back again in an afternoon; then when back at the Pyramids of Giza, they popped to Karnak in the south of Egypt for five minutes before returning to the Pyramids again a frame later. Egypt,according to Michael Bay, is about ten kilometres wide.As for the pyramids themselves, how you are able to see Khafre's pyramid in the background, when the lead character is supposed to be on Khafre's pyramid at the time, is completely beyond me.How Michael Bay thought he could get away with using Egypt as a setting for at least a third of the film, without bothering to actually go there and see what it looked like, is completely beyond me. But get away with it he did, apparently.**** UPDATE: Since writing this, I have discovered that not only did Michael Bay film in Egypt, but the Director of the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities was instrumental in making it possible. Very few American movies get to film on set in Egypt. I can only hope that this shows what is really important to Zahi Hawass, given the eventual treatment of the Pyramids in this film: In Egypt, the almighty dollar rules supreme. ****This is a kid's movie, made for older men simply because of the gratuitous flaunting of the female lead's body throughout.In summary: if you still own Transformers toys, you'll love this. If you have anything better to do for 2.5 hours of your life, you should avoid this.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie starts off similar to the first one; we see a glimpse of past events involving the Autobots and Decepticons. We are then sent to modern day and we learn about the new team involving humans from the first film (and new ones obviously) and the Autobots. Here we are introduced to the following, new, Autobots: the twins (I hated the twins for the first part of the movie but they slowly grew on me), an ice cream truck (I think it was Arcee but I'm not sure) and sideswipe. Sideswipe makes a great entrance. After this mini action scene, which was done well, we begin to learn more about the fallen and the Decepticons plan this time. The next 30-45 minutes about all involves Sam leaving home for college and all that. There is only one or two decent action scenes in this part of the movie and 3 or 4 mini scenes total. Then the fun begins. After this lame 45 minutes or so we are transported to the forest area you may recognize from the trailers for an awesome fight scene. Then after this fight we get a whole lot of Michael Bay trying to expand on this movie's plot. Besides a few moments where we go between Cybertron and Earth not a whole lot goes on. There is no real action for a long chunk of time. The final 20-30 minutes, about, however were great! You may have seen the Egypt battle in the trailers well this is it! It's finally here and delivers, unfortunately it does not make up for the other flaws. The script writers need to be FIRED before the third movie. The dialogue between the twins at times was beyond awful and at times the twins seemed more interested in fighting each other, than protecting Sam. The soldiers in this movie need to learn exactly how soldiers act especially Lennox. Also Starscream is not a little pussy so don't try to make him one. Shia LaBeouf's acting was not bad at all and Megan Fox shockingly proved to me that she may actually be developing some talent. Simmons also provided a few good moments and I am happy to see they brought him back. Sam's parents also offered good moments in this film like they did in the last one. Bumblebee was shockingly powerful and a total badass! (For someone who is supposed to be a scout he sure acted like more than that) Will I see this movie again yes; however I highly doubt I will be going to see it a second time in theaters. I still have yet to decide if this movie was better than the first one and I will need to see it again before I can fully decide. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a solid summer film that will be enjoyed by some but it is not the biggest movie of the summer. Star Trek and Terminator Salvation were both better than this movie. While certain action scenes were great they do not make up for all the other flaws listed above and others I did not mention because they involve spoilers.

However, I do use this site when choosing to see a movie. Therefore, from reading the many comments on this movie, I knew there was some off-color humor in the movie. While I'm an adult and can easily get past such humor and still appreciate a decent action movie, what really bothers me about this both Transformers movies is the audience that will inevitably be drawn to see these films. Transformers is a movie produced by Hasbro.Hasbro is a toy company known mostly for making action figures. This means young boys will flock to see their favorite action figures fighting it out on the big screen. I grew up in the Transformer craze. I remember the cartoon series and the movies released in the 80s. Those did not need over-the-top sexually perverted humor. These newer movies would stand just fine without jokes and gags that involve a mother announcing her son has popped his cherry, a girl inadvertently being thrown face-down onto another man's crotch, a leg-humping ankle-biter robot, a dorm-room seduction, and on and on.Friends of mine have a seven-year old son that just adores the Transformer movies. Should these movies put his parents in position to have to explain some of the things shown in these movies? Would you want your son repeating any of these things to their 2nd-grade teachers? Having such scenes in this movie detract from it...and for what reason? To get a cheap laugh to break up an intense action scene. Come on Hollywood, take a moment to consider your audience for such movies.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

A graduation celebration. A few of my friends, and myself, bought tickets to see it midnight, opening night in IMAX. And it sucked. I honestly felt like crying. $15 bucks each. I was expecting it to be as good as the first. Well, that's not entirely true. I read some reviews of it, and let's just say I had a bad feeling walking into the theatre. But, I figured I'd give it a chance. Large groups of people have been known to be wrong before. Just look at religion. But no. They were all right. It was a bad, bad movie. It felt as if the plot was something they added on after making most of the movie. Sure, it had awesome fight sequences. Sure, Optimus Prime is a god. But everything that made the first a great movie (other than what I just mentioned) was missing. You don't relate to the characters at all, instead you get to see two , small, yappy-type boy dogs humping, as well as a small transformer humping Megan Fox's leg. And let's not forget the giant, robot testicles, eh? They spent more time on cheap, retarded gimmicks for cheap laughs than they did on character development and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, the robots were humping awesome. Jetfire was my personal favorite, and I loved Alice, but that's about it. I haven't really watched any Michael Bay movies, but this seems to be a perfect representation of what everybody says about them. Two-dimensional eye-candy. Also, I haven't watched the show, so I don't know if this actually happens, but Optimus Prime really should not be doing Arnold Schwarzenegger-like one-liners. It just makes it even crappier.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I have to say, the trailer to this movie was better then the actual movie. The plot was WAY drawn out and the main Transformers weren't even in the freakin' film.I couldn't believe it. The main characters were replaced with trash talking twins. It was super annoying and HUGE disappointment. I know that the premise of the film was supposed to be about the Decepticons, but if they're battling the Autobots, then shouldn't the Autobots be in the film? The director and the writers of this film should slap themselves in the face. After the movie was over, I looked at my significant other and said ""I want my 2 and half hours back."" I only wish that I could have gotten a refund on my ticket. It makes me sad that I contributed money to such a horrible film. I guess it wouldn't be the first or last time I do that. I'm sure there are many more horrible films to come.Let's just hope I'm smarter next time to spot them before paying 6.50 to see it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The plot basically stays constant throughout the film, metal-men fighting, explosions, followed by colourful and shiny things in an attempt to distract the audience from it's obvious flaws.The acting was sub-par, basically saying that it is going to be a bit below what you are expecting. Before viewing this film, I wasn't expecting good acting quality, and the film was spot-on with my predictions. Overall, don't expect much.The script was very dull. Most of the dialogue was filled with an attempt to make either a inspirational speech, or an attempt to make a touching moment between characters. The dialogue was trying too hard to become a film with a very inspiring plot, but didn't come close to it. The plot was very basic, and had no defining part of interest. It seemed pretty straight-forward, and had no changing point to make the audience go in awe/shock. Possibly one of the worst parts was the humour. Usually, mature humour in films is worth a great laugh, but this film goes far and beyond respectable. Some jokes are down-right sad. The soundtrack was absolutely horrible. I personally believe that if a song is going to be used in a film, it should only be used once. A song loses meaning if it is played multiple times, and sometimes for no reason at all. Whatever happened to orchestral music that usually accompanies fight scenes? That is probably the one feature that connects the film with the audience. It gives it that much more feel, and makes a much better film.Overall, it was a status-quo Michael Bay film. Not much to expect, and definitely not much to follow.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This second film I had to get up and leave. Whoever green lights the crude humor should think again, maybe you might squeak out another $100 Million from parents who would have let their kids watch the film apart from the needless sick humor, like the transformer humping on Megan Fox's leg to mention a few. I'm not talking about kids under 13. This humor should be for young adults. I will not let my family see the next film. And I will be very careful from now on when I watch a Dreamworks flick. Michael Bay is a great director and I am not slamming his work. Also, hats off to the great animators, composer and FX people. No hats off for the executives behind this film, they are the ones who seem to wreck what could be a great film.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first Transformers movie was excellent, pure escapist entertainment. How could they have messed it up for the second part? Well I've finally gone to see this film, and I understand the reviews now.There is a lot happening in this movie, and one or two of the story sections lasted longer than 10 minutes, so by the time it finished, some reviewers may not have been able to remember how the scene started.If you're like me (and I'm 46 and remember the original incarnations) you'll enjoy this big screen live action offering.If you understand the folly of nitpicking a plot that includes alien robots trashing famous Earth landmarks, you'll like it too.One thing I will say further though, I've read comments criticizing releasing such a movie when people are being laid off and losing their homes etc. The original wave of Super Heroes (Superman, Batman etc) were born out of the Great Depression, because people will always want to sit down and believe in another world for a while.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

He can direct big CGI kaboom-boom, 60 foot tall CGI robots lumbering about, and CGI in general. So why is it his human actors seem incapable of delivering believable lines? And their relationships are forced and more fake than the CGI going on around them? What is it with the dumb sex jokes? This is a movie based on toys and a kids cartoon. It's like making a movie about the Smurfs and inserting human actors and live action scenes... and then adding some soft core porn and an avalanche of unfunny sex jokes.Spoilers... So many scenes in this movie are just eye-rolling, cringe-worthy, 'yeah right - whatever!' moments. Mr Bay has his female humans present themselves as nothing more than brain dead eye candy. Characters die and come back to life. All the standard action movie clichés are used and are ridden to death.An attempt is made to insert a plot, but it soon spirals out of control. Sam goes to college and his mother gets wasted on dope cake. Then he is subjected to a near robotic rape by a Decepticon/Terminatrix Fembot and his girlfriend just so happens to walk in on him at *exactly that moment*. She gets her leg humped by a little toy truck Decepticon. A robot farts. Another robot talks like a gangster, but with a lisp because its gold tooth is so huge. A joke is made about testicles. And another robot farts. Then we watch two male dogs humping. Twice. Another joke is made about testicles (robot ones this time!) This goes on an hour too long.

It got us to do what was intended, go see a movie with lots of action and neat special effects. Unfortunately, no one said it had to be good.I'm sure every other review write how wonderful the ""first"" Transformers was. It was. Even the trailers were exciting. This one seemed to have all the elements but missed the mark completely. It was like watching a bunch of scenes thrown together to make a film look like a beloved toy franchise.Another thing is I saw how little boys, seven to ten, were just lovin' this film while everyone else was looking at them as though they were nuts. They were not because this film, was totally designed for them: no story, lots of ""cool"" colorful robots on the screen. Except for the language. When I was 7 to ten, I don't think my parents would have like me hearing all the swear words that Dreamworks, Paramount, the Ratings board, etc. allowed in...and parents not quite getting what PG 13 ACTUALLY means. Was it because of the robots that were 'mouthing' them, that it was acceptable to these folks? If so, for shame. Of course 7 to 10 year old boys (and some older ones too) aren't going to get the implications of this, but many of the older people did and I must say that was TOTALLY uncalled for in a film franchise like this. It wasn't cute.Then there are the humans. Sorry, didn't care for the leads, and if you took every single one of them out...they would not have been missed. Only the Armies. The Armies made perfect sense, they should have stuck with them. Actually, it would have made a better story just with the Transformers and the armies. And I was upset that they introduced...ever so slightly...the Pretenders. Or were they the Pretenders, honestly I don't think the filmmakers were too keen on how to develop them. Ori and Bay were more concerned with making MAXIM cover shoots come to life, they missed a golden opportunity here.And yes, I am SO disappointed at the beginning...Sideways(?) didn't get enough time for me, as did not Devastator at the end. I know about the Constructors, but gee wiz, they just appeared on the screen, all willy nilly and all we had for most of this was visual effects. No story. Opportunity missed.I am so exhausted over this Transformers 2 hodgepodge, that I fully expect Spielberg to want to introduce the Dinobots in Transformers 3. Not a bad idea, just get another writer and director on it because I know it's itching under his thumb right now.So should you go out and see it? It's entertainment, but not the best of the 09 summer. It's mindless, and that's good. In IMAX it's fantastic, but don't expect academy award winning material her except for below the line - and that's the point. Got a few bucks to spare - watch. If not, please don't. And if you're waiting for the DVD, I know many parents WILL be disappointed over the unnecessary use of ribald language here.Dreamworks, Paramount, et al can pop open the champaign for a huge money making opening week and rightfully so, they got us to go out and take a look. Too bad, everything that is supposed to be success is based on how much money it made, because some of the better movies so far, didn't make a lot of money, but deserve a look too. And..two and a half hours was incredibly TOO long for this, even in IMAX.So I'll sit and anxiously wait for Transformers 3 - only because I know its comin'...but just a curiosity....hey is um...JJ Abrams and David Knoepp doin' anything....special....'bout now....???","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Night Shyamalan wouldn't have dreamed up). Everyone has already gone on ad nauseum about the twins, and justifiably so. I can't believe anyone tries to defend their presence in this movie. Along with the obnoxious roommate, they contribute virtually nothing except line after line of offensive dialogue. The second girl is brought in purely to put more sex in the movie. She could have-and SHOULD have-been cut out of the movie completely. The action sequences were good for the most part, but so chaotic you had no idea what was going on most of the time. I had the same issue with the first movie. Pretty much everything, in fact, that was wrong with the first movie was simply amplified and expanded in this one. The worst thing about this movie is that it is marketed straight at kids and it couldn't be less appropriate. And don't give me that ""It's PG-13, you should know better"" bull. When they are running ads on Disney and Nick and selling toys at Burger King, who do you think they are trying to get into the theater? AND the movie was way too long! If they had cut out all the vulgarity, most of the sex and at least some of the over-the-top violence it would have been the perfect running time and a much better movie.

I say that, because although the action scenes and special effects were pretty awesome, though maybe a little overdone, the acting, dialogue, plot, jokes, and just about everything else were just completely awful.

I'm sure there were some groans and sighs, too. I don't even want to know how many parents had to cover their kid's eyes and/or ears in some parts, or if they even bothered at all. In other words, this is not the family-friendly movie that it might appear to be. Keep in mind, this is coming from a Transformers fan. I really wanted to enjoy it, but just couldn't. Fortunately, I viewed this movie for free (someone else wasted their money on me), otherwise I would've been even more upset. I hope this review helps.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

MB has gone for the trend of recent of ""bang for the buck"", basically CGI/SFX over what made the series so accessible/relatable to myself as a ""80's"" kid. Don't get me wrong, the effects are amongst the best effects of very recent memory but its just not as good as the 1st ""Transformers"" movie in terms of plot development/character development.

The joy and wonder transmitted by these cartoons was unparalleled.When I knew Steven Spielberg was producing a Transformers movie I was excited. The Transfomers I movie was a success. It was fun, refreshing, the story was good. Good job! And thank you Steven for another jewel.I saw the Transformers 2 movie this weekend. I got bored at half of it (~2:30h long). Let me say in its defense that the special effects are impressive and of an incredible magnitude that makes your skin hair raise. In one word: electrifying.At some point the movie looses its interest. The dialogs become cheesy, the battles take too long or are too confusing. There are serious editing problems and way too many things happening. The story although interesting is not told in the right timing nor in the right way. The jokes are poor and are targeted mostly for young people (<16) Bottom line and Warning: Since the target audience for this movie seems to be the hip-hop generation, people of ages late 20's or 30's will have serious issues with this movie. If you can overcome that, you like special effects and you're big fan of the transformers I guess its still worth while spending 10 bucks to take your friend to the movie for a ride, although you'll be a bit tired in the end.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes, maybe some things could be left out, but overall it was very good. I am still trying to figure out the whole racist thing, but I never got that impression from the movie and I feel strongly that this was just a poor excuse to find something wrong with the way this movie was intended to be. There are more movies out there that have far worst racist remarks in them than this movie, but that comment would never be made about them.The action was great and in some cases I wish they had developed some of the ideas and concepts better...such as the ending....something new....no horizon shot scene like from the previous movie.Be your own judge of the movie....if you like it...you like it...if you do not...you do not. There is more to this movie than meets the eye...as it was intended to....there are far worst movies out their that are being made, in theaters now, and out on DVD than this one.Last of all, no one ever complained about all the robots that appeared in the animated movie or cartoons, so what was so different about the so many robots being showed in this movie....absolutely no...it stuck with tradition and having scenes with multiple robots and tons of action...it was just better and louder than the originals...do not get me wrong....I love the classic G1 Transformer: The Movie...I give one piece of advice to Michael Bay...develop the robots more and give them more shape...I understand the newer concept, but it is time for Bumblebee to get his voice back and have a better and more developed face. Good luck to all you movie watchers....and have a great summer.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I admit I could be a little biased and these could be reasons and partly why it's my favorite, but like I said for the first film, it's a good story, great humor, amazing action scenes, incredible acting, and also some amazing scenery. Again, the legendary voice actor Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime along with legendary voice actor Frank Welker, mostly known for Megatron but this time voicing a few other decepticon characters. Once again composer Steve Jablonsky's film score is a masterpiece with some returning scores from the first film along with some new that are just as well composed!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Mainly, the plot. In the first movie, the plot, while a complete sci-fi, was at least gripping and made sense. In the second one, the plot fell into the fairy tale like areas, with secrets, resurrections (3 of them, by my count), magic-like stuff under the guise of technology... bull. Complete and utter bull. And the resurrection at the end... was lame (yeah, that's what the Romans said. :-)). Seriously, even I could've found a better way to return Sam Witwicky.The acting was worse in this movie too. Megan Fox and Shia Labeouf were a lot more energetic, funny, and believable in the first movie. Now they aren't horrible, but they don't have that same spark anymore. The humor is a little strained, the terror and tragedies a little fake... a little worse, here and there. The rest of the acting was... eh. The only really bright spots I saw in this movie were John Turturro and the guy who voiced the old airplane-transformer (I don't remember the name in the movie, therefore can't find the actor.) The rest of the acting had no absolutely horrible spots, but no great ones either.Overall, the movie had some great spots (breaking into the museum, mommy on drugs) and some horrible ones (the aforementioned resurrection). But two things it had throughout and that was how it looked and it's energy. It is a non-stop adrenaline rush from beginning to end, and as for how it was made... it would blow you away even on a small screen. The film doesn't stop moving. There's always something being blown up, shot, hit, crushed, blown up again, etc.Should you watch it? Yes. It's worth it for the energy and the special effects. But if you do not watch it... well, you're not missing much. 5.2/10 I heard that there is a 3rd one coming out... don't know if I'm going to watch it.

Michael Bay and company seem to have found a way around that, and that is to not do any of these things.The plot of the first Transformers may not have been the best, but it worked for that movie while this movie manages to disregard the plot of original and goes off in a new direction resembling a retarded version of National Treasure mixed with War of the Worlds. It fails to be interesting or intelligent.Most of the major characters return, one noticeable loss is Jon Voight as the secretary of defense. although the characters seem oblivious to the events of the previous film this is not the main failing of the movie, it is the dialog. While the first movies dialog ranged from decent to good this movie stayed in Pearl Harbor territory almost the whole time with the only tolerable lines delivered by the main autobots and decepticons. Another problem is the inclusion of new autobots and decepticons there are so many thrown into this movie that you do not care or sometimes even notice when they meet their demise. However there are two new autobots Skids and Mudflap who you will notice because the movie forces you to. They both horribly annoying ethnic stereotypes that add nothing to the movie.The action in this movie is intense if not slightly confusing. While the action scenes in this movie are on par with the first movie they couldn't overcome the horrible story. Unlike the first movie in which the action builds up over time to thrilling climax. This one just has action throughout. While the action in it is good it never builds to a true climax.It seems Michael Bay pulled a Ghostbusters 2 on us, sure the movie has the same characters and subject matter but it is severely lacking in the areas where it counts.","2 out of 16 found this helpful.

Now the guys who will give the money for this are expecting a huge blockbuster which gives millions of $$, because Transformers 1 + 2 were such awesomely done flicks (in their head, maybe because of $$).Now get inside yourself for one minute and think about who will get the blame if Transformers 3 won't be such a huge success?So if you hate directing and want to look for another job, this is your chance.And yes, this is my way of expressing how shitty the movie was (compared to the possibilities).","2 out of 16 found this helpful.

But Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has achieved the unthinkable...a 150 minute long film that had a plot that was both too vague to really make out and which I just could not care enough about to follow anyway. How it managed to sustain my attention for this long without me falling asleep I can only attribute to having a vague memory of the major disappointment that was the live action original, which was basically a load of noise and effects that I was able to take in just for the big let down that it was as a huge fan of the animated show as a kid. But, it got the right publicity (if not the greatest reviews) and these kinds of films always tend to do well at the box office with this behind them. And so, action auteur Michael Bay has gone and delivered a sequel that copies the formula of the first film exactly...and inherets all the same problems. What I'm basically saying is, if you're the undemanding kind that loved the first one, you'll have a great time. If you thought it fell below average, it'll be the same flashy but empty experience. And God help you if you hated the first one...This sequel is every bit as soulless, empty and insincere as the first film, a good twenty minutes-to half an hour overlong to rub salt in the wounds. The writing, dialogue, story and acting (including Megan Fox delivering an appearance where her body and looks are clearly being sold more than her thesping) are all abysmal, and I think it would be hard even for an under twelve year old not to notice it at times. It's a none stop assault of great special effects and explosive action, culminating in a giant showdown at the Egyptian pyramids at the end that's technically amazing but just...all goes completely over your head. It'll do for a lot of movie goers nowadays but I'm glad I go for quality more than quantity. **","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is due to director Micheal Bay's very narrow-minded and uninspired take on film-making. He's a simpleton in his work, with emphasis being put on SIMPLE, and the result is repetition of the first film in remarkably weaker and boring form because if it can't set itself apart from its own predecessor, then it can forget coming off as different as all the other ugly clusterf***s of CGI and fire that maraud among the theaters of America. That on top of the human characters being less human than the Transformers themselves, and more full-on racial stereotypes (which the Transformers are as well) with no identity or personality, and only there to commit heinous acts of juvenile humor, everything is taken to a higher and more insufferable extreme than in the first thanks to Micheal Bay's dimwitted logic of ""bigger automatically equals better"". And as if it wasn't hard enough to sit through as it is, it's even more difficult to make it through because of its ridiculous length. At its core, It's the same helping you'd come to expect despite all the steroids it's on in this sequel. With Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers has proved that it is the testosterone-soaked immaturity counterpart to the Twilight series of films. Tweens will go crazy for brainless and shirtless romance with nothing to it, and teenage boys will go crazy for brainless action and explosions.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It tries to live up to the minor smarts the first film had, but it fails miserably because of it's over use of CGI and it's bad script and semi-interesting story. It fails to live up to the Transformers name or even the first film at that. All in all this film is a waste of 200 million dollar.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nothing short of a good idea gone bad, Michael Bay tries and fails to bring up the value of the sequel to his adequate adaption of the popular kids show and toy line. But there are three main reasons that it failed. 1.) It's dull, overlong and it doesn't follow any strict set of rules or even a coherent plot for that matter. 2.) It's terrible and bland acting on most part of the cast brings down the high production values of this film. But to no avail they don't succeed very well. 3.) It's just a plain, old good car with bad parts. All in all this film could have been so much better.Shia LaBeouf(Who was alright in the first but bad here.) Tries his best with the bad script and terrible direction on the part of Michael Bay. But he fails to bring any convincing emotion or even good jokes to his character. Megan Fox(who is amazing to look at.) is bad, her bland and inside the box performance is hard to watch sometimes you just want to look at her instead of hear her talk. John Turturro( A saving grace in this film.) Brings the good jokes and the good acting to this film and really makes it one reason to see it just for his time on screen. Josh Duhamel( Another ray of hope.) Does well in this and shows his stuff and makes this film easy to sit trough. But all in all the cast(most of them.) Does alright with there assigned parts and makes this a bad film instead of horrible.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is dumb fun, it uses flashy and stylish CGI rock'em sock'em robot fights, an alluring female lead and bad jokes to entertain. But it fails miserable in it's attempt to be good and plausible entertainment. It drags along for way too long and is very boring at times. But on the bright side it is great fun and a good thrill ride to enjoy. But nothing more. All in all it was a shallow attempt at making a franchise that has been around for more than 30 years and turns it into a bad film. All in all Revenge of the Fallen is an A-Bomb.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

To sum it up, it's basically a movie that is about an hour and a half too long, consisting of one loud fight scene with robots after another. The only purpose of the actors in this film is to run, scream, hide, oh and look good doing it (Megan Fox looks the best.) After about an hour of viewing, the plot is full of holes, and your brain becomes numb after the non stop action scenes. The humor (or lack there of) in the film, is mainly inappropriate e.g. the two robots that are obvious black stereotypes that can't read and the mother buying a pot brownies. I found it to be rather annoying. However, the special effects are in fact superb and the robots do look pretty darn cool, but they aren't enough to save the film. It seems like Michael Bey wanted to see just how much stuff he could blow up with the huge budget he was given. Overall, i was extremely disappointed and found myself saying, "" Thank God that's over,"" when the credits started to roll.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I swear i could have almost fallen asleep had it not been for the noisy clunking of metal parts every 2 seconds, and to make it worse it was a pretty long for an action movie these days.Sadly this really is a disgrace to everything that is Transformers, and despite having an OK start, it truly was a movie not worth watching.I would hope that next time they could bring us something that is more then just CGI action scenes cut and pasted together straight from the studios.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I've read that this movie has a lagging story, I believe it is very gripping story and I can't believe you can tell me that you weren't shocked when optimus Prime was killed.

The story was hardly brimming with development, so really for that to make sense it had to either have some good action scenes, some funny moments or some character development. It had none.Now, the action scenes are exactly what Transformers should be good at, and I must admit that first sequence actually got my hopes up in this department. It was flashy and it looked cool, but that was the only scene that did. After that, all the fights consisted of metal lumps clunking together, and if I wanted to see that I'd go home and hit to pieces of cutlery against each other for a few minutes.Funny moments. Well, they made attempts to do this, and I couldn't call them boring. Though I would say all their attempts at humour actively offended me. Not in a hurt-feelings way, but just because they were so bad. Some jokes just didn't make sense, like the 'swine flu' thing. Clearly that was thrown in at the last minute, and I just don't understand why.And then there's the twins. It's too easy to pick on them, when I've seen that even the most ardent defenders of this film sheepishly admit that they were a horrible, horrible part of the movie. It is very difficult to enjoy a film though, when you have those rolling hunks of half-baked sassy lines and clunky ""laugh-at-me"" delivery.The characters I didn't end up caring less about. None of them showed any personality. I couldn't really pick a strength or fault in any of their personas, because they don't have one. I'm struggling to think of anything to say about them because they're just so bland and predictable.For the most part, this film is just no interesting, and the only scenes that really pulled me out of a state of boredom were just there to really annoy me. I could go into great detail about the university lecture bit, but it would be pure pedantry on my part when it's just easier to say that this movie is awful.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The scenes in Egypt, Jordan and Washington are designed for people with zero knowledge of geography (if you have a minimum of knowledge you would be utterly confused).

I don't pretend to know everything, but I know a bit about films. I like 'intelligent' films like Pi, but know there has to be a flip side to cinema. I went in to this film with low expectations, but was well aware it wasn't supposed to be The Wrestler or Frost/Nixon.OK, let's be brief and frank and admit the first Transformers wasn't spectacular, but no one ever expected it to be. It seems to have done its job and made people happy. However, its sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, seems to be taking a beating.The film's plot in a nutshell follows Sam into college as he experiences hallucinations caused by a shard of the cube from the first film. Meanwhile, the Autobots have been working with a newly formed soldier group that are trying to get rid of the Decepticons from the planet. The main focus of the story is the Decepticons attempts to return to power and Sam and the Autobots attempts to stop that.Now, no one goes to these kind of films expecting Schindler's List. They are what they are; simple, good fun. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen succeeds in this area. It's more action packed, more amusing, better effects, better acting, and generally more fulfilling than the original. The main drawbacks to it would be its length, which you will definitely feel in the last act, and some of the humour being a bit too slapstick (the mum in the college, some of the Autobots interact with each other), but even with this, it can still be enjoyable (particularly with a good audience!).Imagine a film like Armageddon, a film you like, even though it might shame you slightly. You know how a lot of it is going to turn out, you know a lot of it is unbelievable, but that's popcorn for you. Let's remember that Michael Bay has pretty much defined action films. He brings a slickness and immediacy that would be otherwise missing. Sure, there could be more depth to the characters or more meaning given to a lot of things, but who goes to a film filled with giant robots for that? Ignore the critics (seems they're more focused on tearing films down and seeming sophisticated anyway). This film isn't going to change lives, but there's certainly worse ways to spend 160 minutes of your life. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is exactly what it is meant to be; entertaining.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Even the few attempts at humor left a sick feeling in my stomach. That the plot doesn't make sense might have been excused if the film were enjoyable.

In fact it is like being served a dish that has everything undesirable: Racial stereotypes (which are a plenty here), confusing fight scenes, incoherent plot with numerous plot holes and a surprising amount of foul language that serves no purpose to the story (if you can call it a story) and soulless depictions of females, sugar-coated to perfection with the IQ of a dinosaur; Michael Bay to be precise. True, the film sometimes has it's moments but it is completely sidetracked with the most inane and just sheer stupid actions especially with Sam's parents and then later on his roommates or should I say complete refuses of society. Megan Fox is nothing more than window dressing but what can you expect when her character has nothing to do but pose like a Playboy magazine photo shoot. As for the robots, Starscream, Megatron, and The Fallen get more lines of dialog but this film commits the same sin as the first one did. None of the new robots get any chance to develop. This is due to the fact that Bay assumes everyone saw the first film so therefore he felt he didn't need to develop any of the other robots aside from Optimus Prime and Megatron. The first film wasn't nothing special, it had it's charms but after repeated viewings it gets worn out real fast like a new pair of shoes. Wow, that's ten bucks and 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Save your money and buy the old animated series and the Beast War series. Those ancient cartoons can run circles around this piece of trash.Avoid at all costs.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

But the sequel A.K.A this movie, well I won't be that much excited to buy it, maybe on a bargain, but not at full price.The truth is, as most people are saying, there wasn't any logical story in the movie...but to my disbelief, some like it only on the ""Robot Action"" which was such a shame from the first one. The ""Robot Action"" here was so much animation obvious that the animation/graphics of the first one was even better.Second, the movie it self was so much of a waste of time and such a big headache. I mean, 2 HOURS AND 30 MINUTES....wtf? They should have at least dwindled an hour. But that just isn't the only mistake I'd bore you with and I won't bore you with others.But let me add that I only gave my rating for 3 reasons, which is the locations were superb, no comment there.

TRANSFORMERS REVENGE OF THE FALLEN perhaps throws up its own questions such as : since this film doesn't have a screenplay who should get the blame ? Certainly Michael Bay is one of the worst directors working in Hollywood today and fearful that he might get a screenplay every bit as bad as PEARL HARBOR he's decided to make a movie that doesn't in fact have a screenplay Instead he's got a bunch of children's toys and impossibly good looking actors and actresses and some cameramen and made a home movie during the fourth of July . How do I know the home movie was shot on the fourth of July ? By the amount of explosions of course . There's no credible way any media can feature so many explosions unless someone is filming endless shots of fire crackers in what must be the home movie with the highest aesthetic production values ever seen in home video","4 out of 58 found this helpful.

Previously, it was Highlander II: The Quickening and Stars Wars: The Phantom Menace, and now there is this.This is just painfully bad from the start up to twenty minutes until the end, which I can't comment on because I switched it off at that point. There's only so much torture I can take.One of the most puzzling things to me is who was this movie aimed at? The plot was moronic, contradictory, and had massive continuity errors. The alleged humour infantile in the extreme. And yet the movie had adult content, rendering it unsuitable for the eight-year-olds I'd expect to appreciate this best.Some of the special effects (which I'd hoped would be the movie's saving grace) were so awful they looked like they belonged in a video game.After Pearl Harbour, and this, I shall avoid anything directed by Michael Bay in the future for the sake of my mental well being.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

"5","/10","What if we leave and you're wrong?  Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2085484/?ref_=tt_urv","jaredmobarak","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2020154/?ref_=tt_urv","23 June 2009","My screening of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ended around 10:00pm. What do we see in the lobby as we exit the theatre? That's right, a line already forming for the midnight show, less than two hours away, the premiere timeslot to expose the world to the ancient Decepticon Fallen. Those kids were ready for a good time, hoping that the sequel lived up to the surprisingly effective first installment. If any of them had asked me as I walked by what I thought, I would have told them the truth  it's not that bad. In hindsight, I think I gave the original too high a rating with an 8/10. It did entertain and the computer graphics were impeccable, but too often did it have me shaking my head at the clumsy script and abundance of cheese. It was a crapshoot on what to expect with a sequel from maestro of destruction Michael Bay. All I knew for sure was that he'd bring more robots, more explosions, and more carnage, because, frankly, that's how he rolls.Let's put this phenomenon in perspective here. Not only are all local theatres playing a midnight show—yes, even the drive-in—but tomorrow's ""first day"" screenings begin at 10:00am. It's a Wednesday people. I understand it's the summer and most kids are off of school, but one can imagine how many people lining up in the morning are playing hooky from work too. This thing will be breaking the bank for sure, despite the early, mostly derisive, reviews. The people that will be pumping money into Hollywood's coffers aren't likely to be reading those critical analyses anyway. No, instead they are probably going to see it again. In all honesty, I don't blame them one bit. If I were a serious critic, looking at this thing in comparison with the great movies of all time, nitpicking every minute detail, I'd probably be hailing it as one of the worst motion pictures ever. But I am not, and I won't. Transformers 2 is a heck of a lot of fun and I can say with a straight face that, if you enjoyed the first, you will have a blast with the second.The movie brings what you'd expect from Bay—more of everything. There is a ton more action, mostly robot versus robot fighting, that intrigues immensely. I could have gone without the quips and stupid catchphrases as they throw each other, but that is a minor quibble. Even the comedic aspect is increased, and as someone who thought the first was too campy, this actually isn't a bad thing. The humor is shored up and more honed with less headshaking and more laughing. Even little inside jokes thrown in, like a Bad Boys II poster hanging in Sam's dorm room, sparks a chuckle. I was also beginning to think that John Turturro redeemed himself for a dismally weak performance in the first until they had to put him underneath a robot with two hanging metal orbs, to which he spoke over the radio, ""I'm beneath the robot scrotum"". It was a very poor error in judgment, but, of course, the audience ate it up, along with the twins Mudflap and Skids. I don't know what was more offensive, the ghetto-bots' blatant caricature boarding on racist or the fact that every time Tyrese Gibson was on screen he was saying ""that can't be good"".The true success here, however, is that the story revolves around the Transformers. If the first film was about Earth and humanity's discovery of this alien race, the sequel is about that race and what it is they are doing here. It is a time for them to prove themselves and show that the trust humanity has given is earned. As a result, we get a ton of computer-generated robotics to brilliant effect. The robots came to Earth to harvest its sun for energy, only to discover life, realizing they must find another sun because they will not destroy a civilization. Except that one Prime decided to stay and reap the power, forever being called Fallen, exiled by the other Primes and blocked from his takeover. That means the Harvester is buried, the matrix key guarded, and Fallen is in hiding awaiting a chance to return. Once Sam touches a remnant of the All-Spark, well, the map to destruction is embedded in his head and the search for Earth's survival is on. Yes, the mythology is convoluted, but if you buy into an alien race of robots coming to our world, well the plot will fall into place too.So, yeah, the faults of the first are shored up pretty well, but the story loses something in the process. For being over two hours, the end comes with the realization that not much had happened, leaving us with an Optimus Prime voice-over, making us wonder if we accidentally just watched the first film again. Who goes to a Michael Bay film for the strong story, though, right? You go for a good time, an escape from the challenges of our world to watch the little guy defeat an impossible foe and save the world. Bay is the master of escapism and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one more feather in his cap. You know what to expect and it will be delivered, so just sit back, relax, and enjoy a new adventure, much like the previous, but this time full of robotic goodness from front to back.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The action, acting and comedic timing were all perfect. Even the story was good. This is probably why Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen breaks my heart. The 5 stars I give this movie go ONLY towards the Autobots and Decepticons and their amazing fights and action sequences. The real problem with this movie is with the humans. Cut the humans out and you have a good action movie. What's wrong with the humans? Let me count the ways: 1.) Sam's parents (primarily his mother) are so damn annoying. I really was about to shut the movie off when they go to drop Sam off at college. 2.) Speaking of college, what college is Sam going to? ""We're ALL Hot People College?"" Where are all the ugly chicks wearing pajamas that were in my classes? Of course I wouldn't mind attending college that had nothing but hot people in it but this college was only one that Michael Bay could dream up. 3.) Sam is an idiot. Who wouldn't want to take their robot car to college? 4.) Megan Fox was...well, Megan Fox. I'm sorry, how did she smuggle a mini Decepticon onto a plane? 5.) Sam's college roommate....omg so annoying and not funny. Even though it was a PG-13 movie, I was BEGGING to see this guy blown away into little fleshy red bits. 6.) John Turturo wasn't funny. 7.) Not humans, but we all could have done without the twin stereotypical racial robots. Overall, Michael Bay tried to do TOO much. He tried too hard to make it funny whereas it just came naturally in the first one. Everything in this movie fails except for the CGI.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Think of all the cliché things that are involved in Michael Bay movies, multiply that by 10, put in some giant robots and you have Transformers 2. Sadly enough, a fair number of high budget movies are unoriginal in plot and story development, but in one way or another a good portion of them redeem themselves with some level of entertainment. Revenge of the Fallen fails to deliver the entertainment because the plot is uncohesive and haphazard. The only redeeming quality might be the amazing special effects but they are overshadowed by the worst flowing story of all time. Michael Bay manages to take the concept of movie making, defiles it, and gets away with it by using millions of dollars along with the sad fact that the average movie goer is not terribly demanding and is relatively easy to please. The guys at www.wednesdayisforcomics.com do a good job of breaking this down on their latest podcast regarding bad movies. Why is the storyline so haphazard you ask? It comes down to the way the movie was filmed. A large number of scenes were filmed with no idea on how they would fit inside the script. Screenwriters were hired after the fact to fit in the gaps and try and blend these scenes into the movie. Needless to say this style of filmmaking makes for a distorted storyline and a flow that is forced.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The storytelling was a bit messy and there were a few plot holes but I didn't care much. It bothered me to an extent but not enough to ruin the experience for me. This movie wasn't trying to achieve anything great, it's not vying for any academy awards, it's just there to give people a good time at the movies. For me, it did just that. It pleased most of the people in the theater I was in.If we're going to be real, okay (spoiler alert): the movie was TOO long. They dragged that dessert scene for ages, which they didn't need to because the story is formulaic, we know Optimas Prime is going to be resurrected and he's going to kick ass, so dragging it on just made everything a bit too melodramatic. The storyline was sloppy--it had a lot of potential but they tried to complicate things, there was a lot of disorganization, rushing through the actual meat of the story. It confused me. That was the beauty of the first movie. They kept it simple and concise and it worked out because they let the characters and the action do the work. We didn't have to try to figure what was going on while we watched cars and robots crash into each other (deciphering plots is difficult to do when there's so much sensory overload). And I have to agree, although the special effects were incredible, I often found myself questioning whether that was an Autobot I was seeing or a Decepticon. It didn't help that they merged Optimas Prime and a Decepticon (although that was VERY cool). The characters seemed more 2D than usual, but it didn't bother me.All that aside, I still really liked the movie (the first was way better though). I liked what they did bring to the table, the material was good enough (the ending fell a little short, but I was sort of expecting that). I loved the humor in it, it was so alpha and beta male style--I can see how some people might be turned off by that, but come on. They're trying to please a demographic here (cars+robots+hot girls... gotta have that kind of humor interplay). Bumblebee was awesome. I wasn't expecting Isabelle, but sure, I'll buy it.If this kind of movie reaches out to you, you'll probably have a good time. I think you kind of have to be into the alien robots, cars, that macho-guy sense of humor, massive action scenes or at least be open to it to like the film. By the way, Optimas Prime stole the show every time he came out. He has the best entrances ever.8/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I mean what these producers (including Mr. Spielberg) were thinking? What Michael Bay was thinking? Too much money on their hands and the result was an excessive, endless, distractive and horrible movie? But I won't point my fingers only to these guys, I must say something to other people too. The blame of this excuse for a movie is on the shoulders of the two writers of this and Columbia Pictures/Sony for allowing a useless form of cinematic experience to been brought on screen. Is it really that bad? YES it is! I watched this thing for the whole time which means almost three hours of projection and the movie starts to become a boring and endless experience at 15 minutes. But I went ahead, almost crying for missing the EMMY'S (although I've seen some parts of the show and I could honestly say that it was a very good show). When Linkin Park song appeared and the credits rolled I was devastated. And along with that a annoying headache appeared and bothered me for some time. Reducing the plot: Two great team of Robots fights each other and the arena for this fight is our planet and our fate is on the hands of....Sam (Shia LaBeouf) who has in his pocket a fragment of one of these robots, and this fragment shows some secrets. Gathered with incredible and miraculous special effects there's a group of actors from the first (and excellent) film: Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn and Megan Fox (which is here only for the purpose of horny teenagers seeing her bending over a car; she barely has one decent dialog here). Hugo Weaving also makes the dubbing of one of the robots. And adding new elements and actors to the franchise there's a wasted performance of Rainn Wilson, Ramon Rodriguez (the movie could be better without him) and John Benjamin Hickey, who plays a hysterical bureaucrat, and has the worst performance in this film even beating Jon Voight for a similar role in the first film.There's no plot here. I mean, two Robots hating each other and their fight is going to be here just because someone has a little thing in the pocket? Thousands of plot holes and inconsistencies; thousands of unfunny and annoying jokes; overlong battles; nothing was interesting, and when I say nothing it really means nothing. The trailers offered a dark, sinister and interesting movie to watch, but the real deal is a waste of money, waste of time, waste of actors, waste of director and waste of health (for me who end up who with a headache, perhaps other person might had some nausea). ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a disaster out of salvation. One time I was the biggest defender of Michael Bay's work, even when people called the 1st ""Transformers"" of being the worst film ever. Everything he directed I truly enjoyed but after this one it is possible that I might not want to watch his future releases. But I know that the fault lies in the writers because nothing could be made of so great or interesting here. The loads of comedy thrown in this gigantic wreck is incredibly shocking, so shocking that you wonder if a robot wrote this movie and the writers is just names of a front like the ones used in the McCarthism.It's incomprehensible how people liked this incomprehensible adventure and made these the 23rd highest grossing film of all time. I'm writing these because I was there, I watched, I suffered through the whole thing and as a advice coming from the one who was in the battlefield of trying to understand if this was good or not I'll say to you: If you have the guts go for it, take all the necessary risks. But don't say I didn't told you so. It is really that bad. For the indecisive people trust me, you can skip this one easily like a root canal treatment. And I've never been in one!

I know this because I collected hundreds of the toys when I was a kid and the toys had NONE of those things.In fact, the toys only had ONE thing: they could transform from robot to vehicle and back again. THAT is the essence of what made Transformers cool, and when I was a kid that sparked my imagination like nothing else that had come before it.... Well, except ""Machine Men"" (or ""GoBots"" if you spring from the US), who actually pioneered the concept long before Hasbro stole it for Transformers.Anyway, point is, they were cool because they transformed, and it was really revolutionary at the time. It gave my generation a whole new type of superhero that we felt were made specifically for us.So it really was my childhood at stake when they screwed up the first Transformers. It manipulated me, lied to me, and made me feel dirty and ashamed, like the abusive pedo baby sitter I never had.In part II, ILM hyped up their new high poly-count models, more realistic lighting and revamped algorithmic transformations -- but I actually laughed out loud when they grandly introduced the first transformation. An SUV rolls up and proceeds to transform into fan favorite robot Ironhide over a period of roughly 45 seconds.Joints move, then move back, panels slide open then close again, things bend, twist and spin randomly. And all the while, the camera spins around him in a dizzying display of grandeur gone wrong.I'm sure Bay thought he was creating spectacle, but he was really just making a spectacle of himself.Then Ironhide stands up and busts out a bland British accent for some reason. They all have stupid accents. Some of them talk like clichéd Detroit gangstas, others seem to be doing a pretty convincing impression of Ruby Rhod from Fifth Element.I guess this was Bay's attempt to make them recognizable and give them distinct personalities, but it's just another of a thousand choices that make the film annoying and childish.Look, I feel bad, I really do. I know a lot of talented people put a lot of work into this movie. I appreciate all the reflections and textures and bump maps and complex polygons, I really do.But it just doesn't excuse the chaotic direction, one dimensional characters and seemingly random plot line Michael Bay tried to pass off as entertainment. And it definitely doesn't excuse that one dumb-ass decision to fake out the transformations instead of modeling them properly.I get into more detail over on the Popcorn Lobotomy YouTube channel in my video review, so check it out.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

No to be honest I'm not but sometimes its worth seeing something so bad that it hurts. The worst part of this film that so much money has been thrown at something so shallow.

So many people complain about and the predecessor and yet the publicity machine is able to completely ignore this and steam roller ahead as though its another 'Gone With the Wind'. Anyone who thinks this movie is better than 'Gone With the Wind' should be banned from the cinema.In England there's a film reviewer called Mark Kermode his reviews are available and he has plenty to sat about Michael Bay and the way he makes films. None of it good.Everything about this film is either rotten or offencive. I found the use of Egyptian scenes offencive as it seemed like the exploitation of national monuments of great importance to try to give legitimacy to one of the worst films ever made. Its one of the worst as it shows such a waste of technical skills by a director who mysteriously gets commissioned, a script writer who appears to have the toys writing the script.A better film would be explaining how Megan Fox would be with someone like Shia!","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The problem with this film is that it tries way too hard to be funny. All those little gags from the twin autobots, and weak dialogue weren't funny or great Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nothing short of a good idea gone bad, Michael Bay tries and fails to bring up the value of the sequel to his adequate adaption of the popular kids show and toy line. But there are three main reasons that it failed. 1.) It's dull, overlong and it doesn't follow any strict set of rules or even a coherent plot for that matter. 2.) It's terrible and bland acting on most part of the cast brings down the high production values of this film. But to no avail they don't succeed very well. 3.) It's just a plain, old good car with bad parts. All in all this film could have been so much better.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is dumb fun, it uses flashy and stylish CGI rock'em sock'em robot fights, an alluring female lead and bad jokes to entertain. But it fails miserable in it's attempt to be good and plausible entertainment. It drags along for way too long and is very boring at times. But on the bright side it is great fun and a good thrill ride to enjoy. But nothing more. All in all it was a shallow attempt at making a franchise that has been around for more than 30 years and turns it into a bad film. All in all Revenge of the Fallen is an A-Bomb.The truth about this Transformers movie is that it's 147 painful minutes of thoughtless special effects action. Director Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg comes to the table with very little plot, themes, complex sentences, and characterization to speak of. But for the targeted audience, teens and tweens, that's alright. So if you're ready for some reckless violence, rather good reckless violence I might add, then go check out Transformers this weekend. Hell, I'd even go during your regular Sunday nap time, and just take one somewhere in the boundless middle of the movie. It was as bad as people made it out to be.

I left the cinema with no other thought than that I should get home as quickly as possible to consume the pain killers sitting in my medicine cabinet. For two and half hours, this wretchedly expensive technicolour yawn had jangled my nerves, eroded my soul and compromised my intelligence to such a degree, that I honestly thought my brain had engaged in a fight to the death with my skull. For the record, I actually enjoyed Bay's first outing for the shape-shifting toy-range, and whilst I wasn't exactly waiting with baited metal & steel breath for their return to the big screen, I was thinking this sequel would at least equal the young-dumb-full-of-fun schtick of the original. Wrong.Wrong.Wrong. The biggest sin committed in this bloated behemoth ( apart from the rotten racial stereotypes, rotten Mum character, rotten 'pirate' Transformer (WTF?!), rotten CGI 'action' and rotten way in which Bay cuts up every single scene into a million pieces yet still manages to mangle the pace) is that the real Transformers - Optimus Prime and the gang - are reduced to cameo bit-parts in their own movie! Again, WTF?! Seriously Mr Bay - what were you thinking? I reckon you thought: ""Yeah, I know this committee-written garbage has been assembled by a bunch of soulless greed-Meister's , but hey! - im a soulless greedmeister too, and they're paying me zillions to show up and direct it...so what the hell?!"" Bay and the producers of this skyscraper stinker, should be forced to watch their 'masterpiece' on an eternal loop until they succumb to the eternal promise of never making another Transformers sequel and never going near a movie/TV studio or piece of film making equipment ever again. Only then, will there be closure re this abortion. And don't get me started on Megan Fox.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

There are some really good fight scenes, and especially if u are a die hard fan of the auto-bots,then you will get a really great feeling watching these scenes. I was totally hooked to this movie since the beginning. The only downside probably was that there was way to much content and time paid to many details was less. New Autobots did not get enough screen time. Older ones that did not make a return were missed. With that said I feel all in all this is a great movie.. Great entertainment value.

It has silly characters, toilet humour, some classic old school racial stereotypes (kids love over the top black guys and what's funnier than having 2 robots be over the top black guys) and all the different character types you could expect from an action movie.I kept thinking that this movie is perfect for 8 - 14 year olds and would be OK for an adult accompanying them to watch also in the knowledge they're watching a nice kids action movie. The only problem is it isn't for that age group. There's some drug and sex references which make it more appropriate for adults rather than young kids and this is where I think the movie falls down.If you're going to make the movie aimed at older teenagers and adults you should really make the dialogue a little bit less immature. I don't mean it has to have a serious message or be deep and meaningful. Certainly not. Look at any decent action movie and the script is going to have some witty one liners. Some stupid over the top bad guys and all that and that's part of the enjoyment of it all.I felt with this movie that it was written by a teenage boy. It just missed the mark. Michael Bay just seems very immature. Compare this movie to some other recent action movies like the latest die hard and you'll see that they flow better and the dialogue isn't quite as tween like. A few of the things that made me really dislike this movie:On the plus side the action and CGI was very impressive and the story idea itself was perfectly reasonable.I just think if they could have got in a few people in for cliché and continuity control it would have been a better film. When you're spending millions and millions on actors and CGI you can really afford for some non retarded people to look over the script and pick it apart a bit.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is fatty, may not be animal friendly, may not be good for the planet and does not contain foie gras, caviar or saffron. Yet, we eat one with pleasure! This is I feel a good analogy with this film and the reception ""licenced"" critics, and even some free-lance ones, gave to it. It is not Kubrik, Cohen, Lee, Hitchcock, Wenders, Kurosawa. It is not about a man who wasn't there, not about two gay cowboys horse-riding in picturesque mountains and not about the changing morality of a rich physician.It is made by Michael Bay, and it is about Transformers. Great! Pearl Harbour was a serious theme, too serious for Micheal Bay. Transformers is just what he needs. I do not say Bay is a poor Director. Give ""Tranformers"" to Clint Eastwood...oh God have Mercy.Seriously, what did you expect? Optimus Prime, prostrated on the All Spark, staring with a troubled metallic frown at an exhaust, asking ""to be or not to be""?I am not a teenage boy. I am a 32 years old scientist with a taste for varied entertainment. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. There are holes in it, it would be better with a tight plot, but so what? The very nature of Transformers does not make sense anyway.Actors did their part too. Acting was fine, perhaps not perfect. Just remember, they are asked to act in front of a big empty space, or maybe a cardboard face of a robot suspended ten feet in the air, later replaced by CGI entities beating the crap our of each others. Who could do as well as they do, I wonder. I'll give them excuses for their lack of perfection. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, together with John Turturro and the rest of the cast, build a good and believable cast.The audience this movie targets is quite difficult to define. At times I thought the humour was a little bit too Disney-ish, which targets obviously little kids, but the next moment the wonderfully under-dressed backside of either Megan Fox or Isabel Lucas zoomed on the screen. It was very nice, but I do not think I would have been pleased to bring a kid to see this. I hope Michael Bay will decide for whom Transformers is next time.My mark is 8/10. I would have removed about 10 minutes from the final battle. Would have liked more substance to less robots. Less plot holes. Less silly cartoon comedy. REMOVE the annoying twin robots, they make it hard to take Optimus Prime and the Autobots seriously. Finally, Hasbro should let Michael Bay a bit more freedom: it is product placement at its worse. That being said, we are not forced to buy any toys, are we? I bought my last transformers 10 years ago...yes, I know, I was 22, but the alternate form was a great red ant. I could not resist. Besides, the new toys do not make justice to the robots in the film!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This film represents everything that is wrong with the film industry today. The logic of the plot and characters makes little to no sense, as well as takes the classic characters from the source material and takes away what made them memorable. As expected, infamous director Michael Bay replaces character and story for more unnecessary action. The action sequences themselves prove to be cluttered and messy, rendering the audience unable to differentiate one character from another, but instead it appears as a cluttered mess of metallic gray moving parts on screen. Character development is nearly non-existent and the few examples we do get, never add up to anything, nor are they resolved are resolved in the end. The human characters only serve as either eye candy or a punch line to a poorly written joke. The jokes, as well, are juvenile and unnecessary at times, some of which are even at random, in a pathetic attempt to get a cheap laugh out of the audience. Most importantly, they are not funny in the least; they serve only to create an awkward silence lacking any humor whatsoever. The actors in the movie are either overacting beyond comprehension or just blandly read their lines to collect their paycheck at the end of the day. This movie not only proves the faults of the filmmakers involved in this project, but also the current flaws with of the today's film industry as a whole.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

This movie was intended for those who saw the cartoons and followed the series years ago. All of the pieces in this movie were placed together strategically to make some of us remember what our childhood passions were. There were a lot of values being displayed throughout the movie. Courage, respect, responsibility, love, affection and humor. Now, if you can't appreciate that, stop blaming it on the movie, watch the cartoons and get your self a human heart. Pay close attention and re-scan the movie for all of these values and you'll find yourself watching one of the best movies you've seen in your diminutive life. This was a great movie but not the movie for you. It is clear that you don't care enough about it to take it to a level in which the movie becomes your surroundings.

This movie was JUST as good as the first one. The only real reason it did not feel better was because it wasn't as new and breathtaking as he first transformers movie. This movie had TONS more action and the ONLY thing that was a little bit wrong was the amount of different plots they tried to squeeze in this movie. It got a little tiring. It didn't ruin the movie it had just a lot more story than the first which sometimes steals from the action WHICH THERE IS A LOT OF!! Those critics who are saying this movie was not as good as the first where wrong it was JUST as good (which is amazing) and has a lot more action and robots. The only thing that could have been better was the fact that they put a lot of unnecessary plot into it. Otherwise it would have been BETTER than the first!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Digitally and technically they are well made. We even get treated the same guys that made the first movie work. So what went wrong then? Quite a few things I'd say and I'm going to list them ...Story: Apart from the fact, that it's a pretty simple premise, do we really need a complex story for a summer blockbuster? I would say no, but having it be completely ridiculous like in this movie, is way beyond, what audiences should accept.Actors: While we really enjoyed them the first time around, they're not getting real screen time here. And when they get time to talk, the talk so fast, that you wonder how they can follow their own thoughts ... Don't try to understand everything then? Yes and it is a shame. Having an explosion/action sequence every 2 minutes isn't really helpful, especially because you're not getting anything out of the characters.Transformers/CGI: Actually this is one thing they did pretty good in this movie, hence the 3/10 instead a 1/10. But even the great effects suffer from ...Editing: We should be used to MTV cuts by now, but when you have two robots fighting each other, 100 cuts in 10 seconds tend to confuse you rather than give you something you can enjoy. A shame then, because as stated above the CGI is really great.A shame this movie couldn't really be the summer Blockbuster we all anticipated (G.I. Joe took that spot) and I won't even go into plot holes and other crazy stuff, that just doesn't work in (favor of) the movie! And that's why I actually canceled a second viewing, that I had planned, before I even watched the movie. It would just be too painful!","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

He was actually sitting at home and getting high the whole time while some computer geeks working feverishly on the special effects. There is no sign of a written script. Dialogues seems to be made up on the spot. Throw in some stock military footage of jet fighters and helicopters taking off and flying around, and some crazy editing of random shots of actors confused facial expression, running around in slow motion, yelling at each other in nonsensical gibberish, you have the movie! The editing and camera crew ought to be lined up and tested for substance abuse. No sober person could come up with this jumbo heap of mental diarrhea.There is a strange consistency in Michael Bay's work. It has the look and feel of a US army's recruiting commercial. He is one of those current generation directors who make the whole movie looks like an ad campaign. The style works for ad campaign because the audience get an vague impression of what is going on but to find out what is really going on, they will have to go to the store and buy the product. It does not work for the movie because here, the movie IS the product. Michael Bay's character are also very loud and hyper. Come to think of it, I think they should send the whole film crew for drug testing, especially the director himself.Also, I sense some cynical sarcasm in this sequel. It is so bad that it seems to be some sort of self deprecating parody. It is like Michael Bay is trying to paint a cartoon picture of himself that exaggerates all of his flaws. You know the kind of pictures in Mad Magazine. It is a pretty expensive joke consider the budget of this movie. But then again, like the title suggested, Michael probably scammed all those money away because this movie, though looks like very expensive on the surface, can probably be made with much less money consider 95% of the screen time are filled with computer generated effects. He could have out sourced the special effects to India or China, where mad 3d animation genius are working for peanuts. Hence my accusation of him being a scam artist.My dad, being an old man from Asia, had never heard of Michael Bay before. He watched the movie for a bit and asked me if the movie was directed by a lunatic. He was very serious and sincere when he asked that question. I couldn't help and started laughing hysterically, while my poor dad looking at me, truly scared and concerned.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am a fan of the original cartoon, when I heard about the first one I was excited to see the autobots! But it was a bit too much with the human element and the military, what action movie doesn't entail the military these days.The first one was a bore because it spent too much time on the human characters, the sexual tension was there for guys and nothing more.OK, I went into the ""revenge of the fallen"" with mild expectations and it was bittersweet. I liked the fact that the autobots and deceptacons got more screen time. C'mon, this is a ""Transformers"" movie so expect a lot of robots and some action. There are a lot of big explosions, Peter Cullen who is the voice of Optimus Prime is really who carried this movie.What I didn't expect was the crude sexual innuendos, profanity and utter lack of depth of the script. Apparently Michael Bay made this movie for males between teenagers, or the same target audience as ""Step Brothers"".If you are a fan of the 80's cartoon go in with low expectations you won't be disappointed.

Since then I've seen it 4 more times and every time I do I find it better and better. Once you know where and what the dumb moments are they no longer bother you after a while, and you just focus on the cool parts of the movie and enjoy it for what it is. Bay has a certain style and if you don't just go with it, you'll never be able to enjoy his movies. The problem with Transformers: ROTF is that there was just too much of it. But like I said, after a while you get used to it.I remember when I saw the first one in theaters I absolutely could not believe Bumblebee actually urinated on Agent Simmons, I thought it was just absolutely the stupidest thing I'd ever seen, so out of place, etc. much like the ""directly below the enemy scrotum"" joke in this one. But after I've seen it a few times, I actually start finding it funny, not because it is, but just because it is so ridiculous and unbelievable that joke is there that it's funny. And I actually think that's the effect Bay is after, I doubt he actually thinks those jokes and scenes fit within the story and are genuinely funny but he's going for the OMG WT*? effect, which can actually be entertaining if you think about it...I know I'll get the Blu-Ray and watch it over and over again, regardless of what my first impression was, just because the movie is just as much entertaining and cool as it is bad. It is definitely worse than the first one, and it could have been much better, but it's nevertheless a cool-looking sci-fi movie and any Bay fan who liked Armageddon, Transformers and The Island should just accept that this one, despite being inferior to the above titles, is nevertheless still in the same category and accept it for what it is. What's done is done, let's hope Bay will learn from the negative reviews and tune down the bad humor and stupid redundant scenes for the next one, so that its cheesiness is actually enjoyable.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was disappointed with how many flaws were in this film.Basically the decepticons snatch the all spark and use it to bring Megatron back to life. THey then plan on uncovering a device that is capable of destroying suns. In a nut shell, pretty much that is the main conflict.I was hoping to see a lot of new transformers in this film. Sideswipe was a really cool new autobot in this film, but he is barely in it for more than a minute. Arcee seemed cool, but she is barely in it. The two main new autobots in the film are skids and mudflap who are easily two of the most annoying characters in film history. Seriously, could not stand them. The talked like they were from the hood and did nothing at all except annoy the hell out of me.Most of the main autobots from the first film are not in this film nearly enough. Even Prime has a very small role which is inconceivable. What were they thinking? Also for the most part in this film I think there are way too many human scenes and the humans seem too important. It was never like that on the show, sure there were humans around, but it was the transformers who were most important.Having to watch a film titled tranformers, and have to see humans for the most part was disappointing. I wanted to see a lot of new transformers and lots of transformers scenes and it did not satisfy me enough in either regard.The humor is very lame as well. THere are a lot of weird sexual jokes though out the film. It just made the film seem like a teen comedy and not a transformer film.The action was OK, but once again it was hard to tell at times who was winning and who was who.The film is not all bad though. I loved Soundwave and Ravage in this film. Both were awesome, although not in the film nearly enough. Megatron was cool once again, and so was Starscream. Devastator looked awesome(besides a certain part of his anatomy being present) but he did not do anything that cool.One more thing, the idea of Megatron having to answer to someone else in the Decepticon ranks is pretty impossible and unthinkable if you ask me. Just saying.So, while someone who may enjoy lame humor and pointless action may like this film, a true G1 Transformer Fan like myself did not.

Are there a couple plot holes? Yes. Does it have a lot of sexual innuendo and 3rd grade fart humor? Most definitely....What this film ALSO has is.. great action, effects, a decent story, and decent acting....this IS and action film based on kids toys and comics from 20 friggin years ago....it would be the equivalent to going to see ""gone with the wind"" and saying there was not enough blood guts, or explosions for me.I've read some of the WAY over analyzed plot holes....holy crap...lighten up...Tranformers 2 is great movie fun.

What are all the bad reviews about? Were these people (critics mostly) actually taking this film seriously? It has talking robots, and the kid from Holes, for Christ's sake. I saw this movie a couple nights ago, my expectations going in were this: ""Gee Whiz, I'm going to see a lot of things blowing up...""That's about it. I wasn't expecting it to have (even) decent dialog, or even an actual plot; I expected to see a lot of things blow up while I eat my popcorn. That's what this movie is. The ultimate summer- blockbuster popcorn movie for the action fan. This is the summer time, is it not? This is the season for over-the-top dumb movies, where things go ""BOOM."" So I say to you: Go and enjoy this film, for it's explosions, it's amazing (but inconsistent) special effects, and it's mission to just entertain. And that's what it will do, as dumb as it is, it will entertain...Also this is a Michael Bay movie, has this guy ever made a movie that made sense? No, so buy you're d-a-m-n popcorn, and watch the d-a-m-n movie!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is your answer.The beginning events of the movie was O.K. starting with flash back and a robotic attack. In those events, we learn that the ""Transformers"" have been on earth since the stone age. We also learn that after the events following Transformers 1, a confidential military group is formed specially to fight off more Decepticon attacks.The beginning mood was pretty serious... And then we switch over to the scenes of Sam. The mood changes from a good action movie, to a failed attempt of a comedy alike ""Disaster Movie."" The failed attempts to make us laugh were followed by many other pathetically made scenes, and barely followable scenes of metal clashing metal.As for dialogue, you couldn't ask for any worse. There are life threatening sequences that follow with a child's sense of dialogue. That includes overacting too.Micheal Bay made the first Transformers excellent, and barely escaped me giving him a 1 star for his sequel.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think Harrison Ford would be a much happier man if the same amount of money was put into the Crystal Skull, good for Shia, bad for Harrison.Interesting thing is that it appears the bad robots are higher tech, some of them got jet engines so they can fly like F22s, leopard like robots are agile, plus a very sexy female robot, the good robots only got wheels.

The movie is hilarious.The clincher though is the amazing action and special effects, as well as the standout performer: Optimus Prime.

Everything thing Michael Bay touches explodes with entertainment, Transformers 2 was no exception. I enjoyed every moment but at 2h30m maybe a not so avid fan might think it drags on a touch, and id like to remind them the autobots are the brightly coloured ones. The only bad thing id have to say about it was that it was not as nicely rounded as the first which was perfectly formed with the right amounts of action, comedy, sci-fi and transforming. This was only because, as with many sequels, they had to make it so hugely spectacular so that it wouldn't disappoint. They also seemed to go for more funny-silly than funny clever with annoying parents and various robots.But 2 dislikes out of hundreds of things to like about this movie is not bad, its still the best cinema trip i have made and are likely to make this year. The scenes are explosive, locations are hot, the acting is pretty accomplished and there are of course one or two heart wrenching moments that make up a blockbuster like this.So if you want to go see a really great film this summer that gives you your moneys worth, go see Transformers-Revenge of the Fallen.(especially if you liked the first)","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, the Autobots are working with the Military to protect Earth from the Decepticons, who want to resurrect the one known as the fallen.I liked the previous 2007 Transformers film, so I wanted to like this one. However, it was very long and the fighting was drawn out to the point it felt unnecessary. There was so much destruction it was hard at times to keep track of who was who and what's happening.Compared to the 2007 transformers, this movie isn't as funny. I did however think when Sam and his mom first got to his College was funny. His mom didn't realize she was eating marijuana, she ended up getting high and almost started a fight. The fact that the weird alien creatures kept fighting among themselves probably was meant to be humorous, however, I found them irritating.There wasn't enough substance to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen for a two hour and 30 minute film. It got to the point where it felt like they weren't fighting for anything important. In the 2007 film there was action and fighting but it seemed much more controlled and easier to follow what's going on. A reason that this movie wasn't good might be due to the writers' strike at the time, which meant Michael Bay had to finish writing the script himself.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

With its impressive special effects, exhilarating action sequences, and a touch of nostalgia, this movie delivers an entertaining experience for both fans of the original animated series and newcomers to the Transformers universe.The film follows the story of Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LaBeouf, a teenager who unwittingly becomes entangled in a war between two factions of alien robots, the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons. As Sam discovers the truth about the ancient AllSpark, a powerful artifact sought after by both sides, he joins forces with the Autobots and their leader, Optimus Prime, voiced by Peter Cullen, to save humanity from destruction.One of the standout aspects of ""Transformers"" is its jaw-dropping visual effects. The seamless integration of CGI and live-action creates a believable world where giant robots transform into vehicles and engage in epic battles. The level of detail in the robot designs is impressive, capturing the essence of the beloved characters from the original series. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, filled with explosions, high-speed chases, and intense combat, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the film.The performances in ""Transformers"" are solid, with Shia LaBeouf delivering a charismatic and relatable performance as the film's protagonist. He brings a sense of humor and vulnerability to the role, making Sam Witwicky a likable and engaging character. The voice acting by Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is iconic, capturing the noble and commanding presence of the Autobot leader. The supporting cast, including Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, and John Turturro, also deliver commendable performances, adding depth and humor to the story.While ""Transformers"" primarily focuses on action and spectacle, it also touches on themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the consequences of war. The film explores the moral dilemmas faced by the Autobots and the Decepticons, highlighting the complexities of their struggle for power and the impact it has on the human world. The screenplay strikes a balance between thrilling action sequences and moments of emotional resonance, creating a well-rounded narrative that keeps viewers engaged.However, ""Transformers"" is not without its flaws. The film's runtime is quite long, and at times, the pacing can feel uneven, with certain scenes dragging on. Additionally, some viewers may find the humor and dialogue to be overly cheesy or clichéd. Nevertheless, these minor shortcomings do not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the film.In conclusion, ""Transformers"" (2008) is a visually stunning and action-packed extravaganza that successfully brings the beloved Transformers franchise to the big screen. With its impressive special effects, exhilarating action sequences, and a touch of nostalgia, this film delivers an entertaining experience for fans and newcomers alike.

There were many times, where i wanted to switch this load of crud off. The story line is completely pointless. The textures and lighting were unpleasant resulting in actors and actresses skin looking greasy, dirty and ORANGE.Megan fox is completely unnecessary to the story, her character does nothing except for walk in on Her boyfriend cheating with some hoe ass robot.The jokes were so god damn lame it was as if Ben stiller's retarded cousin had written them. Oh its SOOOO funny to see your mum on hash cookies. NOT.CGI? Myyy god.. the CGI! Wayyyyy too much CGI. It was like i was watching toy story, robot edition having a CGI orgasm all over the screen. The big robot battles, there was hardly ANY sound effects????!!!?! Just pings and pangs...If the navy had a rail gun, why did they not just shoot every transformer with it? Ohhhh and the gangster robots? WHAT THE HELLLL was THAT? Was Michael bay trying to reinvent Jar-Jar Bink's in the form of two lame ass robots? This movie was a piece of trash. Don't rent it. Don't buy it. Don't waste your broadband on it. AVOID IT.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Things change, and the movie was a blast. I looked forward to the sequel, hoping for more of the same but with a bigger scope to reflect the growing threat.Well, more is certainly what we got with Revenge of the Fallen, there's no doubt about that. More robots, more locations, more fight sequences, improved effects. It's all up there on the screen, no doubt about that. The movie looks incredible.Unfortunately, Michael Bay doesn't seem to know when to stop. The movie is a good half hour too long and relentless with it. There are simply too many Transformers on screen now to care about, and the few of them that do receive adequate screen time to get to know tend to be the more grating, comedy relief characters, while the potentially more interesting Transformers are relegated to the background.Oh yes, the 'comedy'. There's way too much of it, and it's faaaaar too juvenile in nature. Jokes about stoned mothers, Transfomers showing their 'affection' for their new human friends, Devastator's swinging wrecking balls... I must admit the odd snigger, but felt quite ashamed with myself for it. This kind of stuff is just out of place, making it seem like giant shape-shifting robots have wandered onto the set of the latest instalment of the interminable American Pie series. And as for those twins...A shame, because there is good stuff here. The core Transformers from the previous film remain and work well for the time they have on screen (save Bumblebee, who seems to have turned into Sam's stalker). Megatron and Starscream's relationship is expanded and works brilliantly. The human cast work well, particularly Shia LaBeouf , Josh Duhamel and John Turturro, whose comedy relief character DOES work. Soundwave is perfect as a sinister puppet master, keeping a close eye on things from space. And Ravage is simply brilliant.Despite slight disappointment, I'm still looking forward to the third in the series. Just know when to hold back next time, eh Mr. Bay...?","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

In this sequel, in my opinion better than the first, he is still the source of my lasting headache. I spent most of the film wishing he would just SHUT UP!! As if his deplorable and amateurish over-acting wasn't bad enough, they added a second contender, in the presence of Ramon Rodriguez, his room-mate. It's really is too much for words...the yammering, jabbering rubbish. LeBeouf screams his way wide-eyed, through nearly 2 and a half hours of film. I can forgive the bad campus, all-American images...I mean, this is Hollywood. We can even get over the fact that the US is deemed to be the arbiter of the entire world security (after Bush, there is little that would surprise me) but while we don't expect much in the way of intellectual stimulation, couldn't the crippling hysterics of the first film be addressed at least? Please, if there are any more sequels, kill LeBeouf's character or make him otherwise silent and PLEASE don't replace him with anymore screamingly BAD actors. John Torturro at least improved slightly from last time but still.... *sigh* I guess after these catastrophic decisions are made (cast, lines, etc.), the enormous budget they spend means that they don't DARE watch the final product for fear of seeing how bad their mistakes were.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I do agree that this movie has some weak scenes that could have been left out by Michael Bay. This is the only negative critic I can agree with.Voters or viewers who have known the original transformers cartoon, know how thin the original story line was. The original intent of Hasbro was to create a cartoon to sell their toys. I believe that a movie script should always stick to the original story as much as possible. It's up to the director and the producers to audio visualize this as creative and professional as possible. Knowing this I believe Michael Bay has done a terrific job and as an entertainment movie experience I truly enjoyed it. If you are looking for an artful drama movie with a lot of spiritual meaning hidden in it, then why would you ever go to a movie about toys attacking Earth? Therefore, most negative critics are from people who truly misunderstood the original intention of this movie. Do not forget that great directors like Steven Spielberg were involved in the production of the Transformers' movie. Besides, this movie has already generated a global revenue of over US$ 600 million. How bad can it be then?Just like with most things in life: ""Different movies for different entertainment needs"".Make your judgment with knowledge about the original history, so that you truly understand the accurate intention of the movie. Only then your movie critics really make sense. Making a good movie is a skill, but enjoying a movie in its true meaning and respecting its history, is a true art. Just like with wine. Just like in real life, not everything what you see, hear and taste, is what you expected and may not appeal to you the first time, but we all know that differences in life and in entertainment offers make life an enjoying experience.

Eye candy makes up for about 95% of the target audiences expectations, after all.So it was a great pity that Michael Bay tried even harder to ensure that the maturer audience almost keeled over from motion sickness and extreme face-palming... Not only is 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' a tiresome sequel-by-numbers, but it has more flaws than a Wickes catalogue.The original movie was almost a guilty pleasure; pure popcorn entertainment that you can easily disengage your brain to enjoy (as with Armageddon). 'Revenge...', however, follows in Terminator 3's footsteps by claiming the events that lay ahead were inevitable, therefore creating a disbelief that spoils what is left of a completely preposterous story.Shia LaBeouf is excellent once again as the socially awkward Sam, but it's a pity (for some) that Megan Fox is once again present for her physical assets rather than acting ability. 'Revenge...' takes this a step further with cringeworthy close-ups and completely unnecessary shots of Fox showing off those seductive functions, although to be fair, the first half of the movie is edited in such a frantic and confusing manner that you're never aware of what's going on, and the significance of such. This spontaneity makes it difficult to understand what Sam's entry into college had to do with anything, and why we need stupid jokes that go against any kind of drama from the, for lack of better term, dork room mates.Talking of bad humour, it seems the transformers themselves have spent too much time around the cast as they themselves produce truly tepid one-liners that the Christmas crackers author to shame. I'm guessing the scriptwriter thought this may appeal to the hyperactive under-10's in the audience, who think things are awesome/'epic' very easy.The most frustrating aspect about this movie isn't how it could have been compressed into half the runtime, but for how in that period, it manages to conjure so many ridiculous plot holes and bad mistakes. Since when was full colour film available in 1932? How did the marines get to Egypt in under an hour? Why did no-one discover those GIANT WEAPONS inside the pyramids of Giza for over a century? Why does a transformer who's been dormant in a museum require a beard and walking stick? And why oh why, in typical American pig-ignorance, did they give him the most English of English voices just because he's a bumbling fool and knowledgeable? Jee-wizz...I should also point out that someone in the CGI department believes Optimus Prime - a behemoth weighing many tones - can casually stand on the edge of an aircraft carrier without affecting the vessels waterline or stability?Please... someone fire this guy.As a movie-going experience, this sequel is expectedly disappointing. It will please children that love two and half of hours of their daily CGI-count, but it is truly a nauseating and ridiculous product that, sadly, represents the state of the movie industry at this point in time... Hype sells.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

What I didn't expect was the level of stupidity of this movie. The editing is terrible, so many scenes out of context you just grab your head and say ""WTF is going on?!??!"" .the jokes are terrible, those twins, my god they are so annoying!! they just wouldn't shut up..just talk more and more and more.I don't know what the writers thought about when coming up with those 2 characters. The stereotypes of those to robots, so help me god, and that robot doctor with the German accent, what were they thinking??Sam's mom. I just don't know where to start...the writers got the impression that on the first movie she like ""stole the show"", so they said to themselves ""Hey, why not give her more stupid and unnecessary scenes?!"" She just talks so much! every scene the writers just had to give her as many lines as possible, with many jokes as possible. The Brownie scene for example...what is that has to do with anything?!I can't remember a movie with so many plot holes..it's unbelievable. A border passage between Egypt and Jordan?! WHERE IS ISRAEL?!?! Sam landing in the desert, holding his broken hand..next shot it's all nicely under cast and bandages...Sam briefly dies and goes to Robot Heaven. Robot Heaven?!?! Why do we have to see John Turturro's thong??? I can go on and on and on...The length...this movie easily could be narrowed down to 120 mins exactly...but since director Bay likes slow motions and unnecessary scenes...there's not much to do.The amount of robots is ridiculous..I wish they give SideSwipe more scenes cause he's transformation in the opening scene is AWESOME!!!!! there's enough stuff here for a third movie...THANK GOD for the special effects...there are some truly amazing moments in this movie, although due to poor camera work and editing sometimes it's hard to figure out who's fighting who, scenes like The Forest Battle is a standout in the movie...a truly jaw dropping scene, Optimus Prime with two swords is one of the coolest things i ever saw and by far the best scene in the movie. Sam's psychotic attack in the classroom was brilliant and intense, but another thing that bugged is that no one seemed to care that he is acting like that and the class just went on as usual. That dog robot ""Ravage"" arrival, to see him running and jumping is spectacular, with those tiny balls piling up creating that thin robot, amazing. Again, this movie has great moments.I recommend watching this movie only for the SPECIAL EFFECTS. the CGI is a wonder to be hold..and so does Megan Fox. So hot it's a crime.As for the 3rd movie, I'm wondering how could they surpass this movie in terms of bigness. Cause this movie is unbelievably HUGE.They have to take a break with this franchise. aim for like a 2012-2013 summer release and do something about the editing the script, and the director, cause Bay is a child. And try to make it more serious for god sake.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

There were quite a few things I enjoyed about the movie. Even though I could do without some parts, I thought that the movie was well paced. The fight scenes were spectacular. The robots' movements were fluid and there were lots of explosions. The best fight was with Optimus, Megatron, Starscream, and Grindor. It was well choreographed. I did enjoy seeing the new Transformers such as Soundwave, Arcee, and Sideswipe. I wish all three would have been in the movie more.I could have done without the twins. I understand that they were there for the younger audiences but they annoyed me quite a bit until they fought Devastator. I love Sam's parents in the first movie but I think his mom was a bit over the top. The reasons for her actions when they were at school were a bit over the top. Also, there were some holes in the plot.I would recommend this movie almost any moviegoer, but check your brain at the door.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Relentless action sequences (with the side effect of destroying the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). This is a teenage movie series, and we stepped in, forewarned of the same, and got everything that we might have expected. The question is – did this movie lift the franchise to a higher level? Did it lend character to Optimus Prime the way it clearly sought to do. Did you want to make up our minds about whether humans should be taking sides in an extraterrestrial battle, or whether the Autobots should be sharing their military technology with humans.

There is an unbelievable amount of jokes in this movie, yet, I only had to smile a single time. I didn't laugh once. It's almost like in those really bad comedy shows where one bad joke after the other is being pulled out – simply because they ran out of good jokes...Yet I still liked it. The story felt like the one of a children's comic book. The story is told fast, with a lot of action. And heck, this action is fun to watch - despite all the silliness in the movie. The movie doesn't have a ""realistic"" theme, and doesn't care to be realistic.

They'd really have hated the over priced easy to break Transformer toy-line.(Personally I had megaton based on the cartoon transformed into a Giant Desert Eagle 5 foot Caliber gun lol.The main issue though is the action scenes are just too extensive, and can overwhelm the visual senses. I also found it to be relatively a repitition of the first.Disney has that warning..but on an OLED quality 55-72' set the robot fight scenes can be overwhelming on the senses.The films may have been accepted or reviewed better had they been cut down to 130 minutes max plus credits..But if something can rake in over a billion on a 250 million budget before BLU-Ray and merchandising it will be made.Like anything else movies especially in this genre aren't made to win Oscars but to bring in big bucks.In terms of sequel overkill.... I find Starwars to be more embarrassing as mentioned. The prequels were a nightmare, and JJ plagiarized the first three...Ray is the Emperors Grandaughter...Luke is Vader's son. Mark Hamill was young and mopey now old and grouchy. A Death Star and Star base 1 at least they didn't make a second star base just Imperial Cruiser planet killers.

So reviews are out and all the hot-shots are calling this film a big expensive disaster. All I hear is how terribly built the plot is, how awful the acting might be, and just how generally disappointing this movie is. Which it definitely is not.I can't believe anyone would go see a movie like this, a Michael Bay film, expecting a world-class Best Picture nominee. This is Transformers. Get real. I didn't go to this with high hopes for big twists or heart-wrenching well-acted dramatic love scenes, I went to this because I knew it would be a complete jumble of exciting visual effects and outrageous action, which it was. Nonstop action straight from the get-go. Explosions, metal melting and flying everywhere, fight after fight, crunch after crunch--just stuff that can make you laugh and go ""WHOA!"" at the same time. The dialogue was humorous and clever. Clichés may have been abundant, but they're just there to make you chuckle, not have a hysterical laughing breakdown.I had a complete blast watching this movie. Anyone who has the slightest bit of interest in a larger-than-life over-the-top action film, just for the fun of it, should NOT miss out on this great movie. Definitely one to see in theaters. I'll be back this weekend to watch it again!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"2","/10","Only good sound work prevents this from being one of the worst big-budget films of the last decade.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6465502/?ref_=tt_urv","RMurray847","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1203594/?ref_=tt_urv","11 January 2021","I saw the first Transformers when it first came out, and didn't care for it much. The battle sequences were noisy and confusing. I found I couldn't tell the ""good guys"" apart from the ""bad guys."" I admired the effects overall, and the film certainly gives sound designers and editors a nice showpiece. But I never really desired to see any of the sequels.The other afternoon, I had some free time on my hands, and wanted to watch something mindless. I sure picked the right film. I mean, where do I start in running down the reasons this film is stinker?!?!#1: Script/plot. What a mess. In typical form for director Michael Bay, scenes of more than a few seconds are rare. He must have and assume we do too, the lowest attention span of anyone on the planet. It creates a frantic pace that's exhausting to keep up with and never worth it. The dialogue is INANE, where characters are sketched in moments and then forever locked into their type. Many don't even have a real character developed at all: I mean, Josh Duhamel has been in two of these, ostensibly in a major role, and yet I have ZERO idea what kind of character he is. The story bounces all over and little is rationally explained. The film basically wants us to just watch little chunks of storytelling and not worry about how it ties together.#2: The action. It's what we're really here for, isn't it? And it's as bad as the first film. Again, I couldn't tell the transformers apart readily. The Fallen (what a DUMB name) looks a lot like the good guy with the Liam Neeson accent. When they fight, no one can tell them apart. It's just a bunch of clanking grey metal. And there is no consistency as to what kills one of these creature/machines. Some get huge holes punched right through their middles and keep going. Others are flung against a wall and die. They seem to be easy to kill or indestructible at will. I can only imagine the work the special effects team put into all this, and it looks pretty spectacular until you try to make sense out of the combat. The climactic scenes, set near the ancient pyramids of Egypt (one of which is utterly destroyed!) are confusing locations. The camp where our GIs await Sam Witwicky (our hero, played by Shia LeBeouf) seems to be near the action at times and FAR away at others. Sam seems to be right there, and then he seems to be far away still. It's all so stupid.#3: Acting. Terrible. Shia LeBeouf is clearly barely interested in this role, and he's the best of the bunch. It ranges from generic, I'm-here-to-get-paid (Josh Duhamel or Tyrese) to frantically over-the-top (John Turturro, trying his best to be comic relief but instead just being annoying) to unwatchable (Megan Fox). Megan Fox is simply the worst actress I have ever seen. Sure, she's built like a model...but she brings not one single second of believable character or emotion to the film. She has no comic timing. No ability to connect with those around her, making her ""love"" scenes with Shia truly cringeworthy. Simply awful. Awful, awful, awful. Wow, she's bad.#4: Humor. Well, the first film succeeded in being entertaining early on with some amusing bits where the world gets introduced to Transformers. There were some cheap but at least genuine laughs there. NOW, all attempts at humor are forced. LaBeouf has lost virtually all his natural charm in this film, so you don't even enjoy his energy. There are two little ""jive talking"" transformers who are merely uncomfortable and unfunny racial stereotypes. It's all ham-fisted and not funny.#5: Sound. The film sounds great. If you have a surround sound speaker and good sub-woofer, get ready for the windows to rattle. Again, these guys do a great job in the service of a bad film. They are the only reason the film isn't one-star.REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is simply amateurish and insulting. Insulting to our intelligence and pocket books. Why, oh why, did I watch this?","0 out of 18 found this helpful.

What the hell was that! Devastator has BALLS!! And Wheelie humping Megan Fox's leg? Why the hell would a robot have the hots for a human? I would understand if he was trying to hump a toaster!! And not to mention John Turturro's butt! At least there was that scene with a nice view of Fox's thighs!Gosh, if it was not a Transformers movie I would say it's all trash, I only had a bit of interest on it because I'm a huuuuge fan of Transformers and I'll always enjoy seeing the big robots clashing at each other.

"8","/10","Simply transformed my interest in films.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2095450/?ref_=tt_urv","jordell5","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18036548/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2009","It has been a long while since I've seen a movie from the cinema that has both mesmerized and has consistently kept my attention and enjoyment throughout the entire film. This movie truly did it for me! I went in with almost zero expectations and only had the prequel(which i thoroughly enjoyed also) to anticipate what I was expecting. I myself am not even a fan of the 'Transformers' series- I've seen bits of it when I was a child but that is the limit of my knowledge.So what did I love and dislike about Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen? Firstly, and to me the most important of all, was simply the action. The jaw-dropping transformations from vehicles to fighting machines, The fast paced action and camera movement, the clash of metal, and countless explosions. This movie was jam-packed full of action and I simply loved it. No-one, and I mean no-one can fault Transformers 2 for it's CGI and fight sequences that in almost every sense became shinier and upgraded from the first film. I entered the cinemas with my mates looking for an epic popcorn movie and that is what I was given. I'm not going to lie- the plot was very lack-luster but by no means terrible. The story does what it needs to by paving the way for the cliché battle of good VS Evil to unfold, and thats it. But did you really expect a mind-blowing story? Not everything can be catered for in a 2 hour film extracted from a long TV series. The prequel was exactly the same.Secondly, the comedy was genuinely funny. I laughed a lot during the whole film almost in tears of joy. I looked for a film that entertained me and humoured me. Sam's parents were more whacky and hilarious in this sequel too. I found the Robotic Twins overall no where near as annoying as most people did, but yes they were a weakness of this film. FYI I'm 22 years old, and though Transformers 2 is mainly targeted at kids and teens I am not ashamed to admit that I chucked as much as everyone watching it too. Yes I will admit that certain aspects of its humour was immature and repetitive gags about 'scrotum' and 'balls' were noticed by myself, but who cares?. Why be so serious? Thirdly, the romance/women. Being the typical male I don't have that much interests in chick-flicks ,but still care for romance and the pretty ladies. Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas were both stunning as their characters and their acting was convincing enough, though average. There wasn't much chemistry Between Sam and Mikaela but there was plenty of flirting and banter to keep girl and guy viewers interested.My fourth category is the music. Keeping this short and, the music was apt and fitting for all the scenes from heated battles to sadness. Nothing negative here. I've listened to the OST of the film and almost every song on there is great. If you enjoyed the music in the film I recommend you buy or download the music- you won't regret it.Overall it pushes all my buttons. Any film that keeps my interest peaking from start to finish is brilliant in my eyes. I'm only speaking for myself, but I believe the vast majority who see this film will not bedisappointed. The hardcore fans (and minority) of the Transformers cartoon series are probably the bulk of the unhappy viewers, but that is always the case.In essence my message is to enjoy the film for what it is. Switch off your brain and marvel in an action-packed, CGI masterpiece. You will find yourself laughing and musing again and again every time you watch this film,but several forced and repetitive jokes and a weak plot prevent me from giving it a top score. This film is not perfect, nor is hardly any other. Enjoy it for what it is.8/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

All of the problems from the first one are still present. Michael Bay-isms are doubled, military bloating, underwritten and uninteresting characters, and a weak and cringey script with a mediocre and exposition-heavy plot. The nostalgia saved it from bothering me that much. It's honestly a nice change seeing the final big sequence of an action film take place somewhere that isn't the US or Europe, even if it means we have to believe that Petra and the pyramids are less than an hour's drive away from each other.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The storyline wasn't great, it didn't need to be. A lot of things didn't make sense, IT'S A FILM ABOUT GIANT ALIEN ROBOTS. Looking at it critically there are a lot of flaws, but I mean come on it's entertainment not art, judge it accordingly.For anyone hesitant about seeing this film because of the negative reviews - I enjoyed this movie, my friends enjoyed this movie, a lot of people in the theater enjoyed the movie. You probably won't like this movie: >If you walk out after a movie that you really enjoy and say stuff like ""that was a really well constructed plot"" >If you hate Bay, Shia, or Fox with a passion >If the storyline is always the most important to you >If you are a die hard fan of the original >If you haven't seen, or didn't like the first oneYou probably will like this movie: >If you walk out after a movie that you really enjoy and say stuff like ""oooohhhh, that was sweet, remember when that one guy cut off the other guys head"" >If you love Bay, Shia, or Fox >If you care more about the presentation than the plot >If you enjoyed the first onetips to enjoy this movie:1)You need to have seen the first one before or else you'll really be lost and you'll miss out on a lot of character development (they don't bother re-introducing anyone)2)If you saw the first one a long time ago and only kind of remember it, good, DON'T re-watch it! It'll only make the inconsistencies between the two more obvious.3)Listen to the negative reviews. This isn't a perfect movie, don't expect it to be.4)Don't anticipate anything, don't expect anything.A lot of people enjoyed this film (65% gave it 8+), and a decent number didn't. I'm not saying you'll love this film, but I really don't think you'll hate it.Bottom line: It's entertaining, if you aren't a critical person I bet you'll enjoy this movie, give it a chance, the effects alone are worth seeing it in the theaters.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Transformers 2 for the rest of this) fails in almost every way possible. You have a $200,000,000 or so budget and this is the best you can do? I'm not sure how often I've used this word to describe a film, but Transformers 2 is just stupid. Here's the long, but still incomplete, list of my many problems with the movie:1. The plot is a disaster. More accurately, I should say the film lacks a plot. The movie is little more than one gag after the next, whether it's an attempt at comedy or a visual gag, none of it really flows into a cohesive film. I suppose the main point of the film is a Decepticaon known as The Fallen wants to use a machine buried under the pyramids to destroy the Sun. Why? It's never really explained why he wants to do this. If it is, it's lost in all the nonsense included in Transformers 2. The ""destroy the Sun"" bit is really nothing more than a McGuffin designed to make The Fallen look evil and create an adversary for Optimus to fight. There's no other purpose to it.2. The comedy in this thing is misplaced and rarely funny. The ""comedy"" bits with the parents, the twin Autobots, and the roommate - none of their attempts at comedy are funny in the least. The parents are more cringey than funny, the twins are more offensive than funny, and the roommate is more annoying than funny. It doesn't work.3. The runtime at 2.5 hours is at least an hour too long. There's so much unnecessary crap in Transformers 2 that could have been cut to make a tighter, more focused film. The scenes with the parents, the scenes with the roommate, and the whole Army/government power struggle could have been cut without affecting what little plot the movie has. Sitting through one unnecessary scene after the next makes Transformers 2 longer than it should have been and an incredibly arduous process.4. I know some praise the special effects, but to me, they're weak. The robots look horrible. If they weren't meant to be giant piles of random junk thrown together haphazardly, then director Michael Bay succeeded in presenting his vision. But if all the expensive CGI was meant to present interesting, unique characters, the special effects fail on an epic scale. In the big fight scenes, it's almost impossible to distinguish on robot form the next. They all look equally horrible and just alike.5. I suppose my biggest complaint and what all this leads to is that I'm not much of a fan of MIchael Bay's style of directing. Bigger and louder don't necessarily mean better. And the way the film jumps from one scene to the next, it makes me wonder if there's not a 6-year old with ADD trapped inside Bay's body. It gets annoying after about 5 minutes. Don't misunderstand - you can make a big special effects film if you've got a good story and interesting characters. But Bay seems to think that all you need to do is throw a wad of cash at CGI and that makes a good movie. Well, it doesn't as Transformers 2 proves.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

My first wish was fulfilled, there's a lot of action and I love that (the best sequence was the one where Optimus Prime fights Megatron, Starscream and Grindor...superb). For some reason I felt Megan was portrayed much better in the first film. The reason I cut 24% is because they showed these Robots as sex machines (that was insulting...Wheelie & Devastator disgusted me).Director's Work:[10%] This guy is a little crazy. Someone should tell him to stop filling the films with his crappy humor. I really don't know what his job requirements are since the cool-CGI stuff is not his responsibility, he's pretty much useless or maybe there is something for him...lets see: shout ACTION, CUT and PACK-UP.Acting:[20%] Come on people we are talking about Transformers (particularly not famous for its acting). IMO the best actor was Optimus Prime.Entertainment Value:[74%] Its 74% entertaining and most of that 74% is because of the cool CGI-effects. As all of you know, seeing Davastator and the Autobots (excluding the Twins), Decepticons in action was cool.Script:[12%] The only thing that comes close to the bad direction is the Script. The Twins were Stupid and irritating to say the least (I don't know why they were given so much attention and screen time...they never looked heroic to me). Quite a few scenes were really unwanted. I hope they seriously prepare a good script for the next one (if there is one...looking at the box office numbers, there will be a Transformers 3).__________________________________________________________________ All the people who LOVED the first film should LIKE this. Anyone who's looking for a time-pass film can watch this. I saw this movie on the first day, first show for Rs.50 (around US$ 1 ...matinee show) and I don't feel cheated. My advice is watch this one at a theater with cheap ticket-price (if possible) and you won't regret it. Some cool CGI stuff waiting for you. _____ 5.3/10","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

From the racism to the goofy humor.The action scenes are alright when you can understand them, or hear over the loud noises Michael Bay calls explosions. The CGI is great but during some fights, it looks like they just threw random colors and models that were all over the place. The IMAX was a wasted element that was barely used. And the plot was all over the place, it even slows down to catch up on some stupid love story and tries to explain stupid plot elements that you really don't give a crap for.In the end, Revenge of the Fallen is a movie only a child could like, but for older audiences hoping for some summer fun, go watch Star Trek!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

There was some unnecessary perverted jokes, but all in all this movie was ENTERTAINING. The story was average but there was a lot of action. Micheal bay sure knows how to direct it (action). Even though it was a good movie, It wasn't better than the first movie. DO not listen to the critics. You can tell by walking around your college or work that people enjoyed the first one and our hyped for the second movie. When I got to the theater i did not expect a crowd on Wednsday night but I got one. Then my friend told me ""Don't worry, its not all for transformers"". Then a group of girls passed by talking about transformers and sure enough it was sold out till 10 30.

It was utterly disappointing. Sure, the actions were cool, the robots were bigger, Megan Fox was hotter, but the main thing, a script, was missing. I am a big fan of action and great CGI effect movies, but to be honest, at one time I was feeling bored with all the clinging sounds and transformers transforming and transforming and transforming and limitless shooting.This movie could have been so much better, had a script been worked out. But I would admit, the special effects, though tedious, were very cool and compelling. In some places, Shia LaBeouf's acting looked good. But overall, this movie disappointed me and I am anxious with the third installment in this franchise already being announced.

However, all those things together doesn't make the sequel better than the first 'Transformers' movie. The first movie was better than ROTF (like 9/10). It had a more human aspect to the film, while ROTF has a more mechanical/robotic feel. In the first film, the robots were toned down in favor of character development for the human characters. I liked that it didn't totally rely on special effects, and that I actually cared for the characters. In the sequel, the human characters, for the most part, just run around as they hunt for something. The robots have more speaking roles this time around, but it's a let down. I hate most of the personalities and the voices that many of the transformers had. The 'Twins' were annoying with their stereotypical gangster slang and attitude, although they did have maybe one or two funny moments. The little blue robot was also annoying with his voice (the voice actor of Spongebob), but I soon grew fond of the character (too bad he's totally left out in the finale and final fight). Jetfire (the old robot) had a stereotypical grumpy/grouchy-old-man personality, and that got on my nerves. His character was over-the-top. I would've liked him more if the filmmakers toned him down a bit. Also, with the addition of so many robots in this movie, the 'Transformers' film franchise has become more cartoonish, which I don't like. There were many 'Frenzy'-like characters in the sequel (frenzy was the crazy small robot from the first film), but Frenzy was more realistic since he didn't have a cartoonish appeal and he didn't speak (in English) that much. Since there's so many new robots this time around (like 42, compared to the 10? in the first movie) most of them either don't talk at all, or get one line in. The big robot in the final fight (Devastator – the one that's made from the combination of six or seven robots) was very underused and a waste. His big character could've been great. Also, there seemed to be two identical robots: the six or seven robots that combined seemed to each have an identical robot fight in the battle at the same time. This confused me, but it probably won't confuse people that don't know the individual characters. {Spoiler Alert: I hated the addition of 'Alice', the hot girl that gets all over the main character. If the robots could transform into humans, why transform into vehicles? It's more convenient to be a human. Spoiler Alert Over}. Although there was a lot of things I felt was wrong with the movie, I still enjoyed it. The fights were better this time around (although i liked the first film's final fight more than the second film's final fight). The forest fight where Optimus is fighting three decepticons was cool, but it was like 5 minutes long. If it was longer, I would've appreciated it more. Oh, that reminds me – I HATE the way Optimus Prime talks. Every word that comes out of his mouth is a cliché! Also, a thought just came into my mind: What happened to the cop-car-decepticon (Barricade) from the first movie. He didn't appear in the final fight for the first film, and he didn't appear at all in the second film! He was my favorite decepticon from the first movie. Since I'm talking about Decepticons now, imma say a little something about Megatron and Starscream. Megatron was badass in the first movie, while in this one he's just a little servant to The Fallen. Megatron is stronger in ROTF but he doesn't do much. The only good part he had was in the forest fight with Optimus. Starscream was also annoying because he does nothing. He bickers with Megatron more, but I hate the way Starscream fights. He stays in vehicle form and just shoots at the enemies. Now, about The Fallen. The concept of him being the main bad guy in ROTF was cool, but the way he was portrayed in the movie was dumb. He was barely in the film, and in the final fight he barely does anything. Also, when he fought, it was for about 2 minutes before it was over. Bummer. The Fallen wasn't even as menacing as Megatron was in the first movie. The villains this time around just suck. The subtitle 'Revenge of the Fallen' is a double meaning. It means the revenge of the fallen decepticons, and also means the revenge of the character called 'The Fallen.' However, in ROTF, neither the Decepticons nore The Fallen were successful in their revenge plot. They all SUCKED. I don't know why I'm ranting about all the flaws with ROTF, even though I liked the movie and I gave it an 7 out of 10. The movie's awesome, but it just has flaws that bothered me A LOT. ROTF is certainly a much bigger movie than the first film, but the first film is certainly better. However, I still enjoyed ROTF and the exhillarating ride that Michael Bay kept me, and the audience, through. PS: Now that the robots talk more, the movie has a lot of cursing/swearing. Do robots really need to swear? Oh, and the parents were back with their comedic selves. Haha, everyone's gotta love the mom! Oh, and there's a lot of dick jokes in the movie. The audience and I saw the giant wrecking balls on the gigantic transformer dude, and we all laughed. Was it really needed? Oh, and NEST stands for Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers. I wish the freaking movie explained that, so as to not confuse people.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I went into this movie with the same expectations as the last one and it delivered ten-fold. Awesome fighting scenes, the forest scene was epic and so was entire Egypt scene. The small amounts of comedy added to the movie in my opinion, but that may not be for everyone. People seem to dislike the plot but I thought it was pretty good, nothing amazing, but not absolutely terrible. But seriously, this is a TRANSFORMERS movie, which after the first one (and definitely after this one) should be synonymous with action. My advice to the people who were disappointed for some reason...go smoke a joint or something and take the movie for what it is, not what it isn't. Just my 2 cents.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Every now and then you actually feel overloaded yet elated from all this, but then you start to get numb from it after the 2nd hour with no contrast, asking yourself is this all there is? No one expects an academy award in a film like this, but with Spielberg's ongoing push to move Hollywood to Bollywood to retain old studio system profit goals. We can predict an Oscar in Special Effects this year with this Bollywood calling card.For film fans who like more than CGI you might be let down. For those of us who bought a ticket, expect even more of these films as we financially reward studios for delivering these products.But with the overpriced tickets today, you do get 2.5 hrs of movie for your money, and some of the most intense CGI scenes ever. But not much else is really behind the virtual curtain. Even with the extremely hot females cast in the film, the rest of this film is a limp and lifeless mass, with no real hook to it.For the younger ones who liked the first Transformers, obviously money talks because PG-13 for liberals is a bit under-rated for this R film. However most desensitized teens will be fine; but some parents may not appreciate the drugs, sexual scenes, language, crude humor, alternate lifestyles, graphic violence, intense action and battle sequences. Take the last Transformers and multiply it 10 times for your elementary school kids.The battle scenes in Egypt were truly a thrill ride. In a theater environment, this might be worth the money alone. Since no home theater system for most of us can shake from the action like this movie does.But like a traffic accident on the side of the road: you still turn your head to watch, even though you know you'll probably be disappointed again. You will still talk about the graphics at work the next day, but not much else really registers even on the drive home.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I know it's just a mindless summer blockbuster, but Mikey Bay didn't have to take the mindless part to heart. There's just a ridiculous amount of plot holes and inconsistencies.It just seemed like the writers wrote the script in one go, and didn't bother to read over it. It's really surprising considering two of them were the Star Trek writers which was a great film. Revenge of the Fallen could not even meet the mediocrity of the first film. It's almost like Bay just decided we're gonna have more of everything in this film. They tried way too hard to be funny whereas the first picked its moments rather well, and was pretty entertaining as a result. There is certainly more action, but it seemed more incomprehensible than the first one. I didn't have a problem following the action in the first Transformers, but there were literally two separate instances in which i thought Megatron was killed when he wasn't. If i had to sum up this movie in a condensed manner I'd call it a really crappy anime shot in live-action. It's all about robots and up-skirts with this one.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Whats with the all the gangsta rap/black stereotypes? I heard about it before I saw this movie and thought some people are overreacting , but after watching it I was like wtf, thats weird. One good thing was the soundtrack and or song by Linkin Park that was one of the best songs for a soundtrack ever. I doubt Michael bay even saw or researched transformers before making these two movies he just glimpsed and ran with the movie production. Like Chinese director for Hulk supposed to be Incredible Hulk he knew nothing about it , we know how that turned out, this is a little better , but eerily similar in how it turns out in some ways.

When Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes appeared, the movie went on the correct way. It came with more logical order in comparison with the Transformer 1. All details of the movie were interesting and reasonable. If you go to the cinema, you can enjoy the spectacular actions with a lot of new robots. The movie also came with some touch moments but in some scenes, it seems to take a little long time and make you tired in waiting for the next action scenes.

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN has bigger action setpieces, but at the expense of a coherent script, likable characters and a general reason to give a crap about anything that happens. If all you care about are action sequences with hunks of metal duking it out, you'll be in heaven. I was not. My sole memory of seeing this in theaters was leaving with a headache. While I didn't have the same experience watching it on Blu-ray some five years later, a lot of what is wrong with this film stuck out to me even more. Since the AllSpark from the previous entry is all but destroyed, they had to come up with a new MacGuffin. They came up with Energon and something called the Matrix of Leadership, which is as ill-defined as the AllSpark was, except that there's more pointless backstory and exposition to go with it. Another thing that got more screen-time was Michael Bay's unique sense of ""humor."" We're treated to two Autobots who are vaguely racist caricatures as well as an abundance of sexual humor that falls flat most of the time. And more exposition. And military porn. And things hitting other things in slo-mo. There is literally nothing to admire about this movie other than some great scenery, landscape shots and (admittedly) jaw-dropping visual effects. This movie is about Transformers, but the most succinct plot description is ""Guy finally says 'I love you' to his girlfriend."" Pathetic. This movie is pure eye candy, to be sure, but it's the kind that you can break your teeth on if you aren't careful.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The cars and the action scenes are great, no doubt about that. But in typical Michael Bay fashion, it could have been so much better than what we saw.Biggest problem of all is that the Transformers themselves are basically second-billers in their own movie. Way too much emphasis, story, and screen time is centered around humans. I didn't sit down to watch the drama from the humans. I sat down to watch a bunch of cool transformers fighting and destroying stuff. Point blank.Another huge issue with this movie is the obvious, Michael Bay's involvement. Everything he touches turns to crap. And do I even have to mention how extremely annoying it is that every single camera angle always has to have some form of over-exposed blinding flash in it?? That got annoying after the first few minutes of the film. And it continues throughout the entire movie.At times, the writing even felt as disappointing as the film's other flaws. For example, Megatron died but is magically brought back to life. Same deal with Optimus. So why even bother killing any transformer if they are just going to be brought back to life anyways? Lazy writing. That's why.I could go on and on about the movie's flaws. But I'd be here all day. Instead, I'll just say that this film definitely does entertain if you ignore all the other flaws. Basically, just turn off your brain and enjoy robots destroying stuff.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

All the flaws that the first movie had were magnified with more shouty characters, stereotypes, sexual innuendos, voyeurism and excessive action. The first had a simple blockbuster plot, whereas this movie has so many plot threads and moves at such a fast pace it's confusing. There's also an overload of comic relief which is funny at times but loses its impact as the movie goes along. However it isn't an irredeemable picture since the spectacular effects and sound design are all top notch as always. Even in the first movie I found the action scenes hard to follow since its often shot in medium/close-up instead of a nice wide shot showing off the giant robots. For once there's a fight shot in wide between Optimus Prime and Megatron before Optimus dies, only to be resurrected later for the plot's convenience. Transformers was like the male variant of Twilight, they were both commercial franchise that appealed to certain gender desires. Twilight depicted the female fantasy of a man saving them in the most dire situations. Whereas Transformers showcased the male fantasies of beautiful scantily clad women loving a dorky lad for no apparent reason and of course action and explosions galore.Now I don't believe Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the worst movies ever, I've seen plenty of schlock to know what a truly terrible movie entails. However, this was definitely a downgrade from the first, which in retrospect wasn't all that great either. It was more of the same garbage in the first on a larger scale.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Michael Bay once again succeeded in completely missing the point of what CG is all about. CG is a tool, not a replacement for any coherent plot and even acceptable acting. I do not expect a popcorn action movie to have a really intricate plot line or first class acting, but some minimum is required; you can only gloss over so many insufficiencies with more explosions and CG. The movie is incredibly fast-paced, which I attribute to an attempt to prevent movie-goers from stopping to think about all the plot holes and sappy lines. Non of the characters are at all fleshed out, the characters added for comic relief are simply annoying and not even remotely funny.To sum this movie up in a few words I'd say that anyone planning on watching it can prepare for a bunch of well-animated CG explosions and machine gun-totting robots, but nothing in terms of plot or acting.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It might of been better. without that strike, but maybe it wouldn't have been. Im only hoping for the best since Bay took out fox for the last of the trilogy. Especially since they will have Sam's girlfriend removed and have him meet someone else is disappointing. She has been there with him from the start and I think they should finish it together.

It was the first film I had seen on the big screen for a long time and I'll admit to having been slightly (very much) blown away by it at the time. Now, just over a year later I have given it a second viewing and, having seen a lot more films in between, I have somewhat changed my opinion. Man can do that right? Change their minds? Just thought I'd check.Optimus Prime and the Autobots, with some new members, are seeking out Decepticon agents around the Earth. They are helped by an international military force called NEST. Sam Witwicky has found a shard of the 'AllSpark', a device which was destroyed in the first Transformers movie, which he accidentally touches. He is preparing to go to college, leaving his girlfriend Mikaela Barnes and Bumblebee, his Autobot guardian, behind. Having arrived at college, he finds himself blacking out and seeing mysterious symbols. A worried Mikaela flies out to join him and Bumblebee also makes his way there to protect his ward. The Decepticons know what these symbols mean and they want Sam I think that's enough about the plot.First of all, the CGI work on this film is excellent, some really cool effects and some excellent stunt work combine to make it visually quite stunning. Unfortunately I found I didn't warm to any of the characters, they had no depth and so it ended up being quite a hollow experience. So with no stand-out performances, honourable mentions go to Shia LaBeouf as Sam and Megan Fox as Mikaela; Josh Duhamel returned as Captain Lennox and John Turturro also returned as Agent Simmons / Jetfire. Kevin Dunn and Julie White also return as Sam's parents Ron and Judy Witwicky. The Transformers were voiced by Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime), Hugo Weaving (Megatron) and Tony Todd (The Fallen).Over all a visually exciting and even, at times, an entertaining film that unfortunately has little depth. The running time is far too long, which also doesn't help. I guess if you're a fourteen year old boy then you'll enjoy this, but ultimately you'll only remember the funny bit on the pyramid and some of the robot fight scenes. So, not really recommended if you're a serious movie lover, but if you're young at heart and want to switch your brain off for a while, go for it!My score: 5.4/10","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I don't listen to the haters who long for a cult classic every time they go to the theaters and are most likely just jealous that Bay has the coolest job in the world; he gets to blow lots of stuff up and make millions of dollars for it.I was a big fan of Transformers, and I feel that Revenge of the Fallen did a good job of keeping pace with the first. This time it's bigger, louder and much more boggling to all of your senses. The Action scenes feature bigger robots and bigger expanses of land to comprise the settings, such as the entire Egyptian desert. The plot does suffer from noticeable (HUGE actually) flaws such as Sam and his entourage enter the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum (Which is in Washington DC for those who don't know, Michael Bay being obviously doesn't) and then run out the back door only to find themselves in some sort of airplane graveyard desert . Oops.Unfortunately, I found myself constantly laughing out loud at the repetitive use of shots and sequences that were blatantly copy and pasted from basically every other Michael Bay film. The low angled shot of a slow motion jumbo jet passing overhead is ripped straight out of the first Bad Boys. Then we move to a scene where a series of marines barge into an underground vault where an alarm has been tripped, but for some reason this scene looked very familiar. Maybe it was because I had already seen it in the opening scene of The Rock. Then there is Armageddon. Oh man, where do I begin? Lets see, we have an exact replica of the shot from outer space where an asteroid (in this case an alien) is traveling directly into our atmosphere. And then there's the sequence where the asteroids (aliens) are tearing apart Paris as they fall from the sky. Bay should have saved himself some money and just edited in the scenes where Asteroids beat down on New York City because they looked the same to me. Going down the list we come to Pearl Harbor. As more alien asteroids fall to earth, a few conveniently plunge through an aircraft carrier just so Bay could have a slow motion underwater shot of the boat sinking. From Bad Boys 2 we have the scene where the camera continuously moves 360 degrees through a crack house, passing through little holes and openings in the wall with Will and Martin on one side and some Haitian druggies on the other. This time it's Shai and Megan on one side of an Egyptian shack and killer robots on the other side. And of course every Bay movie has that one low angled, slow motion, 360 shot of the main character, that is quickly becoming a trademark of all his movies. However, this movie has just about as many 360 slow-mo shots as Michael Bay has movies. Even the killing of alien robots has become overly extreme and in some cases graphic. This is no doubt a tribute to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th, which are both produced by Bay.Overall the movie is an enjoyable summer blockbuster thrill ride. The action keeps the pace moving, the comedic punch lines offer some flavorful color and lets just be honest, Megan Fox is smokin' hot! It's still a Bay film so don't go expecting Oscar gold. This movie is a series of big budget explosions strung together with tidbits of story line but worth seeing.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

That is the one word I think accurately describes this cinematic experience. Michael Bay, a director of some talent and a filmmaker with credits like The Rock, Bad Boys, and the first Transformers film, goes out of control here with the special effects and opens one big can of cheese as story, logic, acting, and character development take the back seat - in a bus! The story is so convoluted and so ludicrous that I defy anyone to tell me that he/she really understood all that was going on, because it is clear the director and the actors haven't a clue. There is no way a child sitting through this maze of machines forming, transforming, and uttering ridiculous dialog would be able at any point to tell you what was going on AND why it was going on. That is how little time is devoted to exposition. Odd you might think considering the film is two and a half hours long! I am not one of those people that hates long movies - I only am bothered by them when they feel like long movies. This one felt like three or four hours long. I kept thinking to myself when will this mess end. Look, for those of you wanting to see the special effects. There is no way you will be disappointed. I need more of that. If you want sophomoric dialog, juvenile situations, and Megan Fox in huggingly tight shorts and white jeans - you are in luck too. If you want character acting devoid of logic with Kevein Dunn and Julie White playing Shia's parents like they were in an over-acting concert or Ramon Rodriguez hamming it up with a butt roast rather than slices - then you are in luck. I found few bright spots in this film for me. I need something more than one scene after another of mindless transforming and one-liners meant to be funny to a quasi-literate adolescent. The first film, also directed by Bay, was more of that. It was by no means a great film, but it was entertaining and did spend oodles more time in development of plot and characters. This film tries to feed off that development but fails miserably because those plot elements and characters were not wholly formed. Maybe I am getting all bent out of shape for nothing more than what this film was supposed to be - but I have seen it done better - even by this director who excels in that kind of film. The brightest spots for me were Rainn Wilson in a cameo as a professor with a great opening in a class and John Turturro reprising his role with much less dignity but nevertheless some acting skill.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sometimes they all seem to be bundled together that I didn't know who was who. The fight scenes & the computer effects were great. The humor was good and you can't beat the main character, perfect actor for the part. I wonder why there was no good song this time, that would have kicked it up a notch.

"4","/10","Should've been called ""Explosion: The Movie.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2086466/?ref_=tt_urv","SebaZava","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4610211/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2009","Simply put, this second Transformers flick should've been called Explosion: The Movie. There are more scenes of destruction, shooting, bombing, exploding, fighting, jumping, punching and running than in any other Bay movie, war movie, science fiction movie, action flick or any of the actual World Wars. If this film hasn't broken any kind of destruction records, then I don't know what can. And this kind of exaggeration could indeed be thrilling - or even funny - were it not for some of the silliness Bay and his team of writers decide to include. The first Transformers worked because, when compared to the sequel, it was pretty nuanced. (Never thought I would say something like that about a Bay movie.) Revenge of the Fallen has too much of everything, and on top of that, it's definitely too long. Not a completely bad film - although most of the North American critics will definitely state the contrary - but, in my book, an inferior movie to its predecessor.Michael Bay is the master of all things action, and he certainly shows his skills here, blowing up everything that could possibly explode. I kinda liked the action, I guess - there are tons of explosions - duh -, tons of scenes of the military trying to shoot at the bad robots, using missiles, bombs, tanks, machine guns, guns and aircraft, and a lots of scenes featuring robots trying to beat the crap out of each other. The thing is, there comes a moment when it's all too much, when it all becomes too repetitive and over-the-top. I guess I could say there are too many explosions, too much shooting and too much use of a shaky cam - and yes, that's precisely the way the movie makes you feel: that there's too much, and that it all should have stopped like ten scenes ago. During the first 2/3 or so of the movie the action is relentless in the sense that it doesn't cease to entertain, but during the last 30 or 40 minutes it's relentless in the sense that it just keeps coming. Come on, Bay, you of all people should know when to stop.Other problem? Just like there's too much action, too many explosions and too many scenes - the film is definitely about half an hour too long -, there are too many robots. Guys like Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and even The Fallen we can recognize. The thing is, there are like twenty other robots in the movie, and Bay doesn't even have the decency to show them without shaking his camera. Moreover, they don't have any personality - they just have names or colors. I liked the bickering between Megatron and Starscream; I somehow liked the little robot which turned into a toy car, and I definitely enjoyed the way the old transformer with a beard and a walking cane was presented, but what about those two that turned into bikes? Or the annoying twins that make Jar Jar Binks seem hilarious? Or that big one that ate all that sand in Egypt and seemed to have a pair of big, metallic balls between his legs? (Yes, that's Bay's idea of sophisticated humour.) I'm sure the movie could have done with ten or so robots less.It's not like Bay cares about acting, but some of the actors that participate in his movies at least care about their performances. Take Shia LaBeouf, for example, who tries to inject some humanity into his character despite the fact that the screenplay uses him only to run and shout. If Sam is charismatic and worth rooting for - and ultimately works as a compelling leading character - it's because of LaBeouf, not due to the filmmakers' work. I also liked Josh Duhamel, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents were pretty funny. John Turturro, reprising his role from the previous movie, gave a memorable performance as always, although his character has somehow changed. On the other hand, I didn't get the point of Megan Fox's character. Okay, so she's incredibly hot, but she was also incredibly useless. Pure eye-candy, no substance. (We're talking about Megan Fox here, guys, not the movie... or are we?) Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is all right because, despite all its flaws, it definitely never bored me, and because from a visual and technical standpoint, it's certainly a marvel, something worth taking a look at. The film is a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly, and one of the hardest films I've ever had to review, only because I was terribly entertained by it, but also - very frequently - terrified by it. And not because it's a scary movie, but because it can be a very bad movie. Still, it's got some terrific action sequences - which kind get old during the last half an hour or so of running time - and some very funny parts, so those who liked the first - superior - movie should have a blast with this one. The rest of us puny humans, though, will be left exhausted by the time the end credits start to roll. I wonder why three writers - two of them being responsible for the screenplay of the amazing and decidedly smarter Star Trek - were needed to pen the movie's screenplay. I don't even remember if there was any dialogue... and if there was, was it really needed? Wasn't this a series of action sequences, CGI scenes and shots of Megan Fox running in slow motion with the camera focusing on her breasts?","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is a romance part to the story that is unnecessary and time consuming as well as attempts at humor which just aren't very funny. The special effects are excellent but once you have seen one robot fight you've seen them all and the sound of machine guns and robot noise for two and a half hours isn't very pleasant. Megan Fox is looking good but the scene with her in hot pants and when her titties are bouncing are both included in the trailer. May I suggest just watching the trailer - it has a transformer fight, some explosions, Megan Fox and some good special effects all wrapped into a minute or two, there is no need to stretch it out to 2.5 hours.200 Million dollars this cost. How sad. What a waste of money, there are awesome films out there made with a quarter of this budget.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

And there sure is lots of it. But that's where it ends. There is very little substance in this movie. Not enough for the amount of time dedicated to it, anyway.There are some funny moments, but mostly there's action. When the movie moves away from the action to try and build a story line, it's weak. Especially entertaining to me are the Transformers' lines. For the most part...cheeeeesy. Particularly when Fallen is involved. His request for revenge is somewhat unimportant to the movie. It seems to be a vehicle who's only use is to give a reason for all the Transformers to fight.Most telling to me was when my 16 year-old cousin turns to me 2/3s of the way through the movie and says ""You know, this really isn't doing anything for me."" Me either.Like many reviews I've seen, it's an assault on the senses. There's so much action and noise for so long that it's almost not worth it. It's like having a hot dog with so much ketchup on it you can't taste anything else. IMO, Star Trek was much better...and I can't WAIT for Harry Potter. Revenge's record for 3-day haul will most certainly 'fall'...pardon the pun.4 out of 10 because of the CGI.

I'm beginning to think the professional movie critics all saw ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" on a bad day. Even my favorite reviewer, Roger Ebert, whom I usually agree with 8 times out of 10, blew it on this one.While this movie isn't perfect, it is far from the mish-mash of explosions and action reported by the critics.This is Michael Bay (who has come a long way from ""Armageddon"")at his best and I'm beginning to think he is the new ""Master of Disaster"" in action and horror films, though one wonders what Irwin Allen would have done with CGI (rest in peace Irwin).You want eye candy - explosions and destruction on a massive scale? Bay provides it. Digital sound effects that will rock your seat? Bay comes through. Action? Bay's best efforts yet. There's even story here if you go to the theater and look to be entertained instead of finding fault. How much of a story can you expect from a line of robot toys anyway? After all, this isn't Charles Dickens, Stephen King, or John Grisham and it isn't intended to be.I had the pleasure of seeing this in an all digital theater and it was awesome - as good as the first film. I can only imagine the IMAX experience.So, forget the critics. Go see this for what it's meant to be, pure entertainment. Don't expect a ""Best Movie"" contender, but don't think it's comparable to some recent horrible Hollywood remake either.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Michael Bay is renowned for not giving the slightest damn about a movies story, and that's all good and well but why is he making 2 and a half hour movies? This movie is filled with scenes that make about as much sense as the third Matrix movie, but yet it's even dumber. For god's sake's people, he put testicles on one of the robots. I really don't have much to even say other than this is one of the worst things mankind has ever created. At the very least it ranks among the Pearl Harbor attacks in terms of total disaster.

The only difference is that we may not really impressed on the second, since the elements of ""WOW"" already shown much at the first movie.I watch the premiere of Revenge of the Fallen, and the whole of what I was saying on the first paragraph up there was wrong.The movie still make me impressed. It still got the elements of humor everywhere, and the placement of the humor was great. Autobots VS Decepticons fight scenes also almost dominate the whole 150 minutes of the movie. Although the elements of fighting still same like the first one, They were improved by mostly, by providing new Autobots and Decepticons on the screen, and giving new style of fight (e.g: when Optimus fighting 3 Deceptions alone, it still impressed me until the end of movie).The greatest improvement of Revenge of The Fallen is how the storyline works. Although it was not perfect, complex, or dark story, but the storyline is enjoyable. I'm quite sure most of the watchers wouldn't go out from the cinema, and find out the end of movie was... ""Oh, Sam put the cube to Megatron chest, and Megatron died. Why Optimus not tell Sam to put the cube on Megatron's chest at the first place ? what a crappy story"".Revenge of the Fallen is a great movie, but just like the others, This movie is not perfect one. The jokes, although really entertaining, it seems that the jokes are kind of vulgar. Personally, I laughed at the jokes. The problem lies on Dads and Moms, who bring out their 5 or 10-years old child to watch bumblebee acts. It really should be like PG-13 or 18.The biggest mistake of this movie lies on the CG for the robots. Somehow, you'll find out that the robots' body are not ""clean"" enough, compared with the Autobots or Decepticons on the first movie. I won't show detailed on what scene the ""unclean animation"" occurs, but you have to watch for yourself to find out. They are seems to looked very clear on the screen.Overall, I would vote for 8/10. It would be one of my perfect movie of this season, if only they have more time to clean up the CG Robots to be ""looked real"" just like on the first one.

Dive bombing so much promise into an eternity of hatred; instantly switching a blooming franchise into a notorious cluster of nonsense.With Decepticon leader Megatron disposed of, the Autobots receive reinforcements and team up with human soldiers to hunt down the remaining Decepticons. But little do they know that an ancient Decepticon, known as The Fallen, seeks to destroy Earth. Sam, a college freshman now, holds the key to The Fallen's final plan. Or something like that.Okay, so I will be honest... this film is deplorable. A fine line divides what I consider good (the 2007 film) and this, and it mostly comes down to a tragically misaligned screenplay. Scenes come and go, no build up, no tension, no anticipation, no reason, and this mash lasts for over one-hundred and fifty minutes! The reason for this is simple; during the film's development and production there was a strike at the screenwriter's guild. Lead writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman only had a premise before filming began (that's right, no script) so a third writer, Ehren Kruger, was called in to start work on the film. Plus, Michael Bay himself worked on the script, story and even design of some robots. They also had no plans for a sequel to begin with since Transformers '07 was a bigger hit than expected, and a release date barely more than a year after conception was far too optimistic. Need I say more?A lot of people don't appreciate how Bay's influence here is much greater than in the first film, or all of these production problems, and ultimate condemn all three films to be equal to its worst part. This part.This film should be the darker turn in the series: the Decepticons are here and want revenge but no... RotF is packed with unnecessary characters, scenes and a surreal focus on all the wrong things. Terrible comedic turns, cool characters are ignored for unbearable racist stereotypes, character development that bears no emotional impact. The script is noisy and repetitive and the editing is ugly (did I mention that Bay actually re-uses footage, including some from the first film!) You could argue, as I have in the past, that this is Transformers! It is silly and it is a cartoon for kids, it shouldn't mean anything. But there's being entertaining, and then there's being obnoxious.The film still looks good. The opening battle in Shanghai is awesome and feels like a good start to the continuation of the series, the robots are fifty-fifty of good and bad designs outside of the returning characters (some of them are very creative looking). It was wonderful to see Ravage in live action, and I am one of the few who liked Jetfire and Soundwave. Sadly though the climax of the movie is far too messily shot to feel rewarding and the worst crime of all: we barely see the Transformers actually transform. Unlike the first film, this one doesn't glorify it with any scenes tailored specifically for transformations.I was disappointed even upon the first viewing, and though I still say the Transformers themselves redeem some of its awfulness, the more I watch it... the more I get tired of the rife Bay-isms. At best this is a guilty pleasure, more than the other films in the series.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I liked the first film a lot, being a childhood fan of the G1 series. But there were several ""wince"" moments that I just couldn't get around, namely the extremely badly placed awkward humor. After seeing the trailer for ""Fallen"", I had genuine hopes that Bay had learned from his mistakes in the first, and would give us what TF needed to be in the first place; a hardcore giant robot movie that could give us a firm plot and quippy, smart humor throughout. What I got was a major disappointment.Instead of fixing the flaws that were in the first film and running with what worked, Michael Bay did the exact opposite: less Original-TF like action and development, and a Bonecrusher-load of awkward humor. Throughout the entire movie, I was seriously waiting for the film to get serious (like the first film did toward the end). Just as the plot was about to take off, they just had to throw in a few more gags. Seriously, Michael. ""Ghetto Twin"" Autobots? Simmons in a dheli? A leg-humping Wheelie? ""Wrecking ball scrotum""? Altogether, it seems to me that they had a pretty good storyline, but decided to throw it in a blender with a whole bunch of slapstick crap.I really tried to like this movie, and I probably would've if it didn't make me wince so much.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Here they were just too many robots without any introductions. They was too much time given for the vehicles to get converted to autobots. As for the villain robots, they didn't take so much time to convert themselves. Too much time was given Megan Fox to look pretty, too!! Anyway, i watched movie and then tried forgetting about it, that's it. It was not that great a movie as i thought it would be. What to watch out in the movie is Optimus Prime!! The other thing that i like is the action sequence in the Deserts, there is something about the director and the desert sequence, since even the last time, when eh was working on this movie, his opening sequence was in the desert. It just reminds me of one of my favourite movie Mummy.Coming back to Optimus Prime, he is the heart and soul of the movie, at least that i what i want to believe, but then you have the human characters Shia LeBouf. How does he get all these roles - Transformers, Indiana Jones, all big budget movies.I love Magatron, too.

A full sized, realistic Optimus Prime battling an equally awe inspiring Megatron, complete with the whining Starscream, the ever loyal Ironhide or Soundwave, and the whole host of Transformers.Beyond that, Michael Bay does what he does best, creates an amazing experience for the eye and ear unlike any other director. Bear in mind he does so with the full backing of the most critically acclaimed American director of the past thirty years. Of course, it's not for everyone to enjoy, nor is it meant to be, but if you liked the first Transformers, there is no reason you wouldn't like RotF.On the other hand, it is different from the first movie. The plot is a little less believable. Then again, it is a plot dealing with a giant alien robot war happening in our backyard. The logic rulebook should be immediately tossed out and you should prep your suspension of disbelief to reach all new rubbery lengths before you step foot in the theater. That in mind, anyone familiar with the cartoon will not notice anything altogether out of the ordinary for the Transformer universe. This movie does not pretend to cling to reality, which is part of the fun.The humor hits a little harder this time, but some of the jokes are misses and groaners. Three times throughout the movie I found myself saying aloud that a joke was unnecessary. The sexuality is overt, but again, when you put Megan Fox in a movie, you're really trotting out your one trick pony so anyone paying money to see the movie should expect the one trick.The last drawback is the pacing. The movie starts in a large battle and ends in a larger battle with a very jolting and sudden grinding halt in the middle. To be honest, the pacing makes sense if there were an act break, where the audience could step out and digest for a few minutes then return for the conclusion. Absent of that, the second third of the movie seems to drag and jump.On the whole, the movie does exactly what it set out to do. It's no more outlandish or overdone than the original. The graphics are more refined and the audio and score remain top notch for this type of film. I highly recommended it to my friends and so far none have been disappointed.Note: Many say that this movie demands that you check your IQ at the door and I recommend doing just that.

Because that's all it is and ever will be. In a nutshell, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a victim of many things: the 2007/2008 'Writer's Strike', that resulted in the film's incoherent plot. It's also a victim of Michael Bay's obnoxious humour, that is crammed into this movie, and a victim of Michael's signature plain cringey moments that permeate this film to the core. It's also a victim of Michael Bay's terrible oversexualisation, that also permeates most of his films. Those things drag this film down to the terrible state it's in. But there are some good things about this film. The Forest Battle is excellent and is the best action scene in all the Bayformers films, ironically. And the CGI is very good, just as good as Jablonsky's epic score for this film. But these things don't save this steaming pile of garbage. Don't see this film unless you want to appreciate good movies even more because of it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think Michael Bay did a great job in creating a movie about a TOY. I understand why critics are burning this one to the ground, such as plot holes, and racism. BUT WHO CARES!? ITS A MOVIE BASED ON A TOY! A toy that everyone, if not everyone, has played with or seen once in their lifetime. A vehicle that transforms into a robot. A crazy ridiculous idea that has amazed and fascinated billions of KIDS for years. And they made a movie about it. The first transformers movie had a pretty good story, but revenge of the fallen action was much more amazing than the first one. If you go into the movie expecting to see a great FILM, which it is not, you will be disappointed. A FILM is a message or a story that puts the audience in an emotional stance about a character(s). A MOVIE is something I can take my girlfriend to on a Friday night to just entertain ourselves for that 2 hours. And ""critics"" do not see the difference. Everything must be perfect for them. Its like if you were to go to Disney Land, one of the greatest places on earth, with a sour attitude, of course your experience is going to be miserable if you act and think that way throughout the whole time you are there. You are just going to ruin everyone else experience with your attitude. But going to see this MOVIE with a open mind about a TOY, I was blown away. Fights I had with my own transformer toys I had as a kid were not as epic as Michael Bay put on screen and I thank Michael Bay for this.It's hard for a director in these times to have a vision and to fulfill his vision from start to finish without big power house production companies stepping in and taking over because that's not how they want to release it. Tearing not just one persons work but many people who put their heart and soul into a MOVIE or a FILM. Michael Bay did his job as he was paid to do, as a director should. Now-a-days production companies are so worried that they won't make a buck, and step in not knowing what the hell is going on and ruin everything. Fox is the worst about it next to Sony (Spider-Man 3 ring a bell?). Warner Bros. actually gives freedom to their visionaries (Chris Nolan, Zach Snyder) as well as Paramount and Universal. And you can see it has paid off well with them. Marvel opened up there first studio a few years ago not knowing what the hell they were doing. They handed Jon Favreau Iron Man and got out of his way. Iron Man is now a pop culture icon because of him. Yet studios have not learned from this?It is funny how studios did come as low as to a TOY to make a MOVIE. And recycle characters to this day (Friday the Thirteenth, Texas Chainsaw) it's insulting to the public. ""The public is so stupid we will just retell the story make more money off them"". If studios are not willing to take risk as they had in the past of introducing Jason, Michael Myers, or even Marty McFly they wouldn't be where they are now. And Michael Bay was given a TOY. By Paramount. The writers' strike went on last year, and Michael Bay still worked on the movie cause he believed in it. And I respect anyone who has a passion in whatever they do and overcome the obstacles that hit their way. People and ""critics"" need to relax about this movie. I feel bad for Michael Bay getting what he has got from ""critics"" the last few weeks...BUT IT WAS A MOVIE BASED ON A TOY!! Megan Fox recently had the guts to tell Michael Bay that he focused on special effects than acting and that's why its getting bad reviews. Have you not seen his last 7 films Megan? Better yet did you not read the script? As a professional actress should? I guess you just waited for these ""critics"" and just changed sides because you're scared about your career. You did film the movie? I mean that was you bending over on the bike right? Did that moment not hit you and say ""hey I'm not acting, the camera is just dollying to my butt"" I mean he did say he was writing it a little over a year ago. Did I mention THE MOVIE IS BASED ON A TOY! The story is going to follow robots that can transform , then Shia Labeouf. You are just there to make 9 and 10 yr old boy hit puberty early, and become this generation sex icon. And I don't know if pissing off Michael Bay is a good thing considering he is friends with Steven Spielberg, one or the very people who made Hollywood what it is today. Also who got you a start in Hollywood to begin with. As much money as she is getting paid, acting classes should be pocket change for her if she really cared about acting. Megan, yeah you were perfectly crafted by God which is awesome, but he did not give you skills to become an actress. But it's OK. Halle Berry couldn't act when she first started. She worked hard and got an Oscar. So if you really want to act, work at it. Finally the whole racism thing. WHO CARES?! Its 2009! it's not the '50s anymore you old farts. The twin autobots were entertaining. If you're going to say ""oh I see 2 robots acting black."" who cares!? They didn't say anything against black people. You're racist for thinking about it. And no one likes a racist so drop it. Thanks Michael Bay for a great MOVIE!!!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is one heck of a sequel. I was absolutely amazed. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The good: the effects (zowie!), better jokes and Sam's mom was hysterical. The ""twins"" also added some great humor. The bad: filming crews tend to forget that when they film with their backs to the sun, they can still be seen. In several scenes, you could see the film crew shadows. Also, in the opening scene, the action was so fast it was hard to tell who was who and it ended too quickly. The ending also screeched to a halt. It could have used a little more cool-down time. The ugly: I also took my two kids (8 and 6). There was, unfortunately, more language in this one and a lot more sexual jokes-- good thing the kids are too young to understand them. There was one scene that I had to cover their eyes because it was a little gross for them. But overall, they loved it.Then I started talking to some people and some are calling it racist. Personally, I have no idea where they're getting that from. But you'll always find people who complain no matter what. These are probably the same people that said ""The Lion King"" was racist too. This is a perfect summer flick: amazing effects, well-timed humor and characters you could feel for. All in all, I loved it and I'll definitely see it again.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'll be honest I walked in skeptical after reading the reviews, but came out confused at why it was getting this punishment. If you liked the first one you'll LOVE this one! When you go see a film titled ""TRANSFORMERS"", DO NOT expect this years ""Best Picture with dazzling performances (well, the robots performed, but until there is a best supporting autobot award, you still are watching Lebouf and Fox at the lead, not exactly DiCaprio & Winslett!!!)"". This is not Slumdog Millionaire, No Country for Old Men, etc etc. this was clearly made as an action film. and it was a GREAT action film. This film had just as good of a plot (actually 3, 1 main and 2 great sub plots, saying no more, don't want any spoilers!) as the first film. The acting was maybe even a step up (even MEgan Fox, wasn't all there just for her stunning STUNNINGNESS, she actually wasn't a piece of wood talking). The only downfall is Bay struggles at overusing a joke multiple times, too many sexual innuendos, but it doesn't distract you for long at all. He could have also narrowed down some scenes(not the action though!) to bring the film to 2hrs from 2 1/2, but it wasn't hard to watch either way. I can't say much more, sometimes, especially with the way the world is today, you need to step out of reality and into a world of entertainment, that is what the magic of movies is all about, and for 2 1/2 hours, I was there again, and its been awhile since I went to a movie with no intent on dissecting it, just watching it for pure fun!!! Im sure my review on Public Enemies will be more in depth, and why not, Depp, Bale, Mann...The basic...GREAT ACTION, Great intriguing plots for an action film, good character development for old and new characters, hilarious one liners, and Bumblebee and Optimus are killer! Go see this film to be entertained and enjoy some Michael Bayed explosions, DO NOT go if you can't just enjoy some fun without being critical, Stupid critics, wait for a film that is centered around drama and A-list actors who are EXPECTED to give it their all!!!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I personally looked for 2hours+ of enjoyment and i got it. Maybe others want a deeper storyline with twists in it but a movie cannot serve the demands of all. This movie has three purposes: 1.to keep throwing action scenes at you 2. to generate a storyline that is likely to bring out another sequel and 3. to please the transformers fans that came to see robots fighting.Lets face it, this movie is unlikely to win an Oscar but in terms of action scenes, it is jam packed full of em. The jokes are kinda cheesy but they're not the kind to make you cringe in your seat. Megan Fox's acting was as dull as ever but whoever said she was hired to act? Everyone knows shes there as the eye candy and that is her purpose in the film. I just don't understand what others expect from such a film...So anyway, for all those out there who have yet to watch it, if you've watched the first one then this one is pretty much the same. You're going to get a whole load of action with robots fighting and bombs blasting away. You're going to get Megan Fox as great eye candy and nothing more just like the first one. You're also going to find that the time flies by pretty quickly even though some scenes seem to be dragged out needlessly. Therefore, if you have not watched it, make up your own opinion of it. Trusting someone else's point of view here is the same as jumping off a cliff just because someone else thinks its a good idea.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Nor is it a full-blown kiddie-movie (Hook) or an epic drama (Empire of the Sun).Oh, Steven Spielberg is not the director you say, well he is kind-off involved (Executive producer) and to me this really is a guilty pleasure. This brings out the child in him like we've never seen and reminds us all that we did like this stuff when we were young as well. Is it brainless and witty? (one might say mind-blowing...) Is it unpretentious? Does it look awesome? Yes, yes and yes. Is it smart? Is it life-changing? Does it make a difference to the world? No, no and no.This is simple pure fun at its best. So please, just switch off, lighten up and enjoy. Life is not only about Citizen Kane, Synecdoche, 2001 or Memento (to name just a few).

What you should ignore are the negative reviews by the critics. They are the worst people on this earth . Even worse than the Decepticons. The first Transformers was a refreshing change from the usual summer movies . It was funny, action packed , well-acted and well-made. This one however surpasses the original and is the biggest blockbuster ever. Shia LaBeouf,as usual is great , Megan Fox is smokin' hot and the other people who impress are John Turturro as Simmons and Ramon Rodriguez as Leo . In this movie , the Decepticons return to Earth to capture Sam Witwicky as he finds out about the origin of the Transformers and in his mind is the map of the location of a weapon which will destroy the Earth. Joining the mission to protect the humans are the autobots , Optimus Prime, Bumblebee ,Ironhide and many more new autobots.The best moments in this movie are the action scenes . They are really good and this movie should win the Oscar for Visual Effects. This movie is also very funny and most of the gags are provided be Simmons, Leo and a few transformers. Michael Bay has done a very good job and like most of his movies , this one has been received negatively by critics. To the people who have not seen this movie because of the critics, please watch it .Its a lot of fun and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. To conclude my review I would like to say, ""Mr. Michael Bay , you are the best. ""","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

As a kids film, this is great: it's action-packed, stunning to watch, full of one-liners and bumbling characters that make the (age-appropriate) viewer laugh, and acts as a great promotion for an excellent toy-range.The reviewers giving this film 1 star should stop looking for plot holes (which almost every film has), stop looking for discontinuities between the 30-year old cartoon and today's storyline (!), and just remember during times of childish dialogue or slap-stick humour that this film (like the original story-line) was aimed at kids.This film receives 10 stars out of 10 from me in order to help balance out the rankings.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The special effects are amazing, the acting is good and humorous, the story is pretty good. Everyone seems to criticize the story. The story is from the original Transformers series and isn't just something made up. If you actually pay attention to it, you'll find it's a really good plot. The only thing that bugged me just a little was that the ending kind of dragged on. I know Michael Bay wants to win that special effects Oscar that he and the crew were deprived of in 2007, but he really didn't need that much action. The movie definitely could have been a little shorter, but it's not like it ruined the movie. I really liked how they added characters to Sam's ""gang"". Before it was just him and Mikaela, but now they have that Leo guy and the weird speedo guy too. The twin robots were also pretty funny. Another thing that kind of surprised me was how much sexual humor was included. My mouth actually dropped at certain times, but it still made me laugh, so I was good. One character I want to mention is Sam's mom. She really had about half of my laughs, so I want to say thanks to her. She's hilarious!!!Everyone needs to stop so harshly criticizing this movie and just try to enjoy it. If you're not a pessimist then you won't even half to ""try"" to enjoy it. This movie is amazing and I'm hoping it will win the best special effects Oscar this year even if it isn't the best...I'm interested to see how G.I. Joe's special effects are, but right now I wish the Oscar would go to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen...a.k.a: the best movie of the summer!!!!!!!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I would like to remind people of the original cartoons, very boring, and terribly campy. The reason people were so interested in the originals was because of the minuscule action and fight sequences that were included in a single episode. I would also like to remind everyone that the storyline of the cartoons focused on the Transformers themselves....not the kid who roots them on. It sounds to me like the people who didn't care for this movie, still saw it as a carry on from the last, and that it should continue to fill you with background story. Personally, I am beyond delighted that the movie takes place some time after the last and that the movie doesn't waste time trying to explain. It simply gives a small description of what has happened, and then bombards your mind with action. I think this is what a transformers movie should be, not some sentimental afternoon special.People expect a deep storyline in everything they see, when in reality, it's still a TRANSFORMERS movie....and last time I checked, all they did was fight........for YEARS....in different forms, it's why they are awesome.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

First of all Micheal Bays first transformer film was great for a modern audience. For all you lil'transformer fans (i am one as well) who wanted to hear the 80's soundtrack and unicron were just living in a dream world. The plausibility of that happening was very slim unless you got nelson shin or Gerald Thomas to direct it. At the end of the day transformers were toys nothing more. I enjoyed the film the plot was simple like the first one and the action was second to none, for the people who keep saying why did he have Optimus transform from the plan and then back again, should really stop heavily reading into this film like its requiem for a dream or something. It is purely to show off the transformation get over it. when you watch it and take in the plot you don't really feel like its a solid movie on its own, it feels more like a leading up to. Maybe unicron you never no. Bay was the best person to take on these films he has a great eye for action and also the best contacts with the military that any director has had. Think about this film could went very street fighter if Bay didn't step up to the plate. i always say this to people before going into the cinema Check your brain before you enter if your going to see a chick flick, then don't expect it to be the next Casablanca. if your going to see an action packed film with bid robots then it wont be like fight club. this film was fun go see it and then say what an idiot that (viproductions) is.

Then they write that they didn't like the first one either!! What the hell did you people expect of this movie before you went and saw it!? That suddenly it's going to be a drama or a romantic movie like The Bridges of Madison County? I wonder if any of you people who thinks this movie sucks even saw a trailer of this movie before you went and saw it? Cause if you did, you should have understood from the trailers that there's going to be lot of action and a LOT OF ROBOTS!! It feels like some of the bad review writers are the grand finalists from The Battle of the Jay Walk All-Stars from Late Night with Jay Leno.Transformers is about ROBOTS transforming to different vehicles and the battle between Autobots and Decepticons. If you don't like Transformers or big action movies like Bay usually does, why write a bad review of the movie in the first place. It's like sending a heavy metal freak to an opera. He'll write exactly the same kind of reviews that the people who thought this movie sucked. If you're a Transformer fan you should go and see this movie. Some fans say it's better than the first one and some say it's a bit worse, but no way it's worth only one or two points on the IMDb scale!!Transformers 2 has a lot of action and more robots that you ever seen before. The plot is that the Decepticons want to start up a machine here on Earth so that they can make more Energon now when the Allspark is gone and make more Decepticons. The only reason why I didn't give this one 10 points it's cause the final battle is a bit long. Then people find all kind of mistakes in the movie and it'll grow with hundreds more when people get the chance of watching the movie on Blu-Ray frame by frame. But who cares? It's meant to be a action movie and there's not a movie with CGI effects that doesn't have any mistakes.To all of you who thought that this movie sucked and was a piece of crap and who want their money back from the movie theaters, do all of us REAL TRANSFORMERS FANS a favor. A BIG FAVOR!! Don't even think of going to see part three when it comes out 2012-2013!! Stay away from the movie theaters and don't never ever even consider of writing a review of the movie here on IMDb cause you clearly don't know jack sh*t about Transformers!!","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

This film seems to polarise opinion.As for myself, I loved this movie. I still like dialogue and plot, and some people have queried this in this movie, but the dialogue and plot seems to parallel the first one, just more so. I have no complaints, it is faster and snappier but not necessarily better or worse. I didn't mind the humour, it's supposed to be a fun movie!And as for the action & special effects- couldn't believe how much of it there was. This is to be expected of as a sequel which doesn't always make it better than the original (eg. Jurassic Park) - but I thought it was better than the original.My personal opinion. Suspect the average rating is lower than it should be because some people are giving it very low scores. I suspect this is a distortion based on expectations. There's no way this movie could have rated a low 1 or 2 out of 10 if taken as a stand alone movie. I'd personally rate it a 9!Some have quoted that they grew up with Transformers and this wasn't as good. I too grew up with them in the 80s.

There was a bit of cheesiness in the movie when it went to the whole 'destiny' thing. Another flaw was Megan Fox's acting. Come on! When you're about to die and hyper you don't smile! And last but not least, the story needed a twist.Now all this is quite minor and doesn't do much damage to the movie as a whole. The cinema was rocking with laughter every now and then and the mind blowing visuals were just plain eye candy. Yum.My favorite part was the action. It's extremely intense with missiles and bullets flying everywhere along with planes, tanks and of course, robots.Bottom line: A few glitches, but definitely one of the finest movies there is. If you enjoyed Wolverine earlier this year, you're gonna love this!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It had a decent story line and plot but the action was outstanding. This movie is one to watch over and over again, not a one time deal.

Don't worry about all the negative reviews because trust me you wont give a damn when you see the movie. Michael Bay did what most people wanted a ton of explosions with a ton of action can it get any better? you don't see many movies like this so get to the theaters NOW, it is 100x better on the big screen so don't wait for it on DVD, you wont regret it.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was what I had hoped, robot action, and plenty of it. I can't wait for the next one. It was awesome, enough said. Although some people have been saying it was not what they expected, and I respect their opinions, however I believe that people are way too hyper critical of this movie and should just learn to accept that this is a Transfomers movie and yes there is going to be a lot of action, so just enjoy it instead of being so hyper critical. Even though the first Transformers may have been a little bit better with a better storyline it still was great. I love the series and am happy it is going to be a trilogy. The only reason holding this movie back from getting a ten is due to the fact that Meagan Fox was such a poor actor in this movie focusing more on her looks then the movie.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I am willing to bet that any actress who played that part would have gotten the same criticism for simply being in such a movie. And let us not forget Michael Bay, the despicable director who molded this evil movie just to suck a few bucks from millions of unsuspecting movie goers! Transformers 2 is 2 hours and 40 minutes of humor, action and incredible effects.

When I come out of a movie and it leaves me with a good feeling then the director did their job. All I know is some of these movies the critics love leave me with the feeling of what the heck was that? If you loved the first Transformers movie you will love this one also. The slow motion action scenes were fun to watch. This movie did not drag on or seem like it lasted 4 hours, it flew by and left me wanting more. Optimus Prime was very impressive, fighting like a true leader and not like a thug or killing machine that I read elsewhere.

With superb special effects, action-packed fight scenes, laugh out loud moments,& Megan Fox's sexy bod, this truly has the makings of a great movie. Sure the movie has, soft porn, a story line that doesn't make sense, parts that aren't even that funny, & fast paced action that you can't even enjoy some parts, it's really good.

They should have Shoji Kawamori do the designs for Star Scream (he looks like a flatten toad).The female lead lacks any sort of depth and is almost paper-thin as a character. All she portrays is the sex, nothing else. Heck! the dogs got more on-screen actions. The Australian, Isabel Lucas, had more steam screen than Megan Fox.Other than that this movie is worth your money.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I've seen the comments the detractors wrote to throw down on this film. What they fail to realize is that this is just a film. Summer entertainment at its best! The scale was bigger and the battles even better. I did wish that the film did move a bit quicker as the 3rd act was about to begin. The Twins weren't as annoying as other people were making them out to be. Yes, some of the comedy was overdone and forced, but it was a small price to pay for what was an otherwise very good film. The best element of the film was the relationship between Sam and Optimus Prime. It reminds you of the relationship between Luke and Obi-Wan, mentor and student, and even surrogate father-son. All in all, great job on the filmmakers' behalf!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Those jokes are not meant to cause ""racial slurs"" or anything like that, its supposed to be funny. And to me it was. The jokes were kind of cheesy, but it was just enough so that it wasn't constant action. The story to this one is much more in-depth than the first, and that causes it to be longer. The action scenes are amazing. People will sit there and say, it was just a whole bunch of explosions and metal clanging, but wasn't that what the entire movie is about? It may be hard to understand who's who at times, but for the most part it is easy to tell whats going on.

The ""humans capability of good and evil"" is thrown in on occasion but nothing over powering, for which I'm thankful. The story of this film ties in really well with the first film, all of the events are plausible and keep into the original idea presented in Transformers 1. This film also succeeded in giving each of the Transformers their own personalities and their own sense of humour instead of just depending on big metal robots breaking stuff to carry the film through. Transformers 2 also managed to easily show the characters want for normality, instead of portraying them as heroes waiting to save the planet.Annoyingly the government officials were portrayed as incompetent (more than usual that is) but that's only a minor point. There were some pieces (especially a part towards the end) that I thought were just a bit too cheesy and recycled, like the obsession with the dogs, seriously its just not funny....In summary: Good: plot, actors, graphics, fights scenes, humour. Bad: some bits were unoriginal, probably lasted a bit too long.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Great movie, Great special effects and fantastic action sequences.For those on the internet & the world who are putting it down to a complete flop, check your brain & realize that this is a pure action cartoon/comic movie. This is not The Godfather, if u want that style of movie then go see a dramatic film and read a book. There also is some talk about all the mistakes in the film....I say what mistakes if you have nothing better to do but to analyze all the goofs then get a life. Watching the film i didn't focus on that at all, why watch a film & bad mouth it right away. If you think you can do any better... then make your own film, if you can find 180 million in your wallet. Michael Bay is the best action director out there & we should all be pleased he is doing this movie, otherwise this could of been like the Alien vs Predator series which should be erased from history.I gave it 9/10 because it is the ultimate action movie & I'm glad it was 150 minutes, it had flown by & there was never a dull moment. For those who said the film was too long.... Im personally sick of going to watch a film that is too short, just over an hour long by the time you sit down & get into it you realize it is over, What a waste of money. Transformers 2 is worth the price of the tickets it is like Iron Man, Terminator, XMEN, Matrix and Die Hard rolled into one.Transformers 2 is worth the wait, though my one complaint is The MUSIC and the lack of a good soundtrack... Im glad they used Linkin Park they rock. As well They should of used a lot heavy, faster and loader music, such as metal or hard rock bands e.g Metallica, Megadeth, Godsmack just to name a few in order to convey the massiveness & sheer size of the transformers & there strength in brutal fights.Transformers 2 will do extremely well Globally. It will definitely be in the top ten grossing films of all time. My brother and I really enjoyed the movie & think it will be the biggest film this year. If you enjoyed the first one... then hold on to your seats & get ready to blow sky high. It will make you wanting more... bring on Transformers 3 after Bad Boys 3 of course. Hopefully Michael Bay will do another bad boys in order to take a rest from Robots for a while.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

There were so many parts of the first movie that I really didn't enjoy that the sequel made up for. For example, the fight scenes in the first movie sucked you couldn't see what was going on, it got very boring at some parts, they were too quick and just kind of bland. This one had a lot more raw and intense; this movie punched you in the mouth when the main character temporarily died and they picked you back up when you figured out there was hope to bring him back. I believe that most people said the first one was better because it was something new back then, no one has ever seen anything like it before, and with this one it was so much more hardcore and I know that true fans just loved it. This film reaches out more to the people who grew up watching transformers back in 80s more than the older crowd of people who grew up watching the much old hanna barbarra and the original johnny quest shows. I seen comments that haven't made any sense saying that the movie was too loud, there was too much action and explosions, and there was too much metal well duh!!! What do you expect it's a transformers movie. My suggestion for critics and the people who bash this movie is this: if you don't know anything about transformers go get familiar with it look at the cartoons or just read up on it, 2 if you didn't see the movie do not bother bashing it thats like saying the super bowl was horrible and you didn't even watch it nor you have a TV, radio, or computer in your house, 3 everything you say influences people some more than others there are people out there who probably really enjoy this movie but they won't see because you were having a bad day and decided to bash the movie as a way to vent. For anyone who wants proof, solid unbasis proof go watch the movie when there is a decent crowd of people in there laughing, cheering, applauding and having a good time then email me later about your opinion.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I've seen a lot of reviews about the transformers and its sequel and most of them are crap reviews written by people who wouldn't know fun if it bit them in the tail end of their ass. first of all the special effects are beyond anything you have seen in a movie before. of course we expect this from Mr.bay. as with most of his movies he breaks up the overly done action with a slim plot mostly filled with jokes and mindless chatter which is fine. thats how popcorn movies work! there are at least 4 laugh out loud jokes and several moments were giggling will occur. the plot may be thin but i found it pretty easy to follow. why these so called critics couldn't follow it is beyond me. maybe they weren't paying attention? maybe they are getting paid to not do their job? maybe they didn't wanna like the movie before they saw it? here is the story. man has teamed up with the autobots to protect earth from the decepticons. the decepticons are hoping to awaken the fallen with an artifact on the earth that will help their cause. is that to hard to understand? sure the movie is 30 minutes to long and it opens itself up for a sequel with a few plot holes but it was expected. bottom line, if your looking for explosions, girls, action, and some laughs you cant go wrong here. if your looking for something that is for fans of marriage shows and soaps like these dead beat critics, look elsewhere. im sure there is a love story or a story about a cancer patient in the same theater.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I agree with some of the problems the critics had, like the pacing. The movie tried to tell 4 different story lines at once and succeeded at this on the first one, but was way to jumpy this time around. But come on people. ITS AN ACTION MOVIE. If you really walked into this movie expecting more that what it delivers then you really need to reexamine your definition of ACTION film. Ill admit that it got kind of stupid at times but really is it any more stupid then Terminator Salvation. It's giant robots beating the crap out of each other, not Slumdog Millionaire. Just remember that.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

(like my run-on sentences) The effects were also great in the movie, they still do need to slow down the fight scenes and the way the Auto-bots transform, i didn't like how fast they did that in the first one but at least they slowed it down some. i watched transformers when i was a kid, so I remember them, not enough to be a big fan though so I'm trying to make this as fair as possible. another thing i didn't like was how fast paced everything had happened. but it wasn't too bad, unless you truly do want a lord of the rings type movie, i guess they had to condense it some. all in all a good movie, its at least worth a look and to me a buy. great family movie however they did add more language and sexual references than in the first movie but it defiantly made it more enjoyable and less like a ""kids movie"".","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

TF2 delivered bigger and badder action than the first. It was awe inspiring to say the least. The explosions were bigger, transformations cooler and the Transformers had much more personality. Key things that make TF2 awesome- + As already stated, the action is even better than the first and that is saying a TON. + They realized just how captivating Megan Fox was and maximized her screen time. + Some of the robots are hilarious compared to the original where non of them had much of a personality. + The acting was good all the way aroundThe negatives were few but they are certainly there. - They should have realized from the first film that the movie would be at least 20 minutes shorter. Even with full tilt action it starts seeming to be a little much after two hours. You need a deep plot and character development if you are going to go as long as these two films did. - This film is FAR LESS family friendly. I have yet to talk to a friend who has seen TF2 and didn't agree that the cursing and sexual references are at least 10 times that of the original. If you are an adult then the jokes and references are quite comical but they aren't something I particularly wanted my kids to watch. I'm sure some will disagree but this is just on father's opinion.That about covers my thoughts on TF2. My rating of 9/10 is for adults. For kids it would have been a couple of notches lower.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The special effects in this movie are amazing some of the best I've seen, certainly enough to keep many entertained. For those of us who are looking for a little more, Transformers brings with it many hilarious anecdotes(I would say almost too many) that will have the theater in an uproar.This film can be enjoyed by many generations and we get to see those childhood cartoon characters that we grew up with a little more real. Many can share those childhood experiences, with their children that are now just discovering Transformers. It's an experience that can be enjoyed by the whole family.So when you go watch Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen do us all a favor and put down your critics notebook and just be prepared to be entertained... it will make the experience that more enjoyable.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's NOT going to have the best acting *cough* Megan Fox *cough* and it's NOT going to have the most recognizable plot. It IS going to have mind-blowing action scenes, CGI, special effects, explosions, and incredibly hot slow-mo scenes of a extremely attractive woman *cough* Megan Fox *cough* running from said explosions.Of course, the INCREDIBLY realistic effects (especially the sound, the sound in this movie was epic) can only compensate for so much. There are some scenes where you squirm in your seat because of the cheesiness, or maybe leave you wondering ""Am I really the only one who's able to see that, where's the military, where are the Autobots?"" or ""Hey Mike, can you zoom out a little and stop spinning so much, I'm getting motion-sickness"" But these feelings are soon forgotten in an impressive display of big robots beating the crap out of bigger robots while our mere human race scurries underneath the destruction of our most esteemed architectural achievements.Personally, I thought Revenge of the Fallen was better than the first, but it is definitely debatable. In the first movie, with new perspective of Fallen, it seemed everything was held back a little. I mean, when you're making a two hour live action movie from a set of toy action figures, you want to test the waters first, but the success of the first movie is what made this one so good. Michael Bay and the producing staff or whatever went all out, on everything. Sam's parents are crazier and more lovable than before, Megan Fox's acting HAS improved, it's funnier, and there's at least twice as many fighting scenes done at least twice as well as in the first Bay production of Transformers.Overall, this is definitely the movie to see this summer if you don't see anything else. It has everything: action, explosions, hotness, comedy (personally, I loved the twins), explosions, hotness, romance, action, sentimental moments, and above all, giant robots blowing sh*t up. Don't be deterred by the 2 1/2 hour run-time, because if it were any shorter, this movie would seem like it was over too soon. Albeit, I'm a 16 year old male, so my opinion may be a little biased to say the least, but Michael Bay was the perfect man to make this film happen, and it will leave everyone who goes to see it walking out happy.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I really can't see what turned some people off so much about this movie. Yes, juvenile jokes abound, and yes, Megan Fox's sexual appeal to the predominantly male audience was certainly exploited to the limits of the film rating, but c'mon, folks. This was a story about giant sentient robots that transform into, well, cars – and beat the crap out of each other in a no-holds-barred slugfest.It was fun from start to finish! It delivered precisely what you'd expect from such a premise – a exciting, only semi-serious, action-packed flick that fired full throttle on, yes, over-inflated, but no less universally appealing themes of heroism, villainy, and sacrifice – oh, yeah, and giant sentient robots that transform into cars, and beat the crap out of each other in a no-holds-barred slugfest. What else do you want? Those fuddy-duddies waxing nostalgically over some Shakespearean version of a Transformers that never really was need to revisit what it means to have fun at a movie. If I wanted to see the original Transformers, the animated series, in all its glory, then I'd pop some popcorn, pull out those old VHS tapes, and camp out in front of the TV for a metal-on-metal marathon, complete with '80s commercials. But to expect Bay and the team behind Revenge of the Fallen to blatantly pander to rose-tinted views of the Transformers by creating the same thing all over again is sadly lacking in ambition, creativity, and inspiration.Seriously, Mr. Bay, you get a double-thumbs up from me for putting the biggest smile on my face after a movie this year.

This movie is fast paced and action packed. Too many people are tearing this film apart. It is meant to be a fun entertaining ride - which it is. I think there were too many shots at humor and that seemed to wear on many reviewers. But it didn't detract from the movie as a whole.Could it have been better? Yes. But it's still one hell of a ride. A few scenes could have been left out. On the flip side, a few more scenes with the newer additions of Autobots would've been great. If you liked the 2007 Transformers movie, you'll like/love this one. If you didn't like the 2007 movie... well, you shouldn't even consider this one. Many bad reviews are coming from people who did not like the 2007 one. Why they expected to enjoy this one is anyone's guess.Bottom line - if 2007's Transformers entertained you, this will too. More robots. More action.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Above all though the special effects are superb, and once again Shia Labeouf provides us with a fantastic performance and is very well supported by Megan Fox.

It's Michael Bay at his best, giving us a film where you can switch your brain off and just enjoy as the world blows up and giant robots kick the crap out of each other.

This is what Michael Bay does best: loud and visual entertainment on screen. This is indeed the perfect summer action movie! 10 out of 10 ... without a doubt.You may find plot holes in the script, you may find the acting of Megan Fox not equivalent to her sex appeal, you may even find some of the robots rather lame ... but hey: This is what you came to see! Why do you go to movies like this??? To experience a costume drama with tears and sobbing? Or maybe to escape reality for over two hours and have fun!!?? I go to the movies for different reasons and in this case I admit I simply love the Transformers movie franchise.The effects are perfect, Jablonsky's score is powerful, the script is okay and funny (why do people bother to find plot holes here??) and all the actors do their job nicely. John Turturro is great, Shia as well, Megan ... okay, everyone serves their purpose. For that, Michael Bay deserves an honorary mention.This film will absolutely not be one of the 10 films competing for Oscar's best films of the year. But still I rate it 10 because it delivers everything it ""promised"" :)My rating system may confuse people but when I grade a movie, I use the system 1-10 and quite often I ask myself: hey, what if a great comedy is so funny that I'm laughing constantly... wouldn't it deserve 10 out of 10?? Yes, because it serves its purpose perfectly. Comparing maybe Atonement to Eurotrip would be hard but as a comedy I rated Eurotrip as a 9 or 10 ... but Atonement was 7 or 8. This may be confusing to some, but hopefully not all.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen deserves a 10.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Having said that, it is impossible for me to understand how someone could watch the trailers over and over and be totally shocked when it is jam packed with action. That is what you get with this movie. One of the most common complaints I heard about the first one was that the human element was too heavy. That is no longer an issue in this one. The Autobots and Decepticons dominate the screen this time around. The battles are epic and memorable. There are many things in this movie that fans of the cartoon will get and the casual fan will not. A fan of action movies will not be disappointed with this film. I'm ready for the third one!!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

From, transformers, He-Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (I can't believe they made me write that out),to G.I.Joe, All these movie purist that probably have Transformer action figures,as well as comforter sets, throughout there respective apartments need to cut it out. Its a great, fun, and yes predictable ride! I don't know why people expect perfection...its transformers...if you wanted to see something that would make you cry and move you to be a better person, go watch Pretty Woman...it is a summer blockbuster, its supposed to be filled with action, sex, and comedy. From beginning to end there is a lot going on. So much to fill in, 150 minutes just isn't enough time. I for one, enjoyed every minute of it...Probably just as much as i enjoyed the first one. So if you are looking for a movie that will blow you away with special effects, make you envy whoever Megan Fox is dating, and keep you laughing transformers is for you. Take the movie for what its worth. Don't expect Academy Awards, but expect to be entertained.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"10","/10","The movie of the day, er, weekend: ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2090284/?ref_=tt_urv","dee.reid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0892646/?ref_=tt_urv","3 July 2009","Reflecting on ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" much of the movie's imagery remains permanently etched into my memory. I remember the ear-shattering sounds of Autobots and Decepticons going head-to-head in many spectacular battles in Shanghai, later in the American wilderness and some unnamed college university, and finally in the Eyptian desert. I also remember the sounds of metal and machinery reconfiguring itself and the camera being able to catch every mechanical whir and clank. But all that mechanical wonder and glory can be drowned out by a great many explosions and crashes, complements of Hollywood's favorite go-to over-director, Michael Bay, who has also found some kind of guidance in over-direction from the legendary Steven Spielberg, breaking away from his previous long-standing relationship with producer Jerry Bruckheimer.I also vividly remember the film's plot, where Our Hero Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is attending his first year at college, leaving behind girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) so she can help in her ex-con father's rehabilitation; she is also responsible for being the film's most striking image - the first shot of her, lying on a bike with her posterior high up in the air, is pure eye candy and unforgettable, and an early indication of how she will be used in this picture.I predict that ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" will win over many hearts and minds over this Fourth of July weekend, and how could it not? It has giant robots fighting to the death, lots of epic special effects transforming sequences, lots of explosions and of course, Megan Fox (by the way, as a guy, I actually think she's one of the LEAST - least is italicized here - attractive young actresses working in Hollywood at the moment).Bay, that Hollywood hit-maker behind big, explosive epics such as ""The Rock"" (1996) (my personal favorite film of his), ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) and ""Bad Boys II"" (2003), returns to direct a much bigger, much louder sequel to his 2007 blockbuster hit ""Transformers,"" which saw the big-screen debut of the line of toys made popular by toy company Hasbro in the '80s about massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin that mistakenly bring their centuries-old war from their home planet Cybertron to Earth, and their luring Everyman Sam Witwicky into the center of their battle.""Revenge of the Fallen"" concerns the malevolent Decepitcons' - now under the leadership of the newly resurrected Megatron - attempts to locate a mysterious alien power source on Earth so that they can drain all the energy from the sun, or something like that. And for that, they need to locate poor college boy Sam Witwicky. Meanwhile, the heroic Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, have forged a top-secret Autobot/American military alliance to hunt down rogue Decepticons on Earth. And so, we can basically resume the same ""chase movie"" plot between humans and robots from the first film. And somewhere in there, we also learn a little more about the history of the Autobots and Decepticons and their reasons for being on Earth in the first place.Boy, is this film long. But, at 2 1/2 hours, the film is never really boring, despite getting off to a very slow start. There's a lot to like here, and there's a lot to not like. The good is that the movie looks fantastic, is well-acted (especially Agent Simmons, played by a scene-stealing John Turturro), and well-made; I'm really getting tired of saying that about most big Hollywood blockbusters, because any movie being made nowadays can look fantastic and can be well-made and well-acted and still be complete crap. Truly the second best thing that can be said about ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is that Shia LaBeouf is turning out to be one of the most likable Everymen working in Hollywood nowadays, since he is basically continuing the likable Everyman shtick from the first film. Also, Fox looks pretty good, but that's really all that she does for the movie: she looks pretty good.The bad is that the movie is just too long, there are too many unnamed robots running amok (Devastator was awesome beyond words and was actually quite scary, but he wasn't in the movie long enough), and a lot of the comic elements really aren't that funny; of course I'm talking about the jive-talking twin Autobots. Much has been made about these two and their (alleged) racist portrayal of blacks, right down to one of them having a gold tooth. As a black male, I didn't find them offensive in the least bit, but I instead found them to be stupid, unnecessary, distracting, and annoying. Above all, they were terribly un-funny.The best thing that can be said about ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is that while it's not a vastly superior sequel in the least, it's more like the 1980s cartoon series that it inspired it. And that is what will undoubtedly make this movie a winner this Fourth of July weekend.10/10","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I have to ask you, what did you expect? Seriously?A) It's a Michael Bay film.As a rough guide, it will include at least 30 minutes of slow-motion, regardless of the run-time, at least 5 explosions, and one exposition- laden speech, (generally accompanied by said explosions...in slow motion).B) You are all absolutely correct.As a film, the whole thing is an atrocious work of writing, pacing and lacks any significant depth. The sheer amount of visual and aural stimuli is enough to send most who view this into a semi-catatonic state, a state carefully calculated by Michael Bay to allow maximum absorption of Megan Fox's deadly ""Boob n' Ass"" radiation.C) *ATTENTION* It is a Transformers film. The entire reason to make this film, is to appeal to the younger kids who have grown up with Transformers, and the slightly older kids, who grew up with the classic cartoon films, and cartoon series. This was hardly going to be a high-brow, thought provoking piece of philosophical mastery, because it is not based on SCHINDLERS LIST it is based on ""A cartoon series developed to market Transforming robots that live in disguise, with a war of Evil vs Good raging on, with humans caught in the middle."" Do you seriously go into a film based on action-figurines expecting a profound experience? Of course it will be corny, of course it will be cheesy; it is the product of nostalgia, and the only reason that anyone from MY generation, the kids that grew up with transforming Hasbro toys went to see it anyway, was for the iconic *SCHZ SHCZ SHUCHZ SHUZ* noise, and folding metal warriors.The plot, in itself, is moot anyway. Do any of you remember a single plot from the cartoons? All I remember, is that either they'd be fighting over Energon, or smaller Robots to supplement themselves, and cartoon violence and action would happen in-between.So Michael Bay, I congratulate you, your mindless action-filled CGI fest, was the truest addition to the Transformer's franchise that you could ever hope for.And I loved it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has issues, sure, but I walked in the theatre hoping to see 200$ million dollars on a big screen. I was rewarded with the best visual experience I've ever seen in a film. While I was watching, all I could think was ""f&ck, this sh!t is REAL! There has to be a few robot-actors that are being hidden from the rest of the world..."". I wanted big fighting scenes between a great deal of gigantic vehicle-transforming robots, a film with non-stop action, a few laughs and that's exactly what I got. I believe that this film only needed two minutes in a fighting scene to surpass its predecessor. If you want something deep, don't watch it...

I also know that the critics trashed it.But I don't listen to critics. And I don't pay any attention to the haters either. So here's my review.Like I said in the subject, Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is just as good as the first one. So if you liked the first Transformers movie, you'll like the second. If you didn't like the first one, well then you probably won't like the second one. It's that simple.It's just a great feel good movie. No, there's nothing overly profound about it, but who cares? Some movies are made to be FUN, and entertaining. This certainly was fun and entertaining. The writing is amazing as far as incredibly funny lines go. The effects are top-notch, the acting is great (how can you fault Shia LaBeouf's acting??? I don't get that one), the music is great, the directing is great, and the plot is pretty darn good too. It's just a great movie. You leave the theater feeling zinged and happy, and that's what entertainment is all about.So I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. In fact, I saw it twice during its 5-day opening period. I loved it. Actually, I thought that the sequel might have just managed to go a little bit above the original. It would be a touch call though, to decide which one was better. But Revenge Of The Fallen is at least as good as the first one.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The build-up to the finale was overdone, and the finale itself was way too short.I did miss some of the bots from the first movie which I thought were a lot cooler, and a lot less PG-13 rated (cursing/racial jokes were unnecessary).Overall - if you liked the first one, go see this one too!

Firstly, the movie is the next step of an expensive franchise that was created 2 years ago. Second, the value of the movie about robots, the categories related to the development of science and our future, isn't this inspiring? And third, entertainment value is always guaranteed, for me, this type of movie alone is more than enough. Look at Devastator, many years from now I will still remember this transformation. Regarding music, it continues to be a positive point of the film. And Cybertron's search for energy sources isn't too bad either. I still enjoyed the movie a few more times.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The scenes are NOT dull and repetitive, the camera is NOT shaking without a stop, and the actors are NOT horrible, and by the way, to all the Megan Fox critics, I'm sorry, but how exactly do you come to the conclusion that she's a bad actor? Even if she was one, you can't possibly reach this conclusion from the 1 - 2 liners she was delivering. Therefore, please go back to your day jobs and leave the criticism to people who are paid to do it.The movie delivers itself well enough, there are no plot holes left and that is something you do not usually expect from an action film. The jokes are funny enough, for most of the people in the screening to laugh, and that I suppose should mean something. Which only makes me wonder even more, if those few people who didn't like the jokes or the ""gangsta"" stereotype are commenting here. The film is after all aimed mainly at teenagers and Transformers fan, and each of the target audiences is catered.Michael Bay didn't just deliver awesome action sequences but also managed to portray Optimus Prime perfectly in my opinion - selfless, honorable, chivalrous and one hell of a bad ass. The action sequences with him were exactly what I would expect from a leader of Autobots.Of course the film is not perfect, it's a tad too long, I would've loved to see more screen time and lines added to the Autobots, because after all the movie is about them and not only about the love story between Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox.I suggest to go see this movie, because it DOES deliver what it's tasked with and that is entertainment and a lot of robot action.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was very skeptical after loving the show for so long and the first movie but the cast and crew pulled off another miracle. I experienced nearly every emotion that i could. If i was not laughing( which i did a lot) then I was on the edge of my seat from action and the emotions during sad scenes were the kind of emotions i have not felt from a movie in some years. The way the action was shot and portrayed i felt like i was amongst the midst and chaos of the battles which i loved and it was a unique way of showing the battles. This was all around another great film for Micheal bay if only he were aloud to recreate all our beloved childhood cartoons into live action movies. PS-I have heard many complaints about racial stereotypes. Here is the scoop. Stereotypes are funny plain and simple comedian use stereotypes in their acts why can't movies? It worked if you ask me.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was exactly what an imagination is supposed to portray. It's FICTION and it's exactly as it should be, imagination & creativity. Everything in this film was great & I give credit to all the work that had to be done to make it seem so real. AMAZING!!!! It's creativity at it's finest & I think it's just as good as the first one if not better! There are so many movies out there that don't even come close to this & I'm shocked that these haters can't appreciate creative imagination & art. Don't listen to all the negativity & judge it for yourself. I'd love to see these haters make a better movie than this one! I'm definitely going to see it again this week!

I had tears in my eyes on multiple occasions during this movie due mostly to Optimus and him having the same voice that I remember from the cartoons. This movie is one of the best that I have seen in theatres in a long time. I enjoyed everything from start to finish, and if you had a bunch of transformers as a kid, you will love this movie.

I enjoyed the the first movie and I also enjoyed this one. This movie is exactly what its supposed to be. A huge action flick with lots of explosions. Yes they don't look like the original transformers but this is 2009 not 1985. A volkswagon beetle, mini van, station wagon, flat nosed truck, and so on would look retarded in 2009. All you die hard fans who complain about it might want to refresh on the old cartoons. The old cartoons had hardly any continuation. New characters popped up and disappeared randomly with no explanation, and there were crazy story lines (anyone remember when they found the gold pond that made them all invincible?). This update brings a lot of good things along with some bad. Would you rather have all this action or hardly any action( x- men:3). Before I went to see it people on here were complaining about the SE saying they couldn't tell who was who in the fights. I didn't have that problem( I guess I have great vision). The action in this movie was fantastic. The story was odd, but acceptable. This was exactly what most people expected, a great action flick to past the time, I wasn't hoping for an amazing story, I just wanted to see prime and the boys shut megatron up. My only gripes were that You didn't see a lot of ratchet or Iron Hide. And The BIGGEST problem was I don't recall ever hearing Prime say ""Autobots, Transform and ROLL OUT!"" So in conclusion, If you want a good action film with descent humor, good cgi, and lots of explosions and action this is a great choice. IF you are a Die Hard fanboy who feels it should be just like the original cartoons, you will be disappointed. Or If you go in there looking for dramatic heart tugging scenes worthy of an Oscar you will be disappointed. This is a great movie for action fans.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I don't know how they plan on making a third one that can be better than this unless they decided to make Megan Fox go rated R ha ha. There are many new and exciting transformers that keep it interesting. And what I like most how Optimus Prime and Bumblebee take the fighting scenes to a new level. The fighting scenes were amazing and you always get a chill through your body with some of the things these 2 do.

Next to the cars, Megan Fox is just incredibly HOT, and the huge ""war"" at the end contains just so much action you will be blown away from your screen. Another plus point is the fact that the whole cast is still the same, nobody has been switched from his / her role, and i liked that very much. At some other movies, for example the new Terminator Salvation, their isn't a Arnold Schwarzenegger anymore and that's just sad.The only thing i didn't liked about this movie was the fact that there was to much action actually, and there were so much robots that i didn't knew who was who sometimes. But if you like action, hot chicks and cars this is the perfect movie for you! So enjoy it, just like i did","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's more of everything compared to the first one the only thing that makes this a little less good is the lack of story but if you walk into the cinema for pure entertainment you will walk out with a big smile, every movie does not need to be some fancy brain work.I recommend this movie go see it and make up your own mind!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I've been reading a bunch of crappy reviews, so i thought that i would share my meaningless thoughts about transformers: Revenge of the Fallen(by the way very original and non-cliché title). Personally i didn't think the first one was as great as most people say it was, but it was a pretty good movie. Transformers 2 is almost the exact same movie, except everything is done twice as much, and some stuff that is done twice as much as a slightly negative effect on the movie. such as the doubling of their extremely lame and cliché jokes that you hate to laugh at(but you still do because its a fun themed movie). the overboard epicness that the movie is drowned in. Also when the mom eats a special brownie and starts to act like a crazy person. other than those few flaws there isn't a whole lot wrong with the movie.on the other hand, some of the stuff that is done twice as much is good and benefits the movie,For example, there is twice as much transformers, which is a plus. there are twice as much transformers fight scenes, which is good as well. and last but not least there are twice as many action-packed scenes which is always a plus for a sequel. Overall, i just want to say that this movie may have flaws, but it isn't as flawed as most of the poor reviews i've been reading. Also feel free to make fun of my review as much as you want, because i just wrote it because i was really bored. Also you should see a movie called yo-yo girl cop. you will not be disappointed.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is what the movie is about escaping for a couple of hours remembering your childhood with your kids. It is not meant too be a movie to rival classics like ""godfather"", ""TDK"", ""Usual Suspects""...no this is a summer blockbuster.So in short if you expect acting, character development a plausible plot...then do not go.If you want action, thrills and a chance to escape for a couple of hours...then pay the admission sit back and enjoy!!!This is why in terms of a ""summer blockbuster"" Transformers:ROTF is a work of genius...certainly not the work of a prepubescent 13 year old boy as some have commented.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Very entertaining and excellent effects, but the story is very weak.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2100061/?ref_=tt_urv","JavierAndres92","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9661474/?ref_=tt_urv","22 July 2009","I said that I didn't want to lose again a Transformsers movie in the big screen, because when I saw the first one on DVD I wish I have seen it in the cinema, so for the second I went directly the opening weekend to see it. First i'm gonna talk about the special effects. They're excellent, and better than the first, I was seeing the first movie yesterday and I noted the difference. They can't be so good!, they're very well made, with everything as it should be, with the reflects, lights, everything. The great but great problem in Transformers 2 is it's script, because it has it's predecessor's problems multiplied by five. I'm not gonna say that this movie is bad, I would be lying because it entertains a lot, but I can say that the story is weak. Besides there are very bad solved things, or sometimes dialogs are unbearable of listening because they area meaningless or they are not well located, or because the actors scream all together and you can't understand nothing. There are a lot of unnecessary things, starting with two or three characters such us Alicia (I think the actress was beautiful and very sexy but if they wanted to catch Sam they would sent a big robot and solved problem), the stupid and unbearable Leo, or Galloway. NEST is okay, but it could have been shorter without making it so hard. Other Things: Sam's parents should have had less importance and time, because they don't reach anything to the story, only annoying noise, specially the mother. The final is kind of confusing because they go from a place to another as if everything was at 1 meter long and a lot of things are left with no cohesion or not understood. And the sort of Sam's ""Spiritual experience "" is very unnecessary. Out of all these things, the movie entertains big and I think that's most important to people. There's action form the beginning to the end, very well achieved and entertaining pursuits. If Michael Bay knows to do something is filming action sequences, with his movements he does spectacular things. I want to stand out the forest fights that are very good. And, in the end, World War 3 develops. Bombs, giants robots, planes, tanks, shoots, infinite spectacular explosions. This is very entertaining. Also the very first scene is very entertaining. There's a very good photography job with very good pictures (such us the picture when you can see a helicopter up Megan Fox)and the sounds are wonderful, it's a thousand of faces sound party. Shia LaBeouf is still lovable and has the face for blockbusters, and gives another funny and likable performance. Megan Fox poor me! She's pleasure to see, and cracks the screen every time she's in it, indeed. She's better than as she was in the first, she has more protagonism and she has improved. The rest of the actors are good, the only thing is what I've already said about Sam's parents and Turturro who has to calm down a bit and talk slowly and not look like a crazy man. Finally, Transformers 2 succeeds i entertaining very very good giving incredible entertaining action sequences with excellent effects, but if it had a better script and a more coherent story it would have been a LOT better. Sorry if my English is bad.TRANSFORMERS 2 REVENGE OF THE FALLEN 6/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

There was plenty of action and special effects and the plot was great. They took the use of comedy and made this movie stand off the charts. It does have a lot of teenage and adult humor, so i would say this movie stand away from children more, but its a movie based on violence anyway. I thought the love story could have been cut down more but it still was a great movie to watch and i plan on seeing this movie again in theaters. I liked the idea of pulling characters who would have been removed brought back in and they even brought in other characters who were not so large in roles to have larger or more important roles. I can not wait till the third movie already, I thought they did a good job on this movie and i would recommend everyone to watch it, that is as long as you have a sense of humor and like action.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's going to be difficult to maintain a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend, but that becomes the least of his worries when his old ally Optimus Prime tracks him down and warns him of an impending threat that could spell doom for planet Earth without his involvement. Sam must then embark on a daring adventure and discover the secret of the Transformers origins if he hopes to combat the evil Decepticons. As expected, and much like its predecessor, doesn't provide much in terms of story and mostly just coasts by on explosive action, superior special effects...and noise. This is exactly the kind of thing that is director Bay's bread-and-butter so fans should get what they paid for, others may view it as overlong and overblown, but although he doesn't add anything new to his repertoire give credit to Bay because you actually care about what happens to these characters. **","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The complaints pertaining to this movie are endless to say the least, but I am here to give my 2 cents.First: The Parents Many have said that they were unfunny and shouldn't have been in the movie. The parents had 3 scenes if I counted right. The first was when Sam is preparing to go off to college, but his mom is reminiscing about him as a baby. All moms do this, and yet suddenly in a movie it's unheard of. The father is putting the moves on the mom before leaving the house. They're married, get over it. At the college, the mom gets high and goes A-wall. This was stupid, but lasted a minute, get over it. It's called a mid-life crisis. Last scene is in the desert with Sam. Once again this is very brief, the mom is very calm, the father is scared for his son. Very natural given where they are and what they are doing.Twin Robots Who can forget the ""racist"" robots that talked liked Gangsters and were poorly animated. These guys were in for a while but they weren't given that much dialogue and they did end of helping in the end with the monster in the desert. The length Michael Bay wouldn't give us a half ass 1hr 30 min version. The final battle is drawn out in length, but that was the best part. Intense action scenes don't blow over in 10 min.I am not trying to defend this movie, I am just saying my thoughts. People blow this out of proportion as to how bad it is. The script needed work, yes and the Spanish kid was f**king annoying, and Megan Fox was no use at all, but that aside I had a really fun time with this movie. I also, don't get why everyone bashes John Turturro's character. He brings so much energy and life to the scenes that you never start to doze off and yet people say he is rambunctious and annoying. Whether you love it or hate it, this is not a bad movie, it's just a fun action movie that doesn't succeed in any other areas.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first film was brilliant and I walked out of the cinema so satisfied, 11 out of 10. Well this time I watched it with my elder brother and nephew, 9 to 35 years old and we all loved it. This time I walked out feeling 12 out of 10. The greater amount of robots, their on screen time, the well written plot, the references to transformers lore. I read some critics and couldn't believe they said it was 4 out of 5 etc. Well this film really delivered everything I wanted and some more. Those people who said it didn't have enough plot are so wrong. The first film already laid down the origins, this time we had more answers delivered to their origins and more action. The robots were fantastic. The human actors were great as well with character development and the humour was brilliant. I saw it at an Imax cinema and it was awesome. The only thing is that there was so much happening on screen all the time that I couldn't take everything, but this is brilliant due to the watch again factor will be excellent. I simply can not wait to watch this film again and I can not especially wait for it to come out on blueray. Michael Bay and his team have done well, so Has Steve Jablonsky with his score. What a film!!!!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.
