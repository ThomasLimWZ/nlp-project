I don't think it will be realistic to expect something else to be honest. The trailers showed that pretty well in my opinion.The tone of the movie is close to that of ""Shazam!"", given the fact that the family got bigger role in it again, that said the story is not all that good. Not that ""Shazam!"" got some epic story, but I think it was one idea better.The cast is fine, maybe the best part of the movie is the family dynamic, except when they lean too much to the melodrama side. Xolo Maridueña as Jaime/Blue Beetle and George Lopez are the standouts no doubt.The villain is everything you ca expect from B grade super hero movie, from the introduction, through his motivation, the fights and the conclusion is nothing particularly memorable.I must say the suit looks great when is practical and not CGI all over the place. There are some cool fight scenes with our protagonist, most of which are shown in the trailers, which is kinda of a shame.There are plenty of jokes in the movie, but for me, most of them doesn't land. I mean they are too childish. I guess the younger auditory will laugh out hard, but me and my cinema crowd were silent most of the time. Of course there were funny moments, but don't expect ""Deadpool"" level laughs if you are a bit older.The movie is not bad, but it's kinda cringe, predictable and given the fact that the audience know this genre already, they expect something more clever, which sadly to report ""Blue Beetle"" is not.There are already enough talks about the future of this character, is it part of the DCEU or DCU, will there be a sequel, or the character will transfer in the newly formed universe? If you ask me, there will not be a second movie, because this one will bomb hard, also, I'm not sure how you can do clean slate without the bagage of the previous universe, when you always lean to what was, not what it can be. In other words there is always a chance to see Blue Beetle again, but who will portray it and will the origin story be 1:1 identical is something I'm not sure about and I don't hold my breath for it.In conclusion the movie is ""okay"", got its moments, but there is nothing really memorable, also there are two credit scenes, which are fine I guess.","363 out of 566 found this helpful.

I was excited to hear that we had a superhero movie starring a Latino cast coming into the works but, it was executed poorly. There are times when they were trying too hard to portray a Latino family, a bit exaggerated and tried too hard to be funny. The acting from a few of the cast was fine, some of it felt forced. It seems like they didn't put as much heart into this film as they would a Batman film. With some work, this could've been a better viewing experience. Xolo was a great casting choice but could use a bit of work on some of his execution to the character.","15 out of 20 found this helpful.

With the disappointment of Shazam! Fury of the Gods, in which the first one I really loved, and the somewhat decent of a Flash movie, it seems like the way the franchise is ending doesn't seem like a bang. Fortunately, Blue Beetle has already come out oh boy did it not disappoint.Now let me preface this: it is by no means a classic nor is it groundbreaking in the superhero genre. At the end of the day, I just want to have a good time in the theaters and, for the most part, it succeeds in what I'm aiming for: a fun time.Xolo Maridueña as the titular young Iron Man-like superhero, alter-ego Jaime Reyes, was really good. He brings a lot of energy to his performance filled with charisma, awkwardness and relatability because of his love for his family.Speaking of family, everyone was really good playing in their respective roles but George Lopez was easily the standout because of how funny his lines and reactions are towards Jaime.And the theme of the family is really at the center of Blue Beetle, it's really hard not to ignore it which is similar to Shazam. But as the film moves on, it does feel like everything that was done to make this possible was filled with heart by the filmmakers and knew just to be simply entertaining, hitting at all the right beats to make you laugh and cry.The pacing was surprisingly good as to how they were able to fill in the runtime which doesn't make it feel like two hours at all as you are watching it. It's like it took two to three days in the story, if you look at the second to the third act. That was really impressive.Visuals are great and the action sequences are really good to look at. Props to the director of photography, who by the way did Hereditary and Midsommar - yeah, let that sink in.Of course, the film is not without its faults. It is cheesy at times, does feel generic and doesn't seem like it wants to outshine the rest of the films not just in DC but everything superhero in general. But my personal issue would have to be how they handled Susan Sarandoncs character and the nemesis of Jaime. While I get where they are going, it felt like it needed to be more compelling and not just some cartoony villains.But by the end, I walked out of Blue Beetle thinking how good it was to see an enjoyable film with the message of family that hit me emotionally. Would I recommend the movie? Yes.","119 out of 210 found this helpful.

After graduation, Jaime Reyes returns back to his family who are near bankrupt and on the verge to lose their home. Desperate to save the house, he looks for a job and lands at Kord Tower, after an invitation from Jenny Kord. Meanwhile, Kord Industries CEO Victoria Kord, is a greedy woman who wants to control an alien species Scarab for it's technological power, to create a deadly weapon. Jenny's attempt to steal this Scarab leads to Jaime getting hold of it and eventually becoming the host. What follows is, Jaime realizing his purpose and acknowledging his connection with Scarab.Blue Beetle clearly has arrived a decade late, which is also what works in it's favour. There is no pressure of building in/adding on to the DC universe. All it aims for, is to be a simple silly fun entertainer, going over the top at every opportunity and yet succeed in entertaining. This is simply not the kind of film one should take seriously. The humor is hit and miss, thankfully the emotions work well. The Latino superhero does leave a lasting impression. There is not much about the Scarabs so the film directly focuses on Reyes becoming the new Blue Beetle while casually dropping the fact that there were others before.Susan Sarandon's Victoria isn't evil enough whereas her own weapon Carapax isn't menacing enough and are barely serviceable. What does work is the goofiness of the Reyes family and right dose of father-son dynamic, because what's a DC superhero without that? The action set pieces are generic and like I said, the film still delivers on providing basic harmless entertainment. The post credit scene does set it up for a standalone sequel without burdening itself from being part of DCU's planned future.","74 out of 139 found this helpful.

Guy has been a featuring member of Teen Titans for decades, holding his own as one of the coolest drawn characters that has a very interesting backstory regarding an alien symbiote. The character had immense potential to be turned into a promising live-action film-series out of it. And frankly speaking, I think the cast choice was good as well - they could've pulled off the hype. The only thing that ruined this film, however, is the writing. It's terrible - felt so rushed and low-depth at some points that you'd feel like pausing to not continue watching anymore. CGI was bad for some parts too, but that can still be overlooked as most of it gets the job done quite well. But the writing, man, it's awful. DCU won't have much to build on if they continue doing such pathetic job at writing stories like this.","17 out of 28 found this helpful.

This film is so much more than just a origin story for a new superhero! This film has a lot of heart, with the directors love and care for this character being evident throughout the film! The character was introduced perfectly, and I hope it gets enough love to get a sequel because it deserves one! Also, so many touchy and difficult societal issues are brought up and tackled in respectful and nuanced ways. Their inclusion doesn't pull you out of the movie whatsoever! You aren't hit over the head with anything and these issues actually end up aiding the story and character greatly and give the film that much more of an emotional punch!The acting was phanominal as well! All of the actors gave amazing performances and really were able to convey each of the characters emotions beautifully in every scene!The action was by far the best part of the film! The camera angles and movements made you feel as if you were experiencing the fights irl! They were awesome!The comedy was also fantastic and handled perfectly! I found myself laughing every other minute at some points because the jokes were just so good! George Lopez was AMAZING throughout the film and really brought life to every scene he was in! Perfect casting!!Overall, I had a fun time with this movie and I highly recommend watching it!","156 out of 292 found this helpful.

This cannot be a movie written by humans. The dialogue is just beyond gut wrenching puke. No way this was written by a sanely functioning human. Has WB lost its mind completely? From Immigration to name mispronounciation, poverty and other such blatant in-your face tropes about the latin american genpop. What were they trying to achieve here? Score ESG points for appeasing the ethnic minorties ?Susan Sarandon is completely wasted and reduced to a script reader with a monotone voice. The physical thrreat aka bad guy has to be the THE worst character ever produced in the history of movies. With a singular expression on his face and no character development he was punching bag for the protagonist. The supporting cast is headache inducing with non-stop conversing in their own colloquial terms much of which is left to be deciphered. Horrendous doesn't even begin to cover this movie. Steer clear and wait for streaming after all this movie was meant to be a streaming release initially, so that just tells about its quality. A bloated telenovela garbage with sprinkles of fortnite battles aimed at 10 year olds.","148 out of 221 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Expected more but still enjoyed it","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9267817/?ref_=tt_urv","AfricanBro","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120413622/?ref_=tt_urv","18 August 2023","I remember loving blue beetle in cartoons growing up so I was excited for this. I feel like people, generally speaking, aren't as hyped up for this. I enjoyed it but it was a mixed bag, there's nothing really adventurous attempted and for the most part, just felt good or okay enough. Too many things could've been done better.The family's dynamic was fine, yet the emotional connection between Jaime and Jenny was notably nonexistent- their attempt to forge it even prompted some to audibly scream no in the theatre. The actors' portrayal felt unconvincing, and the writing felt contrived, unimaginatively executed too. The familial bond is likely to resonate with fans later in the future, as evident in their concerted effort to show Blue Beetle is a family guy, along with the Perez family ethos. They really wanted to push that narrative and hammer it home. While I do know that in my brain, but I also wanted to feel that in my heart. James Gunn is a master at this, adept at bridging the gap between what I know and what I feel about a group of characters. They had too many family talks in my opinion, tried too hard. As for Blue Beetle himself, he's a character we'll love more the more we see him(I think), making his debut a respectable foundation for the future DC Universe. However, the ongoing controversy between DCU/DCEU and James Gunn's new vision might contribute to a diverse range of reviews.Pretty good comedic timing and the jokes didn't feel contrived. The suit had a cool design, and despite not having watched Blue Beetle cartoons in over a decade, it had familiarity. The transformation into Blue Beetle was strikingly done with a hint of horror, which I found compelling. I appreciated the mix of cartoonish yet realistic action sequences. There were still some 'fast and furious' ludicrous level action scenes.Some animations looked like video games with their 3D-like quality, and a few scenes lacked the grandeur suited for IMAX screens. The density of the visuals didn't match up, perhaps I'm influenced by the standards set by ""Oppenheimer,"" which was what I saw last in IMAX. Initially planned to watch in standard 2D, I went for the earliest available viewing instead.The story was a generic but it had a lot of interesting stuff in. Beyond the superhero himself, DC's attempt to bring some novelty into the genre was lacking. Some plot reveals didn't have the impact they should've. Improved character background execution, particularly for Nana and the main villain, was needed; their histories felt like it was mentioned only for plot convenience, notably the grandmother's history just because of how it was revealed. Some dialogue and plot towards the end was very predictable.Fighting scenes were mostly cool, although apart from the final one, they didn't reach their maximum climactic potential; only the last battle drew me in. The high personal stakes were great, clearly showing what was at risk and effectively following through on those stakes.A more serious and slightly darker tone would have heightened the emotional impact of the events in the third act. The movie seemed caught between taking itself very seriously and/or embracing a fun, lighthearted vibe, leaving an uncertain feel. It lacked a distinct impact or identity, floating in a sort of no man's land. If you didn't know Blue Beetle already or indifferent towards him, the film struggled to convincingly make you fall in love with the character or feel a connection. On the positive side, the movie showcased significant Latino representation. In terms of cultural blending, I'd rank Shang-Chi, Black Panther 2, Blue Beetle, Ms. Marvel, and then the first Black Panther.The movie excels in certain parts, while its shortcomings aren't overwhelmingly bad, but they could be better. Sadly, seemed to be more of the latter. The quick post-credit scenes were nice, sparing us from what often feels like a long wait usually. Loved that they included the previous versions of blue beetle, it's also quite rare for a superhero film to have a sense of standalone authenticity, rather than just serving as a vehicle to introduce new characters or set up future movies.I typically avoid badmouthing actors, but I believe acting could've been better. As previously mentioned, my earlier comment about the love interests still stands. The chemistry between the actors, the portrayal of emotions in their eyes-whether it was excitement, agony, or loss-and the conviction of the main villain didn't resonate with me. The lack of connection and genuine emotion felt like a first draft, and felt like a mid-2000s Disney show. This contributes to the feeling of a medley mixed bag, the dialogue, story, and acting all fell short of being amazing individually. While nothing was too bad, when combined, they accentuated each other, drawing attention to each.While far from flawless, I still left with a smile. The story was somewhat straightforward, and considering Blue Beetle's unique, I half-expected the movie to reinvent the wheel, though my hopes weren't too high. There were a lot of elements of a potentially mind blowing fantastic movie, It just doesn't feel like they were pieced together the best that they could've, but definitely still enjoyable. I know it's an origin story but it just feels like DC just played it super safe; and at a time when ""superhero burnout"" is a thing, playing it safe ain't too safe.","57 out of 115 found this helpful.

There's nothing new or interesting or anything creative about it. Heard it was originally a Max exclusive. To be honest, wouldn't be surprised if it got dumped there anyway. This is the most Marvel-like DC superhero flick you'll ever see in a while. It doesn't do much new, or even breaks any new ground in the superhero movie genre (not that there's any left to be broken anyway).I did like the family dynamics a little, but if anyone's seen Ms. Marvel of the MCU (that makes like, ten people including me), it will all seem a little too familiar, except this time they are Latino. Some jokes are drawn out a little too much, and just like Marvel, serious moments are diluted with dank jokes that nobody laughs at, except maybe the cast and crew themselves. The villain, was... as expected, forgettable. Makes sense why they didn't feature her prominently in any of the promo or trailers. But hey, when you're making brand-safe superhero movies for kids you gotta draw some lines, I guess.Overall, DC is just a scalding hot mess now, on an uncertain path both creatively and logically. I didn't even try to connect this movie in my head to any of the confusing mess of the DCEU and didn't even bother to use it as a foundation for James Gunn's Universe. If anyone wants, see for what it is and don't take it too seriously. If you don't, fine.

It's not quite a Spy Kids movie but it's close. A young adult version if you will. Don't get me wrong I love the Spy Kids movies for what they are and this movie made me think of them, but a grown-up version. Blue Beetle has heart, the emotion - I teared up a few times, - and the family dynamic is...great. It's a joyous movie that celebrates Latin culture well, but it falters when it comes to the superhero side of things, mainly the villain's goal and that he's fighting another version of himself.The violence and the softened but still gory on-screen deaths would be the things that make this Spy kids-like movie - to keep the previous example - more adult but it's the performances that make it so, except for one. Uncle Rudy was too much, he was in a low-budget Spy Kids movie, while the others weren't. It was so jarring. He was so grating for me that I was tensed whenever he was on screen, which was a lot. It's like he's trying to be the main character in this movie instead of the supporting. Not everything he says or does is cringe but enough to be worrying once the pattern was identified and there's two third of the movie to go. I don't know if it's the casting, the direction, or the script, maybe all three but Uncle Rudy was not it, not the secret sauce. He really brought this movie down for me. This role could have been played differently. He's being a caricature when the others are desperately trying not to be. I'm not hating on him but him being the main thing that doesn't quite work in the movie is pretty good in my book.Xolo, Bellissa, and Bruna really shine in this movie as do most of the Reyes family cast, they made me care about the family and what happens. Xolo is a great Jaime, I'm most familiar with the character from Young Justice but I recognized him in Xolo. Belissa as Jaime's sister was amazing, she seamlessly brought the dry humor and the sadness, she didn't lose me once. Bruna is a great find and this is probably the role that I'll recognize her from.Blue Beetle is entertaining and fun, a good time at the cinema, yet just shy of being great.@garcwrites.","70 out of 149 found this helpful.

Only complaints are the tonal shifts. His transformation feels like a horror movie transformation and the hero of course doesn't kill people (rolls eyes) but that rule doesn't apply to all the other good guys. They violently kill and make jokes about it. One of its biggest issues is how it is supposed to connect to the DC universe going forward. It doesn't do anything to answer any of those questions. Then there is the racial undertones that seem unnecessary and hurt the movie and again push the us vs them issue instead of trying to unite people. At least it was sort of subtle and could be missed.","13 out of 22 found this helpful.

But after hearing some positive buzz i thought i'd give it a chance. But nope. Its just another superhero movie.What it really is is just Ironman meets Spiderman. No one really cares about this character so they would have had to do something special to make the movie great. But they haven't. Cobra Kai's Xolo Maridueña is likeable enough as the hero. But everyone in this (except Susan Sarandon) is the hero. Either that or they're an annoying ""comedy"" sidekick.At least the action starts overshadowing the lame jokes at the half way mark. As before that its just the character getting thrown around as he discovers his powers. But even later its just robots fighting. This is something we've seen a hundred times at this point. But at least the hero doesn't fight Susan Sarandon in the finale.So i guess it could have been worse. Its not completely awful. There's just too many superheros now to care about this familiar feeling one.","292 out of 384 found this helpful.

His family are under threat as Cord Industries want the Scarab back, He must become one with the Blue Beetle and fight for his family and his freedom.The family element is really good, usually they say it's family oriented and there a joke or 2 but family is at the heart of the movie and the stand outs for me is NANNA the goat, a caring figure and a bada$$, the uncle is also great, he has some funny likes but his overall character works.Blue Beetle himself is really enjoyable, the movie is fine to be honest it's an origin story. Not man of those are AMAZING but his personality and likeness pulls the movie. Good action scenes and I love the suit, overall a good movie definitely worth watching and I'm looking forward to more Jamie. 2 post credits, the end one not worth it, it's a joke hahah 7.5/10.","43 out of 91 found this helpful.

It's also one of the funniest superhero movies ever with a very distinctive identity.There are some typical exposition dumps for the genre, and the emotional moments don't always hit the mark with a familiar structure, but it's a film with a huge heart, incredibly good humor, and excellent characters. All the ""good side"" characters are very well crafted and distinct, each of them having moments to shine.In technical terms, it has some surprises and tricks up its sleeve, with good editing, well-choreographed and entertaining fast-paced action, and a strong score and soundtrack. What's even better is the way it incorporates Latin culture to show us the true sense of community and family, elevating the film's message and contributing to most of the arcs.All the performances are outstanding. Madridueña has what it takes to be the star of this film and all of them deserve praises, but the best is the crazy uncle portrayed by George Lopez. Good movie even if you are tired of superhero movies.","222 out of 429 found this helpful.

It's fine and it does the job but isn't particularly inspiring or overly engaging. There's an attempt to inject some emotion into the piece but it feels a little half-hearted. Susan Sarandon feels under-developed as a villain which makes the stakes feel quite low.For the most part the action is pretty bland. The final set piece is a CG blur that is a bit of a snooze and considering the skill set of Blue Beetle the action could have been a lot better.Despite all this, the performance from Xolo Mariduena is strong and he creates a likeable and engaging character, as do all his family members. There's some good humour throughout, and the film does look quite good in parts, with some decent enough direction.Overall, this film is a perfectly average superhero film. It's formulaic and uninspired, but it is a fun enough watch.","23 out of 45 found this helpful.

My eight year old was bored like hell. She is way smarter that the guys who thought this was a good idea. The portrayal of the Latin community showed here isn't very serious. Off course there are happy positive resilient people in those communities but taking every stereotype and put it all at once in a family and making them look like the jesters is really annoying. This wasn't a fun movie, it's forgettable, it's the same old story again, it's meek, it has no villain , it's meh...
I wish superhero's could be treated more seriously than what they are getting this days. If you looked to South Korean show ""Moving"" you could learn a thing or two but no: the american paternalistic media society will only take that show and do a remake just because in their deranged conceptions Americans can't read and a foreign language is too annoying and capable of brain damage or creating communists or democrats as they call it there(Lol). Anyway, having a Batman (after Nolan) isn't enough. DC is way more childish and the CGI is always the worst but Marvel movies ,although better like their comics always were, are getting seriously damaged by the idea every hero needs to be Deadpool or Spider-Man copycats.Once again ,DC has shot itself in the foot, wait...it blew both feet with a single shot.","266 out of 355 found this helpful.

In tone, it's the closest to the first Shazam film and a similar degree in quality as well. The suit looks great, the fight scenes are cool and the story is unfortunately, generic. The niche fanbase of Blue Beetle will definitely enjoy this one as it is one of the better DC heroes debut and a much big screen debut than a certain other, much popular hero dressed in red who runs fast.

The empathy is overflowing. There is such celebration of the indomitable spirit of the Latin American immigrant, their success despite hardship. The Reyes family are supportive, sweet, loving and unashamed of their specific cultural identity. Apparently James Gunn did not have a huge amount of input on this, but this does work well as a lead in to his handling, aka the DCU: it cares deeply about its characters and ensures you do as well, there are great needle drops, and it really makes you care about someone that a lot of people currently do not.I would say about a third of the quick fire jokes should have been trimmed out. There are times where it really feels like they're jingling keys in your face. The fairly frequent, fun if not always the most creative action features a lot of CG, and though it's definitely better than the Flash and Ant-Man 3, it's especially helped by the fact that this was clearly shot on actual locations and physical sets, not surrounded by green screen screens or on the volume. They actually did toss a stunt person through the air, that car was actually knocked over, etc.Some of the violence in this really pushes the PG-13, and though there's not a huge amount of moderate to strong language in English, note that anyone speaking Spanish will pick up on some swearing there. I recommend this to any fan of comic books and the films adapting them. 7/10.","35 out of 78 found this helpful.

The one which crawled up Jaime's ass wasn't Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle was Jenny's Dad in his superhero form. False title if you ask me. The background story was uninteresting enough to pull the audience in. They should've shown more background on the Scarab. Where does it come from, what it actually is, what's its purpose. It'll give the audience more depth to tune in. The villain has created the bare minimum of threat to anyone to show any significance to be dealt with. So there's one more less reason to watch this movie. Usually Susan Sarandon delivers awesome performance either as an antagonist or protagonist. But in this movie, she kinda hovers around. But I understand that it wasn't her fault. She can only do so much with the script that's given to her. I feel bad for her. But alas, even with the negative reviews I've written, I still can't give it less than 6 stars. Cause at least it's more interesting than Black Widow. And I think the real Blue Beetle is coming in the next installment of this movie. I hope they'll do better next time. I'm giving it another star to give the writers some encouragement.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

However, upon his return he discovers his family (his mother & father, sister, nana, and his conspiracy theorist Uncle Rudy) is going through a rough time financially, and facing eviction. So, rather than going back to school, he ops to find work so he can assist his family.While Jaime and his sister are working at a local resort, the lovely young Jenny Kord (whose family owns/operates ones of the largest corporations in world) catches his eye. After coming to her defense, and getting fired for his troubles, Jenny offers her number to him and how she may be able to get him a job with her family's company.So the next day, Jaime goes to see Jenny Kord to inquire about a possible job. When he finds her, she appears rather stressed/panicked, and upon seeing Jaime, she hands him a box, telling him that his first job is to guard the contents of the box with his life, and not to open it.Well,, these events lead Jaime Reyes down a path he, or his family, never saw coming.After seeing the trailer, and hearing bad reviews, I was very much prepared to not like this movie at all. However, I really enjoyed it! It is in no way perfect or groundbreaking, but it is a good, fun movie. Very much a departure for DC (it didn't really feel like

The poly is straight forward and easy enough to follow or at least connect the dots. The light hoarded comedy glades back to other films but so many jokes stand on it own so there is no comparison.

Having seen Xolo Maridueña in Cobra Kai, I've seen both his capabilities of a dramatic actor and in action sequences, when he was cast in this role I was behind it 100%. Having now seen the film I think he's what makes it decent to good. The costume design was on point, especially the Blue Beetle costume. It's inspired by Young Justice and Injustice 2 along with other versions of the costume. Filming was done mainly at location and with heavy use of practical effects, such as the Blue Beetle suit. The director felt that the use of real-life locations allowed for the practical effects to be better integrated into the movie. Thus making it rely less on CGI and instead of what is best, practical effects. I really liked the action sequences, both how it was shot and edited. I think the film looks really good, great cinematography. I really liked the characters and actors playing them; Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord, Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord and Damián Alcázar as Alberto Reyes being three who impressed me.What Blue Beetle does extremely well is how they keep it family-focused and embraces the lore preceding this Blue Beetle, I'm of course talking about Ted Kord and Dan Garrett, the film also have a lot of heart. Critics found it to have plenty of humor and yes it does, but I felt most of the jokes fell flat because of how childish they were then again the majority of the audience was children when I saw it at the cinema. The highlight for me is Xolo Maridueña's magnetic performance in the title role, he's just terrific and does such a good job bringing the comic book character to life. The writer and director does too, a very fine bringing the story and origin to life. Blue Beetle is a fun little movie, using each million of its budget to good use, you kind of see why it was supposed to go straight to streaming as it looks quite cheap at times (mostly the antagonist and the visual effects to him, Raoul Max Trujillo as Ignacio Carapax / OMAC). But it's a good film, a good superhero film and worth your time.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

This movie has everything store for the audience. From Superhero fans to the general family audience all can enjoy this film with a happy face. Movie tells us about the Blue Beetle origin of how a boy from a middle class family gets consulted by a scarab and what situation does he face after getting that scarab into his life.The best thing about this film is it does not focus only on one character and the situation what he face but the whole family gets stucked into it and how they deal with that situation. Family Reunion and the way director has shown the Reyes family was one of the highlight of the film. The origin story doesn't hit you very much as it has same old vibe of origin superhero movies and sometimes you'll also remind some of the comic origin movies that are similar to this film.CGI & Action Sequences are top notch and specially the suit design looks cool and Whenever the suit uses it's different techs while fighting is a treat to watch with perfect cgi elements. XOLO has shined throughout the film and gave the character full justice so as the rest of the cast with acting performance too. Villain is one of the major problem of the superhero films and this film also faces the same issues because it doesn't show or the story justifies the strong villain character and at the end movie becomes average with old typical ending.All n all it's a fresh origin story with amazing cgi shots and action sequences plus a family drama with good acting performances which you can definitely enjoy and give this film a One time watch...","12 out of 30 found this helpful.

The Mexican-American culture feels properly ingrained into it and the comedy works out well because of the heart in it. The lead actor was pretty charming and his family was also really lovely in their roles. The Blue Beetle suit looks incredible because it's mostly an actual suit rather than complete CGI and the hand-to-hand action looks really nifty. The director knows how to properly compose scenes, with proper length in drama and action without chopping them up. But still, the movie is a pretty straightforward superhero origin story with only a few bits and pieces of freshness in it and some tried and tired cliches. Overall, this is only for those who really enjoy superhero films in general. With the superhero fatigue, it's no wonder there were only like 10 people in the theater.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

My only experience with him was from the Young Justice cartoons, which was positive. Blue Beetle is another DC superhero movie failure. A Latino superhero movie that was predictable, had uninspiring characters, a weak, boring villain, and a movie that played too much on Latino stereotypes. This could have been an inspiring Latino superhero movie that many could have related to and enjoyed instead it became a jumbled, boring, amateurish mess. No, even Nana couldn't save this mess of movie. The sad part is that the 2 leads seem to have amazing chemistry together based on their rounds of promotions. But have none in the actual movie. And based on the quality of the movie, it should have been direct to Max not worthy of a theatrical release. How many poorly made DC/WB movies can be made? All I can say is a wise man once said, ""That the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result."" Can James Gunn save the DC universe?

The entire main cast are the heart of this film and the hispanic family dynamic feels so real and distinct. I found myself deeply connected to their story and invested in their emotional moments as if I were joining them on the journey as well. While it can be said that the rest of the story feels very repetitive from previous superhero films, that would be the biggest fault of the film. The action, emotion, and unique style leave a very memorable mark on the current state of superhero film. Had this been released 15 years ago, it could've been as big of a hit as any MCU standalone film, as it shares the same quality of the likes of Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Captain America. With the way superhero films have been, this is a breath of fresh air, even with the familiar taste.","32 out of 57 found this helpful.

I got a bit teary eyed I can admit. The mix of English and Spanish really drove the authenticity of the emotional scenes. They were centred around grief, loss and pain.

I hoped it would get better, but it didn't. Every line Susan Sarandon's character says is some of the worst written dialog, and not even her acting chops could salvage it. But it's not just her character, the entire movie is full of terrible exposition presented in what seems like the laziest manner possible.The plot is paper thin, too. The only thing the main character wants is money to save his parent's home. Everything that happens to him is caused by happenstance, serendipity, or a ridiculously hard to believe contrivance. I was given no reason to root for any of these characters.I did like how they tried to develop the family dynamic, and I was hoping I could rally around that, but even that was clunky, at best. I had the urge to walk out from the very opening scene, but I forced myself to stay for nearly an hour. Eventually, the urge became too strong and I could no longer overcome it, and left the theater about halfway through.I'll give this a 3/10 because the actors were trying their best with what they were given, and it really showed in their performances. I especially enjoyed George Lopez's performance, but it wasn't enough to save this film. I also thought the CGI was pretty good (except for the shot looking up inside the Kord building, that shot looked rough).","193 out of 280 found this helpful.

Is this another superhero movie where the main character gets super powers through an alien artifact? Yes. But it goes BEYOND that. All superhero movies value romance and somewhat family but Blue Beetle does it justice when they talk about family.Being Mexican-American myself and growing up in white America this story touched my heart. I saw myself and my family in these characters and our struggles being put up on the big screen. Many people fail to realize that the Mexican community lived for the American dream. Our parents, and grandparents picked up everything they had on their shoulders and left their homes behind in order to find a better life for themselves and their children. Nowadays, the world is fastly changing under our feet and as the rich become richer, we get pushed out as the movie shows.This story is important for representation to our community. It's filled with comedic monologues and objects our community values. We as a Latino community value family over everything, especially living in the U. S. as long as we got family, we can always figure it out. I loved how they tackled the romance, it's not overly pushed in your face, it's gentle and natural how it grows throughout the film.Lastly, the cast was outstanding their dynamic was well put together. Their chemistry was amazing everyone represented an important role and performed great.As my title says this is a win for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans living in the U. S. Its a great film when you better understand who this movie was made for. This is an amazing movie for the whole family, give it a chance!!","32 out of 61 found this helpful.

He and screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer stick to the A-Z formula of a superhero origin story. We have a young, down-on-his-luck protagonist (sounds familiar?). Then, his life takes an unexpected turn when he finds himself unwittingly becoming a superhero. He's reluctant, confused and has to face a bigger problem compared to what he has experienced in the past.And yet, the familiarity of the story has the added advantage of being the first Latino-led superhero movie. The good news is, Angel Manuel Soto, doesn't confine it as a mere, surface-level novelty factor. He treats it with respect by delving deep into the Latino culture, particularly in the importance of family relations and values seen in the Reyes.The Reyes in Blue Beetle is an immigrant family struggling to make a living in the poor neighbourhood of Palmera City. When the movie first introduced the Reyes, they are already in a dire financial situation. They are about to lose their home after Kord Industries decided to raise the rent to an exorbitant level. The only glimmer of hope right now is their adult son, Jaime (Xolo Maridueña), a pre-law graduate who just returns home to reunite with his family. He finds out about the problem and his dad's (Damián Alcázar) health condition. He's eager to ease the family burden by hoping to land a lucrative job, only to end up settling with menial work alongside his younger sister, Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) as a maintenance and cleaning crew.The family dynamics angle gives the otherwise formulaic superhero movie a much-needed heart and soul. It's hard not to root for the likeable, tight-knit family like the Reyes such as Jaime's wacky and eccentric Uncle Rudy (George Lopez in a scene-stealing supporting role) and his beloved Nana played by the equally hilarious Adriana Barraza.Jaime's journey from being a nobody to a superhero may have been the same old superhero-movie cliches. But at least his story resonates well, thanks to Xolo Maridueña's charismatic and sympathetic lead performance. He shares great chemistry with the rest of the supporting cast playing the Reyes family members and so does he and Bruna Marquezine together.The latter plays Jenny Kord, the daughter of the late Ted Kord who founded Kord Industries before her scheming aunt, Victoria (the long-missed Susan Sarandon, who's clearly having fun chewing the scenery) takes over the business. Marquezine nails Jenny's spunky personality while her magnetic charm helps a lot in elevating her performance.Bruna Marquezine (middle) plays Jenny Kord in ""Blue Beetle"" (2023)Back to the story, Victoria is the one who found the mechanised alien artefact in the form of a blue scarab. Her goal is to draw an unlimited superpower from the scarab to activate her military-based creation of high-tech supersoldiers. Upon discovering her motive, Jenny tries to stop her by stealing the scarab. She subsequently entrusted the scarab to Jaime, who has no idea the level of trouble he's getting himself into. The scarab somehow chose Jaime as its host, where it embedded itself into his spine and even have him automatically equipped in a full-body armoured suit. He is also granted various powers and superhuman strength, complete with an inner voice (Becky G) known as Khaji-Da controlling and telling him what to do.Despite this being Angel Manuel Soto's first major big-budget Hollywood production, he manages to make good use of its reported US$120 million budget (believe it or not, Blue Beetle was originally slated for straight-to-Max streaming). The CGI isn't the greatest but decent enough without looking patchy and inferior (here's looking at you, The Flash). The director also showcased his excellent flair for well-choreographed action set pieces as he successfully brings Blue Beetle's multiple superpowers to life. Whether it was his impressive physical agility or taking down the bad guys with different types of weapons (one of them includes the heavily-promoted Final Fantasy VII video game reference), it's hard not to get immersed by Blue Beetle's superhero abilities.Blue Beetle also benefits from Bobby Krlic's catchy, '80s-style synthesiser score and an equally cool soundtrack. The movie even has a field day with its pop-culture references from the 1995 classic telenovela Maria la del Barrio to the superhero parody series of El Chapulín Colorado. Given the less-than-stellar results of Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash, it's nice to see a DC movie, albeit an unlikely one like Blue Beetle is back on track. Several shortcomings aside such as Raoul Max Trujillo's one-note performance as Victoria's main enforcer, Conrad Carapax and the tedious third act, Blue Beetle remains a surprisingly entertaining, funny and heartfelt little package of a summer-movie blockbuster.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But, you can't hate on the comics, saying ""this is like every other teen superhero"". Well, if you said that when the comics first came out, nobody would believe you, because most of the superhero's at that time were adults. Yes, in 1940 Robin (dick Grayson at that time) did come out. But he was only a mere sidekick for Batman. Though, It might seem like it, I'm not targeting anybody. So most of the the younger superhero's, we're only sidekicks.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The only good part was the family dynamic in the movie which was nice to see but I really found myself caring very little about the characters and the villain is extremely average and uninspired.The fight scenes I just very bland and it seems like there's a lot that happens but they were just boring and very average even though they try not to be. This movie really made me contemplate why I even watch movies anymore and how predictable cinema has become instead of being something that should ignite the senses and the imagination and this was the complete opposite of that and has made me not go and watch random superhero movies anymore.I've never given any marble or DC movie of 4 out of 10 and this is the first because it just felt like a waste of my time and at no point was I excited and in fact I actually walked out in the middle of a fight scene with 25 minutes left to go in the movie.","131 out of 187 found this helpful.

I know there is a ton of bias going into this with people assuming DC this and Gunn that, but this movie was so much more enjoyable to watch than expected and I was pretty happy with it.Yes, there are a few phrases that feel forced and would fit into the cookie cutter superhero flick. However, that only really happened 2-3 times. The tech shown in the movie was so incredibly fun and the suit - AMAZING. The quality of that suit is what got me in the theatre in the first place and it did not disappoint.It was a really fun movie (without spoiling it), it was not a replication of another, it had some fun characters (and one or two I wasn't a fan of, some moments of not great acting, but it wasn't a massive budget to begin with). Actually teared up at one point (okay, maybe 2).The best way to enjoy this movie is to get out of your own head with the expectations and inter-connectivity of the films and weird sensitivities. I saw another review mentioning the ""fascist"" comment - as a big fan of the character referenced, I still laughed out loud hearing it because it fits the wild energy of the character that said it (clearly intended as a joke). There's no secret agenda, it's a fun movie for a more obscure character, and I had a blast watching it. Went in thinking it wasn't going to be worth the money, but was pleasantly surprised and look forward to watching it again.","35 out of 72 found this helpful.

The script was horrendous. I hope to never see George Lopez in another movie after this one; I absolutely hated his character. Just terrible. From the super-smart, smart-ass, stupid uncle to the sweet old grandma who led a revolution at the end, and the mother who's only purpose for being in the movie was to support her son for 5 seconds at the very end, everyone sucked. Xolo Mariduena was a good choice for Blue Beetle but he couldn't save this movie from the terrible writing and directing. He was the only actor I didn't loath by the end of the movie.Just awful. The story was incredibly predictable from the first 10 minutes. The directing was terrible. Important or heartfelt scenes fell flat, the jokes never landed, the action was boring. It felt like a knock-off version of Ironman, but not good. I am mad at myself for wasting my time with it.And the worst thing is the studio will try to blame the writers / actors strike for the bad box office. The writers are to blame for the script and story, so they deserve some of the blame. But the movie is going to flop because it is truly terrible.DC has some of the coolest superheroes, but they can't make a movie worth watching. Blue Beetle has so much potential, I wish it had been made by the early marvel studios.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

Now, we might decide to ""not take it seriously"" and just enjoy the film as a feel-good super-powered adventure, but we've gotten better movies of that nature.For example, DC's very own ""Shazam!"" Interestingly, both films make family a prominent theme in their plot and it proves to be a bankable choice once again. There is a beautiful family dynamic on display here that is hard to deny.The movie falls back on the protagonist's family for most of its comedic content too. However, more often than not, the jokes unfortunately don't land for me. They might come in the form of harmless antics and cheesy lines, but I don't think they really cater to a more mature audience due to their simplicity and lack of originality.The events in the film are equally unimpressive to me because of how recycled everything feels. We've seen too many elements of this story in other superhero movies, and so Blue Beetle's character starts to lose his uniqueness besides the suit (which we learn too little about). It makes me begin to question the point of telling this story.Thankfully, the visual and special effects in this film are one of its positives. The suits and tech on display are deliciously detailed and the fight scenes are choreographed quite well. It makes the action scenes really engaging.Summarily, I think Blue Beetle had the potential to be better. I don't know what the vision for the film was, but what we get is a bit underwhelming.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A cookie-cutter superhero origin story that leaves little else to the imagination","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9322253/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","14 September 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is a superhero film serving as the 14th installment in the DC Extended Universe. Starring Xolo Maridueña in the title role, it functions as a cookie-cutter superhero origin story that leaves little else to the imagination.After recently graduating from university, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns to his hometown in Palmera City. While awaiting a job opportunity at Kord Tower, Jaime is handed a small box by Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), the niece of the company CEO Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). Jenny tells Jaime to guard the box with his life and ensure its contents don't fall into the wrong hands. Upon arriving back home, Jaime's family convince him to open the box where they soon discover it contains a mysterious alien Scarab. When Jaime touches the Scarab, it fuses with his body, giving him a durable exoskeleton and super powers that allow him to become the hero known as the ""Blue Beetle"".Ever since the character's first appearance in 1939, the superhero Blue Beetle has undergone not one but three different canon iterations. The most recent of which is Jaime Reyes, whom upon debuting in 2006, has gone on to become arguably the most recognisable version of the character. From appearing on the TV series ""Smallville"" to being playable in various DC video games, it seems that the Reyes incarnation of Blue Beetle is the one that resonates most prominently with both modern comic book fans and novices alike. In 2023, the character made his live action film debut in the DC Extended Universe's ""Blue Beetle"", a cut-and-paste origin story adventure that feels all too familiar.There's hardly anything this film does that hasn't already been done in almost every superhero movie before it. From the very beginning, it's hard not to have a feeling of deja vu when the set up is first introduced to us. We watch as a team of explorers uncover an otherworldly artefact in Antarctica, which is then immediately handed over to a big-shot CEO of a major company who plans to use it for sinister purposes. Afterwards, we see the protagonist inadvertently becoming involved with said artefact, and using it to fight back against the villainous CEO before it is too late. Does that sound familiar to anyone? If it does then that's because the superhero genre has reached a point where it is near impossible for an origin story to follow any other set pattern. As a result, the film feels dated right out of the box. There simply isn't much entertainment value to be had other than perhaps through the occasional jokes about the lead character's ethnic origins. Maybe it's just superhero fatigue finally setting in, but I found nothing else worth mentioning about the film's plot.With that in mind, the film at least does a nice enough job at investing the audience in its overarching theme of familial bonding, something which is heavily emphasised in Latin American culture. Though they do feel a bit generic at times, I did like the parts where Jaime fights to protect those he cares about. The best scenes were when Jaime is learning about what powers he has and noticing that his family members support him along the way. It is clear here that the Reyes family have each other's backs no matter what, which is especially evident given how often they are seen placed in the way of danger. Without giving away spoilers, I particularly liked one scene that made great use of the family dynamic when they are required to fight back against a large number of enemies. In most other films, the main character's family members are either relegated to the background or end up used as a cheap plot device to move the story along, but here they are all used quite nicely. Even Jaime's elderly grandmother has a highlight moment.In the lead role, Xolo Maridueña was the perfect choice to play the eponymous character, not merely due to his Latin heritage but also because of the physicality involved. Anybody who watched Maridueña on ""Cobra Kai"" will likely remember his ability to handle himself in combat, dishing out blow after blow against his adversaries. It's just a shame that Jaime Reyes is so generically written in this movie, like somebody took Peter Parker/Spider-Man and gave him a Latin American paint job. That's not to say I disliked him as a whole, the problem is that I couldn't see anything in him that hasn't been done before in every other young, inexperienced, down-to-earth superhero protagonist since the genre first began. Still, there's room for growth should the character ever appear in a future DC film project.As previously mentioned, the Reyes family are what I would consider to be the emotional backbone for this film. Jaime's grandmother, known simply as ""Nana"", certainly knew how to hold her own whenever things got tough and Adriana Barraza's performance helped make her seem like she could definitely manage it. Nana was my favourite of Jaime's relatives because she seemed like someone with not only the necessary life experience but also the toughness to go along with it. Coming a close second would be Jaime's sister Milagro, played by Belissa Escobedo. Milagro is the type of younger sibling most of us would dream of having, always there to back you up in a pinch and never giving up on you when things turn ugly. In spite of the rest of the film's issues, It's comforting to see a superhero film that places such a strong significance on family values.However, I think Susan Sarandon was wasted as the film's main antagonist Victoria Kord. Her character is so one-dimensional and uninteresting that virtually any other actor/actress could have played the role. Kord is nothing more than your run-of-the-mill greedy CEO villain - she's rich, she's powerful, and she wants to destroy the hero at all costs. That's about it. Though they do attempt to give her some sympathetic backstory, it is never properly expanded upon beyond the fact that her family life is the polar opposite to Jaime's. This could have been a great opportunity to have made her a more layered character but instead the filmmakers played it too safe and her end fate is about as predictable as they come.When taking into consideration the varied quality of the DC Extended Universe, I suppose you could do a whole lot worse than ""Blue Beetle"". It serves its purpose as an obligatory introduction to the character for the uninitiated and sets the stage for his potential return should the studio executives see fit. The film's saving grace is its wholesome view on the necessity of having a loving family, which itself is hardly an original concept (the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies have been doing this for years). With all that said, I can only really recommend this film to hardcore fans of DC, because there are so many other better movies out there that are a more valuable use of one's time.I rate it 6/10.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Set in a fictitious city much of it looks like Los Angeles and the featured family is of Mexican ancestry. In one scene they even warn each other about being discovered as undocumented migrants. But I see much of it was also filmed in Georgia.The featured actor is 21-yr-old Xolo Maridueña as Jaime (hy-mee) Reyes, just returning home from college with a degree in Pre-Law. Through a chance encounter with a young lady who happens to be an heir to a wealthy company, he looks her up the next day as she is pilfering a scarab to keep it safe, out of the hands of those who want to use it for harmful purposes.But Jaime gets in the middle of it all, gets the scarab (about the size of a hand) and brings it home in a fast-food box, and is told ""do not open the box, do not touch the scarab.""Of course his crazy family, particularly his sister, violate that instruction immediately, the scarab jumps onto his face, eventually it gets inside him (via his butt-hole?) and quickly he is overwhelmed by powers he has no idea how to control or how to actually use.It is the origin story of a superhero, the Blue Beetle, but frankly it is done in such a silly manner at times, then in a manic style, that for most of its 2-hour running time I was laughing uncomfortably and waiting for a more meaningful story.I don't know why this was made, there really is nothing novel about it. Most of the ""featured"" reviews here are accurate. It is NOT a good movie and I certainly would NOT want to watch it again. At home, with my wife, on DVD from our public library.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I always see superhero movies since my childhood and personally, I prefer Marvel movies in general. There was some very good DC movies indeed, but not since a lot of time. I liked a lot Batman movies with Christian Bale, Suicid Squads I and II and Joker for example. Shazam 2 was okay, but I preferred the first one (storyline and humour). Blue Beetle has the same kind of humour of Shazam 1, which I liked. The suit looks great, the fight scenes in general are nice, but the storyline was a bit ""cliché"". I very liked the fact that the character and the actor seems close to the comics. I very appreciated that the story was latino-like because this help us to see others things in the cinema industry than always americans one. They done great compared to the recent Transformers : Rise of the beasts in that way.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The superhero movie no one asked for.... About a b list character no none other than die hard dc fans have ever heard of........ Is actually pretty good.... Who knew....Based on the comic book of the same name, Blue Beetle tells the story of Jaime Reyes, he's just graduated from Gotham university, he comes back to his family home in (Palmera city, which I think is a fictional city in the same way that Gotham and metropolis is, but Palmera looks more like a city in florida... Like if metropolis is new York, Palmera is like a Miami)He comes home to the news that his family is in financial trouble, he gets a job with his sister cleaning rich people's houses, here he bumps into Susan's Sarandons corporate bad villain Victoria Kord, along with her neice Jenny played by Bruna Marquezine. Victoria and Jenny and at odds over the direction of the family company, and krone specifically, about the application and use of a magical, out of this world, super power giving blue scarab thingy...Jenny steals it, gives it to Jaime to hide... And... Off we go with the plot.Thats all covered in the first 60 seconds of the trailer, so if you're ruining late for this movie... Fear not... As long as you've seen the trailer, you've seen the first 20 mins of this movie.Blue Beetle is one of those characters that I'd never really heard of.... Other than I think one or two appearances on Smallville, and I think the character is in one of the injustice games.It's not like it's one of DCs flagship properties....So when it was announced they were making a blue Beetle movie.... I and many others were like.... Really...?..... Why...?Buuuuuuut.... The exact same thing was said about guardians of the galaxy... And look how that turned out.And blue Beetle does the same.... To a lesser extent I'd say. I'm not saying blue Beetle is on a par with guardians of the galaxy.... It's not....But it is an enjoyable movie.It's hard not to draw comparisons to other comic book movies... And this movie had a healthy dose of ant man, spiderman and iron man.Especially iron man.. Character beats and structure wise.... Theres a lot of iron man in here... But... If you're gonna borrow.... Borrow from the best,Cast
Everyone does a good job with what they're given....Xolo Mariduenua carrys the film quite comfortably, and he gets to show case a bit more range than I think he's been afforded on kobra kai...
Comfortably and believably switching gears from likeable and humourous to emotional and thoughtful.The familiar faces rounding out his family are equally likeable, good, and most importantly, believable. You definitely buy into the closeness of the family and of the culture.Susan Sarandon isn't exactly breaking new ground as a by the numbers corporate villain.... But... She's. Susan Sarandon, it's not like she's bad in this.. She's just playing a stereotypical bad guy.Oh... And it's great to see What we Do in the shadows actor Harvey Guillen also.... He's got a very small role in this, but great to see.(if you haven't seen the what we do in the shadows tv show... Definitely check it out, it's BRILLIANT)Something that took me by surprise was the social commentary aspect of the film....Sublte comments on racism, classism, corporate patriarchal traditions, gentrification of poorer areas, plight of immigrant life... ....yeah. All of that is very subtly peppered thought the movie... All of it will go right over the kids heads.... But that's OK cos they'll be busy enjoying what is a fairly enjoyable movieSpeaking of kids, I saw this with my 6 year old and my 9 year old.... And both very much enjoyed it (I'll give their scores at the end)And speaking of being subtle.... If you like this content be sure so hit the like button... And if you wanna see more....you know what to do....Both the soundtrack and score is pretty on point also...There's a couple of needles drops (motley crue and Cyprus hill being 2 standout, grin inducing moments)The cgi is for the most part pretty good, there's no 'omg look at how bag the cgi is' moments...So, while this is a good, fun, not overly long movie (about 2 hours...).... Much like the flash.... It feels like too little too late in the dcu or dceu...Like... Is that part of the old dcu continuity? The 'Snyders verse'? Is it part of James Gunns new continuity?Blue Beetle, like the flash, shazam, and aquaman 2 is one the movies that was and is kinda caught in limbo... With the regime changes at Warner bros dc....I know James gunn has talked about it being part of his dc... It least the character... But yeah...the whole dc continuity thing just seems a bit of a mess....Which is a shame.... Cos the Jaime Reyes character would have been very fun to have alongside the bigger guns in a justice league movie... Bringing aix of spiderman / antman vibes, kinda like civil war...I could that dynamic working well... But alas.... Who knows what's gonna happen justice league / team up movie wise.Like if I knew Jaime Reyes / blue Beetle was gonna be in a team up movie next year or the year after... I'd be hyped for that.... Time will tell....So gonna go with 7/10 for this one....The 6 year old gave it 7/10 also and the 9 year old gave it 9/10!Its an enjoyable, if by the numbers, superhero origin story.... With a likeable lead and a likeable, believable surrounding cast, pdecent enough cgi.... And hints of where potential sequels might go.(btw there is scenes during AND after the credits... So be sure to stick around for them)And be sure to check out my other movie reviews hereJimmy@scottishgeekguy on youtube and all social media✌🏻","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

There's a rough-and-tumble quality to his camerawork that makes the fast action intermittently fun. The performances are also quite fine, with George Lopez being the primary standout and the one bright spot of personality in the film.That's about all in terms of positives. This script has the intelligence of an actual beetle, the tact of a jackhammer, and the consistency of a pandering politician.Characters? Bland. Jaime, our protagonist, complains and is cowardly until the film's last 20 minutes when a character arc is rushed upon him with no skill or feeling.Plot? Perhaps the most predictable I've ever seen in the genre. Every single moment of the movie plays out exactly as you think it would. I predicted the end of literally every single scene. Not an ounce of creativity is present in this piece of writing.Dialogue? Inane. It's always contrived, corny, and shows blatant disregard for its audience's reasoning capabilities.In short, it's a sometimes flashy piece of total redundancy that's a complete bore from start to drawn-out finish.","86 out of 142 found this helpful.

When the Scarab chooses Jaime to be its host, he is bestowed with an incredible range of superpowers and weaponry.I get it, resetting what is already a risky and messy cinematic universe is a risky move, especially since opening it by introducing a quite unpopular character for the wider audience. But man I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't enjoy this one, it's a fresh and solid start if not a great one. It's slick, fun, and packed with emotions, while this type of origin story isn't new in the superhero genre but there's something special about Blue Beetle's central plotline. It's about the power of family's love and support also acceptance of what destiny has given to us, sometimes it doesn't meet our expectations, and sometimes it's exceeded it more than we can imagine. We can see it from Jamie's character developed throughout the story, actually not just him but also his family. Life after college isn't what he's imagined, Jamie even said he failed the family and it just gets worse when the scarab chooses him. He couldn't grasp the reality of it at first, but he slowly embraced it, Jamie is destined to be their hero, to be bigger than he had hoped for.I never see Maridueña's prior work, but he's certainly the right guy for the role. He delivers a joyful and honest performance, not to mention the rest of the cast who played the family, their chemistry natural and strong. George Lopez' Uncle Rudy is probably my second favorite, The dude is literally a comic relief. I'm not a big fan of the villains in this movie, there's nothing really special other than they play an important part in the story, obviously. I think they are sort of merely a threat, Susan Sarandon's performance isn't bad though. It's crazy that the CGI is way better and cleaner than The Flash, which has more budget than this movie. Both of the suits are practical but, once again, the Blue Beetle is definitely superior. The first suit-up looks terrifyingly awesome.Blue Beetle is a promising start for the DCU.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

Yes, that's because of the impending end of the moribund DCEU, but there's a flash-in-the-pan energy to this movie; the reality is, making a Blue Beetle movie is either an act of supreme confidence (ala Guardians of the Galaxy) or supreme desperation (it's already greenlit, we might as well finish it). I suspect it's the latter.Because Blue Beetle, whilst having some diehard fans, is decidedly D tier in the DC Universe. Personally, I've never really connected with the character, but to be honest, I liked what I saw here. Jaime Reyes (played by Xolo Mariudena) is a likeable, fun protagonist, the sort of old school Spiderman type that DC desperately needs. His family is fun, with George Lopez being the clear highlight, even if the film beats you over the head with the theme of FAMILY more than a Fast & Furious film. It's sweet, but a bit cheesy.The action scenes are surprisingly good (for the most part), with a lot of creative uses of the Blue Beetle's power set. They're easy to comprehend, well choreographed, and you really feel the impact of each hit and punch. Aside from one action scene in particular (outside of Jaime's house), they're well done and memorable.And, I do have to commend the final fight of this film. The film goes in a direction I genuinely didn't expect thematically, and it handles some truly weighty themes. Yes, I know this film is focused on the Mexican-American experience, ""familia,"" and is set in a gorgeous Miami/Los Angeles hybrid (Palmera City is without a doubt the best looking and most memorable city in the DCEU - the Batman's Gotham doesn't count, because that would obviously take the crown).The moment with Raoul Trujillo (he essentially plays the bruiser for Susan Sarandon's um...antagonist, I legitimately forgot her name) basically is revealed to have been a child soldier captured by the U. S. Army and turned into a super soldier is surprisingly powerful. It puts into context what this silly superhero movie is really about: criticizing the long history of U. S. imperialism in Latin America and the exploitative capitalism and white supremacy that entailed. Heavy stuff.However, I'd be lying if I said this film was anything more than a slightly-better-than-expected, yet mostly average superhero romp. The script - outside of some nice moments and funny lines - is pretty awful; it's predictable, basic, and sometimes feels written by an AI. Most of the characters are banal and unmemorable, particularly Jaime's love interest and Susan Sarandon's Victoria Kord. To say Sarandon was definitely miscast in this film would be an understatement. She has no screen presence, feels like she's running through the motions, and is completely forgettable.I also kind of wish the Blue Beetle lore was better explained and that the ""Scarab"" (the device that turns Jaime into the BB) had more of a personality. I think if this film ever got a sequel, they'd focus more on that, but generally...it's a missed opportunity.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Given that the family played a larger role in it once again, the tone of the film is similar to that of ""Shazam!"" despite the fact that the tale is not particularly compelling. Not that ""Shazam!"" had some epic tale, but I believe it had a greater concept. The cast is adequate, but there are times when they veer too far into melodrama. From the beginning, through his purpose, the fights, and the conclusion, the villain is all you would expect from a D-grade super hero film. There have been enough discussions about this character's future to satisfy everyone: will there be a sequel? Will the character move to the newly created universe? Is he or she a part of the DC Extended Universe or the DC Comics Universe?In my opinion, there won't be a sequel because of the new change of direction James Gunn is going to take in the DC universe, just as the Flash movie won't have a sequel i presume. Additionally, I'm not sure how a blank slate can be achieved without the baggage of the prior universe when you always toward the past rather than the future. In other words, there is always a chance to see Blue Beetle again, but I'm not sure who will play it or whether or not the genesis narrative will be exactly the same this time. I also won't be holding my breath for it.In conclusion, the film is ""okay"" It has its moments, but nothing particularly remarkable or memorable can be said. The two credit scenes are, I suppose, acceptable.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

More Nana, less Rudy would have been fabulous.Family dynamic- it was heartwarming. They are there for each other, even in the most insane circumstances. It's the glue that holds this movie together.The Bad:Uncle Rudy - listen, I like George Lopez. But this character was kinda grating. He does have some good scenes, but overall, he was pretty one-note.Susan Sarandon - again - one note. No depth, no good lines, nothing. She deserves so much better than this role.The writing - Listen Hollywood- we get it. White people = bad. It was very 'of the time', and it was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Another reviewer likened it to a script written by AI, and there are times I wouldn't have doubted it. It was clunky and rather preachy.That being said, I would watch it again. Would I go out of my way to see it whenever it's on? No. But if I ran across it while scrolling, sure. And I'd let the littles watch it, too. There is some violence, but I'd liken it to a video game.

The core messages are good, but perhaps not original. Still, well-done tropes are still enjoyable. The SPX are very good. Most of the suit is practical effects so they look real and there isn't CGI overload.This is definitely an ""upper tier"" DC superhero movie.

Beatle obviously didint have a huge opening. But I had some hopes. The movie is a decent entertainer. The family angle was good with comedic, emotional and brave moments. As well as new culture being explored in Hollywood. Latinos. I watched this in a city like Florida so had the vibes in! Moving on The main lead had some good presence in the movie known from cobra Kai with good acting. The vfx weren't bad but we're not the realistic. I wasn't a big fan. It could have been better. The story and pace was not bad too for a super hero genre predictable but not boring. Overall decent entertainer.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

From its painfully cliché dialogue to its cringe-worthy attempts at humor, every scene makes you want to crawl under your seat. The wooden acting and lackluster special effects further cement its status as a cringe fest. The plot, if you can call it that, is a mishmash of tired superhero tropes and predictable twists. The forced romantic subplot is cringe incarnate, with zero chemistry between the leads. Even the costume design seems like a bad cosplay. In a sea of superhero hits, Blue Beetle manages to stand out as a cringe masterpiece that's more likely to induce eye rolls than applause.Dont even go to the movies wait for the digital release
Such cringe !!!","70 out of 117 found this helpful.

The film is directed by Angel Manuel Soto and stars Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes, a teenager who is bonded to a powerful alien scarab that gives him superhuman abilities.I found Blue Beetle to be a refreshing and original superhero movie.The film focuses on the importance of family. Jaime's family is his rock, and they support him unconditionally. This is in contrast to many other superhero movies, which focus on the hero's journey of self-discovery and independence.Also, the film has a sense of humor. It is not afraid to be funny, and it does so in a way that is both clever and heartwarming. This is a welcome change from the dark and brooding tone of many other superhero movies.Finally, the film is simply well-made. The acting is good, the directing is sharp, and the action sequences are exciting.Overall, I found Blue Beetle to be a refreshing and original superhero movie. It is different from other superhero movies of late in a number of ways, and it is all the better for it. I highly recommend it to fans of the superhero genre and to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining film.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An Above Average Superhero Origin Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9281797/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","25 August 2023","DC is in a bit of a flux right now as they are between the end of DCEU and the start of the new DCU, but we have Blue Beetle now and I saw it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man become combined with an alien scarab that gives him special powers, this causes him to be hunted down by nefarious enemies.Main Character
Xolo Mariduena has been a young actor mainly known for his really good work on Cobra Kai. He plays Jaime Reyes here and he is great in the role. He brings plenty of vibrance to the role of Jaime and he nails the emotional scenes too. This is just a really likeable main character and I thought he did a really good job of being a lead for a character that I am pretty sure the majority of mainstream viewers no very little about.Supporting Characters
This has a large group of supporting characters and some of them work, some of them don't. Bruna Marquenzie plays Jenny Kord and is a big ally to Jaime Reyes, she was good in the film and I liked the chemistry between the two of them. It was nothing special, but it worked in this film and I think she has a pretty decent future ahead of her.This story really focuses on family, the main one being the Reyes family and all of them do a fantastic job in really building that bond. George Lopez is probably my favourite as his uncle and he provided the most laughs in the film. But all of them were great in their roles.But the villains of this film fell flat for me. Susan Sarandon plays Victoria Kord and she is just really dull, she doesn't really add much to this role. It's not that she is terrible or anything like that it is just she is the most forgettable part of the film. They try to give the other villain Carapax some character but it is way too late to get the impact that I think people wanted.Story
The best thing I can say about the story is that it is pretty functional. It does a good job with the Reyes family and how their bond strengthens Jaime and his ability as Blue Beetle with this linked to Jenny and her family it works too. But this is a really generic story, it would have been way better if it came out 15 years ago but we have seen everything here before in other films. It tries something towards the end of the film to rise it up but it doesn't quite work and makes the film feel a bit cheesy and predictable.Script
The script is okay, there is some decent humour and drama in there that makes this an entertaining watch. But sometimes, the humour feels a bit forced, I mean it feels like some of the weaker MCU films with comedy that doesn't quite work. The drama also is a mixed bag with some of it not really working in the context that they want.Style
The film looks pretty good. I like the design of the Blue Beetle suit, especially with it being a mostly practical suit, the film has some real exuberant colour and feel to it which is really great to see. Though, as I kind of mentioned before, the pacing and structure of the film doesn't quite work and is quite generic with a few lacklustre action scenes.Overall
Overall, Blue Beetle is an above average film. This is an entertaining watch, especially for a new character on the big screen, but it plays it pretty safe and never does enough to push itself into a better film. If you are interested in this film then I would say give it a chance, just don't expect the next Dark Knight.Rating - 6/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie kind of felt like Power Rangers on the CW network, albeit with a much higher budget. There was nothing to care about here. I think DC was stretching to find more characters to bring to big screen. He is a supporting character at best. It is a good comparison to Shazam 2 with all the focus on secondary characters. Both are a waste of money and a little on time. If you have nothing else to watch its ok.","61 out of 106 found this helpful.

Like many superheroes he became one quite by accident. He was given a blue scarab beetle in a fast food box and told ""guard it with your life"" but ""don't open it.""Ha! Those are comical instructions for something handed over in a box that a hungry pigeon can open.The person who gave him the mcguffin was Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), the daughter of a wealthy business magnate and member of the Kord family which apparently had their hands in a lot of things including weapons manufacturing.Jaime was going to faithfully follow the instructions given to him by the attractive rich girl, and he would've too had his sister not opened the box. Jaime still lived with his father Alberto (Damian Alcazar), his mother Rocio (Elpidia Carrillo), his abuela (Adriana Barraza), his sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo), and his tio (George Lopez). They were a colorful family that didn't do much to make the movie better. If anything they took credibility away from the movie and made it more like a Sunday morning cartoon.Jaime would have to fight against a Kord super soldier created by the super evil Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). She was so patently evil she also made the movie lack credibility. She was your standard greedy, immoral, anything-for-profit bad guy (or gal).As I was watching the movie all that went through my head was the number of movies I saw in it. There was Iron man, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Venom, and even Robocop 2. ""Blue Beetle"" looked like ChatGBT churned out the script. There were lines from the nemesis like ""your love for your family makes you weak"" which is an oft repeated insult to heroes. And Susan Sarandon's character even said ""the power will be mine"" to Jaime when she captured him. You don't get more generic than that.""Blue Beetle"" had the budget and all the glitter and glitz, but it lacked anything of substance. Even the fact Jaime refused to kill was nothing new or novel.I heard this movie flopped (relative to its budget) and I'm not surprised. DCEU/DCU is pumping out mediocrity all too efficiently. I wonder at what point do they go back to just Batman.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

He never really worked in the mainstream of the DC Universe.The reactions for the first Shazam (Captain Marvel) movie made think this would work. I thought Shazam was going to fall flat... the second one actually did. Nobody remembers Captain Marvel even though he was an A-List hero (40's-50s), that outsold Supes and Batman for over a decade.Despite DC pushing this 3rd Blue Beetle HARD since introducing him, he just hasn't garnered much of a following. Reyes' verision has been ""kid friendly"" hero since being introduced (like Captain Marvel/Shazam), and I honestly thought it was going to be REALLY good! A goofy ""Scooby-Doo"" kid friendly Super-hero romp, with a young Latino as the alter-ego! It's gonna be a hit!I WAS WRONG! I found myself checking the time over and over again... I was just bored! The CGI was kept to a min imum compared to other movies and what was there wasn't that great. The movie did nothing for me at all.

This generic mishmash of the well and truly worn-out superhero template differs only in that it desperately tries to pander to demographic stereotypes and messaging. The origin story needs no description, you've already seen it a hundred times over in various films, tv shows or comics. Sarandon's mailed in performance as the villain was dull, wooden, and witless. As always, George Lopez played George Lopez as well as he knows how - with the voice of a badger and the personality of a telemarketer calling you on your personal cell at 9 o'clock at night. Some will say it's superhero fatigue. For myself, it's dumpster fire exhaustion. We need to get back to making great films for everyone. Great writing, acting and directing will always have universal appeal.

The first impression is that it had good jokes that I laughed along with. The whole movie revolves around a comedy-action movie so there was plenty of jokes to go around with. The acting was great with everyone especially Jamie Reyes/Blue Beetle (Xolo Mariduena) making him a likable protagonist. George Lopez playing as Uncle Rudy was my favorite character because he was basically the comedian of the movie. It was glad to see him back on the big screen. The cinematography with the special effects and CGI was good of Blue Beetle himself and there was a lot of blue and purple color schemes going on. It was fresh to see an old DC character getting his own movie. Director Angel Manuel Soto does a great job of portraying Blue Beetle's origin story off to the world. Overall, Blue Beetle is great with its acting, jokes, and action. I would recommend watching it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","35 out of 78 found this helpful.

Apologies for my English and lack of adjectives as I am not native.The Blue Beetle manages to push the right emotional buttons. The first 2/3 will keep you tight in the movie seats. It's all there:the vulnerable family who needs a hero.the hero who doesnt want to be a hero but out of a sudden is facing a mythical alien tech (which doesnt't stop to tickle the viewer's fantasy until the end) which turns him into a superhuman force.a serious undertone in the movie which, in the first 2/3 of the movie, keeps the atmosphere very dense, Superman-style. Despite the all-out-happy-jolly Hispanic family vibe, the serious undertone, driven by the weight of responsibility on his shoulders, remains.the Hispanic family is a perfect choice because it gives the movie a lot of the energy in the first half and prevents it from being a dark science fiction movie misplaced in a colourful Miami Beach type of setting.The scene where he protects the family from the SWAT teams is intense. The musical background is unbelievably well chosen.it's really all there: the love story between an underdog and a rich girl. Nicely built up until the end. Chemistry is there. The protection of something very vulnerable. The chase for an ancient artefact. Setting in a futuristic beach metropolis with positive vibes as opposed to a polluted depressive blade runner atmosphere.All in all, the first 2/3s of the movie deliver on all fronts.but then things start being comical. First the vulnerable granny turns out to be a nutty ex-guerrilero. Then there is hispanic hop hop as background to fights - which is a no no no.the character development comes to a standstill out of a sudden and I felt a first yawn. Towards the end the movie gets its ""act together"" (pun intended) again, but does not live up to the very high expectations it set itself in the first 2/3s.shame. Very captivating for the large part.A sequel is coming. My wishlist: a little bit darker but not depressive, less slapstick, a bit more love-story, a bit more character development and let the alien tech be far more powerful that what we have seen. And above everything: this first movie has built up quite the expectation of him finding his ultimate true destiny and I think this requires a far greater Destiny than to defeat a human cyborg on Earth.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even if it only is the main actor who plays (one of the) lead(s) in both those things. Xolo - it would not be fair to him to not let him spread his wings - it's called wings on bugs too, right? I actually have no idea - anyway.If you suspend your disbelief and take this with a grain of salt, this can be a lot of fun! There are quite a few super hero tropes and cliches thrown your way. But if you are a cynic, than no superhero movie actually will be able to do the trick for you. Yes beautiful girl, yes pretty boy ... of course they are meant for each other! Every one knows it - except those two. Well for most of the time at least.Also the convenient timing of it all - the villain who seems incapable of ... functioning. But again, all those things - seen before and ""flaws"" that can be detected in every other super hero franchise. Just go with the flow and accept this. CGI is quite neat, music is nice (even though I am surprised they use known English songs but the Spanish versions of them. Also telenovela ... also Lopez! You either find him funny or extremely annoying ... hopefully the former! Otherwise almost the whole movie is ruined. Shame it tanked ... at the box office!

The DC movie Blue Beetle (2023) was fun and entertaining to watch, though it can be by the numbers when it comes to main antagonists, the main character and the actor playing the main character is what makes the me worth watching. Plus, along with the rest of the cast the movie is funny and like the comics it is based on.Actor Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle was great as the character; he was likable, funny, and you root for him either going up against the main villain or dealing with money problems/finding a job after graduating from a university. The rest of Jaime Reyes's family was funny, played by great actors, and I liked how Jaime Reyes and his family worked together to deal with any problem that gets in their way; one of the family members that were especially funny was George Lopez as Jaime Reyes's uncle Rudy Reyes. Working with Jaime Reyes to keep the scarab away from the villain is Jenny Kord played by Bruna Marquezine who is the daughter of Ted Kord (the second Blue Beetle); I also thought she did a decent job and worked well with Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle.One of the antagonists is Victoria Kord played by Susan Sarandon who is good in the movie, but she is a standard villain who wants the scarab for some sort of super soldier army she is creating because she runs Ted Kord's company because she is his sister. The other antagonist that works with Victoria Kord is Carapax played by Raoul Max Trujillo who is this super soldier she tested on and uses him to fight Blue Beetle, this character does have a backstory of some kind that is revealed at one point, so you know how he got like his now. The villains could have been better, but around that the movie can be entertaining with its action scenes, references to the comics, and a main character you like following.The Blue Beetle scarab looked cool, and I love that the suit is an actual practical effects suit with added CGI that blends very well making it cool to watch in the action sequences that are well done. The action scenes were nicely shot, with it not having a lot of cuts but instead having nice long shots where you can see the actor doing the stunts. The movie has stuff from the comics that people will notice if they know the comics, and the family aspect to the movie was enjoyable to watch, along with this being the first Mexican superhero that does a respectable job representing the culture and how Jaime Reyes and his family interact in their own way which was cool to see in this DC movie.Blue Beetle (2023) was a fun DC movie that I would recommend watching even if you do not know much about the character and comic books he comes from; though the antagonists and the plot might seem like something we have seen before, but Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle played by Xolo Maridueña makes the movie worth watching because he is a likable character. The movie was funny, it had good performances from the actors, great action, nice cinematography, and great effects on the scarab and Blue Beetle suit when using the many weapons that it can create making it entertaining; I would give this a watch when you can.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The entire exposition is filled with scripted dialogues, stiff performances, and cliche development, to the point where the film kinda invites you to nap the first 30 minutes. However, I do appreciate Blue Beetle for respecting the 2 crucial components of any superhero movie: suit up and first flight, as both segments are visibly budgeted. Another thing worthy of compliment are the action sequences, which are well-choreographed, of considerable lengths, although all heavily CGIed. Everything else, including but not limiting to romance, backstories, comedy, antagonists, are just plainly average. Better luck next year DC, hopefully James Gunn will get things back on track soon.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

One thing I enjoy is the strong cultural theme at its center. It is a great sci-fi film, with a great tone and some pretty fun comedic scenes and characters, which is different for a DC movie.The storyline is set in Palmera City where Jamie Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a Gotham pre-law graduate, is trying to get a job. When he meets Jenny Kord (Bruna Marqueszine), she gives him a piece of alien technology called the ""Scarab"" that gives him superpowers. The plot thickens when a woman named Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) tries to steal the Scarab back from Jamie, putting his entire family in danger.The storyline is great. What this story does differently than other superhero movies is make the main character's family a big part of the action. There are a lot of other unique things about this film, too. I love the way the director and writers bring representation of Latino culture into the film through the characters and the sets. Palmera City, Jamie's house and Jamie's family all feel very realistic. The costumes are incredible as well, especially the Blue Beetle suit-it's slick and has a personality of its own. Of all the characters, my favorite is Rudy (George Lopez), who brings a lot of fun into his scenes. He is the 'tech support' for Jamie, but is also a conspiracy theorist, and there are a lot of jokes based on his quirky personality. The makeup effects are great too; for example the scene where Jamie transforms into the Blue Beetle.The film's message is that family makes you stronger, not weaker, which is a theme I love. Be forewarned that the film has a few violent scenes, a lot of action, some profanity and sexual references.I give Blue Beetle 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

It's a bit of a weird one in the sense that it's exactly what you'd expect and it's even pretty janky in places, but it's pretty fun when it gets going (even while committing the same mistakes a lot of its peers have been making for the past two decades) and its emotionality is surprisingly resonant at times. You've seen it all before, for sure: a generic and slightly intangible origin story that focuses on heavy-handed themes of family (it might as well be an entry in the 'Fast and Furious' franchise) and has its hero eventually take on a baddie that's basically just a palette swap of them. Yet, there's just something that makes it more enjoyable than most of the other entries in the DCEU, an intangible charm that you can't quite put your finger on no matter how hard you try. The cast are mostly charismatic (the good guys, at least; Susan Sarandon is sleepwalking here and the main henchman is really boring), the comedy sometimes makes you chuckle (mostly thanks to George Lopez), the action is fairly energetic, and the messaging - as ham-fisted and often forced as it is - often leads to some shockingly affecting moments that make you realise how invested in the characters you must actually be. It's actually the latter that tips this into the solidly 'good' category for me, as a lot of the affair is middling to decent at best. It's honestly fairly forgettable, too. Overall, though, it just works way more than it ought to; it's better than the sum of its parts. It's not something I'm desperate to watch again, but it's far better than 'Black Adam (2022)' and it's a bit of a shame that it sits in this odd limbo between the existing DCEU and James Gunn's upcoming DCU. It's not going to cure your superhero fatigue, but it should entertain you if you're not tired of this stuff just yet.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie shows a family living their life normally until a mysterious scarab attached to one of them and turns him into a super hero that barely knows how to use his powers. Like I said before after watching the movie I did not think it was a masterpiece but I had a lot of fun watching it. It was a cool origin story and I'm looking forward on what's going to happen next with the character.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This revels in the base of stereotypes - the overweight women portraying to be Mexican; the chosen Spanish language and expressions; the attire, the hairstyles and the physical unattractiveness of the ""Mexican"" characters; the Spanish accents although it was indicated the family had been there for years; the references to some of the family having illegal status. My family and I left the movie astounded and sad after seeing the demeaning and inadequate portrayal of the Mexican culture.

I was pleasantly surprised. Coming in a little skeptical because DC has a few clunkers and feeling a little jaded from superhero movies, I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. ""Blue Beetle"" did what the best superhero movies do: focused on character development and people to root for. I LOVED the cast, from the kind-hearted dad, to the sarcastic sister, to the spunky grandma. The actor who plays the protagonist (love him in Cobra Kai) did such a great job in the lead role. Step aside, Fast and Furious franchise; THIS is how you incorporate a ""family"" theme into your movie. I laughed and I cried several times throughout. While some of the superhero elements have been done before, the blue beetle suit was pretty cool. The soundtrack was good, and Susan Sarandon did a great job as the villain. I have to say that this DC movie is by far better than many of its predecessors.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

It's trying to be a fun and charming origin story with family as the core of the movie. As a Latino I loved all the references to our culture and I was constantly laughing out loud at the jokes and references the grandma made because I could relate to them. Are the villains weak? Yes. Is the plot generic? Yes.

I feel like at times it can feel a little rushed and a line or two feel a little forced.On the good side, I enjoy the action at times and the technological sphere in it. I enjoy the Mexican touch to it. I feel like it does have room for a franchise. I like to see a possible prequel spinoff about his family and the people who originally got the scarab. I feel like that will help make this story make at least a little more sense.I feel like this movie has aspects of Iron Man and Venom. The beetle bonds like Venom does and it kinda acts like the Iron Man suit does with Jarvis and all. There's also Ant Man aspects with the villain tries to weaponize what the hero has (Yellowjacket with Pym Particles, the one lady with the beetle). I also feel like Blue Beetle can be compared to Green Lantern and Spider-Man. Green Lantern as they can both seemingly create anything from their minds. Spider-Man as they are both young bug themed superheroes. I find it alright that they try to encapsulate these other superhero characters in this movie.I don't feel like Blue Beetle is the worst, and also not the best thing to come out this year, but it does an alright job as an origin story and I hope it eventually gets a franchise. I don't feel like you should just read the first few reviews that appear when looking at it based on featured. Go to review rating, read a few and press it to organize it in the other direction.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Susan Sarandon's stone cold sentiments for mankind mirror Jody Foster's presidential performance, both power hungry fatales controlling their right hand men with physical & mental manipulation much to their mistake. BLUE BEETLE focuses on finding fortitude in family to fight and face whatever may come together as a unified unit. Unlike superheroes bound to secrecy, there is no hiding of identities in this household - Jaime Reyes' situation is a family affair. Every member's performance is heartfelt & each bring their own individuality to the table, including a spry grandmother with a revolutionary past adding another aspect to the cultural complexity of their people's ongoing historical struggle.Charged with rage against their cultural injustice, Blue Beetle must be reminded of mercy by his Iron Man - like suit to show empathy when he's torn between revenge & humanity, reflected visually by his helmet halfway ripped revealing a tormented boy halved emotionally by the choice that will determine the kind of man he will become if consumed by misdirected hatred. Unlike Tony Stark though, there is no privilege to come to the rescue here.Commonality can be found in the corporate exploitation of international communities, an evil greed using humans as exported commodities. Siphoning strength from suffering channels generational resilience that builds unbreakable walls against the mightiest foes. By embracing the values & traditions of Hispanic heritage within its themes, including a surprisingly surreal sequence homaging a B&W Mexican movie referenced earlier on their TV, the film embeds layers of cultural significance into the script.Just as the scarab becomes a part of the Reyes family, our identities are an inseparable part of us for life.Plus - there's a Mortal Kombat, ""get over here,"" Scorpion reference, hah!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

On the positive side: the story is reasonably involving, the pace is high (when after a slow start the action kicks in), and the CGI is absolutely great. There's lots of humor, and Xolo Maridueña is a sympathetic and good-looking main character Jaime. On the other hand the story is far from original: it's more or less a blueprint of Spiderman's beginnings, with an unsuspecting average teen who gets in a weird way infected, thus becoming to his own amazement a super hero with all kinds of superpowers that he has to learn to control, while at the same time chasing a heinous villain that of course threatens the world. So nothing new there.As said, Jaime is sympathetic, but for the rest his persona is totally blank and nondescript, lacking every inch of character. His family is endearing, but with all their hilarious actions they're made into some kind of slapstick, on the brink of getting tiresome. The romance between innocent clueless Jaime and Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), a worldwise heiress of a business imperium, is totally unrealistic. Susan Sarandon is a fine actress, but for a supervillain she's just too much a nicely dressed old lady, lacking all the exuberant evilness that you expect of a DC villain.In hindsight it all impressed me as a superhero-light, tailored for kids, a bit like a live-action version of a Cartoon Network movie. Nothing wrong with that, and amusing enough, but don't expect anything more or deeper.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Xolo IS the Blue Beetle!Greatly enjoyed this movie. It had so much heart. It had family love. It had the action. Ok, some parts were corny.... But it didn't bother me. I love a FUN superhero movie. But this has heart. I cried, a few times. Some of sorrow some of joy. But in the end, I laughs and smiled.I thought it was well made and a fun film. Xolo does a great job in the titular role, I was worried because his character in Cobra Kai is kinda whiney, a little annoying; but not Jaime (his character in Blue Beetle) as he is older and I'd say more mature than his CK character. I definitely suggest seeing this in theatres!!!","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Very humorous and very family oriented. I'm familiar enough with this version of the blue beetle to be overjoyed with its presentation on the big screen.This could not have gone any better, in fact it was design to be what it was, and it worked.It's not an Epic they are trying to make a billion dollars off of. I'm sure that would be nice and all, but it was really good to see a movie in the DC Extended Universe that perfectly fit into that without the pressure of having to be epic.It was a cool film that allowed itself to have fun and because of that I had so much fun watching it,

The performances are good, highlighting Elpidia Carrillo, Adriana Barraza and Susan Sarandon, the latter as a villain. The cinematography is well done, the music composed for the film goes unnoticed and the special effects manage to be good in some scenes while failing to look real in others. The songs used were not really well chosen, there were only two really good Mexican songs, the rest are based on the stereotype of rural Mexico. An entertaining superhero movie without being a masterpiece.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Now, she would totally disagree with this because they play on the same team but the hair, the way she dresses, her lines, the attitude, it's all perfect. Jamie Reyes is super cute but not too bright. Guess that may be true to the comics but I never read them so I dont know.

And that's just not going to cut it if you want people to leave the theater with a spark.I'm honestly surprised and pretty disappointed that DC is still releasing these three movies this year after telling the whole world that they don't matter. Firstly, people aren't going to see them but more importantly in my eyes, people are losing any kind of respect or value in what the brand of DC has to offer.Moving forward, bring some compelling writing, and serious threat that audiences grab ahold of.

If you enjoy comic book movies this should be right up your alley. Blue Beetle is not a very popular hero, but the characters has had a bit of a resurgence as Jaime Reyes, who now wears the scarab that essentially is the blue beetle. George Lopez provides plenty of comic relief, and most of the other actors are serviceable in their role, including Susan Sarandon, who plays the villain. Overall, I enjoyed this and watched it with the family on a lazy weekend. My only real complaint as a diehard DC fan is I wish there was a more world building and connections to other DC characters. Of course, there are the requisite mentions of Superman and Batman, but the world doesn't feel like a world where superheroes and metahumans exist. Still, I think this is a good first entry for the expected slate of DC movies soon to come. Ignore the bad press and the haters and enjoy Blue Beetle as a wholesome, entertaining movie.7/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The characters seem like they are warming up to each other with forgettable dialogue. But then as the personalities of each character reveal themselves, they inject some much needed life into the film and then the fun begins!The protagonist and his entertaining family is where all the value of this film sits. I was very entertained from the time he gains his powers, shows them off and gets into a few fights. The special effects were on point, too. I hardly noticed them.The latino humour fell flat in places. However, the theme of family hit home for me and was very well done about halfway through when my heartstrings were well and truly pulled.I highly recommend this film for a fun time out for late teens upward.

We chose Blue Beetle simply because it was about to start on another screen.I had low expectations for this movie. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it. It is lighthearted at times, has some family values built in (similar to Spiderman), and there was enough action to satisfy an action fan, but not so much to bore someone who's not into too much action. Yes, the story line is not the most original. But that didn't bother me. The fact that the superhero was not your typical superhero, and his family was not the typical superhero family, made it different. If you go to see it just enjoy it as a stand alone movie and don't compare it to other superhero movies. I had not expectations and i was pleasantly surprised.(There were one or two things about the movie which disappointed me, one being when he should have used his full powers and decided to jerk around and hold back, but other the that, I had no problem with the movie, even with a couple of corny jokes, which can be seen as something this family might actually say in real life anyway.)","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The cultural specificity is also an asset but feels rushed in a format that, unlike the pacing of a series, creates a greater imperative to get to the next battle.

However, it delivers a great, though not perfect take with a commendable message about family, and as a mexican viewer, I resonated with the character and the film in general.While the focus on Jaime's family enhances character development, it overshadows the superhero element, giving us few action sequences and leaving gaps in explaining essential aspects, such as the scarab's origin and powers. I also feel like the relationship between Jaime and the scarab remained underexplored. Additionally, the antagonist's vague motivations and little sense of threat lack the depth needed to make a compelling villain.I enjoyed the action sequences, which show creativity and great choreography, but as I said earlier, there are only a few. Visual effects and the suit design are really positive. In terms of humor, the film is a mix of hits and misses.The cast is mostly meh, with the exception of Maridueña and Sarandon.Overall, a fun experience with some issues, but I think the real problem is that the movie will be, unfairly, a box office failure in the midst of DC's struggles.

This movie overall is really fun and full of entertainment and its packed with good humour, proper typical superhero movie especially what you expect, as I have heard that the film has bombed at the box office despite the failure of the movie it is still a really good movie my ratings for the movie is a solid 7/10.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The script was decently wrote with a couple obvious plots. Most of the lines were funny enough, but pale comparison to George Lopez previous shows/skits. Without giving any spoilers, Lopez's character, seemingly new everything about technology without any explanation...
Xolo did great as the blue beetle. Not too surprising though as his time on Cobra Kai certainly helped with his fight scenes. Other than George Lopez, the family acting was mediocre at best. Bruna did great in her role however, I feel like the writers could have gave her better lines. The main villain was not well written, nor was her acting anything special. The other ""bad guys"" add poor CGI and made the movie feel slightly cheap.Now, let's talk about the CGI. Everyone hated on how bad it was but honestly the CGI wasn't the worst part. It was the fact that all the ""tech"" was all bulky, cheap, and cliché looking. The blue beetle see itself looked really good. I feel like the entire CGI budget was put into making his suit look realistic. Which, I guess if they only had so much money made sense but I feel like they had enough money to make things like the (main) ship look better. Also worth it in the one that one death scenes CGI was so bad it looked comical.The very end of the movie is what really dropped it from a 7 to a 6... almost did 5 bc of it tbh... once you get to the last 20min of the movie you'll completely understand what I mean.Overall, I really feel like if they would've made this movie rated R, they could've had something special. As the blue beetle in the comics had such cool technology, he could have made killing the bad guys a lot more gore-y, and unique. This movie is definitely worth watching if you are huge in the superheroes. If this is your first time, dipping your toe into the superhero movie pool, I would suggest something from the early creations of marvel. (2010s) This movie had so many cheesy one liners it hurt...
The real question is... would I watch it again?The answer... mmmm, maybe in 5 years... if I'm super bored and have watched just about every other superhero movie available then yea... ig.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Normally he would get 5 points from me because he amused me after all, he got another weak star from me. A character with a lot of untapped potential. DC (Warner) doesn't want and doesn't want to be creative, just make a quick buck. I have hope that James Gunn will turn things around and make the DC universe what the MCU used to be. From now on, I will avoid DC films in the cinema for the time being, there hasn't been a single one that has really convinced me! Except for the first two Man of Steel movies.

This film is filled with heart, good humour and excellent flow.Exciting to see what everyone: director, writer and actors do going forward (hopefully within the DCU) but a great experience!Pi scale: 6 pi's given.Follow on I G for more: pewa4real.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Despite hearing all that constantly, I still tried to go in with a clear open-mind, and I was still disappointed.It's been said a million times before because it's true, but this is an EXTREMELY cliched super hero origin movie. The super cliched plot wouldn't be as bad if the characters and humor hit better, but that sadly isn't the case either.The humor for me just didn't hit whatsoever for me like 90percent of the time. Some of the humor is SUPER corny, and I generally don't mind corny humor, but the corny humor in this movie just takes it to a WHOLE Nother LEVEL! There's good corny and there's bad corny, this is bad corny, which doesn't even bring a little smirk on my face. The suspension of disbelief they pull just for a cheap unfunny joke is lowkey insulting.Xolo Mariduena is the best part of the movie, He's my second favorite character on Cobra Kai, the first being William Zabka. It's too bad Xolo was given a bad movie to work with, he's very charismatic and see great acting potential in him, but he just isn't given enough material to show that with this movie, could've made him funnier or at least give him a real arc. Jamie Reyes/Blue Beetle doesn't even have a real character arc. I guess his arc is he loves his family, then by the end, he still loves his family? Huh? I guess he has this super random thing that he's against killing, but I thought that was so dumb and unnecessary to include in the movie. Obviously killing innocent people is wrong, but killing people who are trying to kill innocent people isn't that bad. Plus after his anti-killing scene, it's barely ever mentioned again and this message really goes nowhere, so why was it ever mentioned in the first place? The movie would've been better if the ""no killing thing"" was just never bought up. And the no-killing thing just makes Xolo look like an idiot. The ""no killing"" message made sense in a movie like Terminator 2 for example because it's a huge part of the overall narrative of the movie, but here, it doesn't really do anything, so why is it here?The two main villains are super cliche,"" Your family is what makes you weak!"" Give me a break, seems like this movie was made for 10-year-olds. It's just SO BASIC and cliche that it's corny. Susan Sarandon completely phones in her role too, but I don't blame her because she is given nothing to work with. We all know Susan Saradon is a seasoned actor and clearly knows how to act, so she obviously chose not to even try in this movie, because she knows there is nothing to work with.The ""girlfriend"" is probably the worst actor in the movie. I supposed she's supposed to be the ""love interest?"" But huge quotations on that because she's really bland and has zero chemistry with Xolo. She's more like an AI exposition dump, and that's it.The action was overall just decent. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's barely just good either. It could've been way better, and Xolo barely used any cool stuff with the powers he has. This is not a spoiler because it's in the trailer, but he makes a Final Fantasy sword, this was kinda cool, but it seems random in the context of the movie. It would've been cooler and made more sense if the movie showed he was a big gamer or Final Fantasy fan earlier in the movie, and could've used other video-game weapons. And would've been kinda a cool, unique, and relatable thing for a young adult to do. But this movie only shows Mexicans liking stereotypical Mexican stuff, can't be more unique and show Mexicans liking other things like Final Fantasy, anime, or video-games in general.I'm just sad because we don't get a lot of Mexican superheroes, so they should've put way more effort into this movie if they wanted it to be successful, but they didn't. The lack of quality in the movie shows it. You just can't be super pro-diversity, then when finally get a chance to make a big-budget Hispanic movie, you made a below-mediocre mess of a movie. Whoever wrote and directed this movie just ruined it for more diversity movies in the future. And I know the writer and director of this movie are both Hispanic, so I don't get why didn't they try harder??!?!!?! They should've tried harder or the main studio should've hired writers and directors with more talent and/or cared more.I just wiki'd who directed and wrote this movie, and the director only has 2 movies before this I never heard of. They should've hired a way more experienced director. As for the writer, he DOESN'T even have a wiki page!!! WOW! So your telling me the studios hired some guy to write this movie has no prior movie writing experience or even show writing experience in his whole life?!?!?! Why was he hired?!?!? No wonder the writing is so bad, and I know there can still be studio inference as well, but we still deserved at least a competent writer for this movie.This was my last hope for the DC cuz 90percent of their movies are awful, and they recently keep just making flop after flop and it's easy to see why. It BLOWS MY MIND how one of the richest studios struggles to make a single good movie when they have WAY MORE resources than 90% of other movie companies. They can't even decide if this movie is part of the rebooted DCU or not. How about this, you'd never have to worry about rebooting your series in the first place if you just consistently made good movies like youre supposed to! Making good movies should ALWAYS be at the top of your list.","39 out of 71 found this helpful.

"10","/10","DC renews itself, Family or nothing, Love and fight for the ones you love.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9265420/?ref_=tt_urv","moviesfilmsreviewsinc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59184301/?ref_=tt_urv","17 August 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is a new DC movie that follows the box office success of ""Shazam!"" and ""The Flash."" The film stars Xolo Maridueña as a young superhero and is rated PG-13. The film is inspired by Latin culture and follows the story of a 22-year-old Mexican college grad with a cool family. Director Ángel Manuel Soto's fantasy adventure is familiar to fans of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming,"" ""Black Panther,"" and ""Iron Man,"" but features a main character's superteam instead of Batman and Wonder Woman. Jaime Reyes returns to Palmera City after graduating with a degree but faces a difficult situation as his parents, Rocio and Alberto, have shut down their auto shop and are about to lose their house in a gentrified area. Jaime meets Jenny Kord, who volunteers to help him find a job. However, things take a strange turn when Jenny gives Jaime a blue scarab, a valuable piece of alien biotechnology. Jaime takes the bug out of its box, and the otherworldly entity chooses him as a host, giving him a supersuit and cool abilities. ""Blue Beetle"" takes a Spider-Man comic playbook approach, putting Jaime through the wringer with his new powers, accidentally cutting a bus full of people in half, and even going to space. Maridueña's performance in the learning-to-be-a-superhero scenes is likable, allowing viewers to understand Jaime's strengths and insecurities. The world begins to fall apart as Victoria seeks Jaime to remove alien tech from his body. Jaime's openness to love adds humor and young-adult hormones. DC has had some crummy supervillains in recent years, and Sarandon's antagonist is one of the better examples. Victoria wants the scarab to help her create a One Man Army Corps of souped-up soldiers, including Carapax, a character tied to the controversial real-life School of the Americas. Jaime takes Victoria on with the help of his family, including his Nana, sister Milagro, and Uncle Rudy. Jaime's loving relatives ground his story and add a key sense of representation. The film's plot is grounded in the love and loyalty of Jaime's family, making it a relatable and entertaining story. ""Blue Beetle"" is a comic book series that features Jaime's transformation into a body horror character, blending lively personalities with a deep comic book mythology. The story revolves around Jenny's missing dad Ted Kord, the previous Blue Beetle. As the DC universe undergoes changes, fans can expect more of Jaime in the upcoming reset, highlighting the ongoing flux in the character. ""Blue Beetle"" is a politically spry film that explores the ills of white-American imperialism through the love and loyalty of its characters. The villain, Victoria, is a metaphor for the past and present, while the hero, Love, triumphs over self-discovery. The film's comedy focuses on how these characters mesh, rather than low-hanging memeification, and the family-bound narrative is pure and pure. ""Blue Beetle"" is a superhero film by Soto that despite its unremarkable action sequences, it still maintains vigor due to an entertaining ensemble. Adriana Barraza delivers punchlines, while George Lopez as Uncle Rudy delivers animated pratfalls and one-liners. The film's strength comes from its family, making it an enriching experience at the movies. Although it may not break the mold, it does break expectations. ""Blue Beetle"" is a film directed by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, which focuses on convenience and convenience. The story revolves around Jenny stealing a blue scarab, which Victoria uses to develop super-soldiers. Jenny then smuggles it into Jaime's hands, who is unaware of the scarab. Jaime becomes symbiotically linked to the scarab and gets a blue suit. The film's weakest components are the inarticulate composition of the characters, with the villain Victoria being portrayed as a stoic henchman. The film also lacks chemistry between Jenny and Jaime, partly due to Marquezine's overacting and overacting. The film's plot is a mix of nonsensical events and smart beats, but it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling story.","45 out of 118 found this helpful.

Other versions of Blue Beetle characters do make a cameo but not true to the comics. The scarab origins are simply a part of greater alien technology that crashed to Earth over the milleniums. First large part of the movie is slow building up the characters, especially Jaime's family (family being concept in this movie). It improves with action but then becomes predictable conclusion (and feels like it was rewritten) The whole movie echos of the best bits of other movies with the same formula reharsh. Think Venom, Miss Marvel, Smallville and hint of Ironman. I felt this movie belong to previous universe of DC films where it seems to fit better - the Justice League - and not the beginning of a new era we being promised. Tbh, it's no surprise this film was a blockbuster dud before it was release. It had an uphill battle. No one really knows this hero.

-A simple like for some, the music has a bit of a mixture that is fun, toe tapping, and representative of the moment.-Hispanic raps and ballads have melodrama and that spice at moments with their catchy beats and vocals.-Other songs are that hip hop attitude that comes at the perfect moment to go with the impressive action and training moments. Really pushing the boundaries
-And the symphony songs are quite impressive when they come out in key moments.The Comedy:
-A big selling point, Blue Beetle is a lot of slapstick and jokes that might get excessive for some.-If you are Hispanic and have the relevance, it makes the comedy even better, as the cultural references are a deck of cards lined to be a winning hand.-While others are less specific, with great execution, timing, and quirkiness that I had fun with when it all came together.-And those who like uncoordinated tripping, stumbling, and accident prone comedy work to help raise the torch.-While not the most unique, it works for a comic book movie and has a place with a lot of other elements in this movie.The Story:
-The movie works to add elements that are good for an origin movie trying to reset a big universe.-We have a character arc, some tragic events to put pressure to meet them, a few representable villains, and the growing pains coming with the new power.-It has enough of these elements to blend mostly well, and I enjoyed a lot of the building this movie did with elements that have emotion, growth, and fire that I want in these movies.-And throw everything together within two hours to give you a concise story that is not too convoluted or thought provoking.The Acting:
-It's a comic book movie, and though we have seen monuments to the acting trade in some other films worthy of pedestal raising.-This movie is not bad, in fact good, for what I call the standard way of comic book movies, with a cast that is likeable, feels like a family, and has a bit more realistic feel.-Becky G's voice is not so much singing, and her new interaction as the Beetle's brain is funny, robotic, and near the end shows elements similar to Jarvis.-Bruna Marquezine has a commanding prowess to her. A balanced array of strength and vulnerability, matched with a real character that works well with the various groups she has to be with.-And Xolo Mariduena the lead is sensational. He's funny, charming, delivers his awkward young adult lines well, but grows into some more engaging moments that match the early days of Marvel and D. C. movies.-And George Lopez is... well Lopez. He works as both comedic relief and a good plot device, which might be annoying and old cad to some, but again holds merit in this movie and build up.The Effects... to some degree:
-The effects are what you expect in this movie, and DC continues to put out some impressive moments that worked for me.-Seeing the Blue Beetle fly, alongside his fighting mechanics was good for CGI to most degrees.-Fluid animation, good shifting changes using hard light technology, and a few other things that made the currently impossible, possible.-And with explosions and fires having some practical effects helps further blending of the worlds make it a little easier on the fakeness.The Action:
-It's a little meager to start with as the suit gets time to adjust, but once it does... I was happy.-Blue Beetle has several varieties of action to it, utilizing the start of the abilities and adding a little strategy to the mix up.-Impressive blasting, some good choreography, and helping add a little physical combat offered some mix up to the moments, and with the other things mentioned work to craft a comic worthy battle.-Good cinema alongside adding story elements to it only further enhanced the experience for me, and made most of the fighting in the small time.DISLIKES:The Comedy a Tad Excessive:
-If you have a high tolerance or an attitude of never enough comedy, you'll have no beef with this category.-For me, there are times where the emotional moments and developments are overtaken by another Spanish driven rant, or another screaming bout.-It gets a little tiresome to hear Lopez cry and scream at every other word of his, but it's not the worst compared to some of the other movies I've seen with overutilization.Predictable Story:
-I know that originality is tough to acquire these days, but this movie was very easy to guess what was happening.-Foreshadowing paints an obvious direction this film is going and it takes some of the twists and surprise that you might want in a film like this and an edge.-It all ties up about as I expected, and I think could be part of the boring part that people talk about in their reviews.The Visuals Dip Into Mediocre At Times
-I know this isn't meant to be the most realistic of movies, but Blue Beetle does things well for the most part.-However, there are times that the movie sort of dips in the frame rates and smoothness and gets lost in the hokey fake tones.-Blue Beetle has some polishing to do if they get the okay for a second movie. Maybe a little more blending of the real and the CGI to help blend things. Alongside some better depth and details.-Again, it's not as big for me for most of the movie, but there are some times where post editing was a tad too inconsistent.More Action At The End With Other Characters:
-There is a part where the movie is about planning out the final battle well and using the players.-They kind of do this, but it's underwhelming and used more comedically than that cool finesse to the grand finale.-Blue Beetle picks up the slack, but everyone else is kind of a waste when the potential was there to soar or fly like the character.-Given some of the fun aspects they were going to look at, but then just dropped or ran out of time or creativity.-This happens a lot at the end with a lot of characters, and this might be the biggest dislike for me that I hope will expand in the next attempt at the DC universe.The VERDICT:
Blue Beetle is the supposed start to the Gunn universe, and I had a lot of fun with the movie. It's nothing spectacular, mind blowing, earth shattering, or really sand out like they were int eh past, but that doesn't mean it's a throw away movie for me. The film works well with comedy, origin story, and characters, to make an entertaining build of the world and just focusing on the movie itself. While there are hints at what is to come, the movie is trying to just be a comic book come to life, and bring the punches that comics can only do with a good imagination. And the way they utilize references, technology, and action that I really enjoyed and would have liked a little more of. Yet, the movie is indeed predictable in story terms, a tad excessive at times, and needs some polishing to really hit a consistent B and A gam. Blue Beetle may not be the redefining piece many are still looking for, but it was still a fun incursion with enough gusto to dip into the movie theater. My scores for this piece are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

They come across as rather lackluster, with Susan Sarandon's portrayal falling short of true intimidation, portraying only a hint of cold-heartedness. Surprisingly, her bodyguard exudes a more imposing presence.In contrast to the apparent emphasis on being a badass hero, it's refreshing to see the true heroes emerge within the Ramirez family. Blue Beetle's attempt at adopting a Batman, Iron Man, or Ant-Man persona might feel a tad excessive.Among the characters, Grandma stands out with her resilience and fighting spirit, and George Lopez does justice to the role of a supportive uncle. Ultimately, Blue Beetle offers an enjoyable superhero movie experience, though it may follow a somewhat familiar superhero plot formula seen in many other films.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's not perfect, but it's definitely a good first swing.A star is born. Xolo Mariduena delivers a charming, charismatic and vulnerable performance in the way that Toby Maguire does in Spider-Man (2002).George Lopez gives a torch-passing performance that shows what luminaries of his caliber should do for the next generation of actors. He was funny and cynosure without upstaging his fellow cast members.Alternatively, Susan Sarandon was not needed. She delivers a carbon copy villain that we've all seen 1000 times. It was bland and too familiar. She added nothing special in a culturally historic film targeting Latinos around the world.Her role should have gone to an actor with Mexican ancestry -- Hayek, Trejo, Longoria, Olmos -- someone with as high a public profile as Sarandon. I think they would've brought more depth as Jaime Reyes' supervillain and helped fill more theater seats.Unfortunately, Blue Beetle is going to come in under $30M at the weekend domestic box office, which is a shame. This film deserves support so that it can have the engine behind it necessary to make an even better sequel.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

So i only had a rough idea and watched this film out of interest for the character.My real opinion on this movie consists of only two words:All right.That's it, it was exciting to see a new character in the big screens besides all of the familliar faces we have seen across years. What makes this movie unique, is its focus on the importance of family love. While very basic, I felt high levels of affection and a sense of comfort.Mexican Heritage or not, there were a lot of heart warming loving moments where I thought it would be nice to be that close to your family. Plus the humor wasn't too bad, it was just right.My issue with the movie strikes on the story and bad guys being the same as usual. Everyone here understands the concept of secret evil organization weaponizing stuff, yet that was the wrong choice here. It could of been any other direction besides this and the film would of been so much better.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not sure I enjoyed the lore surrounding the scarab. It was very minimal in that regard. Xolo as Jaime Reyes was awesome. He was fantastic. It's too bad this movie will be caught up in this reboot storm that is the current DC Universe. Susan Surandon was hilarious as the villain.

I went and watched it at the theatre, and man, it was... Something new from DC, only that they were using the same superhero stuff over and over again. You know, a person got bit by an insect, superpowers, the superheroes girlfriend, I just feel that we got the same plot a million times before, but in different versions. The new thing is that this is mostly with a Latin-American cast, and the plot take place in Mexico. If you mix Spider-Man with Iron Man, and maybe put Coco on the side, we are getting Blue Beetle. Even if the movie was generic, and sometimes some childish humor, it was some things that I liked. The action scenes were awesome, well planned and preformed, and the music score was great, too. The acting was pretty ok. But besides, this movie was generic, offers nothing new, and it doesn't expend the DC universe a lot, we just got a superhero movie that just popped out of nowhere. So if you want some fun, go and watch it, if you like DC, this is maybe not the best choice, but it's ok. After theatre I can't say I really like it. It was just ok. If you are going to watch some DC, I recommend The Flash or Joker more that this movie. Really Generic, but good action.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I felt asleep halfway through the movie in cinema. First of all, actors are poorly casted especially blue beetle himself, from start to end his acting cringed me to the bone. Everyone else speaks like train, even when those scenes where you're supposed to have deeper emotions, to empathise with the characters' stories and feelings...but all of them speak without much emotions and pauses like they never process some feelings first before they speak/act. I wanted to see actions from protagonist but this film decided to go with family troop kind of avengers fighting they way out instead. This feels like a combination of spider man and hulk, but the plot is below average IMO. Was expecting a better performance from Susan Sarandon well at least she's the only one I know from the entire movie but her villain evil side wasn't played out well.

It's a really charming story about a boy that wants to lift his poor immigrant family up the ranks by being the first to go to college. The family dynamic is great. Nobody hates anybody. There are disagreements between brother and sister, Mother and Uncle, but at the heart of it, they all love each other.The grandma is absolutely hillarious and had me in stitches numerous times.The uncle is great too. He's really charming, funny and best of all, quirky.Here comes the bad. Despite a really well written lead, and an amazing family dynamic, the whole superhero part of the film is not very good.The Dynamic between the lead and the blue beetle suit is really fun and a creative spin on the Ironman/Jarvis dynamic, but underdeveloped IMO.The main villain has a few, delightfully evil character moments, but her really strong introduction falls flat by the third act and she just ends up becomming a boring bad guy.The whole structure is VERY by the numbers and it is a formula that has become very tiring.The first half of the third act is REALLY fun, because it focuses on the family, but just as soon as we get to the villain half of the act, it becomes really boring.An incredibly well acted film. GREAT direction, really good dialouge, great action, good (at times) CGI and a REALLY mediocre script.6/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The fan service is done very well in this movie as the amount of references isn't too much. For example it was fun to say Dan Garret get mentioned as he rarely does in anything and showing some of Ted kord's gadgets from the comics was fun. There is two ways of looking at the end credits. If the movie is set in the new dcu then it's an exciting ending and does a good job setting up a sequel whether that will happen or not. Or looking at it as a dceu movie where the ending is a big load of nothing.

Unambitious. But honestly, it's kind of refreshing after so many overdesigned, overpacked multiverse films that have been made lately. It's a bit like stepping into a warm bath that you can just relax in. One thing I can say off the bat is that the trailer does an extremely good job of setting expectations for the film itself. If you saw the trailer and thought: ""that looks pretty fun"", you will probably exit the cinema thinking: ""that was pretty fun"".In terms of pros and cons, for me at least, the jokes were mostly unoriginal, but still funny, very funny at times, the action was fairly typical, but well lit and still very cool to watch. Speaking of lighting, the film looks great. Costumes, sets, cinematography, lighting, all good. It's less washed out than older DC films like Batman V Superman, but less saturated than more extreme Marvel films like Thor: Ragnarok. It looks very real, with just enough extra color to make it pop satisfyingly.The plot was predictable, but at least they chose a good plot, and the cast was very endearing, I couldn't help but get invested in their over-the-top family antics. Xolo Mariduena is a revelation as Jaime Rayes, able to sell the part of the young hero without overdoing it on the ""young"" aspect, something that can plague other superhero films with young protagonists *coughs* Shazam 2* coughs*. There is a good balance being stuck between Jaime's reluctance at being unceremoniously saddled with the irreversible power of an alien superweapon, and his natural excitement that any of us would have to acknowledge at being able to fly and catch rockets.Big plus for me; the villain is actually a villain. She isn't very sympathetic, and although the implied bias against the latino characters is a little on the nose, the film does a good job of showing that she is pretty despicable in all aspects of her villainy. Proper evil antagonists will always be more fun for me.All things considered, I would recommend giving this a shot. It's campy, yes, but it is full of the hearts and souls of the people who made it, and I'd rather watch a movie that sets and hits a fairly low bar, than a film that feels like it was made on an assembly line.And, if nothing else, just savor that this film takes place in one place, in one time, with one version of the character.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Blue Beetle is a breath of fresh air and could be a promising beginning for its new path. The story is simple but it is enhanced greatly by the performances of the cast. I never doubted the love this family has for one another. The action is fun and the humor feel less formulaic than others of the genre that I feel is both an effort of the writers and the cast themselves. Blue Beetle is one of the best superhero movies this year. If you've grown weary of the universe, this might reinvigorate your interest.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie reminded me of a solid Marvel Phase 1 movie. It really felt like a mix of Ironman 1 and Antman. This movie was a blast, embracing Hispanic culture and style throughout. For those who grew up in Hispanic households, it's likely to trigger many core memories.The standout aspect for me was the emphasis on family - refreshingly, they're all in the loop about what's happening, avoiding the usual secret identity trope. The trailers showcase their united front, and George Lopez's unexpected role shines as my favorite character, much like Luis from the Ant-Man series - injecting wild fun into the mix.The movie's soundtrack was another highlight. Balancing original tracks with a variety of Spanish hits, it added an extra layer of richness. The storytelling remains self-contained, peppered with DC Easter eggs. Director James Gunn's choice to kick off the new DC Universe with Blue Beetle seems to be a smart move, given the potential the movie sets up. It's evident that the world-building has begun, introducing significant players already.Originally planned as an HBO Max stream, the film's promotion to theater release under the new DC regime was a wise decision. Blue Beetle makes for a strong start, both for the character and the new DC direction. The mid-credit scene promises exciting possibilities for future projects, and there's a clever audio surprise if you stay till the very end. I enjoyed it, and my girlfriend absolutely adored it. A solid opening for DC! Great Flick!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

With ample heart, charm, and entertainment-value, ""Blue Beetle"" has more than enough to warrant a viewing on a rainy afternoon; it's nothing remarkable, but the characters are fun, the comedy hits, and the action is filmed well. The problem is, for all its action and comedy and positive messages, at the end of the day there is nothing remarkable about ""Blue Beetle.""Originally planned for a direct-to-streaming release on HBO Max, ""Blue Beetle"" ultimately ended up being released in theatres, and I'm honestly not sure that it should have been. The word ""generic"" is written all over this film; with little to distinguish it in terms of plot, direction, and action, this flick falls directly in the category of ""average."" Listen, ""Blue Beetle"" doesn't offer you anything you haven't seen before - and besides the 80s synth score and occasional touch of neon-drenched decor, there's nothing too innovative at play here. And to be honest, at first I didn't mind because I was, admittedly, having a good time with it - by the third act, however, I found my enjoyment dwindling as the film failed to provide anything fresh.Simply put, the movie is just stale; from the evil corporate villain to the Power Ranger-esque look and feel of the titular hero, everything looks and feels dated, almost as if directly ripped from an early 2000s superhero movie. And no matter how many jokes the characters tell or action set pieces the movie throws at its audience, the movie doesn't have anything original to say or do during its runtime. And for some, that won't be a problem - my cousin really enjoyed the movie, and, if I am to judge my audience's reception based on the amount of laughter I heard during my showing, I'd assume that they enjoyed it as well. But, God, I just wanted something new to happen.Take the action sequences, for example. I feel like there's a lot you can do with the idea of a symbiotic suit that can create any weapon its wearer imagines.... and instead, all the movie gives us is a sword fight and some blasters that look like they're from Halo. Is that really the best they could come up with? And also, the action sequences were astoundingly small scale - for something shown on the big screen, I started to feel like I'd have a better time watching the action scenes on YouTube from my laptop; there's really just no reason for someone to see this in a theatre, as the movie doesn't feel theatrical.All of my complaining aside, however, I don't hate this movie - as I said, I had some fun with it, and I'll definitely revisit it at some point. I just don't think this is a movie you have to rush out to see, and if you do want to see it, I'd recommend waiting for streaming. Sure, you can enjoy this movie at the theatre, but you can have just as good or better a time with it at home with a pizza and a few beers.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, across the second half of the film I could feel myself gradually becoming more invested in the events onscreen.Much of the cast match each other in terms of standard, they all try and subsequently produce solid displays. I will say that I really enjoyed George Lopez's performance as Rudy, he brings a lot of life and humour to the film via that role.Xolo Maridueña is more than decent as the titular character, while Bruna Marquezine makes for a good match alongside Maridueña; even if her character's Kord family portion of the story didn't interest me as much as the Reyes', in that sense the less said about Susan Sarandon the better here - extremely meh, at best.I very much wouldn't say the filmmakers hit the ball out of the park with this 2023 release, but I can certainly see potential with the character going forward - given they are reportedly planning to continue with him within the DCU. As for this, it's a serviceable superhero watch.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Huge fan from the comics ! But I don't understand why always DC have to some type way alter original history? Yes great humor ! Family! Love ! Unity! Yes even blue beetle was great! The actor did amazing! Nothing against him! But we talking about in the movie he's 22? In the comics it's between 16-18? So why making this type of way! I don't like to compared marvel stuffs but I though I was getting some type of homecoming vibes from spider man. But no they went into adult blue beetle , pushing romance and cheesy. There were a lot action! Yes and I bet the director did try he's best! As well as yeh actor ! I am Latino myself and I felt very represented on the movie but I felt the push it too much. James Gunn you are making anew DC legacy I get it , and yes sometimes there will be changes between books and movies I get it but it was this really necessary? You give us a typical young adult graduate looking for a job. Then becoming the awesome blue Beatle , you give us a beautiful girl completely new to the history! No even the one that he really like on the comics. All the movie is about him having a crush trying to be for her trying to be for his family and that's all. Far away from the comics and the origin, I was very hyped. But I gotta be honest I enjoy it the 2 hours but definitely won't be watching it again unless maybe for free in the future. If you are big fan GO watch it enjoy it you'll have a good time but don't expect too much , it's not hate towards the movie or the characters or actors I'm just feeling sorry about the fact we could have make something beautiful the right way. I feel you guys didn't give us the real blue beetle instead and Hero from hialeah Miami I'm sorry. It's the true. Why why to rush a relationship in a movie when you trying to build a character ? Don't get it here. Lol.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes, that's what we did this week to see the DCEU's Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle follows an alien scarab that chooses a recent college grad, Jaime Reyes, to be its symbiotic host. This relationship bestowed the young man with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes a superhero. Let's see how the DCEU's first Latinx superhero comes across the big screen.Honestly, we all know the DCEU has its issues in the live action movie realm. We know the leader at the helm has changed, but Blue Beetle is the last film from the previous regime. This film was set to be a streaming movie on Max but for whatever reason it was given the courtesy of debuting on the big screen. Just like Blue Beetle is currently missing from Max, there is something missing from this movie being great. The great part of this movie is Jaime Reyes' family unit led by George Lopez as his uncle, Rudy. Lopez and crew are full of energy, funny, familiar and bring life to the movie.What lacks from this movie is a discernable character that fits a superhero. Xolo Mariduena, as Jaime, does a nice job toeing the line of culture, nerdy, cool but something just was missing. Maybe it was the predictable and foreshadowing storyline and writing or maybe it was just me. Either way, something just felt not engrossing about the story. What was a joy to watch was the action sequences. Unfortunately, a few of the better sequences were displayed in the trailer which contributed to the lackluster response I probably had in viewing. Speaking of lackluster, the bad guys in this movie were kind of boring. It's hard to have an invested villain in a movie with a character that is pretty unknown himself to the masses but here we are. The major question is where this movie will fit into the James Gunn version of the DCEU. I hope he continues this franchise going forward.Trip: To me, Blue Beetle felt like a pilot to a HBO Max/Max television show. It did not feel grand enough to warrant the big screen treatment. Everything felt so basic. I appreciate the diversity of the depiction of a Mexican-American family in one of these superhero movies, but I wish the film had been more interesting. Yes, the family was cute, especially Nana played by Adriana Barraza. She was spunky and fun. However, I didn't find the family as funny as the rest of the audience I saw this with, but I do agree that the family brought the movie to life. They are a necessary component of what makes this movie work, if it works. Other than that, while the villain, Victoria Kord, has such a basic agenda and no real ethos behind her plan, Susan Sarandon was really fun playing her. She really sank her teeth into the villainy.I'll put it out there, if this had gone straight to streaming this would be a big box of fresh popcorn to enjoy at home. Since it hit the big screen, of course the action needs to be seen large but we couldn't help but feeling like something was missing from making this movie good. George Lopez and family steal the show from the superhero and that's not a great sign for a superhero movie. Needless to say, go check out Blue Beetle with a bowl of popcorn during the matinee time but definitely when it hits Max (formerly HBO Max).","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The writing isn't bland it's ok, this movie isn't mid or bad, it's just a 7/10, knowing DC this was surprising considering the flash came out in the same year. This is a pretty accurate depiction of Blue Beatle and a good adaptation, in no means is it underrated or overrated, it's in between because of the hate it's getting, I would recommend you watch it to have your own opinion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film has its sense of style and direction. It has plenty of heart, emotions, and action to make this a great film.The plot is great with Jaime (Xolo Mariduena) coming home from college. Only to come across a technology bug that imbedded in him with a suit and powers. While a corporation is after him.Great cast ensemble and a performance lead by Xolo Mariduena. The action sequences are awesome. The visual effects are also good. The humor may be overboard. It is a great Dc film which i loved way more than the Flash. Or if its a start in James Gunns dc universe. The film is off to a great start.","14 out of 38 found this helpful.

This is an induction movie of a new superhero, it's the same like others film, doesn't have too much good sense just letting us know that a new hero is coming to kick those asses. The Cinematographer did good, very beautiful even though we already seen that place in others movie already. The Action, Storyline & Characters are also good, Carapx is not actually a bad guy, we knew that though his eyes even we didn't know his flashback yet, the fighting scenes are interesting, fighting styles with effects make it become one of the best fight scenes, the storyline is not bad tho, but like I said, they just didn't make it good enough for the audience, there are so many superhero movies that come out with how they got superpower and how they learn to control it like it become nothing new because the audience already what's going on with the same taste of introduce superhero movies. Let's talk about the VFX, This time the CGI is way better than before, we can see that the effects combo with the fight make us enjoy it so good, but there's so much funny scenes that makes some of it didn't make so well, like it become cringe or smt. Overall this is a best introduction movie for dc and me, i love it so much hope y'all enjoy it too.7.8/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm so glad we didn't go the theaters to watch it, I would probably ask for money back. I'm kindly asking the director and producers, please, do not mama any further movies from this story.

Yes and no.. I felt the blue beetle scenes themselves when in action was good but I think I wanted more and he got too fast used to what he was as did his family. I loved the action scenes, I liked a little bit of the humour but no real laugh out loud moments. I liked the characters..nobody was super annoying but in terms of believability? Lets just say a couple of them you think yeah no I'm not buying it.At 2 hours long I don't think it necessarily felt it but at times the non action bits felt slow and to me didn't add anything to the film but I guess they wanted to drive home the message about family which yeah in a super hero movie we don't want that all the way through and to be the main focus in each part of the film again and again.I liked the guy chosen for blue beetle but he was still unremarkable I think anyone could have played him..I won't certainly remember his face after I have left the cinema. His romantic interest a pretty face but again forgettable.I think definitely more could have been done.. it was your basic storyline and it has been played out in so many other movies.Would I like a sequel? Possibly. I think I would like it if he was a superhero in all the sense of the word and a bigger landscape fighting villains and definitely more of the blue beetle in action as I quite liked the suit and what it can do although it does seem like it can do too much and it left me wondering what time this was set in because the tech was so much and advance it was like right let's make it do this and that and all shiny and bright but don't necessarily make it better. One thing worth noting I think I never had the belief that the boy was anything until activating powers in the suit I never really truely felt they were combined as they led us to believe like a lot of other superheros.So worth a visit to the cinema? Well if love super heroes then why not but will it leave you wanting more...possibly if we get more of blue beetle and try and develop blue beetle more then just a kid in a suit he loves his family. Would I go watch a sequel..possibly.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

And the results, it does make the most of the material for the character. Blue Beetle is a decent origin movie for the character. The first half of the movie can be basic with the ""family issues"" aspect and the characters don't really provide a lot of personality. But the rest of the movie gotten better with stunning visuals that experiments Blue Beetle's abilities nicely, enjoyable action, and great performances that make the movie quite entertaining. Because it's rare to see Blue Beetle in other form of media outside of comics, this probably will be the one movie goers would get introduced to the character. So maybe this would be worth watching either that or even as a DC fan. I wouldn't consider this as one of DCEU's best movies, but they did a pretty good job making an origin for the character.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The storyline follows a young man who is returning home from college to find his family struggling. He hopes to use his degree to make enough money to bail out his family. He bumps into a millionaire board member while in the process of losing his job and continues discussions after the interaction. They decide to meet up; and in doing sow, the lady hands him a scarab she doesn't trust her company with. The scarab turns him into a super hero and this is the Blue Beetle Origin Story.This is directed by Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City King) and stars Xolo Maridueña (Cobra Kai), Bruna Marquezine (God Save the King), George Lopez (Balls of Fury), Susan Sarandon (Thelma & Luis), Damián Alcázar (Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian) and Belissa Escobedo (Hocus Pocus 2).This is a fantastic origin movie. The writing and storyline makes you care about every character in the family...and this movie is really about family at its heart. You genuinely are very invested in what happens to whom. The CGI is top notch and the action scenes are fantastic. Blue Beetle's super powers are well depicted and fun to watch in action. A few scenes reminded me of the video games Soul Caliber and Mortal Kombat. The ending is sad, triumphant and does bring hope. George Lopez is absolutely awesome in this picture and keeps a fun pace to the film with his brand of comedy. Susan Sarandon was also a solid villain.Overall, this is an entertaining origin story and worthwhile addition to the super hero genre. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.","15 out of 43 found this helpful.

George Lopes bad choose yesteryear actor. Are there really no better Mexican-descent actors in Hollywood?It was so bad I battle to watch to finish. It's boring, and the jokes are plain awful. I can't even fathom how Susan Sarandon in there are okay with the simplistic, absurd, and ridiculous portrait of of her acting skills, disappointing. Having Susan Sarandon is not enough to save this disgrace of a film - her character is hollow and exaggerated.It's no surprise why DC's films performances are so low (in both the ticket office and quality) compared to those of Marvel (with this said Marvel isn't doing to good neither for themselves with the recent releases). The love interest is predictable and forced could see it a mile away to happen. It's a way to waste money and time to watch this film at all. I truly advise you to rather watch the trailers instead it's better than the movie itself. It's not fun, likeable, entertaining at all. I had no expectations and either way, I was utterly disappointed.No significant impact at the box office to render a movie sequel or even a TV series.Budget

The film had some very funny moments and kept me entertained for the entire 2 hours and 7 minutes.Xolo mariduena's acting was really good and it was great to see the cobra Kai actor getting his big screen debut as blue beetle.The movie is doing very well for being released mid strike 6 weeks ago and hopefully it does better since the strike is now ending.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Perhaps superhero fatigue is setting in or perhaps the studios are running out of ideas but with the bar set so low this film is actually quite entertaining.Coming across as a more comedic mash-up of Iron Man and Venom, it certainly isn't flawless as it is guilty of some shonky digital effects in a few places and is a little bit predictable too but it has a big heart, an unknown but charismatic lead, an engaging turn from. Susan Sarandon as the villain and a nice family orientated plot.The film is nicely plotted and doesn't feel overly long either, which makes a nice change in a film of this type. It very loosely connects with the DCEU, making a fleeting reference to Superman and Gotham City. There is no brooding of the main character and the plot doesn't feel particularly flabby. There is a touch absurdity but it's generally for comic effect and most of the gags work. Seeing as the DCEU era is coming to an end, this is actually a decent effort to go out on. It may not be a classic of its kind but it hasn't been massively hyped either, making it a pleasant and fun surprise.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

While it may not be a perfect 10, it's a commendable 7-star entry into the DC Extended Universe.Positives:Diversity and Representation (10/10): Blue Beetle introduces audiences to Jaime Reyes, a Latino superhero, and the film does a fantastic job celebrating cultural diversity and representation.Character Development (8/10): Jaime's journey from an ordinary teenager to a powerful superhero is engaging and relatable. His character arc is one of the film's highlights.Action Sequences (9/10): The action scenes are well choreographed and visually stunning. Blue Beetle's powers are showcased with creativity and style.Supporting Cast (8/10): Strong performances from supporting characters, particularly his family and mentor, add depth and emotional resonance to the story.Realistic Setting (7/10): The film successfully balances the superhero elements with a grounded, urban setting, making the story feel more authentic.Negatives:Pacing Issues (6/10): The movie struggles with pacing in some parts, leading to occasional dips in engagement.Villain Development (5/10): The antagonist, while menacing, lacks depth and a compelling backstory, making it difficult to fully invest in the conflict.Plot Predictability (6/10): The overall story arc follows a somewhat predictable superhero origin formula, missing opportunities for more innovative storytelling.Despite its flaws, Blue Beetle marks a significant step forward for inclusive storytelling in the superhero genre. It introduces a promising new hero and provides a solid foundation for potential sequels and expansion of the DCEU. While it may not be a perfect 10, it certainly deserves a strong 7-star rating. Fans of superhero films and those hungry for diverse representation will find plenty to enjoy in Blue Beetle.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""Blue Beetle"" consciously reuses common archetypes and situations in superhero stories. The action scenes are not exceptional, but they fun among many latin references","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9541261/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","4 January 2024","Based on DC comic books, the film follows the journey of Jaime Reyes (played by Xolo Maridueña), a young Mexican graduate who returns home full of ambitions for the future. As he searches for his purpose in the world and a job opportunity, fate has a twist in store for him when he crosses his path with an ancient alien biotechnology relic known as the Scarab. This blue-colored alien beetle chooses Jaime as its symbiotic host, giving him super-powerful armor and extraordinary abilities. However, a complication arises when this relic attracts the interest of businesswoman Victoria Kord (played by Susan Sarandon), who teams up with the villain Carapax (played by Raoul Max Trujillo) to try to recover it. In the midst of this chaos, Jaime finds support in his own family and in the young Jenny Kord (played by Bruna Marquezine). Facing unpredictable challenges, he finds himself forever transformed as he embraces his identity as the superhero Blue Beetle.We find ourselves in a completely dystopian world, where technology dominates and everything, we see on the screen is extremely artificial. It seems that we are immersed in a cyberpunk universe, where a domineering capitalist corporation controls everything and oppresses the city's most disadvantaged inhabitants. There is even room for a joke about class struggle, the fall of capitalism, imperialism and revolutionary guerrilla warfare. Angel Manuel Soto built this world to show us from the beginning why we came here, but it's not a world we should take seriously. In fact, it is an extremely artificial world, with no commitment to reality. The film is so skilled at immersing us in this universe that it ends up becoming extremely believable internally. Even things that might seem absurd end up becoming normal to us after the first few minutes of the film.In addition to all the technology and the issue involving the scarab itself, which arrives from space, probably of alien origin, it is extremely interesting to realize that the heart of this film lies in the human aspect. ""Blue Beetle"" is an extremely funny and deeply well-intentioned film that introduces us, for the first time, in a respectful way, to a Latin American superhero. This can provide Brazilian viewers with a peculiar feeling of familiarity with all the characters in the film, who resemble us in their speech, actions, experiences and even the environment they inhabit. The jokes made by the characters are so similar to ours that, at one point, I felt like I was watching a Brazilian television program. This feeling is further reinforced by the presence of Brazilian actress Bruna Marquezine on screen, which makes everything seem close and familiar. As I mentioned, artificiality is present in the world of the film and this same artificiality also permeates the relationships between these characters. Okay, it may seem a bit forced, but within that universe this dynamic works. This, in turn, reinforces the human warmth built within the family nucleus. Within this context, the character played by Marquezine also stands out, being a genuine anchor throughout the film.The most significant contribution of this film is the way it highlights all the Latin American references that cover several nations on the continent. He even shows that Brazilians (like Marquezine's character) are also Latinos and how the countries share similarities, even though Brazilians themselves often do not consider themselves as such. This film was clearly designed for Latinos, in all their forms. However, it is possible that the heart of the film, which represents this human side and the authentic Latin American warmth that the work built, is the element that eventually unbalances the narrative in the second half of the film, when we are introduced to the action itself. The film brings with it incredibly well-crafted and quite funny jokes. Due to this human quality of the film, this is exactly what captivates the audience. Every time the film tries to adopt a more serious tone and start a deep dialogue, it seems to lose its rhythm. These transitions seem somewhat disconcerting, especially when compared to the success achieved by the film's targeted approach.Gareth Dunner-Alcocer's script does little to bring any freshness to the narrative, being just the basics. The point is that this is a basic that Hollywood has never tried before, so ""Blue Beetle"" inevitably brings a flavor of newness. The person responsible for adding the mix to a dish that would previously have been bland is director Angel Manuel Soto, who populates the film with countless references to Latin culture, from ""Maria do Bairro"" to the unsurpassed Chapolim Colorado. Even though these references seem a little thrown in, like typical Mexican songs and Latin pop rock playing all the time, they are clearly important, as it is the American element that seems out of place when it appears (and is subtly criticized, too).However, the film fails in several aspects in which, theoretically, it should excel. Here, the Latino family is represented in the most stereotypical way possible, exactly with the characteristics for which it is known in the United States and around the world. It's true that Latinos are, in fact, warmer, more welcoming, sentimental people, but trying to bring a comical vein to the production, we see here people who just scream instead of talking, gesture, hug, cry, laugh in an extremely caricatural way, being exaggerated in anything they set out to do. Other stereotypes are presented (car with the music of ""La Cucaracha"". Meanwhile, several easter-eggs for the Latino audience seem more to be thrown at the screen to satisfy this audience than to have any narrative purpose, in the hope of ""representing"" the Latin people. The truth is that in the desire to bring the first Latin hero to the screen, everything sounded exaggerated and stereotypical all the time, inserted in a far from organic way. Instead of trying to distance itself from stereotypes, the film reinforces them.Not to mention all the parts of the script that must meet the demands of the progressive sector of Hollywood and the left-wing media, such as criticism of immigration, the system of paid higher education in the United States that leaves millions of students in debt, criticism of ""progress "" which excludes Mexicans who are relegated to the background and with second-rate jobs, and mainly to ""American anti-imperialism (""Abajo los imperialistas!"" as a character says in the final third of the production). Even Batman is called ""fascist"" completely free of charge to the delirium of this global progressive bubble.Still, Angel Manuel Soto doesn't leave aside what we normally see, especially in Marvel productions. In this way, there is the presence of a crude humor - here taken to the extreme through the use of stereotypes linked to the Latin people - and a very traditional construction. But it still has a captivating atmosphere, after all, after years, we see a new hero, in his own film, having fun discovering his new abilities. In this sense, Soto's own management works with this proposal. Everything sounds truly innocent, from Jaime's (Xolo Maridueña) romantic interest in Jenny (Bruna Marquezine) to the combat scenes that, although realistic, achieve genuine moments, especially from Jaime's dialogues (desperate requests for help) to the scarab. But the heart of the film, as already mentioned, lies in the captivating performances of Xolo Maridueña and Brazilian star Bruna Marquezine. For those who are used to seeing the protagonist in ""Cobra Kai"", his Jaime Reyes is infinitely more charismatic than any karate fighter, and his motivations are much more realistic than other DC superheroes: he just wants to save his life. Family. More than that, Maridueña is clearly reveling in the chance to play a studio hero, which adds a dash of charisma that, again, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman and Superman never even knew existed. But, even though Maridueña is the protagonist and titular hero, it is Bruna Marquezine who steals every scene in which she appears. She plays Jenny Kord, niece of the villain Victoria who wants to save the company's image that was distorted by her aunt, and who ends up involving the Reyes family by putting the Scarab in contact with Jaime. But make no mistake: she is not just a romantic partner, and fits much more into the role of a second protagonist than a mere supporting character.""Blue Beetle"" consciously reuses common archetypes and situations in superhero stories. Susan Sarandon plays a purposefully caricatural and undeveloped villain who is reminiscent of many others (the owner of a large company aiming for profitability above anything else). Although timid, there are mentions of erections (finally a superhero is not completely castrated by moralism) and quotes that will certainly reach the Latin public (such as the Mexican soap opera and the Colorado hero, figures that populate our imagination, then inserted into the hyperbolic Hollywood production). There is also a welcome (and liberating) lack of commitment to the other inhabitants of the DC Universe. The action scenes are not exceptional, but they work well within this idea of privileging what they add to the drama and the characters, without losing their vibrancy. And there are two eye-watering moments. In one of them, Jaime's uncle gives a speech about Latinity that highlights the problems faced by Mexican immigrants trying to make a living in the United States. ""Maybe it's time we had our own superhero,"" he says. The other is the aforementioned scene of the revolutionary grandmother shooting and shouting ""down with the imperialists"". Curious paradox, as we are talking about the product of a studio with imperialist guidelines. But at least it has a soul.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

An extraterrestrial scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, giving him superpowers that alters his life forever. Jaime becomes the superhero, known as Blue Beetle.Blue Beetle is a mind-blowing film. Director Angel Manuel Soto has given us a superhero movie that shines the spotlight on the titular character's family, while also giving us unlimited humor & heart. The action set pieces are phenomenal. The visual effects are perfect. The background score by Bobby Krlic is electrifying & unique, compared to the usual superhero movie background music. The performances are the standout of the film. Xolo Mariduena knocks it out of the park, as Jaime Reyes. Mariduena gives us another spectacular performance after his starring role in fan-favorite, Cobra Kai(2018-). Bruna Marquezine is outstanding as Jenny Kord. Becky G is effective as the voice of Khaji-Da. Susan Sarandon is fantastic as Victoria Kord. Belissa Escobedo is amazing as Milagro Reyes. George Lopez is hysterical as Rudy Reyes. Raoul Max Trujillo is awesome as Carapax. Damian Alcazar, Adriana Barraza & Elpidia Carrillo are excellent as Alberto Reyes, Nana Reyes & Rocio Reyes, respectively. Harvey Guillen is brilliant as Dr. Sanchez. Blue Beetle is a must watch (preferably in IMAX), for Blue Beetle & Xolo Mariduena fans. I'm so glad that James Gunn has decided to include Jaime, in his new DC Universe.

The characters are given lines and reactions that try to make them funny, like the whole movie is filled with inside jokes. And the responses are getting be anime type responses. Overall, the story was good. The acting left something to be desired. The CGI was expected but the practical effects and costumes fail quite a bit. Many times the suits worn by the Blue Beetle and Carapax looked cheesy and plastic. Not at all like the practical appliances used in Iron Man and the like. In addition, theme elements of ""family"" and ""culture"" are played about with a sledgehammer in the dialogue. Lighten up the message, spend some money on the practical events and thin out the comic relief and you may have something here. Would I watch this one again? Sure. Not going to seek it out but I would sit and watch if someone else wanted to see it or had it playing. I wouldn't leave the room and do something else or complain about it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While the set pieces and the villainy didn't surprise me much, I enjoyed the ground-level combat the most (wish there was more to that!). A major chunk of the action takes place in the air and (of course, the titular superhero is a ""beetle"" after all), and that's where I felt it could've been executed better. The suit and its internal AI will definitely remind you of various other superhero flicks. Xolo Maridueña plays a likeable protagonist and shares decent chemistry with Bruna Marquezine.The makers did a good job embedding the Mexican family dynamics into the plot, which not only gave it a distinct setup, but the emotional payoffs also worked well. Jaime's relationship with each of his family members is neatly explored, especially the one he shares with Uncle Rudy (George Lopez). The revolutionary nana bit was a fun little surprise. On the other hand, the Kord side of things was rather unexciting and didn't feel very engaging. Susan Sarandon gets to play a baddie, but I thought her backstory wasn't given a whole lot of importance. Also, they should've added hardcoded subs for the Spanish dialogues.The thing with superhero films (for me, personally i.e.) is that they're extremely CGI-heavy, and since I've had my fill of them for more than a decade now, I feel disengaged whenever I'm seeing one of those green-screen set-pieces. Like, how many more of these do we keep getting? It's already an immensely saturated space. No wonder the film turned out to be a box-office bomb, even when it wasn't bad.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Despite the promise of epic battles and thrilling heroics, the movie falls flat in almost every aspect.The plot feels disjointed and lacks a clear sense of direction. The filmmakers attempt to incorporate multiple storylines and subplots, resulting in a cluttered narrative that's difficult to follow. This confusion extends to the characters, who lack depth and development. Even the titular superhero feels one-dimensional, making it hard to empathize or connect with their struggles.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of blue beetle is its failure to capitalize on the potential for social commentary that the superhero genre often offers. The movie seems content to stick to tired clichés rather than explore meaningful themes or address relevant issues.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

But the DCEU tried that and people didn't like that either.The biggest issues with this in terms of numbers is it was put in cinemas during a writer strike smack bang between a universe ending and a universe that has not really started.Most general audience would be fine with it overall but wont go as they have no idea who Blue Beetle is (and unfortunately the concept of this hero, and the humour in ads, screams another Ryan Reynolds GL vibe).MCU superfans wont watch it because its DC.DCEU superfans wont watch it because its not Snyderverse (get over it already).Really hoping the overall reviews are ok regardless of money as BB deserves some recognition. If Gunns Superman and his universe gets some traction, we may see him again (possibly/hopefully in Booster Gold. And hopefully with fancasting Glen Powell in the lead). If Gunn gets a slow start with another Superman losing money, we have no hope of seeing this character on big screen again.

Yes, there are some ""cliches"" in the movie, but what movie doesn't have cliches. Mario, Spiderman, TMNT, all highly rated movies by critics & fans alike, and all had many cliches. I don't understand why people are so harsh on the ones here, but to each their own.Connection/Characters -
I do feel that a disconnect many may have had is that the story is around a poverty-stricken immigrant household, so many may have issues connecting, or feeling like they know the characters on a deeper level. Not to mention the many Indu windows to immigrants being mistreated by authoritative/privileged individuals. Additionally, a lot of the more subtle humor is in Spanish.

The film bears striking resemblance to Marvel movies from the mid-2000s, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. While it offers a few moments of genuine laughter, the overall package feels too familiar to stand out in today's saturated market of superhero films.Plot-wise, Blue Beetle doesn't bring much innovation to the table. The narrative arc feels like it's been lifted straight from superhero films we've seen time and time again. It's as if the creators have copy-pasted elements from older Marvel movies, assuming that the nostalgic appeal would be enough to carry the film. It results in a lack of suspense and a predictable storyline that could have done with some refreshing twists.That's not to say Blue Beetle is entirely devoid of merits. The film does manage to muster some charm through its humor. While the jokes don't break new ground, they are executed well enough to elicit genuine laughs. The comedic timing is one of the redeeming aspects that make the movie enjoyable, at least in segments.However, this sense of humor alone cannot make up for what the film lacks in originality. With the plethora of superhero films exploring deeper themes and showcasing groundbreaking special effects, Blue Beetle struggles to justify its existence beyond serving as a superficial homage to an era gone by.In conclusion, while Blue Beetle might offer a sense of nostalgia for fans of older Marvel movies, it fails to establish itself as a standout entry in the contemporary superhero landscape. It's not a bad film by any means-just one that you've probably seen several versions of already. If you're in the mood for an old-school superhero flick with decent humor, it might be worth a watch. Otherwise, there are more innovative options available that would be a better use of your time.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not super original, but the city, score, and overall experience is so much fun.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9597417/?ref_=tt_urv","bluerosecrow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48965690/?ref_=tt_urv","1 February 2024","This is not the best super hero movie ever made. It is not my favorite comic book movie, nor is it even my favorite DC movie. But this one is better than average.One of the biggest things this movie did right was by creating a city that had personality. It was bright, it was purely fictional, and it added to the feeling of the movie. So many comic book movies just take place in non-descript cities. Sure, Marvel is supposed to take place in real world cities, but one of the things I always loved about DC was their ability to create their own cities. This is the first superhero movie since the Burton / Schumacher Batman movies where it felt like a lot of thought went into the world.I also loved the overall look and score. The score had a lot of synth and it gave off a lot of really fun late 80's nostalgia. It made it an overall really fun watch.The story isn't really anything special. Kind of just a version of Iron Man and Ant Man. But really, most of the modern superhero origin movies are just reworkings of Richard Donner's Superman. So it isn't like we are swimming in a pool of originality and creativity with these things. You can see why James Gunn didn't want this movie itself to be a part of his new universe, but he did want the character, actor, and setting. This world has the potential to be great with a little more care and creativity with the script.The city, synth score, and overall look of the film is a fun experience easily worth an 8. I bumped it down to a 7, just because I feel like a little more care could have went into the originality of the script. If this movie came out in 2008, it would have been a hit. But this story line has been way too played out now that we are in 2024.But don't let the 7 keep you from watching it. 7 is still a good rating, and this movie is a lot of fun.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is definitely one of those films where you have to be very willing to suspend your disbelief and just left the performances bring you a self-effacing warmth of regular people thrust into awful and ridiculous situations by outside actors.The special effects here were lovely, nicely imagined, and for a change, not overly obscured by dimly lit scenes. The pace was briskly just right. And even tho the characters were mostly obvious stereotypes, the cast committed to the campiness and breathed life into them. Sarandon appears to have been desperate to play a villain role, and she achieved it with relish and a silly severity and self-seriousness. Veteran Adriana Barraza went from dull grandma to shining action hero in the second half with aplomb. And the young stars, Xolo Mariduena and long-established TV star in Brazil Bruna Marquezine stood out as lovely, engaging, exciting and ready to do more leading work in big budget English language productions. The Latin flavor may have felt like a force for diversity purposes, but it was a welcome injection to the comic book superhero genre, and any other genre these players might be offered. In spite of the silliness of the story, I wound up enjoying this as much as any other comic book film I've seen with established English stars.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

A warm, fun, engaging group who are there for him.The actual superhero antics are very much what we've seen before, and effects laden OTT hitting and swooshing with CGI in abundance.It has potential to be a decent enough franchise, but sadly it has hit just as super hero fatigue is at it's peak. Marvel and DC have saturated the screens both small and large with a bajillion superheroes over the last 20 years and wrung out all but passing interest in them, so for a new one to succeed it needs something truly original and new. This wasn't it, but it was entertaining and hit all the right notes nonetheless.I doubt the hinted at sequel will ever come to pass, especially after the recent changes at the top of DCs cinematic output.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

However there are a few moments which clearly show that the writers had no idea what to do with some of the cast members, and would've been far better if they had simply discarded those scenes or changed the scenes to omit these characters from those scenes instead of forcing them to be part of the script.Furthermore, it feels like the script kept jumping between comedy, action and drama.

While the premise of a teenager, Jaime Reyes, gaining extraordinary powers from an alien beetle promises an action-packed adventure, the execution falls short, resulting in a film that struggles to maintain interest.The movie follows Jaime as he navigates the challenges of his newfound abilities while facing formidable enemies and uncovering the secrets of the mysterious scarab. Despite a vibrant and diverse cast, led by Xolo Maridueña, the film fails to deliver the excitement and engagement expected from a superhero blockbuster.One of the primary issues is the pacing and the predictability. This sluggish pace made it difficult to stay invested in the story, and it took me a week to complete the film as I found myself losing interest frequently. The action sequences, while visually satisfactory, were not enough to compensate for the overall lack of momentum. I also found that I couldn't hear everything that was said by the cast.On the positive side, the film does have moments of charm, particularly in the family dynamics portrayed by Adriana Barraza and Damían Alcázar. Their performances add a layer of warmth and authenticity that is otherwise missing in the larger narrative. The script succeeded at balancing humour, heart, and heroism,In conclusion, ""Blue Beetle"" had the potential to be a standout addition to the superhero genre, but its execution leaves much to be desired. With better pacing and more compelling character development, it could have been an engaging adventure. Unfortunately, it ended up being a monotonous experience that struggled to hold my attention.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Diving into the world of Blue Beetle, I couldn't help but be intrigued by James Gunn's promise of a rebooted DCU. However, post-release reality paints a different picture for this 2023 flick, leaving me questioning the franchise's future.Despite its critical and commercial stumble, my family and I gave it a shot. I've got to hand it to Xolo Maridueña; his energy, reminiscent of his work in Cobra Kai, injects life into Jaime Reyes. It's a fun performance that adds a spark to a movie drowning in familiar waters.Speaking of familiar, the plot and character dynamics feel like a mishmash of superhero clichés. It's a cocktail of Marvel and DC déjà vu, with echoes of Ant-Man, Shazam!, and even a touch of Spider-Man, costume and all. The shadow of Iron Man looms large, from suit capabilities to a baddie keen on armour crafting.Sure, it's a been-there-done-that scenario, but Blue Beetle manages to salvage itself with some light-hearted entertainment. The action moves briskly, peppered with comedy, even if not all the jokes land. It's a welcome departure from the brooding tone the DCEU has often faced criticism for.Is this the character's swan song? Only time will unveil that mystery. For now, Blue Beetle is a harmless way to kill a couple of hours, though it doesn't offer anything groundbreaking. It's a decent escape into the superhero realm, even if the journey feels like a recycled tour through familiar territories.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

Susan Sarandon (why?) is the megalomanic corporate mogul ""Kord"" who is out to create a super-soldier (""OMAC"") using an extra-terrestrial scarab that can synergise an human being with an almost indestructible endo-skeleton. Fortunately for all of us, her cleaning lady likes to use the luxury bathroom at her home, and when she is caught and quite literally dumped, she and her brother find themselves out of work and introduced to ""Jenny"" (Bruna Marquezine) - the strong-minded niece of our baddie - who is determined to thwart the militarisation of her daddy's company. She smuggles the gadget out of their HQ and manages to pass it to the rather earnest and drippy brother ""Jaime"" (Xolo Maridueña) with strict instructions not to even open the box. Of course they do, and next thing he and the glowing blue gizmo are best mates - he can fly, zip around with great speed and has, of course, super-human strength. ""Cord"" is determined to get it back, so she energises her already semi-mechanised henchman ""Carapax"" (Raoul Max Trujillo) for a gradual/glacial build up to a denouement that a bat could see from space. This has all the feel to it of a standard television movie. Great visual effects but lightning pyrotechnics, cleaving a bus in half and endless explosions are no longer enough to sell a film. There has to be some semblance of originality with the thing. Aside from it's bilinguality, this has precious little by way of innovation to shout for it. The characters are largely forgettable - especially the annoying uncle ""Rudy"" (George Lopez) who's astonishing adeptness with all things super-tech was just plain daft! It's also way, way too long and I felt the ominous presence of a sequel looming at the end quite sad. This is a weak story with a weak cast that seems designed to fill a gap in the USA's expanding and under-served Hispanic market. I think it may work there?

Xolo Maridueña was great. If you watched Cobra Kai at all then you can see how far Xolo has come as an actor. He did a great job in this film.There were definite moments where it felt like Iron Man, or Spider-Man, or even Black Panther, but for the most part Blue Beetle stands on it's own. Is it another super hero movie? Absolutely! This movie is meant to be a super hero movie, but this is the type of super hero movie we've all been asking for and they finally provided it. The last 6 DC films were trash, but this is what we we've hoping for. At this point though, I feel like everyone is tired of super hero movies and did not quite understand the Latino culture in the film. There seemed to be a lot of jokes that were made if you have a Latino background. Since I have somewhat lived in that culture, a lot of things might have stood out to me more as funny than someone who doesn't speak Spanish or has not been immersed in that culture. (If you haven't, it's an incredibly beautiful culture and would highly recommend it).The sense of family that Latino's have goes beyond Fast and the Furious and they did a great job of showing that family dynamic in this movie. The movie did a great job of representation as well. It's rare to see this kind of representation in super hero films and as a white American, it's always great to see other cultures and races represented in this way.Nana was a fun character and if you know her acting history it makes her character that much more fun.George Lopez's character plays that crazy fun loving uncle and he really fits in his role. He made the movie that much more enjoyable with all his quirks.Lastly, if you're sick of super hero movies in general, I would not recommend this movie to you. But if you're a fan of any of the characters I mentioned above, this is a fun and entertaining movie. Solid 8/10.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

This time it's DC with a film that feels like a cheap spider-man rip off without any of the interesting bits.Xolo Mariduena plays a young Mexican guy who's just returning home to his family after becoming the first of his family to graduate from college. Like many of us he finds himself jobless and it debt and now the pressures on as the rent for the family home is about to be tripled. What follows is a story about how a guy who's down on his luck mistakenly unleashes the power of the blue beetle and as we all know with great power comes great responsibility which is a quote that maybe Hollywood execs need to start putting into practice with how they treat their writers.The film is about as formulaic as it could be with every single Mexican stereotype forced in there often in the form of jokes that rarely land. I appreciate seeing diversity in my films but Mexican please let me know are you happy with how you're being represented because I wouldn't be if I were you?The films tone doesn't even feel like that of a DC film it's strangely light hearted to the point where it at times feels like a parody of a superhero film. This becomes an even bigger issue when the film throws in some emotional scenes as they have no affect on an audience as they feel so out of place with the light hearted nature of the rest of the film.I tried to stick with this one for as long as I could and there was a scene in the middle between the main character and his uncle (who by the way is by far the best character) where I felt the film may be about to pick up. This wasn't however the case and for the last 45 minutes I found myself on my phone and I can't say I've been this bored with a film since Ant Man Quantumania. Whilst I know this film isn't apart of the new phase of DC I do worry what may happen to the state of their productions in the hands of James Gunn who has publicly defended this film.For me it's the worst film of the year so far.","22 out of 44 found this helpful.

""Blue Beetle"" seems to have the support of the 'Gunn Safran' era but wasn't commissioned by them, so who knows whether this is a one-off appearance or whether we might see the Blue Beetle again.Jamie Reyes (Xolo Mariduena) a young man of Hispanic descent, is chosen by an item of alien origin to become a superhero, the Blue Beetle. As well as the power of flight and enhanced body armour, the suit is capable of producing weapons and forms a symbiotic relationship with its host. The item though is wanted by weapons manufacturer Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) for her enhanced soldier programme, and she's prepared to use her considerable resources to reclaim the talisman.""Blue Beetle"" is, for me, another film in what can be described as the DCEU's perfectly fine goodbye. Like ""Black Adam"" and ""Shazam 2"" ""Blue Beetle"" is an acceptable time, which is both the films best and worst points. There are specific aspects that I do like, Xolo Mariduena is an engaging performer, just like he is in ""Cobra Kai"". I liked his family too, even George Lopez, who looked like he'd be insufferable in the trailer is actually a lot funnier and more heartwarming than he appeared. Visually it's OK, with the CGI looking solid and the fight scenes working well.But ultimately, it's another superhero origin story like so many others before it. Whilst it avoids Reyes trying to keep his double life from his parents, it does include, for example, scenes of him struggling with his newfound powers, which we've seen before. Any of the ideas that might have been interesting or unique about this one, such as the fact that the actual power is sentient and can make its own decisions about what to do, are largely underexplored. Also, the Neon 80's vibes felt, to me, a little played out in a post ""Vice City"", ""Stranger Things"" world.I can't imagine that really the film is going to draw particularly strong reactions, either positive or negative from anyone. It's too slick to hate, but too generic to love - if we see the character again, I'd probably see the film, but I see him shifting into a supporting role in team up films, going forward.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's not surprising either since Blue Beetle is a comic that only saw his first issue appear in February 2006. Now DC has been expanding the DC universe for quite some time, but that goes with peaks and troughs. Nowhere do the movies really want to tap the level of the first 4 phases of the Marvel movies. Still, there really seems to be progress in it, because after a few disappointments such as Wonder Woman 2 and the terrible Harley Quin- movie, where I don't even feel like mentioning the entire title, there seems to be an advance when we look at The Suicide Squad from 2021 and the recently released The Flash. Adding Blue Beetle could therefore be a good move, although DC is unfortunately not really known for its good CGI effects, which often seem to be very substandard despite the expensive productions. Sometimes it feels a bit like this is happening on purpose, but real logic can't be found behind that. Hopefully Blue Beetle will then become a bit of a tipping point and hopefully the DC movies will finally go in a direction that we want to see.In terms of effects, the film is still fine. Here and there the CGI might have been a bit better, but taken by boat it's fine. So no bottlenecks there. Where the bottleneck actually lies a bit is the extremely childish and bland humor that the film contains. There is a bit of an attempt to put some kind of Ant-Man-like humor into the film, but this happens in a way that you normally see appear in The Power Rangers or such a youth production. Here and there, the names of Superman and Batman are used to cultivate recognition, naming Batman as a wealthy fascist. It will all have to do with the all-Mexican cast and the fact that DC wants to come across as politically correct. By the way, this is something we see more often, there was the last Transformers movie recently and a few years ago of course Terminator: Dark Fate who also made a very large part of the cast Mexican. What is very disturbing in Blue Beetle in that is that there is a lot of English spoken to which the opposing party responds in Spanish. Still a bit disturbing and annoying, especially considering the burned-in large English subtitles marred the image.Fortunately, there are also positive things to report, because actually just like in The Flash, you won't be bored for seconds. The film lasts just over 2 hours and takes about 20 minutes to explain the story a bit and let you bond with the main characters and then the action starts and you are immediately plunged into a lot of fights, shooting, walking, screaming, jumping and so on. The film was actually made to get directly to MAX (formerly HBO Max), but they still opted for a cinema release and this is quite understandable when you watch the film. These types of action movies often come into their own best on the big screen and probably this would have been more disappointing on a smaller home screen than it does now. Not everyone acts equally well, of course you get a lot of drama about halfway through that stretches the film a bit unnecessarily, but luckily the makers didn't pull it towards the 3 o'clock, something that the Marvel- films in particular were good at.Blue Beetle has become a nice movie, where you won't be bored. The film lasts just over 2 hours and takes about 20 minutes to explain the story a bit and let you bond with the main characters and then the action starts and you are immediately plunged into a lot of fights, shooting, walking, screaming, jumping and so on.

Still a bit disturbing and annoying, especially considering the burned-in large English subtitles marred the image. For the rest, this is a fun movie for a boring afternoon if you really don't have anything better to do, but the film won't leave an unforgettable impression anyway.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I have never read any comics with the character or anything, so I only knew very little about what I was in for here. So on that account, then writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer and director Angel Manuel Soto had every opportunity to impress and entertain me.The storyline in ""Blue Beetle"", as written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, proved to be fairly okay. It was a rather generic storyline actually, for a superhero movie, but it definitely made for adequate entertainment, which is the purpose of the movie. So that was definitely good enough. I wasn't impressed with the story, though, and I can't say that writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer convinced me to venture out and get to know more about the character and the stories that he is in.Visually then ""Blue Beetle"" was great. The special effects and CGI looked good, though there is an overwhelming abundance of bright neon-color themes throughout the movie, which made me think of the 1980s. Sometimes less is more, which somewhat applies here; I think if they had toned down on the excessive use of bright flourescent colors everywhere, then it would have been a bit more enjoyable. But I will say that the special effects and CGI definitely helped to make the movie all the more enjoyable and watchable.The acting performances in the movie were good, and Xolo Maridueña was nicely cast for the leading role of Jaime Reyes. Aside from Xolo Maridueña, then the only other familiar faces on the cast list for me were Susan Sarandon and George Lopez, with the latter sporting a horrible beard and even worse mullet. I think it was a shame that actress Belissa Escobedo weren't given a more prominent role with more screentime and more influence on the storyline, because she seemed to be able to bring something enjoyable to the movie.Essentially then ""Blue Beetle"" didn't really bring much of anything new to the superhero genre, aside from it being a Latino/Hispanic-based superhero, I suppose. So ""Blue Beetle"" was actually rather generic in some aspects.If you enjoy superhero movies, then ""Blue Beetle"" should be candy for you. I sat down to watch it as a casual viewer, as I am not a superhero fan, but watch them for the mindless entertainment they tend to provide, which also was the case for ""Blue Beetle"".My rating of director Angel Manuel Soto's 2023 movie lands on a six out of ten stars.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is far from perfect, there are characters that are written so poorly i laughed at their dialogue. But this is a superhero genre, poor characters appear more often than not. The main hero played by actor Xolo M. Who was also in the kobra kai (karate kid spin off) did a fantastic job conveying emotion. I'm really excited to watch him move into more roles in hollywood. He really sold the realistic aspects of ""kid becomes hero"" and the movie does a nice job of creating a unique approach of the first ""superhero suit up"" scene. There's plenty of things to feel good about in this movie.To its failures, a couple of the main characters, most surprisingly Susan Sarandon's character, are terribly written. They are straight out of cliche movie textbook. I literally laughed at some of the scenes meant to be serious with her character. There are also points in the movie, where it seemed the writers didn't know how to advance the plot. They decided to just force it along, with satire and comedy. However the movie isn't afraid to make fun of itself for doing so. It's an average movie at best, but i never felt like it was trying to pretend to be better than that.If you are okay with a comedic approach in serious moments, and you're a fan of ""superhero movies"" in general, you'll walk away happy that you saw this.

There is also many question about plot points such as how Jamie is against killing but is okay for others to do it.Overall, it's a fine movie to kill 2 hours with and at least it's better than the previous DC entries.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It didn't really feel like a superhero movie because the superhero didn't do much saving and actually did more harm (accidentally) then good. There was many scenes throughout the movie that had me bored and everything was so predictable. I wouldn't say it was a total waste of time, but i don't think i'd watch it again.

Defying the odds, it showcases that not all heroes need to belong to the 'A-list' to leave a mark on the audience.From its very inception, the film promised to be unique, presenting the lesser-known but beloved Jaime Reyes (portrayed with gusto by Xolo Maridueña) as the titular Blue Beetle. The narrative beautifully dives deep into the rich tapestry of Latino culture, making it one of the first mainstream superhero movies to do so, and is anchored by Jaime's strong familial ties, which includes his charismatic father Alberto (Damián Alcázar) and an endearing conspiracy theorist uncle Rudy (George Lopez) among others.The film's heart undoubtedly lies in its characters. Maridueña, in particular, exhibits moments of brilliance, hinting at a promising leading-man future. He takes us on a journey through Jaime's life post-college, with his earnest endeavor to support his family, leading to an unexpected tryst with the alien entity, the Scarab.The storyline, though an origin tale, does not feel stale. Instead, Soto manages to weave a tapestry of emotional threads, using family as its fulcrum, making the stakes personal and thereby elevating the tension. The narrative's domestic undertones, blended with the larger-than-life superhero elements, create a harmonious balance that few movies achieve.Furthermore, the film's commitment to diverse representation is commendable. Through genuine scenes where the characters just 'exist', the audience gets a genuine sense of Latino culture, adding depth and dimension to the narrative.In terms of visual effects, Blue Beetle doesn't hold back. While the third act showcases CGI in its full glory, there's a seamless integration that keeps you engrossed in the narrative, rather than being distracted by the visual spectacle.In essence, Blue Beetle emerges as a genuine surprise package, proving that with the right vision and execution, even lesser-known characters can make for gripping cinema. While it has its minor flaws, its heart, soul, and respect for the source material make it deserving of an 8/10.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

My child says it was ok, but that the villains were just too stupid. Says it would have been more interesting if the protagonist faced something more challenging (villains who think, or at least can turn their heads while running).Anyways, give the movie a try.

I felt this journey was seriously lacking in this movie as it was all geared around the family and while I get the intention behind it, the family was just cringe, annoying and the movie was unbalanced between them getting 'hilarious' screen time and Jaimie's growth as a character.Jaimie spent most of the movie terrified, and didn't really get badass until the last 15 minutes, and to be frank, nothing was really about Jaimie at all until then, either his family controlled the screen time or his suit did all the work, I wanted to see more of Jaimie really becoming 'one' with it, and the story behind that, not his grandma floundering around, cackling with a gun blaster.Also, why did the beetle even choose Jaimie in the first place? We didn't get any answers with that either! There's so much they could have explored with that as well and so many wasted opportunities in this movie.I think the other reviewers questioning the Mexican representation almost being offensive is also worth bearing in mind, although it was all part of the cringe factor for me.I really hope IF they do another Blue Beetle, the family take more of a backseat and we get to see more of Jaimie as a character.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

You will be on a rollercoaster coaster ride through out the movie. The film does a good job of making the scenes not too long and not too boring.There is Great story line and characters that surprise you. I loved the fact that there was a mixture of Spanish, Portuguese, and English throughout the film. So much of the movie is rooted in the Latin American Community and connection with family. Take everyone you know to go see it. I will definitely watch it again. Imax is recommended.","11 out of 40 found this helpful.

A somewhat likable protagonist finds themselves in the midst of an unfunny supporting cast, a recipe for mediocrity. It's perplexing why writers overlook the potential for depth. Reflecting on an animated series like ""Young Justice,"" which skillfully portrayed the Blue Beetle's origins, it becomes evident that meticulous storytelling is possible.The movie landscape seems plagued by a repetition of these lackluster productions. A simple delve into well-crafted narratives could potentially yield a cinematic masterpiece. Unfortunately, what unfolds is a jumbled, unfunny mess, leaving the viewer struggling to endure until the credits roll. It begs the question of why studios don't invest more in the groundwork that transforms an ordinary movie into an unforgettable experience.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Blue Beetle is everything we've seen before, further reinforcing this tired and repetitive formula. This film again falls into the line of mediocrity, making it forgettable. The whole look of the film doesn't please me, it's sickening to see these extravagant lights and this soulless technology. The humor is forced in many moments and apparently the script doesn't realize this. They repeat the same jokes all the time trying to get at least one laugh, it seems like they try to make the joke stand out, but it's just unbearable every time it occurs. It's unbearable having to talk all the time about films like Blue Beetle. It doesn't deliver anything new or striking, not even striking in a bad way. The only thing that can be taken away from two hours of film is the Latin representation, which is indeed important, but at certain moments they manage to force even that, returning to stereotypes.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Let's delve into this cinematic catastrophe, shall we? Brace yourself for a litany of lamentation as I dissect every wretched aspect of this atrocity.First and foremost, the plot is an exercise in abject mediocrity. It's as if the screenwriter took a nap halfway through and decided to just roll with the most insipid and uninspired narrative elements possible. The result? A plot so devoid of creativity that even the most dedicated fans of mind-numbing tedium would struggle to find any redeeming qualities.Now, let's talk about the characters - or should I say, the vapid caricatures that grace the screen. These characters are not just your run-of-the-mill dull; they are remarkably, unbelievably, and profoundly stupid. Their actions and decisions defy logic and common sense to such an extent that you'll find yourself questioning the very fabric of reality.The dialogues, if you can even call them that, are about as generic as a cardboard box. It's as if the scriptwriters employed a random word generator to craft the lines, resulting in exchanges so devoid of wit, depth, or originality that you'll be pining for the days of Shakespearean prose.And then we arrive at the acting. Oh, the acting. If you could even call it that. The performances in this travesty of cinema are so wretchedly poor that you'd be forgiven for thinking you stumbled upon a community theater production gone horribly wrong. It's as if the cast was instructed to channel their inner wooden planks, with every emotion delivered in a painfully forced and unconvincing manner.The only semblance of redemption in this cinematic abyss lies in the special effects. I suppose if you're the type of viewer who derives satisfaction from pretty lights and flashy explosions, then congratulations, you've found your silver lining. But even the special effects can't salvage this sinking ship; they merely serve as a shiny distraction from the underlying ineptitude.To liken the acting in this film to that of a ""cheap TV series"" would be an insult to the multitude of talented actors who grace the small screen. No, this is a level of performance that can only be equated to the most bottom-tier, bargain-bin productions, where thespian skills seem to be optional.The entire film feels like a mind-numbing descent into the depths of idiocy. It's as if the creators took inspiration from the lowest quality, brainless cartoons and decided to replicate that asinine formula on the big screen. As the film trudges on, it only becomes increasingly moronic, pushing the boundaries of absurdity and leaving the audience in a state of bewilderment.At some point during this cinematic train wreck, I found myself teetering on the precipice of anger. Yes, anger. Anger at the audacity of subjecting viewers to this festival of imbecility. It's a genuine affront to the intelligence of anyone unfortunate enough to have wasted precious minutes of their life on this abomination.I had such high hopes for ""Blue Beetle,"" but what a colossal letdown it turned out to be. In comparison to this travesty, even the most maligned entries in the DC film universe shine like beacons of cinematic excellence. This film isn't just bad; it's a new benchmark for cinematic incompetence, a testament to the depths to which a movie can sink in its quest to be utterly dreadful.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

The story felt really flat and once again another villain with out purpose of being bad. It's just a flat boring superhero movie we've been getting for the past 5 years. The movie should've been about the scarab and introduce the reach who made it. Instead it felt more of his family origin story becoming ""heros"" instead of blue beetles origin. What we saw of him becoming blue beetles origin felt rushed. The best part about this movie was xolo and the suit. He did a great job for his first big screen appearance and he has a bright future. His sister wasn't that good at acting and neither was the mom. The father was great and George Lopez was alright. The Grandma was just eh. They made the movie too funny and oftentimes it was too much and forced. And there was too much propaganda in this film. I'm Mexican and Puerto Rican and it was too much. I was annoyed when they said the government has no problem with locking up Mexicans. It was just too much.

Green Lantern CGI is better, so, there's that, and GL didn't blatantly pander to a specific demographic and manage to horribly insult that demographic every 30 seconds.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Blue Beetle however has everything, terrible acting, almost a plot, almost but not quite, sub standard effects, a swing and a miss in every department. Who knew that super heroes (I use the term very lightly) did a ""Take your family to work day"" tragic in every meaning of the word. Too many histrionics from all concerned, if squealing, screaming and shouting were super powers these guys would be the tops. Not sure who this is aimed at, someone who has never seen a film before maybe, it wouldn't encourage them to watch another. Luckily it still isn't the worst film in the genre, that honour goes to Wakanda Forever, awful acting, stinking CGI, and worst of all the bastardization of what should have been an homage to one of Marvels original characters, Namor, The Submariner, shame on them.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The theme of ""family values"" is crowbarred into nearly every scene, but the script does a poor job connecting the audience to the characters.Susan Sarandon gives a wooden performance as a one-dimensional baddie. George Lopez falls flat as the zany tech-wizard uncle. Xolo Maridueña and
Bruna Marquezine are capable actors and fun to watch, but lack chemistry.Even in the thick of the action, pace is erratic. Bad Hollywood action cliches abound. Rather than overcome obstacles through strength of character, the good guys seem fated to win as teenage girls are able to fight professional mercenaries as equals.Overall, Blue Beetle comes across as a money grab. It copies elements of family superhero films (e.g., Antman) but fails to capture the heart. It takes itself too seriously at all the wrong times. It's just bad entertainment - I literally could not watch it all in one sitting because it was so painful to sit through.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, this movie was finally a hit for the DC universe and really surprised me.Coming into this movie, I had heard decent things about it so I kept my expectations neutral and went in with an open mind. And by the end, I walked out happy, knowing that I just saw, finally, a really good DC movie. Keep in mind this movie is not for everyone, and gets pretty generic at times, but overall, it's pretty solid.The plot revolves around Jaime Reyes, a 22 year old man who just graduated and went home to his Mexican family. His family has strong love for each other, and they're all really funny. After learning they're in debt, he wants to get a job to help his family. He eventually meets a young woman named Jennifer Kord, who is a descendant of Ted Kord, the owner of Kord Industries, a tech company. After meeting, she tells him that if he wants a job, then he should meet her at Kord Tower the next day. When he shows up, he finds Jenny running from law enforcement. When Jaime asks what's wrong, she gives him a case with a special Scarab in it and tells him to protect and not open it. When he returns home, his goofy family tries to convince him to open it, so he does. A Blue Beetle hops out and attaches to Jaime, transforming him into the ultimate weapon.The rest of the movie involves Jenny Kord's aunt attempting to retrieve the Beetle from Jaime and his family, with the help of a hardened soldier in a tech suit, similar to Jamie's. The villain is probably the weakest part of the movie, and her voice acting is really monotone. Her motivations are also really cliche and overused, but the way the movie plays out turns it into something unique.The movie turns into a beautiful story about family and family dynamics, and the Reyes all have incredible love for each other. In my opinion, that's where the movie succeeds the most, as the Reyes are really sweet and absolutely hilarious, especially George Lopez' Uncle Rudy. It's a breath of fresh air with some amazing action and an even more amazing sense of humor and emotion. I really recommend this movie; it's heartwarming, epic, and really, really funny. Really the only thing the movie fails at is making a legitimate motivation for the main villain other than ""money!!! Power!!! Corporate stuff!!""
Overall, it's a 9/10, would recommend :)Oh and also the main theme song is epic :)","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

For instance, Jaime Reyes is the third DC hero to carry the name Blue Beetle. It is not necessary to be familiar with the hero's previous incarnations to understand or even enjoy the movie, but it is a delight to see how much the movie is respectful to them, specially Ted Kord, his immediate predecessor and the hero I used to read in the 90's. Additionally, it is a treat to spot references to Batman, to Gotham, and the other heroes, as if it the movie truly exists within a cohesive DC Universe.If I were to pinpoint a weak spot, it would have to be the villains. Many have commented that they could have been better, and I couldn't agree more.That being said, the movie is packed with humor. Most of the jokes had me laughing, while a few made me cringe.Approach the movie expecting a hero movie with slapstick moments and you will be pleased as I was. Check out the trailer to understand the movie's tone.I wouldn't go so far to say this is the one of the greatest movies ever made, but it was certainly good enough. I walked out of the cinema feeling lighthearted and yearning for more.P.

Now the action scenes were awesome and dramatic to watch and it was very entertaining,my dad will now share what he thought. L (age 10)Blue Beetle is a solid movie but lacking a strong storyline. That said it does give a decent amount of time to character development which makes up for the well trodden story. The effects are good and the action is well paced and enjoyable. Ultimately, it's a fun Saturday night popcorn movie but it doesn't set up the new DCU world too well.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The story is unfortunately one that we have seen milion of times over and over again. Its like we already saw this movie, however, still it flows .However in my opinion it's major flaw is what the studio said is it's major selling point, that is the fact that it's the first major Latino superhero.

It took me three days to watch this movie because i fell asleep the first two days and almost slept off on the third day, rather than a DC Origin movie, this movie felt like spy kids 2.0... we all bashed ""Black Adam"" and ""Eternals"" but i can tell you for a fact that those movies are better than this one.... Black Adam made me laugh and i enjoyed the fight scenes but this one had very few and forgetful fight scenes and most of the conversation was cringe, the acting was just okay and the whole movie was predictable from the beginning to the very end! I am shocked why this movie still have a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes because it is not that good!! All in all, I really wanted to enjoy this movie and not be like most people but the movie was underwhelming and predictable... i am going to rate this one a 4/10 and i think you should watch the movie and be the judge of it.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This film just made me so upset with its sheer incompetence, I felt the need to vent with a review.The writing is egregiously lazy with no care given to character development... why would they need to? Every character is a poorly constructed copy of marginally better written ones from other films, so the writers must have assumed the audience will know them immediately. The whole script is just cobbled together from films of the same genre that had better success. People performing impossible physics, irritating screaming throughout, illogical choices made by characters to shoe-horn in story points and actions, practically plagiarized dialogue, the list of dumb goes on and on. The whole shebang felt like it was written by high school students as homework.The acting can't really be blamed for this absolute failure, though it is rather tepid all round, with Sarandon of all people being the worst. No, the blame is on the director who, without vision, ends up selling out to producers, most of whom are only concerned about the safest way to make a buck.Effects? It's a weird sensation to see so much action and be completely bored by it.DC has had one real franchise success with Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy and the rest are on a sliding scale of mediocrity. The massive budget comic book genre is dead, not unlike the massive budget sword and sandal epics of the 50's and 60's. If we're lucky, as a result of this insultingly lacklustre rubbish, a new New Wave of cinema is just around the corner.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The most appropriate comment I've seen is that this is could have been released twenty years ago. IMO, if was a stand-alone, rather than a DCU ""event"", it might have been judged more positively. The humor approaches that of the Shazam films or an average Marvel effort. Making the protagonist an ethnic successor to a Silver Age hero is hardly groundbreaking or controversial these days, and I appreciated the nods to the character's history. Yes, the villain(s) was poorly characterized and unexceptional. It's a common problem with comic book movies, that BB does not overcome.

He is not ""the melding of Ironman and Ant Man"" nor is he a smart mouth Gen Z. Blue Bettle is Ted Cord, an industrialist along the lines of Bruce Wayne, more than Tony Stark. He predates DC and was bought by DC from. Charlton Comics. Anyone who goes back to read the originals or his 1980s participation in Justice League will recognize the Watchmen character Owl who was based on Blue Beetle.Sadly, the trend in comics today is to present flawed people with powers rather than Heroes a reader can aspire to. This trend is given a nitro-burst in Hollywood where many supers are actually criminals such as Deadpool, Venom, Black Adam, Joker, Ant Man. It is part of the culture that wants to redefine (read obliterate) the notion of Hero under the guise of ""humanizing"" the character. To paraphrase The Incredibles (a truly underrated story), if no one is special, then everyone is.So it comes as no surprise that this version of Blue Beetle fails, because it offers nothing to lift the spirit of the viewer, nothing they can take with them as they leave the theater. Bruce Wayne comes out of the theater with his parents, having just seen Zorro, only to have them murdered. He idolizes the HERO he saw in Zorro and dedicates his life to fighting crime so no other child has to lose his parents. He is the Dark Knight who does not kill...until the 1980s when. Tim Burton gets his hands on him and devolves the character.You will probably enjoy Blue Beetle as the empty shell, devoid of any human value other than mindless entertainment. Sadly, we could do so much more.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

The criminal who suddenly became good just by remembering moments from his family, he himself said that it was his feeling of pity for his family that made him weak, and he also did it. Moreover, the villain loses when he has great power, which is really strange. Jennifer's character also looks ""pretentious"", too superior even though she can't do anything big.

How does something that can change the world, have unlimited power, now in the hands of an evil woman who has spent billions towards harnessing its powers, literally be sitting on a table to be stolen? Something written that simple and ridiculous let's you know what to expect the rest of the way. Cliche characters, crazy uncle, struggling family, story flaw after story flaw. I am encouraged however, it seems DC visually went for a Marvel look. I believe the Meta Score is 6.1/10. In academic terms that a 61% which is a D- That seems appropriate. Not quite an F, but close.

Following the origins of one Jaime Reyes, Xolo Mariduena, as he returns from Gotham City law school to find his family is happy to see him but their own current financial & spiritual straits are up in the air as his dad, Damian Alcazar, is recovering from a heart attack & the family manse is about to be sold from out from under them by the prevalent evil mega-corporation Kord Industries in Palmera City but meeting nice w/the niece, Bruna Marquezine, of its owner, Oscar winner Susan Sarandon, promises Mariduena a job after he came to her defense at their home (he & his sister, Belissa Escobedo, were working as part of the cleaning staff got canned) but when he shows up at Kord HQ he instead gets handed a burger box w/a scarab which he takes home. Showing it off to his family & getting too close to it, causes the object to merge violently into Mariduena's body forming a Guyver like figure which communicates w/him via an internal AI (voiced by singer Becky G) which takes the lead in his use of the suit, since they haven't been fully integrated w/each other. Pissed since she wants to incorporate the tech into battle suits of her own, Sarandon sends out her henchman, Raoul Trujillo (who I remember from Scanners II) to take Mariduena down using any means to his disposal, even going after his family, which results in tragic consequences. Will Mariduena step up & save the day? Fun through & through w/a healthy foothold in the Latin world will make this story, which is very familiar, come alive which unfortunately due to Warner Bros. Ham-fisted handling of their disavowal of the previous DC output continues to paint audiences perceptions if they should venture out to cinemas to watch these things since their emotional investment can be spent elsewhere which is a shame since this film could've done w/Latin fans what Black Panther did for African American ones. Also starring Elpidia Carrillo as Mariduena's mom, Oscar nominee Adriana Barrazza as his grandmom, Harvey Guillen from What We Do in the Shadows as a techie & George Lopez as the crazy uncle of the family who steals every scene he's in.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

The movie follows the standard origin story that we have seen so mantener times before:A protagonist who is trying to live as best as he can his ordinary and mediocre life, is suddenly in contact with a ""special thing created by evil people"" that accidentally gives him superhero powers that he didn't ask for.He struggles to control those powers, causing him to be in uncomfortable situations that cause him to wanna give up his powers and go back to his ordinary life.But when the evil people begin threatening everyone he loves in order to get the powers he has, he is forced to do everything he can to save them, and make sure that those ""evil people"" never get those powers that could be used to destroy the world.As you can see, this is not exactly what one w wouldn't call original stuff. Can it get more generic than this plot after 15 years of superhero movies?The protagonists in this movie doesn't seem o have any agency or his own, he is pretty much nothing without his suit which does all the cool stuff for him, and also he is nothing without his family who saves him so many times.The antagonists and their motivation is also super generic and so dated at this point:""Oh wow, another movie where the entire world is at stake if the wrong hands get the magical stuff that gave him powers... Man I really wonder if this time the world is going to end"". ""Who knows maybe this time it will"".This is not a movie i would recommend watching in the theatre, simply because it is not really a fresh story. It doesn't really add anything new to the genre.The jokes and humour is something that i felt coming every single time because the set ups for the jokes are so obvious, as we have seen them in countless of other marvel movies before.I don't know man. It's the kind of movie that only a kid who has never seen any superhero movie before might enjoy. If you've only watch two or three superhero movies you might think it's great. But for those who have been watching superhero movies for a while this is just more of the same thing.It's like watching a NSFW video on the internet for the hundred time.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

This is cute-ish, and if this movie had came out 25 years ago we would probably be pretty happy with it. But this is a C-movie, and it does not cut it today, and being cute is not enough to win over viewers.I have not liked a single one of the DC movies. Not even one. A couple of them have been watchable if you have had a few, and this is in that same general area of ""entertainment"". If you'd been gobbling down a 6-pack and a couple of shots, and you have a soft spot for cheesy cliche 1990s superhero movies than you might enjoy this. If you want quality, originality, good writing, good CGi and other things that make a good movie than this is not for you.There are a few cool moments, a few laughs, a couple of scenes which is good, and the music score is pretty nice. But other than that this is simple, perhaps something cute, something old-timey flashback but also so cliche so you know what is going to happen from start to finish, but yea, so what? You have seen this a million times, why not a million and one time? You could actually do worse. So if you are a big fan of the character, you might even find this to be good or great.I give this a very generous 4/10. Which I believe is the second highest I have given to the DC movies. And the reason is I do not think I wasted my money. Despite the score this is endearing and cute and sort of fun. But anyone claiming this is a good movie is delusional. This does not suck, but it does stink and you should be aware.","26 out of 66 found this helpful.

Boy oh boy, was I wrong, I seriously hope going forward that this is not the new baseline going forward. Blue Beetle felt possibly the closest thing I have seen to a slightly higher budget CW show but instead of evenly spreading its budget to everything equally they just spent most of it on the suit. I would easily rate this movie a star but the two extras are for the suit and Xolo, whom with a better script would definitely have been better. The jokes do not land whatsoever, in fact I swear I heard some of them done in other movies before, to call the story basic is too kind - it is literally the same story audiences have seen a hundred times, within the first 15 minutes you can practically predict where the entire plot is going to end up and somehow this movie makes it feel even more cheap. Not a great start to all of this, hope they keep the actor but do something completely different going forward.","15 out of 36 found this helpful.

I honnestly hope you guys go watch it.","7 out of 28 found this helpful.

Totally predictable. May be fine for kids who would be happy to see some colours here and there otherwise this movie has nothing to offer for anyone who is looking to spend some good time. There is no sense in this movie plot. Unnecessary drama, and needlessly prolonged scenes. DC could use some good writers and directors who can present the movie in somewhat better way. I never thought that I would be disappointed this much by any movie.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

You opened it, understood that it was indeed something important despite the box's unassuming appearance, and went ahead to play around with it anyway.

Blue beetle has the visual quality of the Power Rangers series from the 90's. The Special FX are so lame, it's ridiculous. The storyline is extremely predictable. The acting is terrible. My guess is, that it is more the director fault considering that Xolo Mariduña is pretty good in Cobra Kai, and I have great respect for Susan Sarandon, but it is sad to end glorious a carrer like this.

This film, which shall remain unnamed to protect the guilty, somehow manages to squander a promising premise and a star-studded cast, turning what could have been a thrilling adventure into a bewildering slog through nonsensical plot twists and wooden dialogue.From the very first scene, it's clear that the director was more interested in flashy, incoherent action sequences than in any form of storytelling coherence. Characters are introduced and then forgotten, plot points are raised and then abandoned, and the viewer is left to wonder if perhaps the screenplay was written by a particularly unimaginative algorithm.The dialogue, if it can be called that, oscillates between painfully clichéd and laughably pretentious. It's as if the writers threw every movie trope they could think of into a blender, hoping the result would be palatable. Spoiler alert: it was not. The performances, too, range from the inexplicably over-the-top to the utterly lifeless, as if the cast collectively realized halfway through filming that their talents were being wasted on this cinematic shipwreck.Visually, the movie is a mess of CGI that looks like it was outsourced to the lowest bidder, resulting in special effects that would have been laughed off the screen a decade ago. Instead of immersing the audience in a fantastical world, it serves only to remind them of the film's utter lack of substance or originality.In conclusion, this film is a masterclass in how not to make a movie. It's a bewildering, joyless affair that leaves you feeling like you've lost two hours of your life you'll never get back. In a world bursting with cinematic talent and creativity, it's a stark reminder that, yes, they can indeed make them like they used to-and sometimes, that's exactly the problem.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The acting is solid pretty much all round, especially of the Reyes family. They have great chemistry and bounce off each for funny moments and heartfelt moments. The action is decent and the music choices are great. I also think the movie is well paced and at no time didn't I think it dragged.Only down points I'd say are: the villain is basic and not really a villain when comparing to other DC films and the plot is predictable.Overall though a very fun and enjoyable movie experience.

While it's great to have the world's first Hispanic super-hero, it's a shame it has to arrive via this s#!t film.From charmless characters to a convoluted storyline, the whole film just drags.The lead actor - Xolo - is completely uninspiring. Bruna completely lacks a personality. The sister comes across as a complete jerk. The others have the standard Hollywood superhero nothingness, just one dimensional fillers. Presumably they thought that the heavy emphasis on family etc would fill in the gaps, but yeah nah. Didn't at all.The director tries to infuse lots of synth music, but the film never pulls it off right. The plot is both standard and completely sucks. There's nothing new here, folks.Superhero movies saturate the cinemas, and while Marvel has a good run, the DCEU is trying to get started a decade too late. James Gunn might make okay movies, but I doubt he's up to the challenge that rebooting the DCEU will take.Skip it. You won't regret it.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Blue Beetle is a refreshing reminder of why we fell in love with comic book films in the first place. Yes, it is a blend of Iron Man (the suit & powers), Spider-Man (the character), and Ms Marvel (the family dynamic)... but it just works so well. It's a little too silly and cringe at times with a somewhat cliche story, but it's just so charming and has so much heart you can't help but enjoy it!

Emphasis on just about.It really should be better than it is since it has plenty of elements that ought to add up to a fun super hero caper. The focus is on a whole family rather than yet another lone outsider, it puts a different culture front and centre and it leans (or at least tries to) into the bright and silly side of the genre. Unfortunately so many parts of the movie feel like they've been given the absolute minimal effort.The story sees Jamie Reyes return to his home city after graduating law school to find out his family are facing eviction. He takes a job with his sister at the mansion of an industrial CEO and promptly gets them both fired but ends up in possession of ""The Scarab"", an alien super weapon that is basically a sentient Iron Man suit. Naturally the evil corporation the suit was liberated from want it back and conflict ensues.Pretty much every part of the plot is as by the numbers as you can imagine. Evil corporation treading all over the little guy? Check. Said corporation's villainous goal is create an army of super soldiers? Check. Bad guy that's a colour swapped version of the main character? Check. Day saved by the power of family/friendship? Check. Its all here and not delivered with anywhere near enough finesse to excuse the cookie cutter nature of proceedings. The same ""it'll do"" approach is applied to dialogue and even the special effects, with jokes that pretty much never land and wildly inconsistent CGI.The acting ranges from not bad to, well, bad. At one end of the scale is Xolo Mariduena who despite having crumbs to work with in terms of character development manages to inject enough likability into Jamie that you don't want to see him get smeared across the floor, even with the insipid dialogue between him and the B-tech Friday AI that powers the Beetle suit. On the other end of the scale is a career low performance from Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord. I'm not sure if she was asked to chew scenery but decided to try and play it more sinister or was told to be intimidating but decided to camp it up. Either way she falls completely flat somewhere between the two. Maybe she read the final script and simply couldn't be bothered. It's a pity since, with a bit fleshing out, her character could have been interesting given she has every right to feel scorned. As it stands the message from her character arc seems to be patriarchy is...good?The only thing saving Blue Beetle from the absolute dregs of the genre is the Reyes family. None of them are particularly complex but they are all enjoyable and give off a genuine sense of family togetherness that adds some heart to proceedings. They mostly all get a moment to shine but you feel the best version of this film would have found a way to put them more front and centre. There is one joke/twist involving the grandmother that just doesn't work at all. I can imagine the film makers pictured the audience rolling in the aisles but staring in bemusement is the more likely outcome.It really feels like Blue Beetle needed taking back to drawing board and rebuilt one more time but the studio just wanted to toss it out there so they could get on with starting their whole universe afresh.4 successful revolutions started by geriatric matriarchs out of 10.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

While this latest DC offering does have some strong elements going for it, most of them revolving around the story's prominent Mexican-American representation, there's nothing inventive, new, or creative to be found within the actual story or it's mechanics. Blue Beetle is a boilerplate film welded together out of useable spare parts lifted from more successful and entertaining superhero films. Instead of redefining a genre and imbuing it with new life via a vibrant cultural backbone, Blue Beetle only further enhances the feelings of growing superhero fatigue. Let's start with the handful of things that work well in Blue Beetle, beginning and almost ending with the rich family dynamic that gives the film all of it's heart.The ""best"" moments in Blue Beetle come whenever the film simply lets the family members be themselves, the worst part that the drama does not exists, there was tons of Español musics. It does not larger cogs in a big budget, effects laden machine. This film is as generic as they come, we have seen it all before and done a lot better. The script could have easily been created by A. I. that watched a thousand hours of superhero films! Every detail of the adventure and backstory in Blue Beetle has been cobbled together from spare parts left over from Man of Steel, The Flash, every Batman film, every Spider-Man film (someone might as well just say ""with great power comes great responsibility"" here and just make it more obvious), Iron Man, Shazam, and Ant-Man.Blue Beetle is frustrating and forgettable because the potential for something better is evident, but it settles for the path most travelled instead. In my honest opinion, I don't think this film stands a chance at the box office, it reeks of writing by committee and corporate meddling. Blue Beetle isn't one of the worst films of the year, but it's absolutely one of the most disappointingly average ones.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

"2","/10","From the unoriginal plot, to the kindergarten level dialogue, to the worst CGI I've seen since the early 2010's, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9292616/?ref_=tt_urv","lucaspursell","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44217362/?ref_=tt_urv","29 August 2023","By default, I have always held a large amount of bias when it comes to movie adaptations of DC characters versus marvel. From an early age, I became obsessed with batman and teen titans --by the time I could read, I was immersed in the comic book universe of D. C. Although I also loved Spiderman and wolverine growing up, D. C would always be ahead of marvel in my eyes, for the place it held in my heart.In 2008, the Dark Knight became a cinematic masterpiece, somehow making it to the top 5 on the IMDB top 250 while raking in several Oscar nominations. While 2008 marked the peak of D. C., I immensely believe this movie marks the end in 2023. There is no coming back from a movie this horrendous.I guess I will begin with the comedic aspect of this movie, since it constantly makes attempts to be funny even in its darker moments. George Lopez is often the source of this movies comic relief, as he is often used throughout the movie to rake in cheap laughs from the audience.I'm not sure if there are any stand up comedy fans reading this review, but the jokes are very similar to Brendan Schaub's comedy special, The Gringo Papi. Lots of physical, awkward comedy that doesn't hit, along with cheap, corny jokes about the Latin American culture.The acting was just awful. The main character, who I had not seen in any major motion picture prior despite being a big movie buff, was just okay. He did not steal the show nor did he prove to be a strong lead. His acting wasn't terrible and he did prove to have some chemistry with the movies main love interest, which felt real at times, but who wouldn't in his situation.George Lopez was over the top per usual, but was easily the best actor in the film alongside Susan Sarandon, who did well as the movies antagonist.The worst actress of the film was the young woman who played the sister of Jamie Reyes. How she managed to land a role of this caliber is a testament to the bad casting of D. C, something they can learn a thing or two from Marvel. Her acting was so over the top and elementary, it reminded you that you were watching a movie even during intense scenes that should have the audience immersed in the magic of film.Overall, the acting was very bad. 3/10 at most. The acting was a huge downgrade from The Flash movie that came out just a month prior. While Ezra Miller has his controversies outside the big screen, him and Michael Keaton are academy level actors that stole the show. The acting in this movie, in contrast, was elementary, dull, and over the top.The special effects were terrible. 1/10 to put a rating on it. I honestly wonder how they managed to pull off this poor of CGI with this large of a budget.Originality was easily a 0/10. This is the worst superhero movie of all time in this category. Absolutely nothing about this movie is original besides the Latin aspect. This movie is literally a much worse version of iron man combined with venom. I'm sure I don't even have to go into detail to prove this point.Plot was a 2/10. I have no idea how I stayed awake for this nonsense. The writers for the DCU need to go back to the drawing board and really figure out how they will not allow this to happen again. I hate to keep comparing this to The Flash movie, but that plot was at least somewhat interesting.1/10 for the script. Dialogue was....well, some things are better left unsaid. Whoever wrote this script was likely 16. Otherwise, I have no clue how the people who wrote this script can drive cars and perform other day-to-day functions that regular adults perform.Lastly, I will end this review on a more positive note. The movie did pass one category in my book, which is the romance between the lead actor and actress. They seemingly had good chemistry on screen that felt real to the audience. Throughout the movie, you find yourself rooting for the main character to get the girl. Even though their relationship was very corny, it was one of the few aspects of this movie that wasn't mediocre. After all, romances in films are often a bit corny.The family also had chemistry, as it felt like a real family. The relationships between on screen-characters were good. As the audience, you can tell this is a cast that likely gets along well off-screen.Moreover, The chemistry between characters gets a solid 5/10 in my book which is still a failing grade, but brings this movie to about a 2/10 instead of a 0 which is what I would have given it otherwise.Throughout the review, I made mention of many other superhero movies and often drew comparisons to other superhero movie universes. One thing I would like to make clear, is that putting superhero movies aside, this is one of the worst MOVIES period, I have ever seen. MOVIES... Not just superhero movies.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Rich bad family trying to monopolize an army to gain power. Only to be taken down by some family and a niece with the help of the scare of course. Now I've never heard of the blue beetle before so this world is all new to me, coming from fresh eyes.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am all up for an hispanic hero, but to try and make humour of their family culture and turn the family into a charictature of stereotype. Why not just focus on the main character. We do not need to know that he is living in poverty, it is just so paint by numbers. I believe if this came out in the 90s it would of been a blockbuster. Nothing in this feels original. It is like Venom, but in neon pink and blue. More of the same. I do not want more of the same any more. The rest of the world does not want more of the same. So why do they serve us this?

Basically we have very high expectations and, as it happens, that leads often to disappointment.Imagine, if you will, that you could show this film in 2003 for instance. The outcome would have been very different, it would have been a smash hit, a record breaker, even with the imperfections that are so obvious to us today.Don't get me wrong, this film isn't rubbish... it's just a bit too predictable and the writing is a bit, umm, how do you say that in the USA?

I also think this film done so good because it wasn't hyped up as much as the other films like the Flash it was so hyped up we expected so much but was let down with blue beetle we weren't as hyped we didn't expect much of it so it done a lot better.","6 out of 24 found this helpful.

Like most movies now, special affects are good, but is destroyed by crappy story line...

An enjoyable movie that doesn't try too hard to be anything other than a fun story with some humor and some heart. The villain is lacking - with dialogue and performance, but it gets the job done. I'm excited to see blue beetle in the future dc universe and excited for the Latino stories it can tell. A refreshing fun summer movie that i think should be given a fair chance.

The SPACE SHUTTLE will do that, travelling at 27,000 km/h on reentry, but NOT a person in freefall (just ask any parachutist).So expect a fun story as he comes to terms with his capabilities, and the that idea he's stuck with it, but expect several periods of ""just ignore that bit "" or it'll drive you to distraction.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I like all three iterations of Blue Beetle. The lead actor was good, but he seemed to be acting in a different movie than the members of his family. In a few scenes, they acted like they were all on meth. I find their behavior less believable than a guy getting possessed by a beetle alien. I like George Lopez, but his character couldn't have been a bigger stereotype unless he was running around in a bee costume for the whole move. It's also funny that they make a point about Jaime not wanting to kill anyone, because he was the only character that had any issue with it, whatsoever; even Ted Kord carried a goddamn gatling gun around with him in his incredibly user-friendly arsenal. The antagonist was basically Obadiah Stane split into two people. I contemplated whether I was giving away any spoilers, but I think that's almost impossible if you watch it for five minutes.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It promised to be good. Then...is this trying to be an homage to Mexican Americans? Trying to be do for Latino's what others did for the Asian community? It looks the movie is written by Chatgpt, with too much over the top Mexican clichés. I'm not Mexican but I'm what people like to classify as Latino based on my place of birth, and I felt that this movie tries to put all Latino's clichés on the same box. Everything is predictable, and the story is just childish. I could give it 1 for rating, but I don't want to be too mean. Susan Sarandon is the white token on this movie, which I also feel bad for having such a great actress doing such a bad role. I feel that, if the writers were not so focused on trying to make the film so Mexican American, the movie could have gone on a different and better direction. It doesn't connect the dots. Here is the take away of the movie: Mexican American are hard workers who are treated as secondary citizens, no matter how well educated they are. Family is the most important thing to them, they always have a crazy uncle that does stupid things but they are always there for the family. Oh, granny's are bad ass when it comes to protecting the family. Bottom line, its a movie for American Mexicans. The question is, do they feel it's a good movie for them? The FXs are great though...","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Also the terrible graphics in 1978's Superman are better than the graphics in this movie. It clearly lags behind the works of graphic artists of other studios.In general, you can't blame dc for using bad graphics in other comics, but here they obviously used newbies or fixed it on fiverr. :)

The script from start to finishis terrible and tries to imitate other Superhero Movies, The family of the ""Hero"" is stupid, loud and completely irresponsible, And we could already see it in the part where they not only pressed him to openthe box but also played with the alien object and threw it to each other. The worst character in the movie besides Jaime himself, Who only God knows why he was chosen as the host by the Beetle, Is hissister Milagro who has no sense of responsibility, Maturity or logic, And made all the possible mistakes. Not to mention the villain who is one of the worst villains I have ever seen, Although the pacifist""Hero"" who is afraid to hurt the villain, And constantly apologizes like a girl with cuckoos for fighting him, Is no less worse than him. And we haven't even talked about the dialogues and the unfunny jokesthroughout the film, Which I stopped dozens of times due to nervousness about the script .In short, This is a bad movie and a waste of more than two hours of time.

The film focuses on Jamie and his life after he gets ""possessed"" by a blue scarab. However this movie has two main flaws that really make it a mid tier movie.The movie overall is honestly not horrible. It is a very middle ground movie, however it falls flat firstly, because it just follows the same plot lines and cliches of other super hero movies. The movie revolves around the theme of family and how it is the true power, and it lasts forever. This is cool and all, however it has just been used so many times. This movies theme feels almost like a copy and paste of Shazam, with just a rewrite.I'm not saying this movie isn't enjoyable though. The cinematography is very enticing. The suits, espically Blue Beetle's is very well done. The fighting scenes and the scenes in general were all around pretty good. It was very enjoyable, however the second flaw of the movie is that the acting is bad from almost the entire cast. The acting really just feels forced and cheesy and it isn't good. It falls flat espically from Mariduena. His character, Jessie is just so basic it hurts. It feels like too much of a classic hero troupe. Innocent, kind, loving, awkward. It's really just so cliche and it doesn't fall together well at all. Making it hard to watch at parts.However in conclusion the movie was entertaining and overall not horrible. Sure not great but it is a fun watch for families, probably with more adult kids, and overall is not a bad super hero movie, just middle ground and cliche.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

When everyone in the movie is cast as some sort of hero, it really takes away from the gravitas of the one super hero. What's the need for the super hero, if everyone can defeat the enemy.This movie is slow at the start, slow in the middle, and a failure in the end. The story is non-impactful to the viewer. It's impossible to become emotionally invested in the main characters, because every character is treated the same. Basically, it's the idealist version of a communist hero movie, everyone is equal, and the only thing special about the title character is some mechanical/AI enhancements. But, without everyone else, he could never have won the battle, because he is less special than everyone else, despite being the chosen one. Boring, unimaginative and cliche.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sure that would be fine enough except this is the most cartonish annoying family you will see in a while.This movie has two actors that are ok and that is Xolo (protagonist) and Susan Sarandon (antogonist). Susan really is killing it and they should base much more of the movie on her.Javiers (Xolo) family is as I mentioned before just like annoying stereotypical personalities on speed. Outside the family is Bruna (Jenny Kord) so unbelivable in any kind of position in the Kord company. She just does a terrible performance in this role.The bug suit is kind of cool in the beginning but you loose interest in that in like five minutes. We have seen similair suits before.Many complain on the latest hero movies like Flash, Quantumania and so on. But they are still ok movies. This is just not that... and this character will not be in any other movie I hope.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The antagonist was pretty well developed too but his side of story was shown a bit less or in a jiff, couldn't really get connected. The background score is pretty cool and matches up with the scenes perfectly in sync. Overall, the movie deserves some love, you can watch it with your family and friends and have a good time. A new beginning to the DC universe.P.s.

Alas, it's really bad. There are some cheap laughs and ok action. Ultimately, the story takes too long to unfold, relies on an overly-bad ""bad guy,"" and, at times, laughs at rather than with Latino culture. It's unfortunate since the character has a rich history and this rebirth could have been interesting. Kids under 8 or 9 will appreciate it, especially the bits of potty and fart humor, but the film wastes good talent and seends the Blue Beetle character back to the file cabinet where it previously languished. Too bad.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This film reminded me why I love superhero films, it had cool fights and powers, good characters, and most importantly a lot of heart behind it.The main character was likeable and relatable, I like that this film is about a struggling Mexican family, and brought a different perspective to most other superhero films I've seen. One big thing I liked about the film is the focus on family, and how they love and look after each other. I really liked Jaime's sister, she was funny (even if she was slightly annoying a couple of times), I thought she'd be my favourite family member, but actually Jaime's grandma was my favourite (I won't say why, but if you watch it you'll know what I mean!). I thought Jenny was a very good character, well-defined personality, good heart, and very skilled - not ""just"" a love interest for the main character.The villain was also very good, in that you love to hate her and hope she gets her comeuppance. And at least one person working for the villain also gets character development which was really nice to see.The film had good emotional moments, I cried at one point and there were other times that moved me. The blue beetle suit was great and we also get to see some other gadgets and things which I thought were really cool.I didn't know anything about Blue Beetle before watching the trailer for this film, but I saw it with someone who knew more about Blue Beetle and he thought they adapted it well.As I said before, I love the heart behind the film and the different perspectives that it offered, as well as the classic elements it has that contribute to a good superhero film. I really liked it and can't wait to see more of Blue Beetle in the future!","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sadly the one point that I found disappointing was Ms Sarandon didn't quite fit the role. Otherwise, the family as part of the story line is brilliant. And I have to say why not have more of that. It makes the film more relateable for younger crowds and there are some great moments to the family scenes.Some of the fight scenes were a little OTT but really it's a superhero action movie.. I want that OTT because it's fun..I don't need to see blood and gore in slow mo..I would have scored this film higher but for a few little slips in the continuity and story line.. 8 is the second highest I score a film..like I said at the start - watch this film and make up your own mind.

The story props up blue beetle as a poor but smart kid who's unlucky in life. It's a cliched but good theme, but it doesn't work. I have no motivation to root for the hero to win. All the special effects and stellar cast makes this another dc movie where they pumped all the money into everything, except the story.Every few minutes, I kept remembering all the old DC animated series and movies like Justice league, Batman's tv series and movies. All of them were low budget shows with very few famous celebrities involved, but they packed a punch. I was happy every time Superman punched Doomsday or Batman foiled scarecrow's plans. I wanted them to win. Justice League's Blue Beetle (the animated series) was a fun addition and evolved as a hero of his own right.It's disappointing to see such great characters reduced to boring puppets of corporate greed.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Boy gets super powers through weird incident. First time super power sequence. Fights crime. Gets tossed by the baddy. Big emotional thing happens. Boy hits bottom. Through power of emotions Boy defeats BBG.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

His sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) gets a cleaning job for him at the mansion of the wealthy Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). However, they are both fired by Victoria when Jaime interferes in a discussion between Victoria and her niece Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine). When Jaime is leaving the house, Jenny asks him to look for her in the Kord Tower for a job opportunity. On the next morning, Jenny learns that her aunt is using an ancient alien Scarab to develop powerful weapons and she steals the artifact. Meanwhile, Jaime is looking for her to get a job, and she uses him to leave the Tower with the scarab hidden in a burger to-go box. His curious Mexican family opens the box and Jaime becomes the host of the alien scarab and they fuse in a powerful weapon. Jaime looks for Jenny to have explanations but he turns into the Blue Beetle. She tells him that they have to remove the device as soon as possible; otherwise, the fusion will be permanent.I had expectations to see ""Blue Beatle"" mainly because of the Brazilian actress Bruna Marquezine in a lead role. However, the film is a great disappointment, with a terrible and long screenplay about another unknown superhero. The silly and ridiculous Mexican family spoils the whole movie with their foolish behavior. It is annoying to hear and see them, and it seems to be a critic to the behavior of Mexican families in particular, and Latin families in general, in a prejudicial view of the author. The humor does not work and it is unfunny actually. And based on the cliffhanger in the credits, it seems that the productors intend to make a sequel. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Besouro Azul"" (""Blue Beetle"")","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

There is a mystic element plus alien element that makes for an unusual mix in a comic book and maybe I had a head start with the story, so I can more easily appreciate the unique character. Also, I'm old enough to just let go when comic stories get crazy. Maybe some of the reviewers could stand to go back and watch the movie again, maybe without mentioning it to any of their friends who hated it. I don't know.

It's more than obvious that production lacked anyone from a Mexican background. How Adriana Barraza and George Lopez decided this was a good idea is beyond me.

An alien scarab beetle chooses Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the recent college graduate with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle.The film was directed by Angel Manuel Soto, and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.THINGS I LIKED:
I first noticed Xolo Mariduena in the Netflix TV show Cobra Kai where he does a fantastic job. He's excellent in this role and has a very bright future. I'm so happy for him and for his success. His character features a scrappy, naïve element to the Superhero genre, much like Spider-Man has done for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Other cast members include Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon, comedian George Lopez, Harvey Guillen, Belissa Escobedo, Adriana Barraza, Damian Alcazar, Becky G, Elpidia Carillo, Bruna Marquezine, and Raoul Max Trujillo. They all do a great job by clearly defining distinct characters. The grandma character is awesome and hilarious.DC Studios CEO James Gunn ultimately decided that the Blue Beetle character would be disconnected from the DC Universe. That being said, we see the name ""Lexcorp"" on a tower from the Superman movies. We also see Jaime wearing a Gotham Law hoodie from the Batman movies.Final Fantasy video game fans will get a kick out of the scene when Jaime creates the Buster Sword as his weapon of choice.We're introduced to Mexican culture. The Latino population will love seeing one of their own featured as a superhero! One of the Hispanic characters dies, something that the DC studio pushed for in order to make it more emotional. Angel Manuel Soto didn't want to do that but later saw it as an opportunity to share how the Mexican culture views death.Family is at the heart of this movie. It's what gives the film both a soul and humor.Humor has been one of the magical elements to the success of Marvel movies and where DC movies have failed, for the most part. This movie taps into the natural humor of a Mexican family and gives it all of the charm DC needed to level up to Marvel.The town of Palmera City is fictitious, much like Gotham City.Fun fact #1: Roberto Gomez, son of the original Chapulin actor Roberto Gomez Bolanos voices a radio transmission in this movie.The film has a lot of entertaining Easter eggs to look for. For example, in Spanish, we hear someone announce on the TV that ""Bruce Wayne Bought Twitter."" Ha ha I remember seeing ""Sabado Gigante"" on TV when I sailed through the channels. In one scene in this movie, we see it playing on the TV in the background.This is the 14th movie in the DC Extended Universe.One element that I really loved was when the Blue Beetle is able to truly understand a bad guy's unique perspective. Hurt people hurt. If only we all took the time to understand, rather than judge and react without the full story.Keep watching during the rolling credits for another scene.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Because of Xolo Mariduena's work in Cobra Kai, we know that he has some serious karate skills, yet they were, sadly, underutilized in this movie. His physicality and skills could have been a real highlight. He's not much of a superhero throughout most of the movie, but just bumbles his way through fights and, most of the time, gets beat up or tries to run away.So much CGI.So much screaming.The villain isn't very compelling.It's extremely cliched with wooden dialogue.Very predictable.Sometimes, the Blue Beetle suit's robot capabilities work but other times it's silent and doesn't seem to help. I didn't understand the inconsistencies.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
A lot of Spanish is spoken with subtitles.There is a surprising amount of profanity in English and Spanish.Superhero fighting
Lots of destruction
Talk of a parent who died in the past
Someone in the family dies a sad, unexpected death.Some blood splatters.We see a flashback of a child kidnapping.Bug farts.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

To help his family, he looks for a job, which he tries to find at the wealthy company Kord Industries. Here he comes into contact with Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), who asks him to help her smuggle something out of the company.What Jaime smuggles out turns out to be an alien scarab, which Jaime chooses as a symbiotic host. This is how Jaime turns into the Blue Beetle. Now he must fight Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the boss of Ford Industries, who wanted to use the scarab for her own purpose. To counter the scarab, they try to threaten Jaime and his family, so Jaime as Blue Beetle now has to try to protect his family.This movie was first going to be released on the HBO Max streaming service, but they later decided to release the movie in cinemas anyway. It was also unclear whether this film still belongs to the old DC Extended Universe film series, or at least as the start of the new DC Universe film series, this film series would start. James Gunn, the new CEO of the DC film series, was also growing past this himself at first, but eventually decided that the film would meet as the first film of his new DC film series, because he still wanted to use the character of Blue Beetle at the front of this film series. Despite meeting then anyway for this new movie series, the movie remains much of a standalone with no real further references to other DC movies to come in the future. James Gunn can still remember that.Despite the uncertainty of which film series the film belongs to, the film itself remains a standard, standard superhero film, which does not bring much uniqueness. The movie is good about a Latino superhero, who carries this culture with him. This is something unique for a superhero movie.Furthermore, the film seems to copy more superhero moments from other superhero films. For connoisseurs of this kind of film, the film can come across as a bit unoriginal and it remains on a predictable side without creating real tension.The visual effects are also on the mediocre side with more of the quality you expect to see on a streaming service, which was also the idea for this film. For example, some of the effects appear less spread out.Xolo Maridueña tries to be the main character for as many days as possible, but this is sometimes made difficult for him by the standard quality of the film. Still, just as if he meets the early seasons of the TV series Cobra Kai, he knows how to portray a character that you as a viewer care about. Just like with Cobra Kai when the focus shifts to several different characters, he falls more into the background. Together with the castles, which his other relatives play, they still come across as a family with a Latino culture. Sometimes they just often try to do unnecessary things, while this is not always necessary. The villains in the film also come across as a bit standard as cliché villains from a superhero movie, who have no real good reasons for their evil plans.","8 out of 23 found this helpful.

I still gave it an 8/10, because it had a great story, great fight scenes, amazing comedy, and perfect dc references. Why I found it average though, was because it had too much Mexican dialogue, and jokes, and it took too long for anything exciting to happen. For most of it, I thought this is worse then quantamania, but the last hour made me change my mind. And I didn't hate quantamania, it's just it was very mid, and it was the worst superhero movie I had seen in a while. This one seems like more of a kids movie, I have to admit I am a kid myself, but I watched it with my friends, and they loved it. However all of these reviews I just read, hated it. We also came across a little boy with his Mum, and he gave it a 10/10, but his mum gave it an 8.

The company that owns the scarab, Kord Industries, is a world leader in technology, but it's easier to break into than a coffee shop. Overall, this movie is a mess.One of the biggest problems with the movie is the writing. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predictable.

The film has a few good jokes, the CGI is not too overused, the world building of Palmera city is great & (most) of the fight scenes are pretty entertaining.However the film has a pace that absolutely crawls, it's charterers range from tolerable to unbearably obnoxious and the actually good actors, like Harvey Guillén are shunted to the side to make way for bland love interests and quippy comic relief characters.The films central family has two interesting & fun characters and the rest make me want to drink antifreeze, it became a genuine pain to pay attention to the film, because every single sodding scene has one of his family members doing an oh-so-funny scream.But I think this movies primary sin is how unremarkable it is.

So predictable and cringey, very dull movie, I feel sorry for Susan Sarandon. Trying to copy Marvel by merging Iron Man, Spider-man, War Machine etc. And by copying end credits scenes. I mean cmon, if you're not striving to be original, why do you do it? The story was dull, too inclusive (another outsider getting its powers from an alien source and is now a superhero who at first harms others and himself. The script was lousy, with lousy dad jokes and forced comedy. Leave the superhero filmmaking to the pros at Marvel.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's sad when the animation version outshines live action. The movie itself was mildly entertaining, and hey, who keeps giving Susan Sarandon jobs???? She should be out trolling for Trump. See where she was dropped by her Management Agency for things she recently said, pitiful. If this is the best Hollywood can come up with, maybe they should have stayed out on strike.

I think the whole cast was a great mix. It's gonna be interesting to see when they mix blue beetle with the Batman and Superman series coming up. I think it's going to be a good Spider-Man type of mix whenever they make the universe much bigger. It's a good start. It was lighthearted and funny, catchy kind of suspenseful. I realize that most people probably won't enjoy it because of the Hispanic cast, but it was a good mix. You can't take this movie too.

Unfortunately it doesnt live up to the hype and in several cases in sinks to much lower levels than expected.Not sure if its because of the times or what but I have lived ina heavily populated mexican area in SoCal for the last 20 years and most mexicans dont have a bad taste for America. Many are greatful for the opportunities and the life they have been able to build since moving here. Yet this movie portrays a dislike for the country and I have to believe its jumping on the train of ""America bad to foriegners"" narrative. Its sad to see as I Know a great deal of people who are fron outside this country that have real love and respect for what this nation representsIf its not the several disses towards the nation its the obnoxious sister that really drags down this movie. I also dont understand why all the superhero movies make the main character a clueless genius. Almost ever superhero movie in recent memory stars with a completely clueless character who at the same time is a genius and also has this witty side to them so they always have some quick comrback leaning on the comedic side. Most of it wasn't funny as is with most superhero movies.I could have predicted how this movie would play out which means I could have watched it in my heard rather than buying a ticket to see it. I honestly just want the superhero films to stop at this point. The industry has been over saturated with these films and they all just appear to be carbon copies of each other.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Good redemption plot as the story builds for one of the villains, well written and directed. Nothing questionable or non family friendly, violence is mild and not too over the top. No nudity, or sex whatsoever. Good clean fun for all. Great CGI too.

Lack of flashbacks: 7This movie is a giant mess and doesn't understand what it is trying to be or tell.The hero has a sister who constantly whines about how South American people have in hard in this city and how other people, likely White rich people, have it all and take it all no matter how hard these Mexican immigrants work so she doesn't even want to get an education or a proper job as it won't matter in her eyes. Yet the movie shows exactly why she is working low-paid jobs with no job prospects and her brother is working his way up. She uses a private bathroom then instead of trying to sneak herself out brags about her business while strolling out the stall catching the house owner, the evil lady, staring at her and firing her on the spot for being this dull headed. Anyone would have fired her here. She clearly shows she can't even follow basic rules or act civilized. And this type of behavior is constant from her so this one event just illustrated how she acts regularly. She's a racist hateful and extremely lazy uneducated worker. Her brother meanwhile just got this low-skill job and basically in what seems to be their first day gets a giant opportunity for getting a much better job in the company after being fired because of his sister. So a lead character got to explain her worldview with no one budding in and yet if you look at what is actually on screen it's the complete opposite. Yet there is never anyone to dispute any of the claims because the only White person here is the evil lady. They could have made this into some thematic debate yet she is just pure evil with no depth whatsoever.There is also a plot about how the giant tech company didn't make the evil lady CEO and instead made her brother CEO even though she ran it. The movie calls it out as sexist and tells this small story several times over. Yet from the very first scene she is made out to be an evil maniac who doesn't mind killing innocent people to get her way. She's nasty and evil to the bone and extremely open about this threatening people to their face just for fun. Apparently she turned evil after her brother got her job and then took over the job later on. But this is a hard sell. She was a great CEO then by not getting to keep her job turned into an extremely coldhearted murderer? This is an experience millions of people have in real life where they don't get their fair share. You get turned down or lose your job for unfair reasons all the time. Maybe even once every 5 years if you work in a competitive industry. If all those people turned into psychopaths we would have a huge problem. A more logical explanation would be that she was always pure evil and just hid this as she was gifted power from a young age because of nepotism and didn't need to step on toes. People saw this and replaced her and she clawed her way back. Actually, this would be a BETTER story. Instead everything is sexist or racist here. She experienced sexism and she is apparently racist. There is nothing deeper here.We also have the love interest literally cause a main death. An act that would make her hated forever in any real setting. Yet here they don't even mention it. Because obviously she's part of the good guys so her actions are therefore positive like in all other superhero movies. The movie doesn't care about what actually happens. It just forces a storyline into events that don't support this storyline whatsoever. It's like the writers didn't understand their own story which seems extremely common in modern movies that are largely produced. This trope scene is here, that trope scene is here. Step by step. Except they don't really create a storyline combined. Producers just selected them ahead of making the movie and forced a progressive immigrant theme onto everything and the writers just had to follow suit. Yet the themes are utter nonsense just forced into the movie via dialogue. It removes all depth and clearly this is why all actors phones it in.Everything here is extreme cringe. The acting is horrible and all dialogue is extremely on the nose in a way where even kids would notice this. Which is extra offensive as this is made for Latin Americans and other DC movies weren't this childish and silly. So they investigated the main market for this movie and figured out they had to make all characters constantly say what they were doing as they figured viewers wouldn't get it otherwise. Superhero movie viewers are not the smartest group of people overall, but this is made for people who don't even understand basic movie stories and have never seen a superhero movie before. So are Latin Americans in USA this clueless about basic superhero stuff? They have never seen a single superhero movie before?It's also extremely irritating how the lead does nothing. Everyone just pushes him around, but he's not even kind or smart. He's not even a clear weakling trying to stay safe. He's just nothing. He doesn't make any decisions and doesn't react or change things. His sister is bullying him because she's hateful and bigoted yet while they share parents he's completely different. They could at least have made him try to hide or avoid danger or responsibility like with Spiderman. Or made him into a regular guy trying to keep his life normal like with Clark Kent. Just some motivation in some direction even if it's something negative.The story overall is also nonsense even if we ignore the extremely cringe moral stuff. In one scene they need to break into a building and randomly we learn that a family member has made an extremely advanced system to shut down any security system anywhere even though this is an extremely advanced building with a room full of security guards controlling the IT security. We never learn why he knew all this extremely advanced IT stuff as an old guy or why he acts like a poor clown living with his brother when he is actually a genius. In another scene regular characters pick up weapons and become superheroes right away. Zero training. This is what modern movies do wrong. They always want to have some young girl also be a superhero and then create superheroes out of whole families. Which could work in some cases if they received training first and could die. If they are just like the main character superhero then obviously it means nothing. In another scene the main character has something extremely wrong with his body and needs to seek help right away. Yet his family is afraid of cops as they are illegal aliens. So they forbid him to seek help and freak out when he does. Again, this makes zero sense. He's 22. Why would they let him suffer and potentially die just to remain hidden? Are they psychopaths? He's an American citizen who just got his diploma yet suddenly he's not allowed to talk to doctors or people who may help? What?The movie looks and feels like a long episode of a dirt cheap TV show. But unfortunately TV shows have way better writing today. So besides the CGI being cheap and acting clearly all one-takes with no depth it doesn't even live up to a B tier TV show. Though I must admit some of the superhero TV shows are quite terrible. This is not just bad, this is unwatchable. And I am truly shocked that reviewers didn't notice the horrible acting and pathetic writing. Just watch the first 5 minutes. It's extremely clear this is not a good movie so how did people miss this?","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Superhero and Cobra Cai-Atmosphere are well brought together in this one. I like a lot that this is a movie with positive atmosphere that still has some tension. Marvel tried to make these positive family-settings in Hawkeye and Ms. Marvel, but for once Blue Beetle does not seem like a less good DC- clone but like the original. This is due to the good cast and of course Xolo Maridueña, who has a very charismatic presence, more then his female colleagues in the marvel series. In my oppinion, Blue Beetle would also make a good series or at least deserves a sequel. Fun Fact: Like the other DC-Movies, this movie happens in the fictional 'Palmera City'.

DC Comics has made some pretty good superhero movies in the past but also some pretty bad ones too. Blue Beetle was mainly okay. Throughout, there were some pretty good productions and the superhero/action moments were solid with some fun fight sequences and colorful effects. The direction was alright but there were a few moments that felt a little sloppy. The performances from the cast members were mostly good as Xolo Maridueña does a pretty good job performing his role as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle alongside Susan Sarandon, Adriana Barraza and George Lopez as well.For the story, it was fine. It didn't feel too special or as interesting as some of the other superhero stories. Throughout, the camerawork has some solid shot moments and while the humor was mostly meh, there were a few good humor moments. The characters were okay but they weren't fully investing to connect with. There are some dialogue moments that could improve and the uses of special effects and CGI were good. However, there are some not so great CGI aspects but it is definitely better than The Flash.If this movie had came out in the 1990s, I feel like it would have been an smashing hit. Overall, it's not the best DC Comics movie but it does have some good entertaining moments and it's an okay pop-corn piece of entertainment.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

There were only 2 nice minutes out of the disappointing +2 hours runtime that you may label watchable. The story has nothing interesting going for it, the cast carried an embarrassing underwhelming performance and the characters were as bland and generic as any family superhero movie you can imagine. A superhero movie is nothing without a worthy villain which this obviously didn't have, instead we got a cardboard villain picked up from the nearest dumpster. No matter how you look at it, this is a disappointing superhero/family movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Older audiences who grew up with the older superhero movies that were made in the early 2000s won't like this one. This film contains a cast that has awful acting, and the idea isn't original at all. What they did was take a number of superheroes and they blended them together. Spiderman, Ironman, DeadPool and Batman are the main superheroes that the filmmakers blended together to create Blue Beetle. DC is struggling to create new original supheroes. The superhero genre isn't doing as bad as other genres are doing, like the horror genre, but for creating brand new superheros the idea needs to be original and the superhero shouldn't be so identical to other superheroes that superhero fans can see that they're replicating and copying ideas that have already been done. Even George Lopez's acting wasn't the best at all. George Lopez has done a lot of amazing movies and tv shows. I certainly hope he doesn't return for a sequel if one ever gets made. The whole movie fell apart very quickly and I didn't enjoy Blue Beetle one bit. It was lousy and it's a complete rip off of the superheroes that I had mentioned above. This is just a movie that is better off without a sequel. I am not giving this movie a bad rating based off of any political stuff, I just wanted to get that out of the way. I'm giving Blue Beetle a bad rating because it's unoriginal and it lacks complete creativity. Blue Beetle ranks at the top of my list for the worst Superhero movie ever made, period. Blue Beetle is extremely disappointing in every single way. I watched it because a friend recommended it to me. I don't know what other superhero fans saw, but what I saw was a desperate attempt to rake in money from the superhero fans. It didn't do that well at the box office and it definitely shows. The trailer made the movie look better than what the real movie actually is. To me the trailer looked okay, but the real movie is just pure trash and this is what I call an attention seeking film.Rating: 1/2 star out of 5.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This felt at a lot of times like watching cartoons where just drawing the scene makes it possible to do in real.Another annoying factor is most of the movie is in Spanish so it requires extra effort to follow through with the dialogue.Here is the rating of:Storyline: 2/5. Very cliche, linear and expected outcome. Moreover, the editing should have been done better as you notice there are many gaps between the scenes in the movie.CGI: 2/5. You would expect really good CGI in an action super hero movie but this isn't the case here. That's not coming as a surprise from DC comics and they could learn a thing or two from Marvel. Even when special effects were used on the helmet of ""blue beetle"" when it was half broken in the fighting scene, the helmet looked so cheap just like a toy for kids and reminded me of the old kids shows we used to see in the 90s on tv.Acting: 3/5. The reason why I put 3 is due to the good acting of the supporting cast mainly George Lopez and Adriana Barazza. The main actor Xolo delivers an underwhelming performance and lacks the ability to connect with the audience. My biggest disappointment was the horrible writing made for the lovely and amazing legendary actress Susan Sarandon, she deserves roles that are much better than this and movies on a different league. I hope she doesn't take such similar roles in the future.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Somehow these interesting Latinos got dumped in a truly cliched super hero movie with a massive sink hole sized plot that made no sense. An in debt college student uses an airline to return home. Nope. He would have used a bus. Then the plot sickens. In the end local neighbors come to help la familia. The neighbors look like they have sitcom potential since they include a variety of non Latinos. The possibilities for stories with those characters is interesting. The crazy uncle is someone I want to see more of. And the scientist. He'd be a good other crazy uncle. Mean Guatemalan guy can find a better film.

Rather than the 1939 original (yes, that old), or the better known and written second version, Ted Kord (who does at least get some references in the film), we get a third, dull-as-dishwater incarnation, Jaimie Reyes.Jamie is young, well-meaning, and as bland as possible, but he is also American Mexican, and THAT is the theme and focus of the movie. Being Mexican, while being in a kick-ass Mexican family, and referencing Mexican pop culture (songs and TV shows).For those who believe a movie should focus on race above all else, Blue Beetle is a triumph. Alas, dissenting viewers ares likely to be bored, and grow disinterested as this limp film hits you with cliche then CGI, then more cliche, then more CGI etc... for 2+ hours.Blue Beetle isn't true to it's source material, and manages to be predictable above all else.

It had lots of fun action that really made me care about this hero and wanting to see another installment or atleast more of the Blue Beetle. Xolo does such a great job as portraying the character and the rest of the supporting cast fill their roles greatly. I give this movie easily an 8.5 out of ten and while it isnt a crazy masterpiece it is very much enjoyable with an interesting plot. I do have to say there were lots of funny jokes that I enjoyed but lots of cringe moments that made me wonder why they were left in the film. Lots of the jokes were understood and relatable and I genuinely laughed at them but sometimes I felt like they did a little bit too much and they could have stopped. I love a super hero when hes supported by his family like the next fan does but in this movie we see they take it a little too far and things get ""silly"" and exaggerated. I would say the only person I would choose to recast would be Jaime's sister because it feels like she's too ""Disney channel"" and her acting isn't necessarily bad but it makes the movie feel a little too silly. Sometimes I wonder when they do test screenings if they genuinely understand the corny and cringe parts or if they realize them and choose to let it slide. In one line the mom says in Spanish ""go kick their asses"" as the camera pans in their face. Its just a very corny and cringe phrase and scene and it totally takes me out of the superhero movie vibe I want to feel. We are left with one real post credit scene and the ""second"" is very disappointing and not worth staying for because it doesn't have any type of relevance to DC films. I very much enjoyed this installment of Blue Beetle b y DC and I can't wait for more.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

The cast was all-around fine, with George Lopez being the absolute stand-out and Xolo Mariduena doing a great job as Jaime. Fun and exciting tone with emotion sprinkled in. Jaime and his family were the heart of this movie, it felt genuine and how a Hispanic family would act. The antagonists were not great, they were definitely one-note, Victoria Kord was mainly just a typical greedy corporate head while Carapax was the typical henchmen character. The visuals were decent, but towards the later half of the movie weren't great, but keep in mind this was originally going straight to HBO Max. The Blue Beetle suit however was masterfully done. The comedy was solid, there is a little bit of childish humor, but the rest of it mostly sticks. The action is pretty entertaining and suspenseful at times. If you're on the fence about watching this movie, you should go see it, everybody who worked on it, clearly put their heart and soul into it. After a long week of stress, this movie really made me have a fun time. I was scared that this movie was going to be bad, but thankfully it wasn't. I hope this movie can be what Spy Kids was to me for young Hispanics. All in all, this movie was a blast and a glimmer in the dying genre of the superhero movie.","5 out of 25 found this helpful.

Much like when I checked out of Flash during the ""baby shower"" scene, I checked out of Blue Beetle when the protagonist's family sings a theme song from a novella in the midst of a life-and-death situation.You throw away story momentum and character intrigue for a cheap joke, and suddenly the cinematic experience is reduced to waiting for the next ""yuk yuk"" of a muppet show. This could have been the perfect sling-shot of a film to move the DCU into the rebooted universe. Instead, it's yet another example of how the superhero genre is weakening by the month.I don't blame the casting, though. Xolo Maridueña is solid as the lead, Jaime Reyes. Bruna Marquezine, who I'll admit may just have helped me confirm what my ""type"" is in a woman with her sheer beauty and presence, did plenty of heavy lifting fot the emotional center of the film as Jenny Kord, niece of the villain of the movie (played expertly by Susan Sarandon). And yes, George Lopez wasn't bad.There's just too much silly family stuff to make me actually believe in the family aspect of the story; like someone trying so hard to be liked it makes it difficult to like them. I guess I blame the writing, primarily, but the director has also got to pick a theme. Is it like a Batman film directed by Joel Schumacher or Christopher Nolan, because you can't have both.I do think this would be a decent family-friendly film. The special effects are top notch, the fights are believably choreographed, a few jokes actually hit, and there is not only an origin story but a redemptive arc, as well. So it's not an awful movie by any stretch. It just could have been much, much more.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jaime Reyes, in my opinion, is the best new character introduced in the last 20 years in comics. His character's deepest desire (extracted by supernatural means) was to be a dentist to provide for his family. Why on earth did they cut out that wholesome part of his characterization? Yes. Lawyers, occasionally help people. Sometimes even for charity, but let's be honest - that is not a profession people go into for altruism by and large. I cracked up that he went to Gotham University for law school as well. The only thing I can envision lawyers from that city doing regularly is filing papers to keep (likely guilty) clients out of prison or dodging acid attacks in the courtroom. Was there an aside that he got a prelaw class with a guest lecture by Dent? Why not have Jaime go to Ivy college? Why would a family struggling send a kid out of state for a higher education? That does not make sense to me. Even with scholarships - unless it is a full ride - that is a big step for families without extensive resources.This may have been a film about Blue Beetle, but this is not Jaime Reyes. Cutting out his supporting cast, Paco and Brenda was not necessary. I wish we had gotten to see actual kid sister Milagros. I liked the actress, but I wish she had been depicted younger.I like the new character of Jenny Kord even if I feel they didn't give her agency. The actress is good but they built no background for establishing this character. A few short minutes establishing the character with her father as a child and this would have been an incredibly improved film. I also like the actor for Blue Beetle, even if I disliked this film. I like him in Cobra Kai as well. But this is going to be a hot take, he's too cocky as Jaime for this to be the first outing with the Scarab. He did not fit the comics I've read - and I've followed this character since the debut. I think he would have been a better fit as Rafael Sandoval (El Diablo).The villains are caricatures. Their actions without consequence tearing up a city are hysterically ill-plotted. The plot itself is nonsensical, and looking at the rich but recent comic history to pull from this is just a mess. I wish I could say I was surprised it was butchered so badly, but recent comic book movies have been awful across the board. I would rate lower, but I love this character so much and I do like the actors. I did like hearing the scarab speak and think the CGI is good. Here's hoping DC get's it's soul back in future cinematic endeavors.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film takes a step back from the city of Gotham and brings us to Palmera City to meet the Mexican family of Jaime Reyes consisting of his father, mother, grandmother, sister and uncle2. The film's visual effects are much much better than the Flash, Black Adam and Shazam 2.3.

The action scenes, my god, are unlike anything you've seen in the previous dc films.5. The performances. Everyone is great in their roles but I'd like to point out Xolo, George and Bruna for their amazing performances.

Full of clichés, but a fun watch with great pacing and a great ending.For starters, this is apparently a super-hero for Mexicans (Hispanics, eventually? Sorry: I can't never get my head around American race wars). It's only natural that global conglomerates finally start to act locally (remember the ""think global, act local"" motto from the 1990's?...) However, everything in the story was either started or developed by Americans (Ted Kord - the good brother, and Susan Sarandon's character - the bad sister)... which means that although it LOOKS made for Mexicans, it kind'a has a ""colonialist"" after-taste.Anyway, if I was a Mexican I would feel deeply insulted by the depiction of this caricature of a Mexican family, as it's wrong in so many ways (from the multiple instances of embarrassing public behavior of the whole family to the depiction of the grandma in the brink of an orgasm while shooting people with what looks like a Nintendo version of a Gatling gun).Anyway, let's get into specifics.First of all, the whole saga starts off with the all-too-common unwitting-and-unwilling hero who is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Fine... But there is a little twist in it: his fat sister with eyeglasses (a double cliché) is the stupid one who actually starts everything. She's the one responsible for effing up her brother's homecoming with bad news (when explicitly told by everyone else in the family NOT to do it), then goes on to get herself and her brother fired because she wanted to take a dump in the boss's toilet (?!), then she acts like a child and manages to unleash this alien drone that goes up her brother's behind and gets the whole story in motion... then later she's the one responsible for their dad's fatal heart attack! Somehow, nobody cares that this stupid chick just screws everything up.On the other end of the racial+social spectrum, the rich girl is always saying ""Sorry! Sorry!"" even though she didn't do anything wrong and explicitly told the dude to not mess with the effing scarab in the first place...
Is this the current zeitgeist? Are we, as viewers, supposed to think that it is OK to be a dimwit who ruins everything if you are a girl? A poor girl? A fat girl? A girl with glasses? All of the above? Are we supposed to think that anyone who is born into poverty should be excused of everything, from being fired to getting their dad an heart attack (or getting their brother sodomized by an alien drone)? Are we supposed to think that anyone who is born into wealth must be constantly apologizing even to the stupid idiots who screw up everything by ignoring every warning?All this is deeply disturbing if you think about it. I rather not, but I'm still aware of it and I can't avoid mentioning it. But let's move on...More clichés:
1. Nowadays we use tons of software applications that have several deployments per day without the need for a ""reboot"", but still... highly evolved alien technology beyond human comprehension always has to ""reboot"" at some plot point. And it has to take several minutes, so that the bad guys get a fighting chance.2. ""Good"" is always blue, ""bad"" is always red. Hollywood is like paint by numbers.3. The bad guy looks exactly like a Gundam robot or something out of Power Rangers. I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of copyright lawsuits are coming up their way.4. The good guy is such a sucker that he always refuses to shoot to kill, even after seeing his family under live gunfire, and his dad dying. I guess this is supposed to be a ""family movie"", so lethal action is dialed down to a minimum. (although this gets an exception near the end of the movie, which is completely out of character and blatantly just for the sake of that specific plot point...)
5. The ""sentient alien technology"" has a sexy female voice.Bottom line: this is a highly flawed movie, with some disturbing undertones you should be aware of, but it is actually very entertaining due to very good craftsmanship from everyone involved. Particularly, the production design, direction, editing and acting are very good, and the pacing is perfect. Plus, you get a (predictable but) gratifying ending.Regardless of the above criticism, if you're into superhero movies then you surely got to see this one.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film had terrible acting the jokes were not funny. Obviously there were jokes directed towards Latino culture and I'm sure those hit for a lot of people but for someone not apart of that culture they did not. My main issue though was the cgi and how terrible it was. They did not have the budget to make a good blue beetle movie. Not to mention the story was very dragged out and also felt very lack luster the villain was very predictable and also was a terrible actor. . . .eiefwjvejscwjsvsjscsjsvsjvsjscsjsvshscsjsceve.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's like a movie made to be forgotten. Literally everything about Blue Beetle feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to make a superhero movie based on every other superhero movie ever made.And what on earth is this new trend of creating unbearably annoying over the top characters we're supposed to be rooting for? It's supposed to be endearing to watch a bunch of people act like they're all developmentally disabled because... family? Especially the main character's sister; who ends up being a patience tester in how annoying she was throughout, and the worst part about it is knowing that it's not actually supposed to annoy us, but to make us empathize with what a cool sister she is. Like, no, please, stop. There wasn't a single likeable character in that entire family (except maybe the dad, who at best was just around)... the sister, the mom, the uncle and the grandma... Oh man, the grandma. I would hate life if that was my family.Even with all that, it would be a little unfair to call it a bad movie. It's somewhere between below-average to average depending on how annoyed I am I guess. And no, there's nothing new here for you to have to check out, but if you still feel like you want to, you're not going to be disappointed either.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

You don't care much about the protagonists (nor antagonists) and are rarely left with a light smile on your face. Also, Xono Mariduena is severely miscast, neither can he act, nor does he convey simpathy or seriousness for the character.The action and CGI however, mind blowing! Not to get your hopes too high but Blue Beetle and Shazam-Fury of the Gods have some of the better CGI's out there from the recent years.

The direction and vision from Angel Manuel Sotos really brought the story of Blue Beetle to life and made it known worldwide especially to the Latino community. As a Latino(boricua) superhero movie fan and actor I've always felt that we were missing out on playing a superhero on the big screen. And Xolo and the whole cast really showed and represented that ""sason Goya""(seasoning) and our beautiful Latin heritage. Numbers are looking great and I think Blue Beetle was a fresh new take and boost the genre needed. I think picking Xolo Mariduena was a genius idea by the team and in my book he brought us the perfect Jaime Reyes! Congratulations to the whole team, job amazingly and talently done.

After a brief, unintriguing scene with Susan Sarandon we meet a nice family who joke and argue and face challenges and it just goes on and on.* The sitcom format adapts poorly to the actual events. This is most obvious in the first superhero transformation, which is a body-horror moment played as silly comedy. It's weirdly incongruent to combine someone going through an objectively terrifying moment as though it's a very special episode about getting your first zit.* The action is unacceptable. I mean, sometimes very mediocre superhero movies will still have one or two knock-out action sequences, but not this one.Some people say the public is beginning to weary of superhero movies, and movies like this will do nothing to change that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are some shots where the Blue Beetle suit looks cool but for the most part the visual effects are ugly to look at. The villains are just over the top comically evil and the film has no idea how to deliver exposition. The action isn't memorable and neither is the score. The final battle is one of the weakest and most predictable final battles in a superhero movie. The sets look fake and the world building is mediocre. Characters also do things that make no logical sense multiple times just because the plot needs them to. The tone is also all over the place and the pacing never lets you catch your breath.

Maybe I'm being too critical.The cgi was good with all cuts not being bad.I wish they DIDNT make him such a sensitive, horrible ""hero"". Didn't want to hurt anyone and played it safe. Maybe too old for these movie but shesh what happened to these superheroes not wanting to hit anyone like come on. Ending was alright.Over all could have been better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was funny, thrilling, action-pack, and with surprisingly a sad/emotional element to it. Xolo Mariduena is the perfect actor to play as Blue Beetle. Me and my brothers were so excited once we heard Xolo Mariduena was casted to play as Blue Beetle. He brought charisma and excitement to the character. He is caring, passionate, and a hard worker, like most Mexicans! He made the character very likable and that is what Blue Beetle is all about. The director, Angel Manuel Soto, did an outstanding job representing Mexicans/Latinos in the big screen, and I thank you for that! Everything felt so natural and not forced. Me being a Mexican-American has even encouraged and motivated me to keep on going and echandole ganas!! Overall, me and my brothers had an amazing time watching Blue Beetle. I hope we can get to see him more in the new DCU!! THANK YOU!!!","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

In 2023's 'Blue Beetle,' we meet Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) and his multigenerational family as they try to navigate an ancient superpower that Reyes accidentally comes across.It's not that the Blue Beetle is a ""bad"" superhero, per se, but he definitely does not have main character energy. In his big screen debut (or, more fittingly, ""bug screen debut""), the Beetle/Reyes comes off as being a cocky college grad who has dreams of living how the other half does. The film is cheesy, silly and feels very 'Ant-man'-ish, which isn't surprising given the subject matter. The villains, Victoria Kord (an extra-annoying Susan Sarandon) and Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo) are not fearsome, and the soundtrack feels like it was coopted from 'Stranger Things.'It's probably fair to say that 'Beetle' is geared towards a younger crowd, which explains why so much of the movie feels like it was written by a 14-year-old boy. It's certainly different from other entries in the DC library, but that's not necessarily a good thing.'Blue Beetle' is an example of why not everything that appeared in the pages of a comic book deserves to make it to the big screen.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Latino market made the character a draw in comic book format but got a lot to do make back a couple hindered million budget.

The dialogues are boring. The characters feel forced, and it seems like the actors were pushed in front of the cameras at gunpoint. The only bright spot is the visual aspect, but there aren't enough effects to pull the movie out of the mud. Oh, even most of the action scenes are dull!All in all, below average.

Movie Review -Blue Beetle Review: DC Studios latest superhero drama, Blue Beetle, marks Ángel Manuel Soto's debut in the superhero genre. DC has been looking to turn the tide for a while and has had a few impressive successes recently, especially with Joker and The Batman. Blue Beetle is fresh stuff, alright, but does it really matter if superhero theories are old? A new suite and powers are enough? I guess Not. It's not just DC; Marvel too is suffering from an insufficiency of new conflicts and thrills. It's just that earlier we used to get one or two superhero movies a year; now we get a lot of them, and that too after watching so much stuff already. Blue Beetle is funny with Mexican humour-that's new! The suit, theme, and powers are also quite new. Though the film lacks newness in storytelling. We all know how one gets power and tries to use it while tackling dangers, doing romance, and saving family. Blue Beetle is that mixture again, with some tech talk we have been seeing from Iron Man, Wayne, and Hulk for years. Nevertheless, it's a promising start for a new superhero, if that's what you're looking for.The film begins with Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returning home after graduation, and he learns that his family is gonna lose the house in Palmera City. He is fired from a job by Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) while trying to save Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine) amidst an argument. Jenny might have a job for him, and he visits Kord's office to meet her. Jenny gives him a Scarab to protect, which is childishly opened by his family. Jaime is now chosen to become a symbiotic host to the Scarab, an ancient alien biotechnological relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armour, turning him into the superhero ""Blue Beetle"". Victoria and her bodyguard robot, Conrad (Raoul Max Trujillo) are after the code of Blue Beetle, which jointly puts Jaime's family in danger. Jaime and Kha-Ji must work together to protect the family and the code, but will it be enough?Coming as a fresh film, Blue Beetle has no load of expectations. So even if it's underwhelming at parts, it still doesn't bother you much. It can't be the same when you watch The Batman or Superman movies because they are hugely popular superheroes and their films come with certain baggage. The screenplay of Blue Beetle is the main concern, as it deals with new ideas in old ways. It's 2023, and we are still being fed two decades-old conflicts. Why? The building collapses, but the Hero wouldn't be hurt, or even the heroine, even if there is large destruction right around her. One of the family members must get hurt so that the Hero can get angry and unleash his powers. In no time, the hero and heroine would come close to kissing each other, and someone would enter the room. Don't you dare ask when they fell in love. It's just there. Don't tell me you haven't been familiar with all these things, because if you are not, Blue Beetle is going to feed all of them for the first time. But if you have tasted them before, then this might get you away from the table in no time.The handsome Xolo Maridueña will be the girls favourite soon, at least as a crush. He has that personality and kindness in his natural role as Jaime Reyes. But as Blue Beetle, he is still immature. That's what the course of his character demands, by the way. Raoul Max Trujillo has been pretty impressive as the antagonist here. He might have only a few scenes to show his face and act, but he is damn good there. The female baddie played by Susan Sarandon didn't look evil at all, but you know why. It's just that female touch that makes things difficult for her. Jaime's love interest, Bruna Marquezine, is cute but nothing that can be remembered or even discussed. Surprisingly, all the family members of Jaime seem to have a blast. Damián Alcázar, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, and Belissa Escobedo have rocked more as a unit than as individuals. Harvey Guillén's Sanchez goes unnoticed until before the last lines, when he speaks in Mexican.Talking about the visual effects, Blue Beetle is your old laser show put together with high-tech weapons. Some of the destruction scenes look grand on the big screen without any 3D effects. The cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski is fine, whereas Craig Alpert's edit keeps the crispness intact. Technically, it's a well-made film, no doubt, considering the $120 million budget. The studio took good care of the production design, as nothing really looked outdated or ugly here. However, Blue Beetle needed a little brainstorming on the paper, which is clearly missing. Of course, you don't expect a typical superhero entertainer to be a smart and intelligent film, but what's wrong with being a bit more clever? Ángel Manuel Soto's storytelling is well-versed in your regular superhero flicks that you have been enjoying over the years. He makes you a simple popcorn entertainer when the world is getting more advanced with multiverses and emotionally powerful tales. Could he have done better? Yes, I guess so. Blue Beetle isn't a bad film at all, but it isn't great enough to be recommended. It's just a matter of your expectations, whether you want to go for it desperately or not. But yes, it can be viewed once for a fresh attempt in the money-spinning genre.RATING - 5/10*","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Oh look how funny Mexicans are. Oh look how family oriented Mexicans are. Oh look how unfairly Mexicans are treated by all the white people.That also another thing - the villain of the story, the femme fatal, the trickster, the dictator, is of course evil... Just evil. Mostly her white privilege is in focus regarding how she treats her staff off other ethnicities. You know... Older Ritch white people are evil because they're just evil.I don't really know what guidance James Gunn and Peter brings. But it isn't good at all. This movie shows us the same shallow boring formula marvel has forced on us for years. Dramatic moments destroyed by stupid silly jokes and there's no real continuity between how the characters act and their moral compass.Visually I do like it. It's bright, it's colorful and I like the cinematography. At least that is good.But in between all of the namedropping, character hopping and floor mopping, to show that this movie is in fact, part of a larger universe with big heroes there's a good idea if a film. We just don't get to see it.We, the audience, are expected to care and be invested just because the characters are Mexican. That's the defining trait of the main family. Not their personalities. No. Their ethnicities makes them who they are apparently and that's not worth paying a ticket for. These behaviors is what you can see online in stereotypical memes.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

There were also some inside jokes that you also wouldn't get if you are not from the community, that's probably why people get bored and give so much hate to this movie, which is kinda ironic because is just as equal as the hate they give in real life.

Take your pick - Iron Man, Spider-Man, Green Lantern, Ant-Man, the list goes on. Suffice to say, there's very little here that's new and fresh.Second, there are some genuinely annoying characters that detract from the film. While I don't mind George Lopez in his various TV shows, he was horribly miscast here - and his role makes absolutely no sense. So too was Susan Sarandon, who was cast as the villain. She just couldn't pull it off and I didn't believe her in the role. The only redeeming family member, in my opinion, was the grandmother. She was a surprise (in a good way).Third, the plot was a mess. While trying to be an origin story, it was also a heavy-handed family movie - sort of like the Shazam sequel. And the story was surprisingly boring for a superhero film. If this is the sort of ""quality"" we can expect from the ""new"" DC, Warner's is in deep trouble.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It met all of my expectations of a comic book turned movie and then some. Some reviewers it is too predictable, but most DC and Marvel movies are.

So now, just like in Black Panther, an entire race of people seems to live outside of any form of relatable real-world realism previously established in the DC universe of Zack Snyder and James Gunn, in their own futuristic city which is, just as with Black Panther, more technologically advanced than the rest of the world, notably any of the cities we've seen a normal mix of white and other people live in any of the films, counting cities like Metropolis and Gotham. It's as if these films, by the presentation of these settintgs, are attempting to artificially elevate these cultures above all the others, as if these films are written by white dudes who are very much overcompensating with their scripts, rather than being more reasonable and striving to simple make them equal, comparable and relatable to a wide audience, rather than simply targetting said ethnic groups. This is an utter disgrace, and, if anything, should be considered a bit racist, as it is a blatant, hyped, big budget effort to misrepresent said cultures and ethnicities that undermines the progress of so many great other great films and series from those groups, and it should be considered vulgar messaging by anyone with any tact. And, to make matters worse, AGAIN, like Black Panther, the film is UTTER GARBAGE, with ABYSMAL acting and, obviously, even worse writing. These are the exact sorts of desperate market reaches that are slowly sinking the once hyper-successful superhero movie market, and no one keeping up with current events will dispute that en masse viewers are losing interest in the genre altogether.We can thank DC and Marvel for garbage like this when they finally ruin all the incredible progress made since they started back with Wesley Snipes' Marvel Studios' Blade and there is no longer a producer left who will want to attach their name to a superhero.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But it's the summer holidays, and kids want to go to the cinema. So I grabbed some food and drink and expected to snore through yet another superhero movie. At least i'd enjoy some food huh..But I was pleasantly surprised!This movie is colourful, yet gritty.Fun yet emotional.Dream-like yet realistic.The way our protagonist changes into the blue beetle is done in such a way, it's kind of difficult to watch.Gaining a power like this and turning into a bug-powered superhero wouldn't be a comfortable transition and this film captures that brilliantly.I'm not a Latino, but being from an Asian background, there's definitely some similarities. The love and support of the protagonist's family is refreshing to watch. His family stick by him through thick and thin and it was truly wonderful to see. This film has some heart and soul that is not present in many other similar movies.It's a refreshing take on the tired superhero genre which is on its last legs. It was very fun to watch and also makes you sympathise with many of the characters.If this was a marvel movie, it would've recieved a higher rating. I don't know why DC is judged so harshly.This was the best superhero film I have seen in quite a while. Give it a go if you like this genre.

Furthermore, the overarching impression I derived from this production was that of a constrained budget. The limited resources at the filmmakers' disposal manifested themselves clearly in the visual elements and special effects, which, though valiantly attempted, bore the marks of financial restraint. Regarding the performances of the cast and the narrative itself, I must confess to a sense of profound letdown. The portrayals, while earnest, seemed to lack the depth and authenticity that might have allowed me to forge a more profound connection with the characters and their unfolding journey. The storyline, likewise, trod a path that felt overly familiar, offering little in the way of innovative storytelling. It's imperative to underscore that the views expressed here are entirely subjective and represent my own cinematic predilections. The realm of cinema is one that thrives on diversity of opinion, and what might have left me wanting could very well be a source of enjoyment for others.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

From the beginning, Blue Beetle was full of preaching about family, Latino principles, values, etc. When I watched it, it immediately gave the feeling of custom order film. Producers dictated what they want to see in the movie, copied scenes from other movies and even lines to be said by actors. Coz the director met the majority of the dictation, the movie felt disjointed and forced in most scenes.George Lopez was clearly recruited to save the film sensibility by throwing jokes and comments. He kinda lifted the film a little, so it was watchable as a TV Series pilot. Blue Beetle was, IMHO, a TV Pilot. It would replace Arrowverse that finally ended after a decade. It would also the opportunity to build the new generation of Jistice League, considering Blue Beetle and Booster Gold are famously JL members.The good news is Blue Beetle is watchable. The bad news is nothing memorable in the film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you think of Iron Man and Ant man, but no where near as good or enjoyable. It actually reminds me of the lower budget films during from the 90's, such as Guyver 1991 or Star Kid, where a boy finds an alien super suit.The action really wasn't great I have to say, it was actually quite boring in my opinion. There was no real character development either. Would have like to have seen more about the backstory of the scarab and the previous Blue beetle and less of the family. None of the characters really held any weight or had any substance.Basically there was nothing of the film to shout about it was just bang average. A film you can watch once and be done with. Anyone that scores this movie over 6 IMO is pushing an agenda. Rating should be based on the film alone and the film was very much average. THE ENDThat being said, If you have some free time to kill or want to chill out and don't have much else to watch then the movie is worth a watch, but don't be expecting anything new or exciting.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The cast has a great and very believable family dynamic. It's also nice to see a movie with scenes in bright daylight and with pops of color, since a lot of movies now are very dark and beige. There's a lot of heart in this film and that constantly shines through.

""Jaime."" I've never met a Jaime that wasn't gorgeous. Granted I only met three in my life. And despite only the character's name being Jaime, the actor continued that streak of mine. Also, I've always loved Susan Sarandon, especially when she's a redhead. So those two factors made me see this on opening weekend.And if I knew Harvey Guillén was in this, I wouldn't have waited for the Sunday of this film's premiere. He's my absolute favorite part of the ""What We Do in the Shadows"" series.Unfortunately, the movie is just okay. I literally stopped counting how many other superhero movies this took from. Iron Man, Venom, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Batman, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Green Lantern and on and on. I'm sure I missed a dozen more. I know this is an established DC character (I had bought one of the comics in my youth) and not fully stealing from those ideas, but it was hard to see this as a standalone origin story with all that baggage.So, Jaime Reyes (you will hear this name 100x more than Blue Beetle, so get used to it) is eager to get a job after graduating college, save his family from eviction and bang his job lead. Instead, Jaime Reyes becomes an alien scarab's host who turns him into the title's superhero to fight the evil Kord corporation.This movie is also part-sitcom about a super tight Mexican family. There is a ton of slapstick and absolute live-action cartooning going on here. Despite there being an alien presence, you WILL have to suspend your disbelief multiple times, namely when the family can out of the Blue operate high tech gear/weapons in split-seconds for convenience.Actually, this movie is chock-full of coincidences and conveniences. If you leave your brain at the door, you can just let these slide and, again, this really is a live-action cartoon.For the positives, forevermore, I'll always love Susan Sarandon. So much so, I didn't even pay attention/critique her performance here. I just adore her no matter what she does. And I did like the dynamics and chemistry of the family. Doesn't hurt the title character is, indeed, very handsome and there were a few near-naked shots.Bring on his Blue Beetles in an uncut version!I would mildly recommend it. There isn't anything here groundbreaking, original, fresh or creative. And on the flipside, it's harmless, entertaining and aside from a few slow scenes, it mostly flew by.Like The Flash, they set these both up for sequels that will never see the greenlight. Sucks for this cast and crew who probably thought there would be more while making this and they did put their hearts fully into this movie.***Final Thoughts: Updated DCEU ranking from Best to Trash with only one more to go...1.

It might make gangbusters at the box office but if this is the direction that James Gunn and Peter Safran want to take the rebooted DCU then I am 100% on board(not that I already was).

A film that makes even old commercials seem staggeringly intriguing. Where to begin? Maybe with the 'script,' which seemed to be the inspiration for a new definition of the word 'emptiness.' Dialogues that make talking to a chatbot seem like the peak of literary finesse. And the main character? His only achievement was that the viewer literally couldn't decide whether to ignore him more or actively root for him... to disappear from the screen faster. Acting? That seems like too grand a word. It seems the director chose the cast based on their ability to stand still and stare into the distance with an expression of mild surprise - perhaps because of their own presence on the set.

The story is convoluted and disconnected but still manages to come across as the same generic super hero film as others that are not well done.There is a love story that is stifled due to the protagonists immaturity and comedic attempts. The female in this love story and the supporting actress is absolutely stunning, so there is that positive note.. The superhero lives at home in a small house with a massive Mexican family all squeezed into the same place.I could write more on how things are not good but I feel as though I have already had enough of this film and want to move on to something more engaging, Avoid this one.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I saw it with my family and..What the Heck? Ok, so i thinking this was made for the Power Rangers demographic, young kids. All though it was fun at times, I could not recommend this movie. It had all the Latino cliches, typical hard life story, typical super hero story and the music was overkill. Who wrote this? It was a Mexican born Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. Now does he think all Latinos are Mexican? Hollywood obliviously doesn't know to include all Latino cultures into a Latino movie. Very few films have been done like that. Also including George Lopez in the mix was another reason I didn't see the film in the theater. My opinion but I don't care for him. This was disappointing all the way thru. We were saying ""This is like watching Spy Kids"" . But that was a better movie with the same strong family message. I like the optimistic strong family that stays together message. This seemed like it was made not for a wide theatrical release. More like made for TV. Xolo Maridueña did a good job and I hope he gets more roles in better movies. But these stereotypical Latino movies do not represent us as a people. Again Hollywood is to blame. As for DC, I'm a long time DC comics fan. If they thought this was going to bring more fans to their side, what were they thinking?","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The special effects were really well done. The color grading was fun. There were a couple scenes that actually got a chuckle out of me.But the film's story was just absurd. You're telling me that a group of poor immigrants know how to fly Alien ships and use advanced weaponry? On their first attempt of using it? That was so ridiculous. Not even Hollywood's magic could convince a viewer of that.The story felt like it was going on and on. You know when you're watching a good movie and time doesn't matter? You're lost in the story. Well mediocre films you'll constantly look at your watch to see when the misery will end. First time I glanced at my watch was almost exactly one hour into the film. The movie is over 2 hrs long.

I'd rate it 4 out of 10 stars. The movie's childish tone didn't sit well with me - it felt like it was trying too hard to be funny. Humor can work, but here, it was overdone and even diluted the story's impact.The inconsistent tone was frustrating too. It couldn't decide if it wanted to be a fun adventure or a serious exploration. This made emotional moments feel out of place. The visual effects were cool, especially the action scenes, but they couldn't save the film.Character development was lacking. Blue Beetle's transformation felt rushed, leaving me wanting more depth. Overall, ""Blue Beetle"" missed the mark. It had potential, but the excessive humor and lack of focus held it back.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I like the grounded approach they went with blue beetle and I believe that one of the main reasons why this movie is actually good is because of the lack of cameos from other characters making this movie feel like it's actually about Blue Beetle.

Only light in this ""Dark Night"", pun intended, is the special effects, they have done a really good and deserve the praise.The jokes all went side ways and the characters were not serious enough to potray the emotions required for example : when the father died, every one went on to crack jokes immediately.In short if these (Shazam inculded) type of movies are to be made then i would suggest WB executives should attned a workshop on movie making or something.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Menudo Spy Beetle Kids comedy with a Terrible script, cast and acting.This film works only as a bad comedy rip off of spy kids meets cheesy iron latino man with so many stereotypical cliches of Latinos it's pathetic.How was this green lit for $110m with a no name PR director and a writer with Miss Bala as only credit. Maybe DC can blame it on Covid.This story has no universal appeal whatsoever- and is a copy cat low brow ripoff of iron man/spiderman/ viper with nothing unique or original. It's not even appealing to kids.Xolo has a good screen presence but is too young and inexperienced to lead this huge DC film. Bruna is a nice love interest but there was no chemistry and yet her role was a waste as useless female side kick with no backstory.Unfortunately it all comes down to a solid screenplay and an original story which this film is neither so the terrible casting just added more drama to this failure of yet another DC film.DC is a global brand that requires a universal story. The audience has matured and this is a sad excuse of a film that should have never been green lit. End of story.3 stars for the Blue Beetle suit and George Lopez comedy.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

All those martial arts from Cobra Kai gave Xolo to be prepared for this superhero. George Lopez is still funniest comedian for the entire Hispanic community. Susan Sarandon definitely nailed her character as the vile Victoria Kord; she's definitely the character that you will love to hate. I remember she played the evil Queen Narissa from Disney's Enchanted.In superhero films, the main character would value romance like an example of Clark Kent falling in love with Lois Lane from the 1978 Superman film or Bruce Wayne falling in love with Vicki Vale from the 1989 Batman film. In some scenes, Jaime falls in love with Jenny Kord. Blue Beetle definitely values family. It's just like Shazam and his family.The scenes and locations of Palmera City remind me of walking through Miami, Puerto Rico or El Paso, Texas. I've read that they shot some scenes in El Paso. The action sequences were awesome and there were also funny moments with George Lopez. This movie had a lot of heart but there were also dark moments and scenes that made me cry a bit. Even the special effects blew my mind as well. This movie is awesome and cool. When it comes to watching superhero movies, the action, drama and special effects are brilliant and magnificent. Blue Beetle is one of the best movies to watch.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I read some Blue Beetle comics like a decade ago and they were fine, relatively good and relatively interesting. Not as good as Spider-Man comics were for me, but they probably had the closet alternative to them from DC (the one I knew of, at least). The movie, though... It's just... Trash. I don't have other words for this.First 30 minutes or so were complete snooze-fest, and even when we passed that mark and got to see the suit - it still was not as exciting, because it did not make much sense. Jackie Chan's ""The Tuxedo"" was a waaaay better representation of a trope ""I have a powerful suit and don't know how to control it. Even before that, why would the so ""important"" object as the Scarab be stored practically without security? Even B-Movies from 80s knew better.I also did not care for any of the characters. They felt worse than any character in Arrowverse after like 4th season of ""The Flash"". In fact, I think if they introduced Blue Beetle to Arrowverse it would have been a much better fit. But instead we got another attempt from DC to be like Marvel, when even Marvel themselves has started missing a mark more often than not. DC needs to realize, that copy-pasting and making these ""ha-ha"" movies does no good to them, because that's just not what the audience want.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But while those were mostly boring movies, this one was particularly painful to watch.I won't dabble too much. The casting was good, and they were wasted by one of the worst screenwriting I have ever seen, bar none. This movie makes Scorpion King look good.The movie's first half is annoying, the dialogue is beyond obnoxious, and it's excruciating and a waste of time. There is no coming back from this.They gave up from the beginning. This movie makes no attempt to be taken seriously. It's 100% campy. But it's not the fun kind of camp. It's really the obnoxious type. The one that treats the audience like stupid little kids. Not even cartoons go this far.There is nothing here. Uncle Rudy is a big brain genius, even though he lives in his brother's house because he can't find a job, and he is super obnoxious and on the nose all the time. He's tiresome. The sister is a big-mouth complainer straight out of Twitter. Not even Grandma was spared from this travesty. She starts as a very sympathetic lady, and by the end, she is basically The Terminator's grandma.The father is in the background for the entire first half. We know nothing about him. And suddenly, he becomes the wisest one out of nowhere. They tried to make him Uncle Ben, but there was no development to earn that. And this is a theme throughout the movie. The main villain is a grotesque Iron Monger bootleg. No development, and by the end, we are supposed to sympathize with him because of 30 seconds of backstory added at the very last minute. Lazy doesn't even begin to describe this screenwriting.Jaime Reyes and Jenny Kord are supposed to be a romantic duo but have zero chemistry. None, zip, nada. It doesn't work, feels forced, and is beyond cringe.The CGI and battles are okay, nothing special. And they have no idea how to build up a good battle. Out of nowhere, they need the hero to be nerfed; otherwise, the movie would end too soon. The solution? Make the alien suit decide to reboot out of the blue. I believe it runs Windows? Random stuff like this breaks the immersion all the time.Even bad movies like The Last Jedi or Rise of Skywalker can be reused in fan edits. They just cut off the bad parts (Canto Bay), and some usable material remains. But this movie? Nothing. There is nothing there. Cutting off the bad parts means leaving enough for a short music video.It's not even a bad movie in the sense of ""oh, ok, this is not Oscar material, but it's still fun, like the Fast and Furious franchise."" No, this is not enjoyable at all. As I said, it is painful to endure until the end.I should even reconsider this 1 out of 10. Maybe a zero would be more fitting.Don't waste your time on this one. Or have some drinks before watching.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, what I know is that this was an opportunity for DC to craft their own Spider-Man like character (young, struggling with the hero life, and navigating family). Instead what we got was a movie which failed to create a visually striking environment (it tries from the title artwork, to the neon signs.... but doesn't have the character of the Guardians movies or Thor: Ragnarok), fails to give us original characters and see their development (we get pared down version of the characters from Shang-Chi and Ant-Man), gives us the most one-dimensional bad guy since Iron Man 1, and ludicrous dialogue throughout.The movie feels like someone decided to make a superhero tele-novela.I wish it wasn't so. I wanted this to be great, and there are hints of it, like in the first transformation scene.

It's just not a good movie is the problem. It's like something that's gunning for a Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Award. Similar to Black Adam and the Shazam! Movies, there's nothing particularly offensive, but it's also completely forgettable. They're trying to leverage Mexican culture to distinguish this movie, but the core elements are exactly the same so it ends up coming across as just kind of racist. Otherwise it's like Wonder Woman 1984, where it has a lot of cartoonish vibes, over-acting mixed with flat acting, and every character has Home Alone levels of plot armor. Probably too immature for a teenager, so this is best for 10-12 year olds, probably to play in the background of a birthday party where they have something else more entertaining to do. Definitely not worth attempting to enjoy as any kind of cinematic experience though. It's like Black Adam and Shazam! But missing the positive elements of those movies.

The camera movement and generally the fighting skills shown were really commendable. They actually engross you in the scene. On top of that background music was really great.Kind of fit with the whole and many scenes for kind of almost perfect. You could actually feel the feelings of different people and what they were going through.This thing is what I found different in this movie that this had a holistic approach i.e it wasn't more focused only the superhero and his fighting.Animations may seem a little off on buildings constructed by CGI but overall a negligible factor.Flash had all these things accept a good background score, I suppose.

Acting was fine. Action was acceptable. However, mobilizing grandma to be a superhero revolutionary and turning the family into Beetle wars was a little too much. I hope a second movie moves into the DC mainstream of fighting villains.This was good to lay the foundation for the superhero, but at times it just seemed silly. There didn't seem to be any real plot but to unrealistically portray women as both villains and saviors in order to appeal to girls from the evil boss to the voice of khaji. There was too much foul language for a young audience and the only thing driving the Blue Beetle is his anger. I hope improvements are made in the future to make it more enjoyable. Take a lesson from a movie series like Guardians of the Galaxy in terms of character development, plot, music and mystery.

Apart from that, what more can be said? It's just another Superhero Film which to me, is heartbreaking to say because 5 years ago, I would be saying the more the merrier! Little did I know that writers would be going on strike because they were worried about AI stealing their jobs (I am aware it's not just that, pay is a massive factor too) but it feels like AI is already writing these films..... It is SO by the numbers. It could easily be just another Iron Man/Spider-Man/Ant-Man/Shazam! Etc. It just happens to be about Blue Beetle who is actually a fun and interesting character but is in a mostly boring movie.The weirdest decision in this film is that Jaime is extremely against killing but I guess is perfectly fine with his family members doing it....? Jaime isn't aware of this moment at the time but Rudy kills someone and Mili yells ""20 points!"". It is so incredibly jarring consindering like 10 minutes ago Jaime was adamant about not killing.Anyway you already know everything that is going to happen in this film within the first 5 minutes, even the credits scenes were predictable.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

He is the first person in his family to graduate from university but comes home to find his family struggling financially largely due to the hands of Kord Industries led by the power hungry leader Victoria Kord (Sarandon). Jaime is desperate to do anything to support his family, so when he comes across Kord's niece Jenny (Marquezine) who asks him to protect a stolen piece of alien technology, he accepts. But the technology unwittingly chooses him and infuses him with godlike powers. He must now learn how to control the persona of the Blue Beetle, a figure who can create any weaponry with his mind.The first two thirds of the movie are a generic fun blockbuster led by a man born to play the role of Jaime Reyes. Xolo Mariduena is a delight as the main character and plays the unwilling hero trope to perfection. He is a good kid that can still become emotional as anyone would be if they were thrusted into receiving godlike powers. However, it does mean that for the first two acts of the movie he is basically untouchable. This does detract from some of the tension the movie tries to build. However, the third act does offer some twists.As Jaime is put into this terrible situation, the people he loves most, his Nana (Barraza), Mother (Carrillo), sister (Escobedo), father (Alcazar) and uncle (Lopez) are all put in peril and have to come to terms with the fact that Jaime cannot be anyone other than Blue Beetle. The family dynamic is what really makes this movie truly special, they didn't ask to have their house foreclosed nor did they ask to have their son/grandson/brother/nephew infected with alien technology, but they came together and each one of them got an emotionally acted moment to shine in the movie. Every single family member got to get involved in the action, and because of that angle, it truly embodied the Mexican/Latina spirit so incredibly well.The third act of the movie makes it worth watching, but it does not necessarily forgive the movie from being formulaic in the first two acts. From the secondary villain (Trujillo) being the same as the hero but evil, to the main villain being just a power hungry military industrial manufacturer only after money, to love interest character also being an exposition machine; it even has a henchmen with a change of heart. This movie is full of these plot points that can be formulaic/weightless at best to dragging at worst, and it is exemplified by the fact that for most of the movie, the audience cannot see Blue Beetle or Karapax's face in the suits, they are just two faceless creatures punching and shooting electric pulses at each other. And it really is a shame because they could have just played up the biggest selling point of the movie: family and how even though they are not superpowered, they are the strong shell that protects their respective selves. There is one twist I did like involving the secondary antagonist's backstory which I thought should have gotten more screentime, and does tie into the themes well. This plot point is effective because it not only breaks the suits and reveals their faces of the characters but also their imperfections, and gives the actors a chance to deliver heart wrenching performances. However, like the suits, this movie brings up some heavy topics in the first act like gentrification of Hispanic neighbourhoods and imperialism and its effects on Central and South America and hides them from the audience for the vast majority of the movie.This movie could have been greater then the sum of its parts, but in the end I am just relieved that it was as good as it was, given the circumstances surrounding it's tie-ins to the larger picture. The DC Extended Universe is coming to an end, and taking its place is the DC Universe, and I do not know if this movie will be successful enough to continue on the family legacy. I do hope that Xolo Mariduena continues to play Blue Beetle because he is a charismatic and humorous talent that can make an audience both laugh and cry, but above all else I hope that Nana (Barraza) joins the Justice League alongside Superman and Batman.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The script is awful which directly affects the performances. It didn't matter whether the actors were good or not because the writing was so bad that it made their job an impossible task. I really enjoyed Xolo Maridueña in Cobra Kai and he does what he can, but much like the rest of the cast the horrible dialogue is just too much for him to overcome. The only actor who is able to maintain some semblance of dignity (ironically) is George Lopez. The writers knew exactly what they wanted to do with Rudy and his character was the best written in the film. It is obvious that Susan Sarandon is having a good time playing a cartoon villain but she had a lot more success playing an actual cartoon villain in Enchanted. Here she is just over-the-top in a movie that can't decide whether it wants to be superhero or reality based. Overall, I can see why this did so poorly and that no one saw it.

However, the recent release of Blue Beetle, unfortunately, falls short of this potential, failing to deliver a captivating origin story.The film follows Jaime Reyes, a young Mexican-American teenager who discovers an ancient alien scarab that merges with his backpack and grants him transformative superpowers. As Jaime navigates the challenges of high school and his newfound responsibilities as a superhero, he must also confront the villainous forces that threaten his city.Despite the promising premise, Blue Beetle fails to capture the essence of what makes a truly compelling superhero origin story. The film's narrative struggles to find its footing, meandering through a series of predictable events and uninspired plotlines.Jaime Reyes, the titular Blue Beetle, is a character with a rich backstory and untapped potential. However, Xolo Maridueña's portrayal falls flat, lacking the charisma and emotional depth necessary to make the character truly relatable and engaging. The supporting cast, while offering some semblance of personality, fails to elevate the lackluster script.The film's action sequences, a crucial element in any superhero film, are another major disappointment. The CGI is subpar and outdated, creating a visual spectacle that feels cheap and uninspired. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and lack any real excitement or intensity, failing to capture the thrill and excitement of superhero action.Blue Beetle's failure to deliver on so many levels is a missed opportunity to introduce a new and promising superhero to the cinematic landscape. The film's weak performances, uninspired story, and lacklustre action sequences leave audiences with a sense of disappointment, failing to ignite the passion and excitement that make superhero movies so popular.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was a good surprise for the first half of the movie. Not extraordinary in any way, but quite enjoyable. Then the writers made a bad choice for the tone of the movie by creating a drama in the middle of the movie (which was totally not necessary) , and then make all the characters just have real fun while using cool tools and killing bad guys like nothing happened. The movie lost me at that point. There is even a scene where the grandma have a big smile while the others are trying to act a bit like they still feel at least a bit what happened. God, this is so stupid. No real emotions, and the characters that were quite relatable weren't anymore. I think the writers do not understand that while people usually need fun to engage in a movie these days, it's not actually bad to had true emotions at some point when the viewer is engaged with the characters. But no, let's just have fun the entire time, regardless of having to confront grief. You can laugh while living such grief, and even just after, but you can't just ignore it and just make fun all the time, just by saying ""it's not the time to cry"". If you want to keep that tone for the entire show, don't create such drama in the middle of it, or process it correctly. Guardians of the galaxy got it right, this movie didn't. I bet that the same movie, just avoiding the drama, would have had 7+ on average reviews instead of 6+. There is a lot more to say, indeed, but that was the main concern on my part. Stop writing on stuff you never actually experienced, or at least do solid research on it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A highlight for me was the battle scene using one of Motley Crue's biggest hits.What can I say I'm a fan and have seen them play live in concert in Brizneyland.So far it's barely made back its 120 million dollar budget at the world wide box office, but it will probably become a cult hit on streaming especially with an audience largely ignored by the major studios including Warner Brothers for far too long.James Gunn's (""Guardians of the Galaxy"") influence is already being felt at the normally austere, dark, moody halls of DC.He's bound to shake things up with his own whacky sense of humour now he's in town.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Quite possibly the least original film I have ever seen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9659736/?ref_=tt_urv","gnperuti","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur178239163/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2024","Iron Man. Green Lantern. Venom. These are just some of the movies Blue Beetle very obviously rips off. I know Hollywood has been seriously bereft of originality recently, but it shouldn't be this blatant. I've seen Disney remakes with more originality than this. The plot and character motivations are every predictable cliche you could expect. If you think a certain plot thread is going to go in a certain direction that's been done to death, odds are it will. And of course, there are a ton of plot holes to boot.But it doesn't stop there. The dialogue is also really stock, including multiple uses of ""Do you remember"", which is one step above ""As you know"". The art direction steals a bunch of designs. The suit is Iron Man mixed with Spider-Man's Infinity War outfit. There's a ship that looks like the one from Watchmen. Towards the end, there's a gauntlet that's literally a Power Glove. Even the Blue Beetle theme rips off a chord from the Imperial March from Star Wars.The acting is hit and miss. It ranges from surprising bland (the main character) to surprisingly annoying (his family, especially George Lopez and the sister; seriously how did Helen Mirren get a Razzie nomination over her?) to surprisingly too good for this movie (the villain; not even this film could stop Susan Sarandon from being awesome as usual).The pacing is way too slow. Part of that is because I don't care about the characters. But also, it has a similar problem to the Fantastic Four movies: not enough action. It takes a full 45 minutes for the first action scene to happen and there are only 3 in total.So, is anything good? Well, the suit, despite it's lack of originality, is cool and does some cool stuff. The visual effects are decent for the most part. There are some funny lines. And when we actually do get some action, it's well done and entertaining enough.Overall, Blue Beetle isn't one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it may be one of the laziest. The total lack of creativity here perfectly shows how the DCEU was on it's last legs. If they do make anymore of these films (James Gunn says they plan to), here's hoping for more effort next time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Although there seemed to be some blatant alignment to Marvel fight seems, armour and weaponry. There is even a hammer scene that made me think Mjolnir was on set.Really wish I hadn't bothered, DC and MC are now about as terrible as each other.

Not because I know much about the hero itself, but mainly because I was looking forward to something different other than The Flash or something that we've already known about for so long. Blue Beetle I knew from the Injustice video games as a playable character. The trailer itself had looked pretty cool to me and I honestly had some hopes about it. However, ehhh, it wasn't all what I had really expected it to be.The cast of this movie is fine. The effects are cool as well. That's really why I am giving it a 5/10. That's not my problem. I had a problem with how long the film was. How much it seemed to drag for me, as there wasn't really much of an engaging story to keep me focused throughout the movie. Plus, it got super annoying watching Blue Beetle the whole movie, being completely clueless on how to use his powers and running away like a scaredy-cat all the time. I would've at least thought that after the beginning, we see Blue Beetle adapt fully within himself and then become this ruthless, badass hero that we would've love to have seen. I mean, was this the actual intention the writers wanted with this character? To be lost throughout the whole 2 hours?Kinda glad I watched this movie in the comfort of my own home when I was in boredom. I couldn't have imagined seeing this on the big screen. If I did, it would've made me even more disappointed. Other than that, Blue Beetle is something I would most likely not be watching again. And the post credits weren't all that exciting to me either. So I can say for myself that I don't have anything to be looking forward to.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

watched it in IMAX and it did feel good for sure since I'm hearing/watching this superhero for the first time, the entire film was nicely made except for the family drama part which felt like a cliche and the boring drama of family coming to save a superhero was the most draggy part, removing that part alone from the movie would've made this one a racy entertainer.Overall, it was a good one-time watchable superhero fictional drama.ChatGPT Summary:
I had the opportunity to watch this film in IMAX, and the experience was undeniably enjoyable. As someone who was encountering this particular superhero for the first time, the overall cinematic experience was satisfying. However, despite its many merits, the film does have a few drawbacks that are worth mentioning.One of the film's strongest attributes is its overall production quality. The entire movie is well-crafted, boasting impressive visuals, engaging action sequences, and a captivating storyline. For a viewer who is new to this superhero's world, the film serves as an excellent introduction, immersing them in a visually stunning and immersive cinematic universe.The film's ability to draw the audience into this superhero's world and maintain their interest throughout is a testament to its well-executed storytelling. The pacing of the narrative, the character development, and the integration of various elements of the superhero mythos all contribute to a cohesive and engaging viewing experience.However, there is one notable aspect of the film that detracts from its overall quality. The inclusion of a family drama subplot feels somewhat clichéd and, at times, drags down the film's momentum. The idea of family coming to the rescue of a superhero is a familiar trope in the genre, and in this instance, it comes across as a somewhat uninspired narrative choice.Had the film omitted this family drama subplot, it might have been a more streamlined and thrilling cinematic experience. The absence of this particular storyline could have allowed the film to focus more squarely on the superhero's journey, his challenges, and his growth, which are often the most compelling aspects of such narratives.Nonetheless, it's important to note that the film still manages to deliver a satisfying one-time watchable superhero fictional drama. While the family drama element may not have been a highlight, it doesn't entirely overshadow the film's strengths. The superhero's journey, the world-building, and the action sequences are more than enough to keep audiences engaged and entertained.In conclusion, my IMAX experience with this film was undoubtedly enjoyable, particularly as a first-time introduction to this superhero. The film succeeds in many aspects, offering impressive visuals and a well-crafted storyline. However, the inclusion of a clichéd family drama subplot does detract from the overall experience and results in moments of drag. Nevertheless, it remains a solid one-time watch for fans of superhero fiction, showcasing the potential for a thrilling and entertaining cinematic journey if certain narrative elements were refined.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

At the core it's is about a Mexican family and although they are caricatures the family dynamic rings true. The special effects are not the best but that doesn't matter when you are rooting for the heroes and engaged in the story.

There's no real star in here, so it was probably just a tussle behind the cameras as this effort to combine the desire to make a movie about family (specifically a weirdly secular but traditional Mexican family) with the needs of a big-budget action spectacle. About Blue Beetle.Jaime (Xolo Mariduena) is a university graduate in America coming home to Mexico to help his family rise out of poverty. For that, he got a pre-law degree. I hate this. This is stupid. The opening is just this collection of Millennial angst about how college is a waste of money and income inequality, and it makes no sense at all. The idea that a college degree, no matter what it's in, would lead to upward mobility is such a nonsense belief based on data from decades ago when college degrees were far rarer in the world. Someone who thinks that a pre-law degree would be the path to wealth anywhere is a fool. The only reason to get into pre-law is to go to law school, and Jaime specifically says to his sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) that he doesn't want to go to grad school (specifically grad school, not law school) because it will just lead to more debt. I mean, none of this ultimately matters in the longer stretch of the film's story, so it's easily forgotten. However, this is how you begin your film: a fool of an idiot who thinks a pre-law degree is going to magically help him make his family wealthy instead of...say...a mechanical engineering degree that he can't find a job for because there are too many other graduates, or something.Anyway, Milagro gets him a job at a local resort as low-level service. When she uses the guest bathroom in front of Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the CEO of Kord Industries that owns the resort, she fires them both. Witnessed by Victoria's niece, Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), the two are out of jobs until Jenny offers to help Jaime get another if she stops by the central tower the next day. That also happens to be the day that she discovers that Victoria has found the scarab, a mysterious object in the shape of the insect that has mystical powers. In a rushed handoff, she gives it to Jaime while trying to evade Victoria's henchmen, the scarab choosing to bind with Jaime and make him into the Blue Beetle.So, why does the scarab bind with Jaime? At no point does the film make the case, simply repeating the fact over and over again. The problem is that it doesn't make sense. The Beetle's consciousness completely takes over Jaime's actions. He has no say in what happens for a long stretch. When he does finally gain some control, it's to tone down the Beetle's levels of violence. Essentially, the Beetle is a Terminator, and Jaime reprograms it to take knee shots (but with blue special effects because super hero movie budget). Why would the Beetle choose someone who is so materially different in outlook about the use of violence from it? They're obviously not that compatible. And then, on top of it, what does the Beetle need with a living human anyway? Seems like, if it needs a living body to function as the suit, it could take the dumbest person it could find and just control it while ignoring the person's inputs. Essentially this whole thing makes no sense.Anyway, getting past that, the film largely becomes a more standard CGI slug fest with the only real wrinkle being the emphasis on family. Jaime is from a smallish Mexican family, headed by Alberto (Damian Alcazar), who has lost his job and had a recent heart attack. There's also Jaime's grandmother Nana (Adriana Barraza) who has a secret past but an exterior of just a nice old lady. When Jaime ends up getting kidnapped by Victoria, they have to band together with Jenny, who secretly is the daughter of the original Blue Beetle who mysteriously disappeared more than a decade before. They use his tech to get Jaime out of Victoria's bunker of a base, being wacky as they do it. Sure, a good bit of it doesn't make sense (Nana being able to effectively hold and use a gatling gun that looks like it weighs at least a couple of hundred pounds is...thin, especially when she needs help getting up off the ground in the film's final scene, but whatever, I guess). It's colorful, decently photographed, and has a sense of fun to it, even if, again, little of it makes much sense. There's a connecting through mutual trauma, or something, with Victoria's chief henchman, Ignacio (Raoul Max Trujillo), and the destruction of family in the middle of a movie about how family is everything because Sarandon's character is American, I guess. I dunno.I didn't hate it. It has its moments. It's dumb, though. It makes little sense. It's helped by looking pretty good throughout. Also, what is with the insistence on making a Mexican family so thoroughly secular? Isn't part of being traditionally Mexican tied intimately with being Christian? The only time it comes through is when Nana gives Jaime a blessing before he enters the tower, but there's stuff around death and even a look into the afterlife, and Jaime's father just calls it ""the universe"" having a purpose.Anyway, it's not the worst of the DCEU, but it was never going to be good enough to raise the franchise from the dead. It's manic, over-produced, has some small amount of charm, and feels redundant of a whole bunch of super hero films that came before. It's not good, is what I'm saying.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Other than that it's the same recipe as every superhero origin movie for the last 20 years. In fact as others have said it just feels like DC decided to copy both Spiderman and Ironman at the same time so they didn't have to bother with two film franchises. Loaded with predictably cheesy moments where it looked like the hero would lose but magically finds more power to defeat the badguy at the end. The bad guys were entirely forgettable and dull. For most of the film I couldn't have told you either of their names at any point. If this is DC's idea to compete with Marvel then I won't be watching many of their films. It just feels like a spoof copy with the same formula and a few jokes thrown in.Also, for the love of god, could we please have something a bit more interesting than evil white capitalist as the badguy for a change?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie immerses viewers in the richness of the region, beautifully capturing its landscapes, culture, and values. The quality of the ensemble cast is evident in each performance, lending depth and authenticity to the characters.What truly sets this film apart is its skillful incorporation of humor, which strikes a perfect balance between light-heartedness and the serious superhero narrative. This touch of levity doesn't detract from the film's emotional depth but rather enhances its relatability and entertainment value.As a superhero film, Blue Beetle doesn't shy away from the classic elements that fans love. The exhilarating action sequences, breathtaking visuals, and a compelling origin story contribute to the film's overall appeal. It pays homage to the genre's traditions while infusing it with fresh perspectives and cultural significance.Beyond its engaging plot, the movie impressively navigates the complexities of Latin American identity, celebrating its diversity and history. From the bustling streets to the heart of the Amazon rainforest, every setting feels authentic and resonates with the essence of the region.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

The story follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a young man who gets superpowers after discovering an alien scarab in a takeaway container he was meant to guard with his life. The plot is engaging and well-paced, with enough twists and turns to keep me interested. Maridueña delivers a standout performance, and his character's journey of self-discovery and acceptance is one of the movie's strongest aspects. Other characters are well-developed and relatable. Each one has their own unique personality and motivations.Angel Manuel Soto, the director, brings a fresh and unique perspective to the superhero genre - which is a relief given the many ""template"" superhero movies we've had over the years. Blue Beetle is visually stunning, with some truly breathtaking shots. The score and soundtrack are excellent, and the cinematography is top-notch. The special effects are also excellent, with the alien scarab and Jaime's superpowers being particularly impressive. The dialogue is well-written and engaging, with some memorable lines. The scarab's interactions with Jaime provide some of the movie's funniest and most memorable moments. The editing is also excellent, and everything flows smoothly from scene to scene.Blue Beetle explores themes of family, identity, and the immigrant experience, which are rarely explored in superhero movies. Blue Beetle handles them with sensitivity and nuance. Mexican culture is presented with little fanfare or explanation, which is a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood approach of exoticising or stereotyping other cultures. And Jaime's family, the Reyes family, is a central part of the movie, with Jaime's relationship with his parents and younger sister providing a solid emotional core.Blue Beetle is a fun and engaging superhero movie that delivers on all fronts.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

I do have to say though, I think many jokes and references might go over non latinxs heads, which is why I guess some people say some jokes were not landing.Some negative in the film, as it is becoming an issue with a lot of this superhero movies, is the very flat almost cartoonish villain. Sarandon cast and acting was... a choice. Not terrible but quite basic and forgettable. We definetely need better writing for the villains in this moviesOverall the story is not super deep and yes, quite cliché and predictable but is not so terrible. If you have high hopes for this film probably you'll be dissapointed but if you look for a fun family movie time this passes quite good.This film, at least is much better than the Shazam 2 mess.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

The bond the Reyes family has feels so real and like nothing could break it apart. The chemistry between all the actors is some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie. While the first act of the film does feel a bit slow, by the end of act two you will realize how crucial the pace is to the story. Even though this film does an excellent job of being a standalone entry in this new universe, the little references to other DC properties are done well and by no means feel like they are beating a dead horse. The music throughout has a 80's feel that reminds you of the height of popularity for Ted Kord's Blue Beetle. What stands out the most in this film is the emotion. Everything feels real instead of the usual forced emotion we've been made used to over the last ten years. I'd be lying if I said I didn't tear up. Well done DC, you've pulled me back in. You will laugh. You will cry.

This is a film with heart, humour, humility and humanity. The usual action sequences are all there, and they are beautifully realised, but it is the performances of all concerned that elevate this film to a very high level within the superhero genre. Xolo Mariduena is perfectly cast in the lead role, displaying all of the aforementioned qualities of the movie as a whole. It is giving nothing away in saying that the final action sequence is not the ""usual"" set piece of seemingly never-ending bombast that can detract from the overall rating of what may have preceded it, because Blue Beetle is ultimately about human connections, kindness and the importance of family. To my mind, Blue Beetle is up there with the original Wonder Woman movie and Man of Steel in the DC universe which has, sadly, not had the careful curation of the Marvel universe. Blue Beetle deserved a sequel and a series but will sadly receive neither because of the misguided curation of DC's ouevre. The film did not fail in itself because it is excellent. It was failed by the disjointed narrative and the lack of a common story line or thread to link the DC universe cohesively.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Visual Effects for CGI was pretty good and so well done, and so glad it's not all that goofy like this year's The Flash did. The Flash (2023) had messy goofy CGI effects and it was not that enjoyable, like Blue Beetle is.Xolo Maridueña, from the number 1 hit show: ""Cobra Kai"", did an amazing job with his performance and he's a super star of the show, and let's not forget the number 1 comedian: George Lopez! He also steals the whole show with his part! Every Latino actors did such a beautiful job, and Susan Sarandon did a great job playing the villain.This movie has so much laughs, it also has heartfelt moments, and every best action parts! This movie was all about family, strength, and love and to never forget who you believed in. The director: Angel Miguel Soto, did a splendid job with his best Superhero work for DC. This movie had pretty good story telling, and Blue Beetle is the first Latino Superhero we need!10/10.","3 out of 22 found this helpful.

Don't know the other cast members names but Jamie's sister was very good as well. Anybody could enjoy this movie. You don't have to be into super hero movies as I myself was not a huge fan of marvel after Captain America 3. Hopefully the first movie in a trilogy. Would love to see Xolo playing blue beetle in many movies to come. Just like every super hero movie there is the super cliche ""losing someone that meant a lot to me"" moment. However other than that the only thing you knew that was gonna happen is Jamie not dying. All in all is a must watch and great movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's important to note that evaluating this film in comparison to much larger-scale productions like Avengers: Infinity War is unfair. Both have distinct approaches, where Blue Beetle seeks a less grandiose and more casual approach, while Avengers aims for grandiosity as its primary goal. Therefore, I choose to evaluate each work considering its own proposals instead of comparing them.Within the scope of Blue Beetle's proposal, I highlight the exceptional work done. The performances, especially Xolo Mariduena's as the protagonist, were quite satisfactory. The direction significantly contributed to the emotion of the scenes, while the editing was competently executed. Regarding CGI, a recurring topic in discussions, it didn't bother me at any point.For me, the primary metric in a film is the emotions it can evoke, and Blue Beetle managed to do so abundantly. There are moments of anger, sadness, and anxiety that keep the viewer engaged, avoiding any sense of boredom.Naturally, the film has its negative points, such as some moments where plot conveniences exceed limits, which might hinder the viewer's experience. Additionally, a family character can be irritating at certain moments, something that personally bothered me.Overall, Blue Beetle succeeds in achieving its goal of offering a less grandiose and more relaxed cinematic experience.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Each member brings something distinct and special to the table, making the movie a joy to watch.

(ChatGPT is amazing, it pretty much summed up what I wanted to convey in one second. It saved me hours)""Blue Beetle"" has resonated strongly within the Latino community due to its significant representation and cultural relevance. The film, centered around Jaime Reyes, not only showcases a superhero narrative but also delves into Jaime's heritage and background, effectively reflecting the experiences of many Latinos. The character's identity struggle, balancing life as a teenager and a newfound superhero, mirrors the challenges faced by numerous individuals navigating their cultural identity in a diverse society.The movie beautifully weaves elements of Latino culture into the storyline, embracing traditions, familial values, and community connections. Jaime's family dynamics, filled with warmth, support, and strong ties, authentically depict the close-knit nature prevalent in many Latino households. Additionally, the film subtly incorporates Spanish language and cultural references, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.Moreover, the representation of Jaime as a Latino superhero is empowering and inspiring for many within the community. His character embodies resilience, courage, and a sense of responsibility, becoming a role model for audiences who rarely see themselves portrayed as superheroes on screen. This representation not only fosters a sense of pride but also fosters a feeling of belonging and recognition within the Latino audience.Furthermore, ""Blue Beetle"" goes beyond mere representation by addressing relevant societal issues that affect the Latino community. The film touches upon themes of identity, discrimination, and the importance of embracing one's heritage. By addressing these issues within a superhero context, the movie effectively highlights their significance while delivering an entertaining and relatable story.In conclusion, ""Blue Beetle"" stands as a significant milestone in portraying the diversity and richness of the Latino community on the big screen. Through its compelling storyline, cultural authenticity, and representation of a Latino superhero, the movie not only entertains but also resonates deeply with audiences, offering a powerful reflection of the experiences, values, and challenges faced by many within the Latino community.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Typical, but Fun Superhero Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9282789/?ref_=tt_urv","ejmalek","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur107329935/?ref_=tt_urv","25 August 2023","Superhero shows are everywhere. They are inescapable. There are always shows based on Batman, Spiderman, Avengers, Justice League, etc.,. Then, last week, another one arrived in the form of the Blue Beetle - a superhero that I've never heard of until I started seeing the previews for this year's flick ""Blue Beetle"" directed by Angel Manuel Soto. Now that I've watched that film, I can say that I'm glad that I did because even though it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it certainly stands out from other superhero movies with its emphasis on heritage and family.""Blue Beetle"" is about Jaime (pronounced Hi-may) Reyes (played by Xolo Maridueña) and how he becomes the titular superhero. An alien scarab chooses the recent college graduate to be its symbiotic host, providing him with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers. This forever changes his destiny.Like I said before, I never heard of Blue Beetle until this film came out this year. I did some research, and it turns out that Jaime is the third person to have done the suit since the character first appeared in the DC Universe in 1939. The other two are Dan Garrett and Ted Kord, whose suits actually appear in the flick while Jaime, Jenny (Ted's daughter and played by Bruna Marquezine), and Uncle Rudy (played by George Lopez) explore Ted's lab. This is a nice and clever way to acknowledge the Blue Beetles who came before the current one.The flick itself is not particularly innovative, which is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. While watching it, I noticed that it took elements from other superheroes films from the last 5-10 years. There always has to be romance even if it's not all that necessary. In this film, it's between Jaime and Jenny. The latter's aunt (played by Susan Sarandon) runs Kord Industries and is the main antagonist, but Jenny wants nothing to do with the company, especially ever since her father's disappearance. I get her involvement since she is the reason why the scarab gets into Jaime's hands, but I don't know if the romance was all that necessary. They could've developed a friendship based on justice and family. The sibling relationship between Jamie and his younger sister Milagro (played by Belissa Escobedo) is very reminiscent of that between T'Challa and his sister Shuri in the first ""Black Panther"" movie, mainly how annoying, blunt, smart, and loving the women are. It was still entertaining to see the siblings interact, especially when they are on the rooftop.There are also tropes that are present in the film that audiences have definitely seen before. For example, there's a scene between Jaime and his recently deceased father Alberto (played by Damián Alcázar), in which the latter convinces the former that it's not his time while the superhero is on the brink of death. I'm sure there are many people who have watched similar scenes in other flicks like ""Black Panther."" In another example, the grandma Nana (played by Adriana Barraza) is a sweet old lady, but with a colorful past. The latter comes out when the family comes to rescue Jaime from the villains. Again, people have seen this before, but I enjoyed how Adriana fully commits to the part, especially when she yells, ""Down with the Imperialists!"" in Spanish.Despite not being reinventive, ""Blue Beetle"" still has many things going for it: the Latine heritage and family. This film marks the first time that a Latino superhero has been depicted on screen, which Soto doesn't take lightly. The Latine experience is depicted in multiple ways in the flick. This ranges from the poor, but colorful neighborhood, in which the Reyes reside in, to the acknowledgement of systematic racism that Jaime and Milagro endure even though he has a college degree. My favorite is the soundtrack, which features plenty of Latine-inspired songs including ""Tú Serás Mi Baby"" - Spanish version of ""Be My Baby"" - by Juvented Crasa, which plays during a party thrown by the evil corporation Kord Industries with Latine waiters.The strongest element that the movie has going is the theme of family. Jamie's means everything to him even if they drive him up the wall. Also, they may or may not inadvertently had a hand in the scarab choosing him. Besides that, what makes this work is the chemistry among the cast. They are insanely believable as a family because of how comfortable they are around each other, and the best scenes involve them in some form. In addition, there's a villain named Carapax (played by Raoul Max Trujillo) who taunts Jaime by saying that family makes him weak. Later, Jaime discovers Carapax's backstory, which involves his own kin and how he was abducted into war. This gives him understanding as well as the courage to say to the antagonist that family is what makes him strong and not to kill him. In addition, one of the first shots of the movie is of the necklace containing a photo that Carapax wears. It's later revealed that the picture is of his own family.Because this is a superhero film, I have to talk about the performances. Xolo Maridueña, who is best known for his television work in ""Parenthood"" and ""Cobra Kai,"" is fine as the titular character. He has some charm and works best with the actors who play his family as well as in scenes where Jaime is struggling with his powers. If ""Blue Beetle"" gets a sequel, I would like to see him grow into the suit, uh I mean character. The standout performer of the movie is George Lopez, who plays the anarchist eccentric Uncle Rudy aka the Mexican Doc Brown. He infuses Rudy with elements from his standup comedy and surprisingly with a lot of heart. Also, I dig his long beard; it really suits the character.All in all, while ""Blue Beetle"" may not be the most original superhero flick, it stands out in all the right places. Since it's the first movie with a Latino superhero, the film embraces its Latine heritage in every way. It's also at its most powerful when family is involved. It uses a lot of tropes from other movies, yet it executes them in a delightful way. I would recommend this movie to those who love superheroes, DC Comics, and flicks with a Latine lead and themes about family. I went into watching this film knowing nothing about Blue Beetle himself, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, I couldn't have been more wrong.From its very outset, the movie sets itself apart by placing family at the forefront. The genuine chemistry between the core family members is palpable and gives the film its heart and soul. Director Angel Manuel Soto beautifully maneuvers the storyline to ensure that it's a film about family first and a superhero origin story second. This unique perspective is not only refreshing but also allows the movie to carve its own niche in an otherwise saturated superhero film genre.Xolo Maridueña of ""Cobra Kai"" fame delivers a standout performance, seamlessly blending humor, vulnerability, and action. The moments of humor are pitch-perfect, effortlessly eliciting laughter from the audience. Yet, what truly surprised me was how the movie, despite its superhero facade, managed to evoke genuine emotion, leading to an unexpected tear.Drawing comparisons, the film's tone and content have shades of ""Upgrade"" and ""Venom"", particularly given the symbiotic relationship between the protagonist and the extraterrestrial entity. There's a distinct parallel in the family dynamics with the delightful ""Shazam"" movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed as well.Visually, a notable mention goes to the decision to utilize a practical super suit in scenes where the protagonist isn't masked. This choice lends a tangible realism to the movie, making it stand out from those that rely heavily on CGI.To clarify, ""Blue Beetle"" might not redefine cinematic excellence or be labeled a ""masterpiece"", but it most certainly is a well-acted, well-crafted film that promises - and delivers - a great time. A family movie at its core, with the added thrill of a superhero narrative, ""Blue Beetle"" is a movie experience I'd strongly recommend. And in a time where some superhero movies are missing the mark, this one hits its target with finesse.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It seemed like that was all they really wanted to harp on. Well if you can't figure out that much from previews than why did you even sit through it?As I'm watching this, I'm wondering what Robert Rodriguez could have done with this movie. He had a string of decent movies involving comic book characters and even started his own franchise in the very fun movie Spy Kids.After the disappointment of those other marvel movies like Shazam and that God awful Black Adam, this was a refreshing surprise with its humor and heart. The kid from Cobra Kai leads the way among a group of veteran actors and comedians to make a fun 2hr and 6 minute movie.The blue beetle itself is some sort of relic when hosted with the chosen person it wants, that person possesses all the strength of their imagination. George Lopez in a supporting role lends to some creative inventions and is the backbone of its sense of humor. I've got to say this was a refreshing take on those cheesy other DC movies that have come out because this one is actually good. Above all, I recommend this one because this the kind of superhero movie all those other DC disappointments should have been. Although I do have one question: if anyone can be a superhero now, does that mean we can be stuck with that awful Conan O'Brien trying don a cape now?? God I sure hope not. ****1/2 of *****","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

I would defo watch it again. I didn't realise how much I needed this until now.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

James Gunn's DC Universe kicks off with a bang, serving up an exciting and expertly crafted origin story that's anything but ordinary. From introducing a fresh hero to a wide audience to weaving in Mexican culture, language, and music, this film nails it! Prepare for some intense themes that'll get you talking.Xolo Mariduñea brilliantly lights up his character (Jamie Reyes/ Blue Beetle ) creating space for the supporting cast to embrace a delightful comedic charm. A special nod goes out to George Lopez (Rudy Reyes) , Belissa Escobedo (Milagro Reyes), and Adriana Barraza (Nana Reyes) for crafting moments of pure and authentic laughter.Key elements sought in an origin story are effectively met: authenticity that resonates with the character, growth as the hero navigates new-found powers , heartache , and a burgeoning romantic interest with Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezina). The portrayal of the love interest is captivating, rooted in the concept of Familia , and resonates with profound emotional chords. Certain scenes may evoke tears from viewers.In the end, Blue Beetle presents a startling and remarkable cinematic experience. It is certainly worth watching. Regardless of whether one is an avid superhero enthusiast, anyone with a Mexican background will embrace this narrative. I rate Blue Beetle a solid 4 out of 5.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

The film had heart, action, drama and comedy. The special effects were very good. The main character of Jaime Reyes was portrayed beautifully by Xolo Maridueña, I hope he stays on in the new DCU. The family dynamics were well done and you believed that they were really family that truly care and love each other. The action scenes were very dynamic and did a good job keeping me entertained.The villains were pretty generic and forgettable, which is a shame as one of them was played by Susan Sarandon.Now, where the film looses a point from me is the constant left wing politics which seem to mire much of today's so called entertainment.Overall, a highly entertaining and enjoyable film which I would definitely rewatch.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

It is a great family film and the cast and collaborative piece of entertainment art they produced with this is out of this world and then some.I think that the dialogue and some of the scenes with the abuela and the Tio Rudy were probably the best and really moved the movie forward to give you both jam-packed, edge-of-your-seat thrills while throwing in some really epic heartwrenching and wholesome loving moments as well. I was more than pleasantly surprised.I was totally captivated and loved every single detail about this movie from the DC universe. I really loved the way this family worked together and how each of the characters was a solid and comical character on their own - not just a supporting role but an extension of the very core of the most powerful emotion in the universe, LOVE.I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action superhero films that stick to your heart and leave you laughing, cheering, and smiling the whole entire way!","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

This is one of the first super hero movies where you do not have to be afraid of your child feeling like killing for the greater good is OK. Even one of the villains reclaims his humanity.The main character, Jaime, is so relatable. The family is wonderful and a sense of love and togetherness no matter what. My son cried when Jaime's dad died which is great since Marvel puts him to sleep. I loved all the Spanish and Mexican references. This film really touched my heart and my son's. My non- Latino husband liked it very much.There was comedy, action, great acting, and sad moments. A great villain played wonderfully by Susan Sarandon.The Reyes family really delivered a great representation of a Latino family. Together they are the Blue Beetle. This was a movie about humanity more than about some alien or other planet super heroes and villains.Yes, grandma ""nana"" was over the top but it was still great.I have not seen the last eight Marvel movies because they have no depth. Finally, a movie that has heart.I am Cuban-American and I am very happy to see a Latino cast that can appeal to a wide audience because you don't have to kill to be a super hero. You can find a super hero in your family just like Jaime's dad who sacrificed everything for his family.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even though it all matches the expectations, the most surprising thing I saw in the theater was the fake Iron Man. Of course, the real Iron Man, after three movies, we know all about his weapons and strengths. Without giving away too much, I can definitely recommend the part where this happens as the highlight to watch in the theater.

The critics and audience consensus say that it's an okay film, good at best. 6.3 on IMDB, 3.1 on Letterboxd, B+ on Cinemascore, 78% on Rotten Tomatoes and 61 on Metacritic. All of this is to say that I liked the movie more than most. Sure, it has it's flaws: most notably the formulaic script. Superhero fatigue is all too real, and if superheroes aren't your jam, you probably won't like this movie.As a fan of comic book movies, especially the soon-to-be deceased DCEU, the last few entries have been underwhelming, to say the least. Apart from The Batman, most entries have been lacking: Black Adam, Shazam: Fury of the Gods!, The Flash. I'm glad to report that Blue Beetle delivers - at least to an extent. Sure, the plot is generic, but the movie has heart, especially when it's focusing on the Reyes family. It may be predictable, but it's fun, funny and even emotional, at times. The score, cinematography and direction are all worthy of praise too. As is Xolo Maridueña and Bruna Marquezine's chemistry. George Lopez also delivers, as usual.Suffice to say, while it doesn't reinvent the wheel, Blue Beetle delivers a great film - one filled with fun and heart. It's surely better than the other entries DC have put out this year: Shazam and Flash, though no where near the masterpiece that was The Batman.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

From its captivating storyline to its authentic portrayal of the immigrant experience, this film holds a unique place in the hearts of both comic enthusiasts and those seeking a meaningful cinematic experience.As a fervent follower of superhero narratives, I can confidently declare that Blue Beetle ranks comfortably within my top 5 favorite superhero films. The narrative's blend of action, emotion, and relatable themes is a testament to its exceptional storytelling. What struck me most profoundly was the genuine connection I felt with the character and his circumstances, given my own experiences as a Latin individual.What sets Blue Beetle apart is its masterful depiction of the immigrant journey. The director's ability to translate the complexities of life as an immigrant onto the screen is nothing short of astonishing. The trials and triumphs that the protagonist faces mirror the struggles that many immigrants encounter in real life. This movie captures the essence of longing for a better future while simultaneously grappling with the challenges of adapting to a new culture. It serves as a reminder that heroes are not just defined by their superhuman abilities but by their resilience in the face of adversity.A pivotal aspect that contributes to the film's brilliance is the casting of Xolo in the role of Jaime Reyes, the Blue Beetle. This choice is a stroke of genius, as Xolo embodies the character flawlessly. His performance is both sincere and captivating, elevating the character beyond the pages of the comic book and bringing him to life on the silver screen. The casting is so impeccable that one can't help but feel that Jaime was destined to be portrayed by Xolo all along.As I immersed myself in the world of Blue Beetle, I couldn't help but reflect on the character's potential future in the cinematic universe. I fervently hope that this compelling character continues to grace the screens in future films. The rich depth of Jaime's narrative arc and the issues he addresses are deserving of exploration and expansion.In conclusion, the Blue Beetle movie is a triumphant fusion of superhero excitement and heartfelt storytelling. Its ability to resonate with Latin audiences, its authentic portrayal of the immigrant experience, and the outstanding performance by Xolo make it a cinematic masterpiece that deserves acclaim. As the credits rolled, I was left with a sense of anticipation and eagerness to witness the next chapter of Blue Beetle's journey on the big screen.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie doesn't fart around at all, the action starts pretty quick and doesn't stop. All the actors played their parts well and the comic relief injections were fast and furious.

Not only was he the first hispanic (I'm half and half), but what i thought was even cooler was that he was the first super hero from the southwest (El Paso). Being from northern NM and have visited Las cruces, NM, El Paso, TX, and Juarez, MX, I was happy to find a hero from my neighborhood, not some super hero swinging from, New York, Gotham or Metropolis. I loved looking at the artwork. Many NY artist have never been to the SW, and can't draw the Southwestern desert to save their lives, and to compensate, they draw tons of Saguaros, a cactus only located in the Sonoran desert of Arizona ansd Mexico not the Chihuahuan desert of Texas and New Mexico.I know that it is difficult to bring the written/drawn comic world to screen, but given that there is a huge film presence in NM, a lot of scifi (roswell) and scientific (Los Alamos) communities to draw from, it wouldn't be difficult to film Blue Beetle in his native environs vs a made up city in Florida....and the reason for the 9 stars.Regardless of location. I laughed my head off, as I said half my family is latino and the Jaime's Nana is combination of my grandma and tia. About 30% of the expression were unknown to me as my background is Panamanian not Mexican, but what i did understand both verbally and body language made me laugh.

The good news is all tropes old and new are executed with 100% energy and vitality, which says a lot about the teamwork of all concerned.Its entertainment value is enhanced by the new Latin angles on Spiderman; including, a smiling anti-Imperialist Grandma. Ha!Geore Perez is useful as the lead acts as the normal ""foil"" for the wacky supporting cast around him.The VFX are top-drawer delivering even more visceral Iron-Man vs Iron-Man melee combat and body slamming impacts.I liked the female lead. Susan Saradan has eh job of anchoring the villainous energy and commits fully despite the tropes she is saddled with.While I get the creators' focus has to be on the origin story, to me BB seems too powerful. Who else can he fight except Superman?","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It may not be anything new in terms of story, but it does have it's own charm. It is not as dark as other DC movies.The movie centers more around the family and such, and carries a lot of emotion.The chemistry between the actors was quite good. Xolo Maridueña, Damián Alcázar and George Lopez deliver a very good performance.The sountrack has a nice 80s synth vibe and the CGI was actually quite good (unlike in The Flash).It might not be the best DC movie, it is cheeseband a bit predictable, and there is still room for improvement, but it has heartwarming and heartwrenching moments, and is overall a very enjoyable movie.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

In Superman movies they forget the clumsy and nerdy side of Clark, in the newer Batman movies the excentric party side of Bruce Wayne is left out and so on.Most times the movies do not have fun scenes, are mostly filmed in the dark and are a little creepy.Aquaman and Shazam turned this around, and Blue Beetle takes it one step further.The used music is great, a lot of scenes in daylight and even the action scenes mostly clearly visible. The backstory of the character is well told, with enough details, there are enough emotions going around and you feel connected to the characters.I liked the jokes in the movie, and the feel of a 21 year old kid way over his head in trouble and being guided by his familia.All in all, refreshing course they are working on. Hope Kevin Feige will be able to continue this.This movie is just fun to watch and deserves better turnover.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Best DC movie in 2023.., with references.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9273464/?ref_=tt_urv","joew-86124","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur169539020/?ref_=tt_urv","21 August 2023","I think other users already explained and evaluated the movie in both ways, so I'll skip that part to focus directly in the relationship of the movie with the popular culture either comics, media and TV.In DC Comics Jaime Reyes was introduced as the new Blue Beetle after an event in comics (DC) named Infinite Crisis, where the second Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) died.That Kord Blue Beetle became extremely famous during the 1980s and 1990s fighting alongside great characters as Superman and Batman, member of the Post-Crisis Justice League, and Booster Gold's best friend. Once he was in coma trying to fight Doomsday where Superman died failing in his intent, and ultimately dying in 2005 with an unexpected encounter. All his gadgets and the Bug Mobile were based in the alien technology that Kord studied in the alien scarab he got from his antecesor, the original Blue Beetle from 1939, an archeologist.Same scarab, the same one like in the movie, got on the hands of Jaime Reyes becoming the new Blue Beetle. To be honest I actually don't know much what happened after 2005 as I stopped reading comics. But I rediscovered him during the cartoon Young Justice living in El Paso, Texas, helping young metahumans.So basically the movie from a comic reader perspective, has many elements from the comics: the scarab, the bug mobile (what a nostalgia!), the suit, the gadgets.I put 8 stars out of ten because of the great actors' performance, and the inclusion of Susan Sarandon. However, there's a lot of clichés that have been copied from other movies. This movie has future.And by the way for those who don't understand, the cartoonish red character with the CH inside the heart on his chest, with the antennas and hammer, is a very famous character created by Mexican television during the 1970's intending to mock the American superhero. Chapulin Colorado (Red Cricket) was his name.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Recent college grad Jaime Reyes returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it. As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab.

Yes, it was slightly predictable. Yes the acting wasn't perfect. It was just fun. A good amount of action and humor. It kind of gave me the vibe of Iron Man mixed with Ant-Man. I know there is a lot of hatred going on about this movie but I would say you should see it. If DC can build off this movie, it could be a good start to the new universe. I'm sure my 9 out of 10 is going to be looked at and criticized, but the movie deserves another run at a sequel. For this of us who have not actually read the comics, this was cool to see something that was not already main stream like Superman.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

I hardly watch DC but this, this was a powerful movie on many different levels. I think the acting was quite good, the representation of the Mexican community is everything and the portrayal of love and togetherness through Jaime Reyes' family is so so beautiful. The movie was also very funny, and I especially loved the grandmother she is so strong, wise and added a lighter touch to the sad parts. I think everything was perfectly balanced in this film, there was enough funny moments but not too many as to take away the seriousness of the film; there was a good amount of sadness as well but yet again not too much as to make the film all about it, plus you can't have a superhero origin story without a bit of loss, If there was no loss this film would not be what it is, the character development is dependent on the loss and sadness. I also really loved how they incorporated the romance between Jaime and Jenny, it was such a good slow-burn, there was constant tension between them and they were finally able to explore it at the end. It wasn't like they immediately fell for each other, it was a slow, realistic progress. Speaking of realistic, the family and their reactions and relationships are very realistically portrayed in the film. I mean if there was a blue bug that attached itself to my face and flew me out of the roof i'm pretty sure my mom would also call the police. With the negative comments, I do agree that the film might have been a bit boring or predictable to some but I do not feel that way myself, therefore the 10 stars (I also don't know how to properly rate a film lol, it's so much easier doing a review) I also find it a bit strange that the grandmother was so skilled with that massive gun, like how was she able to carry that weight as well as use it? But ofc there's a bit of a missing story which we also still need. I'm very hopeful and excited for the second movie!","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Xolo Maridueña has gained great popularity for playing Miguel Diaz in the Cobra Kai series and now as he offers his second best role in the role of Blue Beetle. It has very good special effects as usual in superhero movies and a very good balance of action and humor. The strongest point in favor of this film would be its way of representing Latino people. In fact, the film becomes a good combination of superhero cinema and Latino cinema. It has a couple of references and tributes to the world of Latin entertainment through the songs used in the soundtrack and some fragments of Mexican productions. Many of the leads are empathetic and charismatic, especially Uncle Rudy Reyes, played by George Lopez. He knows how to raise the issue of the community in the United States very well in a quite natural way. In fact, the movie feels Latino enough to take its place alongside movies like Coco, El Mariachi, Cronos, Encanto, and Machete. Definitely, Blue Beetle is one of the best movies of 2023 and a great gift for the Latin American community. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

And believe me, I have watched almost every superhero movie. It was fun, the suit looked really cool and fight scenes were fantastic.The reason why its a disaster at box office is because people are stupid. They will watch every stupid movie marvel has to offer but they hate DC. Or the reason is that DC is straight up cursed with bad luck.This movie is fun to watch for young people. The music choice is very good. If you want to watch a fun, superhero movie with not so complexity than this movie is for you.At the end I just want to say watch the movie and support DC so it makes more movies or it will go bankrupt.","1 out of 16 found this helpful.

"9","/10","One of the 4-5 best films of DCEU; despite cliche, still authentic, enjoyable and holds values","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9529070/?ref_=tt_urv","UserTheVisitor","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur141817029/?ref_=tt_urv","30 December 2023","I do not understand the negative reviews; there are much worse superhero films out there; certainly no one could have expected this film to be a historical masterpiece. Here is what You can expect realistically:+ in the comic books, there were 3 Blue Beetles, the film features the third and current one; despite this, it still gives a great hommage to the first and second Beetle characters, especially the second one;
+ while I am not an expert on Blue Beetle, as far as I can tell, the film is authentic, and You can see that the creators wanted to remain true to the character;
+ the casting is successfull, they have found persons who are great fit to their represented roles; (yes, there will be no Oscar-winning performances, but please do not expect that from a superhero film, everyone is still a good fit);
+ the action sequences are good;
+ the jokes are entertaining;
+ there is an emphasis on the family ties; and - not just because of it - but the whole film is a good family movie
+ the music is in line with the plot status; while not always great, sometimes manages to be captivating, I searched for it on Spotify after the movie;
+ yes, there are cliches, but it builds them very cleverly, and it is not that embarrassing at all;
+ yes, there will be a love plot as well, but this is also written carefully; not forced, not rushed, slowly building throughout the film;
+ suprisingly even for me.... I have to say that the film stands up for values. Which is something I did not expected from it. It is a great plus to the creators.Ok, some negatives:
All-in-all, I can recommend to watch this film. Even it is not a masterpiece, I think I will re-view it with friends.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The concept and storyline are awesome. Some good jokes, but they could have added more side kid-friendly humor to make it nice. Also the songs, old classic songs like the ones Marvel puts would have been better. Old-school loyal fans of such shows are waiting to pay money to watch and re-watch superhero movies like that.Really happy there was no bad seasons or even vulgar sexual suggestions. Thank you for keeping it clean so our family could enjoy it.I think the bad guys need a better background story and fighting should be more realistic with a little bit of slow-motion moments.From this one, I am sure there are things they can improve, but I advise that they keep it clean and family-friendly. So keep up the good work and looking forward to the next one.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I loved that they did not just stick with one genre of Spanish music, and the snippets of Kaqchikel (I'm sorry if I misspelled it, also if it's a different language as there are 22 in Guatemala I believe).

Yeah, but so are most super-hero movies.Could it do more telling about Khaji Da? Yes but I think that can be explored in a sequel or prequelWas the family over the top? Yeah but that felt authentic so it fitsIt's a fun superhero movie, simple as that. It doesn't need to be a masterpiece where everything is amazing. It's a movie that allows goofing off here and there yet it still had heart felt moments. People have become too critical and think all movies need to be a certain level of seriousness or originality from other concepts to be a good movie.What makes movies great is beyond a black and white criteria.

This review is more about the character of Sister, Milagro Reyes, played by Belissa Escobedo. And what can we learn from this character?Her character puts everyone in danger. Towards the end of the review you shall be able to connect why we need to shut down this type of character right in the beginning.After Jenny hands over the burger box to Jaime she says two things;
a.) Guard this with your life
b.) Do not open this boxJaime heeded the instructions well and gets it to home. He even shares the details with his family so that they are aware and in any case there is an emergency due to that, they are well prepared. But here comes the sister - Milagro who right from the beginning has been shown as a rebellious individual who thinks that she knows the world better than anybody. Trying to be over-smart and brash but zero-contributor in the family. When Jaime clearly said that a. And b. Have to be followed Milagro pushed him to open the box. She also got entire family to push him. The turning point was when she picked up the beetle in her hand and started to tease Jaime while he was trying to put everything in order.Now let's connect the events in the movie because of this one ignorant and immature person;0. Jaime got fired from the job.1. Jaime got transformed in to Beetle with a symbiote in his body. One may say he got super powers but he lost his original form of the body.2. His family house got partially destroyed right in the beginning when he flew out. They had to sell everything just to survive now more damages.3. Victoria Kord and her Team became enemy of the entire family. If the Beetle was not activated or Milagro was not playing with it perhaps the enemy would have been within The Kord Family and not outside in the world.4. His family was captured, the house was burnt down and his father passed away due to heart attack.5. While Jenny and Milagro are running in the tunnels one of the tunnels collapsed and Jenny could have been killed.At no point she realises that all this happened because of her. She was either near or in all the accidents that have happened in the movie including Jaime losing his job.This movie makes us realise that there could be one such person in the family, amongst the friends or work who could possibly put another person in danger. Such character(s) could be skittish at any moment, that is when one has to keep both his/her eyes open and stop the immaturity.I loved the movie, its story, portrayal of the protagonist, visuals and actions...but when I connect the dots I wanted to put Milagro Reyes in jail.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

An alien scarab chooses Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the recent college graduate with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle..My review:
For my opinion is the best 2023 movie from DC, I'm really like it. How Jaime Rayes as a hero was a good scene. There are scenes are good even the logos of Warner Bros and DC I like it. Xolo Mariduena was good when he did the character as Jaime Rayes, a last scene when he kissed Janny Kord aka Bruna Marquezine they was in love sceneThe characters are brilliant and good. The story is ok and hopefully they make the second movie of Blue beetle!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jenny gives the scarab to jaime. The scarab bonds with jaime until he became a peak looking hero.Carapax (Ignacio) is not a real villain, he was just manipulated by the OMAC technology made by victoria kord. His was almost killed by jaime during the final battle but Khaji-Da told jaime that they were not killers and Khaji-Da gives a history about Ignacio. Jaime realizes that family makes everyone strong not weak.The film's message really inspires me that family is home.

Soto takes a lighthearted approach to portray the superhero's origins and touches on themes of family, fate & purpose but the execution doesn't create any intrigue or interest.The film draws its energy from the family dynamic at play and features few colourful characters to lighten the mood but its attempts at heart & humour isn't convincing enough and also fails to make us care. The action set pieces are lame & lacklustre even if the visual effects aren't horrid to look at. And though the Latino flavour is there and performances emanate it too, the intensity is somewhat mild.Overall, Blue Beetle has a few elements working in its favour but for the most part, it remains a predictable, disposable & formulaic addition to the DCEU. Functioning in bits n pieces, the film needed a more organic & stronger foundation to deliver the desired goods coz the motivations are weak and the emotional bits are at times inauthentic. While some may find it to be a fun & amusing delight, it is a mediocre offering in my eyes.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

To save his family Jaime takes a job with Kord Industries, which is headed by a callous CEO, and gets hold of an ancient alien scarab that possesses him with unusual powers. Focusing on a Latino family does give this a somewhat refreshing quality, but for anybody who's ever bothered to study big superhero movie 101 this follows most of the usual beats despite any familial sentiment and all the quirky, colorful visual schematics. Features an amiable lead performance from Maridueña, and a hard-hearted Sarandon who makes the most of the ruthless corporate type seen in thousands of other movies. Lopez is also fun as the family uncle who serves as a political mouthpiece for the audience. There's heart, humor, and action to qualify this as moderate entertainment, but it's a ways from rescuing the currently sinking ship that is the DCEU. **","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
