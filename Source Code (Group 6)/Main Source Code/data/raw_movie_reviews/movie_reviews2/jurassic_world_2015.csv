"7","/10","Not a patch on the original Jurassic Park, and is an uneven film, but by far the best of the sequels","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3320448/?ref_=tt_urv","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","20 September 2015","The original Jurassic Park still is a personal favourite, it is an enormously fun, thrilling (with some nail-biting moments) and brilliantly made film, with one of John Williams' most memorable main themes and scene-stealing dinosaurs. The Lost World has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and Jurassic Park 3 was even more disappointing.Jurassic World is not a patch on the first Jurassic Park and I didn't quite find it the return to form that it has been touted as, but for all its faults and uneven parts it is a massive improvements on the previous two sequels and is an entertaining film in its own right that does more right than it does wrong.First things off, Jurassic World is an incredibly well-made film, it's beautifully shot with scenery that's both colourful and atmospheric and the dinosaurs look wonderful. The dinosaurs also steal the film, not just their designs but also that they're lots of fun and are scary, their scenes are great to watch and there could have been even more than there were. This is especially true with the Indominus Rex, who is chillingly bloodthirsty, when she is stalking her prey it's enough to be glued to one's seat and then jump out of it. Michael Giacchino's music score is positively stirring, and even includes themes from Williams' score for Jurassic Park, which was just a lovely homage and fits within the rest of the scoring beautifully.The film's homages are most enjoyable and give the film a nostalgic quality, some of it is savvy and funny and while not as much as the original there's still a good of thrills and scares to be had. The latter half is often very exciting, the film is efficiently directed, doing nicely in maintaining the tension, and the acting is good (though one does wish that the characters were written better). Chris Pratt has a likable and warm presence, as well as a nice wit, and Bryce Dallas Howard is similarly good even with the most problematically written character. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a real effort making his somewhat one-note and underused character more interesting than he deserves to be and does bring some intensity.However, Jurassic World does contain some large problems. Not all the acting works, Judy Greer for my tastes was annoying in places and the children's acting was often too forced and their back story goes nowhere. The script and story are uneven, with the script it has its moments but it can be a bit muddled, as a result of trying to do too much at times, some of the dialogue is very weak and can induce cringes and some of the reversals are really out of place. It also could have done a much better developing the characters, because they felt very underdeveloped and clichéd, especially Claire, and any character arcs come off clumsily or aren't explored enough, particularly for the children. Owen and Claire's romance can slow the film down and does contain some forced dialogue. The story is at least never really dull, and excites more than it limps, but at the same time it does lack the wonder, consistent suspense, smartness and originality that Jurassic Park had. It does feel like a too predictable rehash at times, does feel muddled tonally, the exposition in the first half hour does go on for far too long and doesn't really say anything interesting and the ending is too silly and anti-climactic for my tastes.All in all, uneven and not on the same level as the original Jurassic Park, but a very entertaining well made film and by far the best of the sequels. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","61 out of 92 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Manages to somewhat return the Jurassic Park series to it's former glory, but its still a few notches below Spielberg's first two entries in the series.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3251296/?ref_=tt_urv","fruitsaverer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3244718/?ref_=tt_urv","4 June 2015","Modernized and polished entry to the Jurassic Park series picks up 22 years after the original Steven Spielberg SyFy thriller with a fully functional prehistoric amusement park that is trying to pick up their attendance numbers by splicing the DNA of their animals in order to create a new attraction to bring in more customers. With this, they manage to create a dinosaur that is much bigger that the signature T-Rex but also much more aggressive, much smarter and much more territorial as well. So of course it does not take much time for this thing to break out of it's habitat to cause death and destruction in it's wake. It's then up to park consultant Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and company to stop this mega dinosaur from killing everyone on the island.While the set up is predictable as well as it's outcome, the movie still provides a fun two hours of distraction. The problem is however is that outside of Chris Pratt, whose playing an intelligent variation of his swagger character from "" Guardians"" No one in this movie is very interesting or likable with the slight exception of Vincent D'Onofrio, who can read a phone book and make it interesting. The script is cringe worthy in a lot of places and while technology has come very far from the original, good storytelling is far and few between. ""Jurassic World"" still does manage to offer a lot of scary moments of sheer terror and does provide some comic relief, which is a huge step up from the last movie of the series(Jurassic Park 3)but does not have the genuine spectacle and heart that drove Steven Spielberg's first two movies in the series (The original Jurassic Park and The Lost World : Jurassic Park).All and all, it's a decent ride that somewhat redeems the Jurassic Park series but they need shoot higher next time other than just be a decent follow up.","429 out of 860 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Very good but more a remake of the first two movies than a sequel to the series.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3250545/?ref_=tt_urv","theladywithbrains","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21203104/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2015","Like it's dinosaur Frankenstein creation, Jurassic World is itself a  hybrid of sorts. A bright and vibrant opening that reminds the viewer  of the first time they saw the original Jurassic Park, with a voice  over by the late Richard Attenborough in introducing the park visitors  and the audience of the wonders of the first dinosaur amusement park.  Sort of a tribute to what the first movie was about and the realization  of it coming true. Then the mayhem begins and the viewer will remember  the words of Professor Ian Malcolm from the first sequel ""The Lost  World"": ""Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later  there's running and um, screaming."" That's what happens after the slow  introduction of the characters and story points of ""Jurassic World"".  What good about this film that it's a slow burn, like the first  Jurassic movie, then it kicks like a mule with the scares and adrenalin  of ""The Lost World"" when the park's new attraction starts eating the  tourist and it's fellow attractions. While having both Steven  Spielberg's original two films as inspiration is a good way to create a  Jurassic sequel, it's not original. Don't get me wrong, its very good  for what it was and Chris Pratt earns his stripes as a leading man but  takes too much from both ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" and just  regurgitating scenes here and there to be taken seriously as a sequel.  Plus it goes into overdrive with the scary,intelligent predator hybrid  dinosaur, which comes across more like ""Predator"" than a Jurassic Park  movie. This dinosaur hybrid kills for sport, not hunger or necessary  and that pushes the boundaries of what the Jurassic Park series was  about. Yes, they are wild animals but this film plays them up as good  guys and bad guys then the out of its time species that did not belong  into human society. With all of that out of my system, i will admit  that i did have a good time watching ""Jurassic World"" and jumped quite  a few times during a few scenes. A few inconsistencies a side, i  enjoying it as what it was. While there are obvious links to ""Jurassic  Park"" not to mention the fact that they are back to the original place  of the first film, i just did not feel like it was sequel to the  Jurassic Park series. More a reboot/remake of the first two movies but  it could have been much worse (Jurassic Park 3 anyone?).  3 Stars. Don't expect anything original but do expect to have a good  time none the less.","298 out of 596 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Smart Dinosaur, Dumb Writers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3256916/?ref_=tt_urv","grayremnant1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57536146/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2015","Overall, this wasn't a dull film. It was full of action and very absorbing. It just wasn't a very intelligent film. The writers took shortcuts to move the plot in the direction they wanted, and most of the characters fluctuate from utter moron to complete genius throughout the film.The acting was relatively dull, with the exception of Chris Pratt who played a character he's played over and over again. Most everyone else was uttering cringe-worthy dialogue throughout the film.The story is cliché, uninteresting, and full of moronic plot holes. The idea to turn the raptors into tamable teddy-bear creatures was a terrible decision that turned potentially horrific moments into a waste of time. Couple that with a worse deus ex machina moment than the first film, and you have a veritable mess on your hands.The most damning part of this film was the fact that the writers spent 14 years developing a story with a dinosaur written to be smarter than the writers themselves. Indominus possesses all the wit and clever thinking that could have been used to write a terrific screenplay. Next time, write a smarter story with a dumber dinosaur.","243 out of 489 found this helpful.

I have read nearly everything he has ever written. So, the bad comes first - 1. Some of the characters (dinos included) did not fit the mold for his writing. While I found them likable, I also found them detestable as a ""Crichton snob.""2. I felt like there was too much in the way of homages. A few subtle nods would have been sufficient, imo. Other minor things like overall story development, and a few other directorial issues aren't worth dwelling on in light of a 2 hour and 10 minutes run time.The good - 1. Chris Pratt was excellent. I'm quickly becoming a fan, and hope he can develop his skills a bit more for future roles. As my wife pointed out, he'd make a great fit for an indiana Jones reboot if the time comes.2. The dinos were awesome. Even the new ones, as far-fetched as they seem. In this regard, the writing was right in line with Crichton. He loved to stretch the science to the very edge of being illogical, if not impossible.3. Did I mention ALL of the homages? Many casual viewers will miss most of them. My 11 year old got a bunch but not all of them. From that standpoint, I like being able to see some of the more subtle connections, and rides down memory lane are generally enjoyable.Conclusion - Overall, I felt like it was worth the matinée admission of 7.50. I wouldn't have wanted to pay 10, but others may disagree. Solid action film....3.5 stars.","153 out of 304 found this helpful.

They also have to tell you how to feel at every moment with blunt soundtrack bits that leave nothing to the imagination. The evil corporation, the arrogant rich man, the uncaring secretary and the opportunist need all be punished for their sins. Not so the sexy redhead who got everybody killed in the first place or the annoying children who do whatever they feel like it while a killer dino is on the loose . God, not the children!This sums up the plot of the film. There is absolutely no recipe for a quick buck that was not used in the movie and the rest, which is just as formulaic, is just special effects and a weird hybrid (see what I did there?) between Jurassic Park and Godzilla. Say what you will about Spielberg, the man knew subtlety.Points for not killing the black person first.

This movie could have been so much better! I was completely enthralled during the first 45 min or so, and it was as if I was visiting the Park myself. The cinematography was beautiful, the attractions were innovative and the park was filled with so many extras, that it felt like a real place. There was a lot of interesting man vs. nature debate in the script as well as tidbits on the danger of technological progress. I applauded the writers at first. There were even some pretty decent character arcs but unfortunately, they never fully developed.When the action started to pick up, things went sour really fast. If this film had maintained its serious tone, I may have scored it in the 8's or even 9's. But sadly, the director chose to include bits of cheesy comedic lines in moments of urgency, completely ruining the thrill. I cared nothing for the characters, because, it seemed as if the characters took the threats they came across a bit too lightly for my tastes, so much so, that it completely nullified Bryce Dallas Howard's excellent performance. But hey, at least the action was better than expected and so was the CGI. I was skeptical at the fact that there were so few robotics used in this film, but it didn't matter. The CGI was that realistic. I still can't say it saved this film. I yawned a lot in the end, despite the pretty cool plot twist. This film should have been a horror film like the first 2 installments, but it chose to be a movie aimed at teens. What else is new these days with blockbuster films right? 6/10","159 out of 317 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A nod to the original and even more","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3256910/?ref_=tt_urv","alexander-rumpf","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45407128/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2015","As a young boy, dinosaurs were the greatest thing on earth (well, the greatest thing that once WAS on earth) for me. I knew most of their names (like Gray in JW) and had my plastic dinosaurs fighting themselves, evil, and sometimes also good. You can imagine my excitement when I first saw Jurassic Park and I was truly blown away by the idea. I still somehow wish that I could actually experience the events in the movie, although I understand the critic that the author of the novel, Michael Crichton, wanted to express. Much of that critic is lost in the third sequel to the original movie, 22 years after its original release, at least it's hidden very deep in the plot. The scientists have created a new super- species, filled the missing pieces of DNA up with genes of amphibians that all have certain survival-powers, and it all goes terribly wrong, much because the dinosaurs are being underestimated as they always were. So is it a reboot of the first movie? At least a bit. They are referring to the first movie all the time, examples: A control guy wearing an Jurassic Park shirt proudly says he got an original shirt (shown in part 1 several times) for $150 from eBay, they run through degenerated original buildings and one time the kids even drive an original van that they repaired competently. New park-owner Masrani says that John Hammond told him on his death bed to ""spare no expense"", which was one of the funniest scenes in the movie, yet Masrani doesn't want to commercialize the park too much. That's where the movie starts being perfectly self-ironic: one control guy (the one with the classic shirt) jokingly suggests, in order to please the investors, to name newly bred species after companies, ""so how about Pepsi-Saurus""? The movie indeed is full of product placements, I counted at least 9 brands and logos that are shown or mentioned during the film. So what is the purpose of the movie? Mainly, I guess, it's meant as a nostalgic, yet up-to-date experience/excuse for all those fans who were bitterly disappointed by the Parts II&III. It's exciting, contains a little love story, it's got wit, social criticism and excellently animated dinosaurs. It shows that 22 years after Jurassic Park, movie heroes are still being chauvinist and women are still stronger and braver as they are pictured in most (other) movies. And, finally, it fulfills every fans biggest desire: man and dinosaur, at last fighting side by side. That's probably why I'd give it an even better rating than the original Jurassic Park movie, although of course classic scenes like the shaking water glass will probably never be outperformed. Résumé: Director Colin Trevorrow manages to create an enthralling and visually stunning homage to the original which at some points brilliantly steps out of the shadow of its role model and finally puts the conciliatory end to the dinosaur universe that we, the fans, truly deserved.","221 out of 373 found this helpful.

Some really cool effects but overall disappointing attempt to restart the franchise. Never understand why they can't try something original but have to resort to borrowing from the previous films. Even Spielberg had trouble with his sequels, with the third film in the franchise being particularly bad. Would have liked to have seen some improvements in the actual dinosaurs to reflect current thinking but they decided to stick with the same versions from 17 year ago. I think that this one Jurassic World will end being seen as better than the third film but inferior to one and even two.

A few days later as I think back to the movie, I remember the action packed finale and some of the great visuals but ultimately there was something lacking from the film, a soul, an identity.Newcomer director Colin Trevorrow proves that he has the ability to to shoot involving action scenes, despite having just one small indie film on his resume. Despite this, sometimes his direction can feel flat, especially in dialogue heavy scenes where he struggles to create dynamism in the interactions of his characters. This leaves the audience uninvested in the intricacies of the story (which is highly straightforward) and simply eager to get to the next dino' showdown.The dinosaur scenes in this film are overall fantastic, and elevate the movie to new heights. I felt like there could have been a greater variety of dinosaurs on offer here, but the ones that are in the film (especially the Mosasaur and I-Rex) deliver the goods.Unlike the original Jurassic Park and to a certain extent The Lost World, Jurassic World presents shallow characters and tries to flesh them out in a cliché manner. For example, the divorce subplot involving the two boys that is brought up once early on in the film, and then never resolved or mentioned following that scene. Another example is the main female character Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is portrayed in a negative and highly stereotypical manner for 3/4 of the movie.Some people have criticized Irfan Khan's character but I thought his small character arc was brilliant. However the military subplot was both unneeded and implausible and should have been scrapped. Chris Pratt was decent as always but wasn't given much to work with here. Ultimately, the movie somewhat succeeds in creating a plausible and believable world, however it would have benefited from some more confident direction and a greater focus on story and characterization over visuals. I don't really have a pressing desire to delve back into the world of the film because it ultimately felt too soulless, especially in comparison to Spielberg's original.The movie has been marketed as an action/thriller film and it achieves this at the expense of the more subtle tension present in previous installments in the series. That said, if you are looking for thrilling popcorn entertainment you will have a good time with this one, just don't expect a classic.6/10","171 out of 345 found this helpful.

Yes, people from the original cast are not there, however there is actually not a logical reason in the time line to make them go back. Taking out this little detail, the acting is amazing and Chris Pratt holds amazingly as a main character again . Animations are better than ever and the story line even if a little prematurely developed is exciting and looks to reward the new audience as well as the hard on fans. Overall is a great movie which promise enjoyment.

It takes place about twenty years after the events of the first film. There is now a functioning theme park on the original island. They get thousands of guest and they have tons of money making attractions. But then the people who run the park get a little greedy wanting to make more money and bring in more people so they create a new attraction, one that is more dangerous and scarier then the T-Rex. This film was fantastic. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard lead this film very well almost as a good as Sam Neill and Laura Dern did in the first film. The kids as well Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins did a good job. Colin Trevorrow also was a great choice to helm this film and he did a fantastic job directing. Now yes this film was a sequel and a great one at that. It's been a long time since I have felt that a sequel is just as good as its original. This film to me is really good and just as good as the first film. The special effects were great and one of the best parts was the music. I have been a Jurassic Park fan since I was a little kid and this is actually the first of franchise that I have seen in theaters as well. So this was definitely an amazing experience for me and hearing that original score in this film literally gave me goosebumps.","198 out of 339 found this helpful.

Thank goodness one of them is Chris Pratt who is the epitome of cool. Love the way he calmly plays his character, dripping with killer machismo and testosterone. Think Steve McQueen. Chris Pratt is the new old. Who cares about the other characters anyway?It took quite a while to get going but once the mayhem started it is actually quite a rollicking good time. The story pays homage to Spielberg's Jurassic Park and I find it a bit laborious and self-conscious in that some of the homages roar in my face. The theme of corporate greed is again highlighted in rainbow colors and underlined in bold strokes, and there is just so much one can milk it. Why the heck people don't seem to learn? But I am getting ahead of myself. After all these are people in the movie world. The problem is that the narrative feels too familiar and it very soon became repetitive, but still it is really a logical extension from the idea posed in Jurassic Park, a ""what if"" brought to full fruition - a full-fledged dinosaur theme park.Colin Trevorrow's storytelling is uneven and the tone feels a little unsettled. It feels like he was hovering around ""shall I give my due respect to Spielberg"" or ""shall I do my thing"", but it couldn't quite figure out what it wants to do. The tone can also feel preachy (especially the long exposition in the beginning) and goofy, and it doesn't feel like it was comfortable blazing its own path. Thankfully Pratt's character smooths out the ragged edges for me. The poster of him on a bike with the raptors made no sense, but after the movie it made perfect awesome sense.Jurassic World didn't re-invent the dino-disaster wheel. I doubt that is its aim. IMHO it is a greatest hits album packaged with a few remixes of old tracks. Like a theme park ride, you would easily push the lousy parts like the long wait to the back of your mind, and only remember the thrills and spills.","114 out of 228 found this helpful.

I wanted to have a ride, the buzz was positive and I really wanted to see how the park opened looked like. My expectations were't sky high, I really just wanted to have that thrilling ride that the first one offered. The movie doesn't manage to meet that standard, but still has enough going on for it not to be defined a faliure.The premise of having the park open definitely delivers some great moments, of which truthfully I would have liked to see more. The ride it takes you through has its stumbles, but overall I was never out of it and it had enough good, and just a couple of amazing, set pieces to keep the pace going. I cannot deny that despite the many times I got phased out by what happened on screen, there were as many times were I got genuinely excited and thrilled. I have to give a shout out to the sound design and mixing of the film because it is definitely the part that is resonating the most with me whilst writing this review. Much more than CGI, which I will get into later, it added a real layer to the film and astonishingly helped getting me engaged. It is great to hear the original theme back and I just might think it wasn't used enough. To sum up the positives in the best way possible: the parts that worked, really worked.The rest was all just: ""Well OK, I am sure I will forget this the second I exit the film"". The premise of the film isn't neither original or interesting nor grounded enough for it ever to be truly relevant. It's just another dinosaur and that would be OK if it wasn't inserted in this plot that a couple too many and convenient times strayed away from credibility. Moreover the themes it is trying to explore are frustratingly and repeatedly put aside. The CGI is just forgettable unfortunately. There are maybe a couple of shiny moments, but other than being somewhat underwhelming it really is just too poorly used for it to provoke any sense of wonder or amazement in 2015, I am really sorry, CGI has to be used as a gift not as a gadget and it is what this film did. And on the final negative note, you are given a group of way too generic characters, they seemed to have been pre-fabricated in the factory of generic blockbusters. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard, who really gives her character a beat and a presence on screen making her likable, all of the characters I really couldn't care that much and it made for repeatedly poor stakes.I unfortunately can't say I really had that much fun. I was never bored and really enjoyed quite a few moments, but truthfully I was far from having any sense of wonder or amazement and I think the positive reaction the film is having is due more to the fact that we all desperately want ""Jurassic Park"" to be good again more than the actual quality of the film.","140 out of 284 found this helpful.

Fell in love! And really have enjoyed the 2 sequels for what they're worth. Then, came out with Jurassic World, used our favorite Starkilled... and we have an amazing movie. I'm still riding a high from seeing it last night. It was just so good. I spoiled a few moments for myself, but overall was still surprised at the ending, despite it's Mortal Kombat predicted finish. The CGI was top notch and had us really believing these creatures were real. A worthy movie to see over and over again. I really do not want to spoil a THING. I would not say this movie is sexist in anyway... not sure where people picked up on that, but will say it is heavy on the testosterone(did I spell that correctly?). Which isn't a bad thing. Jurassic World has a wonderful build up, some good personalities, and a few main 'side characters' are killed off! We see some personalities actually change through the movie. Claire, Zach, and even Gray and Owen to some extent. I'll say this: Claire learns some humility and heart. Zach learns real love over shallowness to some extent, Gray learns true courage, and Owen (with already enough faith and trust) gains even more (and a fan club). Though the one character who comes back... I wonder if they grew his character more from a twisted version from the original novel. (Real the original novel!)Don't let the trailers anger you, you will root for the raptors, and you will LIKE IT! The raptors aren't exactly 'tamed', barely. Think Dug from Up. This is the true sequel to the original movie Michael refused to give Spielberg years ago... instead Creighton wrote about irregular students outside of the norm, attached to a character akin to Spielberg's personality, and gave us a more boring version of Malcolm (that sung Dixie no less), and Harding, who was a woman who to was hard to understand and not very likable. And the end of the second book was... lackluster to say the least. Not want Spielberg wanted. Still a good novel and fun read.The island is back, the locations, the look, and we see some of its 'history' (wish we saw more of the attractions). This is the true sequel and it the summer smash for 2015. If you like the original Jurassic Park movie, you can not miss out on this movie. It fits so well, and open enough for a few questions and a sequel. Which makes one think... they could... no wait, can't say it. It might spoil the ending! Ha ha! They do mourn a character that dies. A plot twist here or there... the final fight is simply amazing. Cool tributes to the original movie (and Stan Winston - there's a building named after him, look for it, I saw it!) This was an excellent movie and a definite 10 in my book. Easily rewatchable. Please note, it seemed a little more gory than the previous movies with a little more blood. The cursing was actually minimal. I wouldn't take anyone under 7 or 8 to see it. The gore was kind of cool though. More detail than we had in the originals other than ""I think this was Gennaro..."" Great movie, plenty of dino on dino fighting action. Don't listen to the naysayers. No contrived endless conversations about dinosaur behavior here.","166 out of 288 found this helpful.

The Action is intense, and the storyline is great. The orchestration by Michael Giacchino was VERY well done as opposed to John Williams, and the actors and actresses fit their roles very well too. Now, I constantly go to Movie's, and in MY opinion, this was one of the best I have seen in the last 5 years, due to the storyline and the incredibly well done CGI. If you love Dinosaurs, you're going to enjoy this movie, regardless of what you think about the rest of the movie. Trust me. If you love action, this one is pretty action packed, so you'll have a great time too.HOWEVER, if you read the rest of the reviews, you'll most likely see title's following the words, ""This Movie Sucked"" or ""I'm gonna go on a rant here"". DO NOT READ THEMLook, everyone has their own opinions, likes and dislikes. My opinion is 10 out of 10 across the board easily. Yours might be different, but before you judge this movie because of all the reviews you've just read, I strongly suggest seeing it first.

There's very little of them in this movie. It's nearly half an hour before we see one and it doesn't get better from there. The storyline is very limp. The character of Claire misfired on a number of levels. The movie didn't make me really care what happened to any of the characters except Owen and Larry and the four raptors. This is the main problem with the film, it doesn't really matter what happens. There's no emotional punch like there was with the first film or with jaws. There's also a distinct lack of tension. This should have been a thrill ride, but it was all very predictable.The best acting in the film was by Blue the 'beta' raptor. The relationship between Blue and Owen was about the only emotional factor in the film. The dinosaurs when on the screen looked good enough, but there was no tension in this film. The score and sound effects were also a bit of a let down for me. It wasn't bad, just a bit meh. I saw it in 3d. There's no need to pay extra.

Why? Well, after a steadily sloping series of movies, then I wasn't in any particular hurry to get around to watch the most recent of the movies, it being ""Jurassic World"".And now having seen it, I must admit that this was visually a beautiful movie. As was the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie back in 1993 when it was first released. And it did offer some adequate entertainment, for sure. But everything here had essentially been presented to the audience throughout the course of the three previous movies. Sure there was the thing with the Indominus Rex creation that stood out. But wasn't it just a twist on the gene manipulation and reproduction that essentially sparked the first dinosaur in the first movie?The acting in the movie was good, although you should not expect any great thespian or Shakespearian moments throughout the course of the movie. People did adequate jobs with what they had to work with from a fairly limiting script and storyline.The CGI is what carried this movie, as it has been with the entire series since the first movie. And the dinosaurs are quite life-like and realistic to look at - taking into consideration that we only got fossils to compare appearances with.The movie does bear some sarcastic permeation of American consumerism, in terms of everything has to be bigger and better. And look how it turned out in the first, second and third movie. So it makes you wonder why they still haven't learned their lesson and continued on with a new dinosaur amusement park.While ""Jurassic World"" is certainly an entertaining movie and a visual treat for the eyes, then it is hardly a revolutionary movie, nor is it a movie that really were particularly necessary to the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise.","16 out of 26 found this helpful.

Now they've remade the park, with more dangerous creatures lurking around, what could possible go wrong? THIS!! Instead of moving on from the idea of a dinosaur petting zoo, the managers of the park believe it can still work with no loose dinosaurs. However, the idiot scientist think it will be no danger to breed their own dinosaur with a mixture of different creature DNA. So eventually a highly intelligent blood thirsty dinosaur becomes loose around Jurassic World.The film is completely fuelled with intense, pulse racing action that Jurassic Park delivered only bigger and louder. Although it is new I did believe that the film is almost the exact same feature to the original, with the exceptions of a slightly different narrative and several annoying characters.The film does present though an interesting narrative, and brilliant visual effects. There is also a small emotional theme to the story of the relationship between the dinosaurs and humans, which I think Chris Pratt executes brilliantly.Sadly the film becomes very predictable with other themes presented throughout the story, and becomes infested in plot wholes. Throughout watching it I could not help but think WHY? To the characters as they perform stupid actions and not even do the sensible thing. There are also moments of intense gory images and disturbing scenes, which make men question the certificate of the film but also nearly made me believe I was watching a horror movie.Overall to me the film was just exhausting, familiar, and annoying. However the film provides what it promises and I'm sure will entertain fans of the previous films. I give it 5/10.","40 out of 83 found this helpful.

This first film in the reboot trilogy certainly has its moments, but to me has always felt much less plausible than the initial films, particularly at the films conclusion.Years after the fall of the first ""Jurassic Park"" Ingen have successfully salvaged the island, and created a destination resort complex. It has been in operation for a few years now though and attendance figures are dropping, the solution is to create a new hybrid dinosaur, the Idominus Rex. Bred to be bigger and scarier than all that have come before, the beast shows unparalleled intelligence and aggression and when it escapes the owners discover they have repeated John Hammonds errors, but on a much bigger scale.I was surprised about how more violent and bloody this film was over the previous three. I suppose this is reflected in the 12 certificate rather than the PG one, but still it was surprising. I liked Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, even if their will they /won't they love pairing is a bit played out. I did hate the kids though, especially the older one, who just stares at girls all the time in a way that quickly gets beyond flirting and into stalking. The rest of the cast is strong though, and there are number of recognisable actors in smaller roles, such s Omar Sy and Lauren Lapkus.The action scenes are generally pretty thrilling though as I said above, I do think that the ""tag team"" work at the end of the film threatens the credibility of the film quite a bit. I do think that the idea of the Raptor hunt is also lacking a bit in logic, both in terms of what they wanted to happen when the Raptors located the Rex and how the bikes and cars negotiated the tree trunks and debris the Raptors were jumping over.I wish it was a little cleverer and a little more inventive, but it's got more than enough moments for me to feel positive about it.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

JURASSIC PARK was an epic film, and then Spielberg and company found a way to destroy its flavor with two banal sequels. After a lengthy hiatus that included much soul-searching, and dumping Jack Horner, JURASSIC WORLD brings the franchise back to the wonderfulness of the original.I try to not watch trailers before I see a movie. Often, they are misleading. At best, the reveal too many key plot elements or scenes. Unfortunately, the trailers for JURASSIC WORLD permeated media in a major advertising campaign blitz. What I saw in the trailers alarmed me. Did I actually see Velociraptors work along side the film's protagonist Chris Pratt, as a unified force? It reminded me of ALIENS VS. PREDATOR, where viewers were force-fed the notion a petite black woman was the only human representative capable of defeating a horde of aliens by teaming with the creatures who hunt humans for sport. Please. The concept was idiotic, and though they tried to salvage the movie series with a follow-up, the initial theme essentially destroyed the franchise in the world of celluloid.The raptors, in the same frame with Pratt, are not friendly creatures. Luckily, there are no ""we are family"" moments between species. I'll test your memory here, but think back to the second film in the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON series; THE REVENGE OF THE CREATURE. In the film, John Agar, experimenting on the intelligence of the gill-man, uses an electric prod to teach the word ""stop"" to the Creature. Through Pavlovian testing, the Creature hesitates at the sound. It establishes a necessary reaction for the climatic scene. The raptors work much the same manner in JURASSIC WORLD. It is done well.Now, consider Jack Horner. After JURASSIC PARK, Horner attempted to garner his fifteen minutes of Andy Warhol fame and used rather sketchy paleontology findings to discredit the Tyrannosaurus Rex. He claimed the King of Dinosaurs was nothing but a mooching scavenger. Somehow, he convinced Spielberg to shift attention away from Rex. It was a bad move that culminated in a horrendous JURASSIC PARK 3, where a Spinosaurus, which in reality measured only 20 feet compared to T-rex's 50 feet, fights and defeats Rex. Horner's new Rex theories were dismantled by his peers and colleagues within a year. He is now in the café of scientific oblivion, sipping coffee with the two researchers who tried to convince us of global warming with a fabricated hockey stick graph model. Rex is back in full glory in JURASSIC WORLD. In fact, he received cheers and applause from the preview audience when he appeared on screen. They were louder than any reaction to superheroes.JURASSIC WORLD makes many references to the original, and basically ignores everything from the sequels. It is twenty years past John Hammond's disastrous attempt to bring dinosaurs to a theme park. In that time, technology has improved, enabling Hammond's dream to become reality. Thousands of people visit JURASSIC WORLD on a regular basis, but as with all things, dinosaurs become mundane with the public and the park must find new and exciting ways to keep ticket sales booming. Enter Indominus Rex, a genetically built dinosaur hybrid, meant to add an element of fear and terror to park visitors. BD Wong returns as Dr. Henry Wu, and is the culprit behind creation of the new Rex. He is reminiscent of Dr. Susan McCallister, played by Saffron Burrows, in DEEP BLUE SEA, who created superior sharks, but opted not to tell anyone about the enhances features.In keeping with the Spielberg tradition of constantly putting children in danger, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson star as Gray and Zach, who are visiting the park while their parents attempt to end their marital bliss. There can never be happy families anymore in films. It doesn't fit the template of a dysfunctional society, so loved by liberal Hollywood ideology. Entrusted to the care of their aunt, the boys naturally find a way to immerse themselves in park havoc, while they discover the bond that exists between brothers. Meanwhile, Auntie Claire, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, while chasing the All American Woman Executive Dream, has the hots for Owen (Pratt), who is in this story what Robert Muldoon should have been in the first. All these subplots are secondary and just provide hurdles for a tale about a genetic freak, and the dinosaurs who hate him.Critics were able to see JURASSIC WORLD in 3D. It is worth it. The dinos, especially the raptor attacks, are superb. The dinos look great, thanks to Ed Verreaux's production design. Cinematography by John Schwartzman is excellent and provides several iconic moments sure to appear on posters and memes. Music, though featuring additional tunes by Michael Giacchino is basically variations on John Williams memorable score.All in all, JURASSIC WORLD brings the series back to where it belongs. You can watch the first one, skip the second and third, and jump straight to this one and have a better franchise. The movie is filled with dinosaurs and dinosaur action. It's worth repeated views and deserves a spot on your home video shelf. As such, it exemplifies excellence in film entertainment and captures the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2015. You'll like this one; it's a keeper.10/10","169 out of 296 found this helpful.

I remember I left the theater on opening night feeling so empty and unsatisfied. Like Force Awakens just Jurassic World was just a bad remake of the first film in the franchise.The characters were awful. They were bland, forgettable, and unlikable. I wanted all of them to die, because they all make the dumbest decisions. Example, older brother (lets run away from our babysitter, takes little brother into restricted area, yells at his brother to stop crying). We're supposed to like this character and root for him to live???? Nobody remember any of their names and that's a big problem. When people talk about the characters they refer to them as red head lady, two annoying kids, British nanny, black guy, Indian guy, lady in the control room. Zero character development and no growth.Too much ripping off the first film. There's a difference between homages and straight up copying. Two kids get attacked in a vehicle. Gee... because we didn't see that in the first movie. This nostalgia garbage has to stop. The scene at the old visitors center was just there for nostalgia jerk off festival. Hey remember the Tim's googles, the old dinosaur painting mural, the original Jurassic Park banner, the original jeep cars.The tone was all wrong. Way too comedic and meta. Couldn't take anything seriously. This movie wasn't scary and had zero tension or suspense. The truck chase scene and the gyrospchere attack should of had me on the edge of my seat, but it didn't. And characters unrealistic reactions don't help either. The little brother is laughing and joking ""I can't wait to tell mom"" after bug zapping a raptor. In the gyrospchere scene the old brother has a blank face while it's been flung around violently. No reaction. During the pterodactyl scene everybody is running around screaming being attacked and killed, the two kids are blankly watching Chris Pratt and Bryce's characters causally kissing. So stupid.The acting was so horrible. Chris Pratt was so wooden and stoic. Bryce Dallas Howard was so awful with her out of breath ""acting"". Vincent Dinofrio was miscast as the villain. Didn't buy him in the role. The two kids were horrible. Nick Robinson was so wooden and had no reaction anything happening him, just blank stares. No emotion. The younger kid could have been better. Ariana Richards/Joseph Mazello were excellent in the original film and were believable. They knew how to play scared very well. I never believed the two kids in Jurassic World were scared at any point. Jake Johnson was obnoxious and not funny. Lauren Lapkus was awful and her crying scene was embarrassing. Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard have zero chemistry.The movie looked fake, too clean and shiny. Unlike the original three films, this felt like a movie taking place on a green screen. The teal and orange color grading made the film look ugly. Terrible cgi, how do the dinosaurs look better in 1993 than 2015. No animatronics except for one. The Indominous Rex was lame version of the T-Rex and changed to fit whatever plot device the movie wanted.People trash the Lost World and Part 3, but I rather watch those over World. At least those felt like Jurassic Park movies. World felt like a terrible Syfy channel film with a huge budget. Jurassic World was a soulless cash grab that has zero re-watch value.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Disappointing: Much like the Dinosaurs this Film Represents, the Jurassic Park Franchise ought to Remain Extinct","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3255478/?ref_=tt_urv","totalovrdose","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52795042/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2015","Don't get me wrong - there is plenty of entertainment to be had when viewing Jurassic World: the special effects are absolutely outstanding, and we are able to cherish these when viewing the creatures right up in our faces. Unlike many films where monsters are hidden by the darkness, in this film, they are beautifully presented in direct visibility. Not only this, many of the action scenes are truly breathtaking in their execution, the climatic moments being especially fantastic, however, these are often marred by predictability, the final sequence being a combination of several fight scenes from the original feature, and Jurassic Park 3. Regrettably, in other instances, including a scene involving pterosaurs, and another involving raptors, the script's directionality offers nothing new, as we watch what can only be described as tweaked footage from previous installments, regardless of how good they look. This is unfortunately furthered by the fact that those who have viewed the trailers, will already have a strong inkling of what is going to happen in almost every major scene.Although In-Gen still have a role to play in the feature, their priorities appear to be strictly military, a tactic which is strongly led by Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), who efficaciously portrays his greedy, self-centered character. Although the notion of using dinosaurs, particularly raptors, during military operations is interesting, and seeing this executed on screen is probably the most uniquely entertaining experience the film is able to muster, this grand scheme seems outlandishly ridiculous. Furthermore, at times, it seems difficult to fathom who is actually in control - Hoskins, or park owner Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who is introduced as one of the world's richest men, and though he is hailed as a man with 'humility', the moment everything goes terribly wrong, money and reputation, rather than safety, are his top priorities. Despite a number of superb scenes, for the most part, his character recites juvenile dialogue, and it left this writer wondering if Mr. Khan was sadly, racially chosen because of his accent.This is not helped by the script, which, despite the seriousness of the operation, doesn't always retain the professionalization one would expect. Characters like Scott (Andy Buckley), who is provided far too much screen time, spends the entirety of his scenes vocalizing what can only be described as pointless dialogue, while characters like Dr. Henry Wu (B D Wong), who terrifically shows the passion he has for his work, are rarely glimpsed. Even Owen, although exceptionally portrayed by the dashingly handsome Chris Pratt, whose character is a reliably effective protagonist, is initially provided some rather sexist material, conveyed in the scene where he communicates with former girlfriend and operations manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who, despite been an effective marketer, spends more than half the film being interpreted as an emotionless zealot.This impression is only furthered by her inability to be an aunt to her sister's two children vacationing at the park, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson). More often than not, these children appear to steal the show, much of the plot, from the film's opening to its close, orbiting around them, and though this allows us to see the park from their eyes, their behavior, and recklessness, quickly loses its appeal. The addendum that Zach, no offense, is a sleaze bag, doesn't help: the opening of the feature sees him saying goodbye to his girlfriend, and for half the movie, he has the gall to attempt fraternization with every adolescent girl he sees.Moving on, the primary antagonist, the Indominus Rex, the creature scientifically engineered by splicing together classified dinosaur genetics, which predictably escapes, is able to masterfully command the screen with its presence, though at the same time, its unique capabilities appear to be randomly used. On many an occasion it appears the creature is capable of doing what was convenient for the scene; almost as though the monster itself is unsure of its capabilities and learns overtime from practice. Despite its massive build, more could have been done to make this creature more terrifying, and the fact it too closely resembles a Tyrannosaurs, renders it less effective on screen as it would have, if it looked vastly different.The sub-plot, about humans forming a bond with dinosaurs is a nice addition to the narrative, and helps establish the ancient reptiles as more than just killing machines, but as potentially loyal animals, however, the fact the Indominus steals the show, severely limits the effectiveness of this story arch. Additionally, the accompanying musical score occasionally adds to the environment, however, the original John Williams theme appears to be recklessly handled, and is inserted in what seems to be the most inappropriate of locations.In conclusion, our return to the park feels less than impressive, and more stereotypically cliché, and despite the term 'world' appearing in its title, the staggering number of Caucasians, makes it seem the 'world' is barely represented at all. The fact the film is left wide open for yet another sequel, a little too obviously demonstrates Universal's opinion they have tapped a lucrative oil well, however, any further forays into the park are only likely to end in disaster. If you are thoroughly impressed by Mr. Pratt's work, I would recommend you watch this film; if you really enjoy Mr. Khan's on screen presence, I would recommend you avoid this feature, and for fans of the franchise still reeling after the abysmal third movie, I would recommend you stick to the original two films.","36 out of 76 found this helpful.

These harrowing dangers, and imminently omnipresent threats in JURASSIC WORLD scream in deafening volumes, enough to keep the awe- inspired spectators glued on screen for more than two hours.The movie picks up two decades after the infamous Jurassic park shut down, in the wake of a horrendously bloody catastrophe that swept through the island. A new company has taken over ownership of the park which has been fully operational and open for tourists, only it's been seeing a steady decline in audience attendance. At the request of park's geneticists, a new hybrid, called Indominus Rex, which actually resembles a T.Rex, is created. Frankly, there's is not much to dig in the movie's proved-tested but overly familiar set-up. Cliché and predictabilities scream along the ever impending terror, but that terror itself holds enough charm to cover such narrative defect. The jawdropping cinematography employed to capture the screaming raptorial outrage is unmissable. Once the hybrid escapes, terrific camera-work follows its rampage and delivers an avalanche of eye-popping bloody visual spectacles. There are plenty of riproaring sequences, that include deadly chases and battles for flesh, enough to pull your attention away from fully gauging the depth of human emotions, that the film barely relays to its audience. This isn't to say there is really nothing to expect from that department, because as its emotional core, lead actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas-Howard, charm their way through their thinly-structured (mostly two- dimensional) roles. Chris Pratt, being the central hero here, has the striking charm and sarcastic demeanor he needs, to pull off his character, while the rest of the supports engage with either nothing or no more than forgettable acts.JURASSIC WORLD works best once its CGI dinosaurs begin raging on screen. It's a visual bloodfest, teeming with sense- cracking fight setpieces that get more intense toward the movie's roaring final sequences. I'm not really a religious fan of this franchise, and I'm not claiming to be a credible source of comparison between this installment and the past entries of the franchise. But based on what I've seen here, and in so many similar creature movies in the past, I'd say JURASSIC WORLD, is a solid addition. 7/10","76 out of 176 found this helpful.

As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.And of course there is ALWAYS an SUV, or Quad right at hand when our hero's need one... keys in it of course... yet all the screaming people have been running right by them rather then jumping in and driving the hell away.Yes, it's a movie but can't we keep at least some reality of physics in dino stories. It is NOT possible for ANY flesh and blood animal to swing it's arms and tails around and smash thru huge concrete columns and turn them to dust without doing massive damage to their own body. Yet time and again the arms and tails go swinging and knocking down multiple foot thick concrete stuff.And really, you are going to take out these dinos with assault rifles? Of course the assault rifles are worthless but someone did have the sense to bring ONE grenade launcher with them which blows up dino's just in the nick of time. And of course we wouldn't want to give away our position although we do shine laser gun sights right at the dino which would lead them straight back to where the gun holder is.How on god's green earth this movie gets 10's is beyond me.

The trailer summarizes all the bad parts of the movie, which results in the movie actually being a pleasing experience. Unlike most movies, where the trailer displays all the best parts (Ironman 3) and the movie is a total let down, Jurassic World manages, even with a stupidly predictable plot, to create an entertaining movie. It isn't anywhere near as good as the first but it beats all the other Jurassic movies in my opinion. It is surely worth going to the movies for.The acting is credible and Chris Patt excels. The two kids are all right but not at all necessary nor contribute to the plot in any way. Their only purpose seems to be to allow their own relationship, as well as another to develop. The CGI, despite my impression from the trailer, is great and believable. Really the best CGI I have seen in a long time. The 3D is okay. The director makes it work but it could be improved.All in all, given the type of movie it is and after the underestimation caused by the trailer, it is a solid 8/10.","31 out of 65 found this helpful.

Jurassic World is now one of my favorite movies of all time. The action sequences are intense and plentiful. The special effects are top notch. The music is wonderful(and not just John William's famous themes; Michael Giacchino's score is excellent as well.) And while the characters may not be as developed as in the original Jurassic Park, they are interesting in their own right. Chris Pratt does a great job as Owen, the raptor trainer, and Bryce Dallas Howard does excellent as Claire, the head of the park. One of my favorite ""characters"" though is the underwater dinosaur Mosasaur. (Every time it jumps out of the pool it's freaking awesome!) Even though a lot of people have called this movie predictable, it had a lot of twists and turns that were surprising, especially the ending. Without spoiling it, the ending sequence is one of the most epic endings that I can remember in any movie. The ending will give any true Jurassic Park fan chills.","156 out of 273 found this helpful.

Every movie has their problems, and this one did have a few but not enough to say that I was mislead. The audience and critics may be all over the place with this movie but hey, Haters gonna hate. This is truly the best sequel to Jurassic Park to me and has earned its place with the best sequels along with the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

The workaholic and uptight manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) receives her nephews Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the boys. Meanwhile the dedicated Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is training four velociraptors and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) believes that the animal can be trained for military use. When Owen and two other employees go to an isolated paddock to evaluate the new attraction of the park, the hybrid dinosaur Indominus Rex, the animal lures them, kills the two men and flees from the spot. Owen escapes and asks Masrani to kill the Indominus, but he believes his security team can contain and capture the animal that cost lots of money. However the team is destroyed by the Indominus and Claire orders the evacuation of the tourists from the island. But the dangerous pterosaurs escape from the aviary and the place goes havoc. Meanwhile Gray and Zach are riding a gyro-sphere in the restricted area and Claire and Owen seek them out. With the chaos in the island, Vic assumes the command and decides to use the four velociraptors to locate and destroy the Indominus. Will his plan work?""Jurassic World"" is one of those predictable movies that the viewers know what he or she is going to see. However it is an entertaining adventure due to the special effects, the good acting and the music score. The romance between Claire and Owen is totally out of context. The presumption of Masrani piloting the helicopter does not fit well for a successful entrepreneur and business man. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Jurassic World: O Mundo dos Dinossauros"" (""Jurassic World: The Dinosaur World"")","16 out of 33 found this helpful.

Yet, it's hard at times to tell whether they're talking about the audiences at the park or the audiences for the movie.This little bit of self-reflective self-awareness on the part of the filmmakers is one of the few interesting things about this fourth entry in a tetralogy that began with the groundbreaking ""Jurassic Park"" in 1993. The problem is that it's hard to break ground more than once in the same soil, and ""Jurassic World"" finds no real way to bring anything new to the project.The movie just keeps playing different variations on the same theme. Thus, instead of ""mere"" (and, now, apparently passé) full-sized dinosaurs being regenerated out of ancient samples of preserved DNA, we've graduated to ""super dinosaurs"" being genetically-engineered out of a mixture of all sorts of dino types. All this gene- and species-tampering is taking place at a decade-old amusement park, an improvement, we are told, over the ill-fated one that never quite got off the ground in the 1990s. But humans are humans and playing God, especially for sensation and profit, never ends very well in these sorts of scenarios, so we're primed to buckle our seats and hang on for the ride. We aren't disappointed.Once we get past that one slight deviation, the plot of ""Jurassic World"" pretty much replicates the 1993 original, right down to the ""unlikely"" (though, actually, quite predictable) system malfunction and two lost and imperiled kids having to be saved from becoming Dino-food by an intrepid adult at the park (Chris Pratt plays the role of trainer and dinosaur- whisperer here). In fact, virtually every scene in ""Jurassic World"" has a corresponding counterpart in ""Jurassic Park,"" only what was once innovative and fresh has now become derivative and stale (apparently, none of the characters here ever seen the original ""Jurassic Park"" or they wouldn't keep making the exact same mistakes as the previous group).Pratt has an easygoing, good-ole-boy charm that serves him well in his role as makeshift hero, but Bryce Dallas Howard is given the thankless task of playing a rather insultingly sexist caricature as the manager of the park who's in way over her head when it comes to running the joint, not to mention coping with a crisis of this magnitude (think Kate Capshaw in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") and is, thus, in constant need of rescuing by the stalwart Pratt.Under the directorial aegis of Colin Trevorrow, the action scenes and special effects are predictably eye-popping and state-of-the-art - helping to generate the ""wow factor"" one minimally expects from this series - but the overall air of deja vu that permeates the film keeps this latest dino-blockbuster from being much more than an afterthought in the Jurassic universe.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The 'Jurassic Park' (1993), of two decades earlier, is hinted at in 'Jurassic World'.Film opens with an emotional and harassed mother played by Judy Greer. She is packing her boys off to go on holiday to the dinosaur theme-park. Miss Greer had a small part in the 2013 'Carrie' remake, though my favourite role of hers was in 'The Big Bang Theory' TV series.Nick Robinson (not the BBC Political Editor) plays well the role of the elder brother. He is a surly teenager, uninterested and unreliable. His younger brother is played to perfection by Ty Simpkins. He is in fact a show-business veteran who has been performing since he was a baby, and it shows! He plays a small boy, who like all small boys, has bags of energy, and this is shown well. There are also emotional scenes which are done very well. The two boys feature heavily in the film.The boys arrive at the island as the guests of their aunt (the sister of their mother). However, as she is the chief administrator on the island, and thus very busy, she places them in the care of a surly baby-sitter. Auntie Clare is played by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard. Her character is humourless and work-obsessed. She may not be the best auntie in the world, or the best boss, however her destiny is not that ridiculous dereliction of duty Dwayne Johnson acted out in the recent 'San Andreas'.It is when the boys arrive at the hotel that we see some great scenes. John Ford's 'The Searchers', has that iconic scene of John Wayne inside the door-frame, as the door shuts. Here we have the opposite, as the hotel window opens, and we fly out of the window, to take in the park scenery. What a shot! Jurassic World's Director is Colin Trevorrow. This is only the second film he has directed. The first, which I am very fond of, is a time-travel rom-com called 'Safety Not Guaranteed' (2012). It was written by Derek Connolly. The two also were producers. Here, they have collaborated with the screenplay. Also here from 'Safety,' is Jake Johnson, who is also familiar for his role in the 'New Girl' TV series. Here he plays a cynical and thoughtful technician.The film itself is also cynical. There are a couple of clumsy product-placements. However this is balanced by what can only be described as a not too subtle indictment of capitalism. The best since 'Nightcrawler' (2014). This is seen in many scenes, but 'ride-boy' encapsulates this perfectly.The theme-park wants to make money, thus to keep visitor numbers up, newer dinosaurs need to be introduced. Thus we have DB Wong, from 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' TV series, playing a scientist who is working on that. Earlier this year, Mr Wong played a manic gambler in the con-rom-com 'Focus'. Here he once again plays the role of a serious doctor.Another Law & Order veteran, is also one of my favourite actors, Vincent D'Onofrio. Knowledge of his appearance, was decisive in choosing to see this film. Unlike the small part he played in last year's 'The Judge', here he gets a bigger and more meaty role. His character has a military background. He is cold and ruthless, as well as very persuasive in his forward planning and thinking. Casting must be rated highly. I was particularly happy to see many of my acting favourites in this film.Chris Pratt plays an animal-behaviourist, who understands and empathises with the dinosaurs. This puts him into conflict with the others administering the park. Irrfan Khan, plays a boss, and Lauren Lapkus an underling. Both small parts are played well and believably.The 3D-effects and the special-effects are all done well, and are also enjoyably viewed. The dinosaur scenes are exciting and thrilling. There is a fight sequence reminiscent of 'King Kong'.Much of the film is shot from the POV of the two brothers, who feature heavily in this film, just as much as the adult stars, thus this film will appeal to boys. However UK rating is 12A. Parents should be aware that the eating habits of the dinosaurs may be upsetting for young children. Though boys aged 12+ will lap it up.This film is a concrete lesson on the dangers of putting the pound (£) before principles, or the dollar ($) for that matter too. Scientists play god at their peril, and ours too. As they reverse history and plunge us back into the Jurassic World, we can only once again shout out the old battle-cry of 70 million years ago; ""Death to the dinosaurs!, long live the mammals!"" Film has a much better ending than 'San Andreas'.An enjoyable and exciting film. 10/10.","51 out of 118 found this helpful.

The latest is the most dangerous of them all. Then it escapes and chaos ensues.It's funny that Claire's heels became such a big complaint. The movie obviously knows it's a joke so pointing it out is a little beside the point. The biggest problem is that Claire isn't funny and I don't blame it all on BDH. The character is written badly and so is Owen. Almost every attempt at comedy ends with me groaning at its clumsiness. Claire and Owen have almost no chemistry. I hated them kissing in the middle of pterosaurs attack. It's just ridiculous. It's one of those cliché moves that needs to be outlawed. Stop kissing and shoot some pterosaurs.

I mean let's face it...more people lost on an island again wouldn't have been very original. I didn't dislike them, but thankfully massive improvements was made from The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3.I loved Jurassic Park. I thought the second film was decent enough, and the third was enjoyable even if it was very thin story-wise. Jurassic World, though, wipes the floor with the previous two films, and for me was almost just as enjoyable as the first. I enjoyed a lot of the homages to the previous films as well and they were nice touches.The film took a wee while to get going for me, and there were moments where I thought it was going to be a bit cheesy and full of cliché's, but thankfully this wasn't the case. Yes, there are cliché's scattered throughout the movie, but what film doesn't? It started off a bit ""ho-hum"" but it most definitely got better as it went on. Was the majority of it predictable? Pretty much, but it didn't make it any less entertaining.I think the biggest cliché's were some of the characters, mainly that of Owen (Chris Pratt). Him being a rough, buff macho man who's an ex-Navy SEAL is as cliché as you can get, along with the 'love/hate' relationship between him & Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). I'm surprised they never had him shirtless at some point. Thankfully it didn't become a romantic cheese-fest...apart from them stopping right in the middle of things to lip-smack that is.The CGI, as we have come to expect, is amazing and if I'm honest the first film's effects were just as good. It's just that this time there was much more and all on a larger scale. People will probably moan about it being a ""CGI-fest"", but at least this wasn't like Pacific Rim...all CGI and nothing else.Ignore the hate as this is definitely a must-see movie, especially if you loved the first film.","16 out of 35 found this helpful.

Unlike the quiet, thoughtful, and suspense filled park series, Jurassic world is a break-neck paced action film, and the sense of wonder is also glossed over.The emotional scenes are forced, there is a rushed romance, and a shoe-horned in divorce for the mandatory children in the move.(this movie didn't really need kids in it.) It is an amazing spectacle, that has a few thrown in, rushed through 'clever' moments, and exposition, but once that's out of the way, it plunges into insane, almost cartoon-like action, with poorly rendered dinosaurs doing over-the-top-things. The effects are weird, the cgi looking real in some shots and fake in others, and the dinosaur character models look odd, as all the dinosaurs have big feet, big heads, and just look like 3-d cartoons, especially in the case of the tyrannosaurs. The only time they look real is when the brontosaurus dies as they used a robotic dinosaur. In its credit, there are some cool concepts in this movie, such as dinosaurs imprinting on people, and the new attraction, a genetically engineered hybrid created to boost popularity, has an interesting back-story, although once it breaks loose it just behaves like a generic movie monster and attacks everything in sight. It is also a nerdy nit-pick of mine, but the dinosaurs, from a scientific point of view are all hideous, deformed monstrosities, especially in the case of the small meat-eating dinosaurs which we now know possessed feathers, and had inward facing palms, not loose zombie hands.But in this movies credit, it does state the cloned dinosaurs are mixed with other animals DNA making them look different, but it would have been cooler if the park cloned purer dinosaurs resembling the real deal.But all in all, this movie is good fun, the dinosaurs have a lot of personality, are still sweet and likable, Chris Pratt is affable, Claire is basically bones from bones. The climax, which i won't give away, is amazingly over-the-top.","16 out of 35 found this helpful.

It all seemed a bit weak, it's difficult to go into more detail about why I don't like it without seeming like giving spoilers, so in conclusion, some good scenes here and there but very weak and not worth it. I don't recommend you spend time or money to see this, wait until you can see it at home. I'm not a producer by any means but could have come up with a better plot and dialogue for this ruined Jurassic park film. Of course everyone has their opinions and the review above seems to have enjoyed it, you have been warned...","23 out of 51 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Thrilling and rousing sequel in which a genetically engineered hybrid Tiranosaurus goes berserk and carries out a killing spree","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3817011/?ref_=tt_urv","ma-cortes","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3270789/?ref_=tt_urv","28 September 2017","New chapter subsequently to the famous trilogy that gives exciting , sweeping fun and entertainment provided by giant animals made by means of incredible combination of computer generator -ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and Animatronics models . The Dinosaurs , Tiranosaurus and Velociraptors are the real protagonists , they're terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing . This original ideal is based on Michael Crichton's novel and writing credits by David Koepp adapted by screen-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver ; in addition , the story idea for this film was created by Steven Spielberg and Mark Protosevich to confer the notion of doing another installment in the Jurassic Park franchise . The picture starts on Isla Nublar , a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica , a group of construction workers and animal handlers , and security guards watch the creature within unseen . There are living dinosaurs and various prehistoric creatures genetically engineered by means of DNA cloned extracted from Jurassic animals found in mosquitoes preserved into amber from cretaceous period . It happens 22 years after the original Jurassic Park failed , the new park also known as Jurassic World where Dinos were allowed mix freely and to breed and it is opened for amusement and business . After years of studying genetics the scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur has been created , being a new hybrid ""attraction"" . During the process , the animal tries to escape , an act which leads to a mass panic , and the death of one of the workers . Meanwhile , the workaholic and stiff-upper-lip manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard , Ron Howard's daughter) has two unexpected visitors , her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the children . And the dedicated worker Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) , helped by Barry (Omar Sy) , is training four Velociraptors and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins , a greedy man with mean purports (Vincent D'Onofrio) , thinks of these wild animals can be trained for military use . The park attraction in property the Indian magnate Masrani (Irrfan Khan) ; as Jurassic Park's owner brings to various genetic experts (B.D. Wong) and other scientific people to practice embryos and other weird experiments . Later on , during an inspection , a security agent disables the security system so that he can make his surveillance , this enables a huge dinosaur to escape the enclosure . Then , the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur : ¨Indominus Rex"" , it means ""Fierce/Untamed King"" in Latin , after the hybrid dinosaur's erratically destructive and murderous nature that exhibits to run amok against the tourists . Then , the two kiddies escape through the park in a Gyrosphere featured in the resort tour , being pursued by the carnivorous animal and things go awry . This is an agreeable entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills , chills , emotion and lots of fun . Interesting and enjoyable premise about DNA of a prehistoric dinosaur taken from an ancient insect and subsequent scientist experiments leading a extremely lethal creature is wonderfully developed . Humans try desperately to escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and of course by attack of the Velociraptors . Simple dialog and plain tale , but the story is very exciting and inventive . In the film appears numerous predator animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors, Pterodactilos , Behemoths , Spinosaurious , Stegosauruses , Gallimimus stampede , although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables as large dinosaurs , triceratops and Brachiosaurius accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus . Along with a Mosasaurus that shows up soaking a lot of extras in the bleacher section and eating a shark but suggested that when the animal grabs the shark that the whole bleacher section submerge underwater using a hydraulic system so that the audience will be able to see the Mosasaurus feeding underwater . In fact , the prehistoric animals are truly the film stars , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There're also some stirring and exciting scenes where the actors give vigorous physical performances . Magnificent FX totally convincing are for combination of models and computer animation from Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas , as well as Phil Tippett effects returning to crew duties as Dinosaur Supervisor, reprising his role from the original film. . As always spectacular music by Michael Giacchino , replacing John Williams , and music in the trailer is a rendition of 'John Williams' original theme , this marks the first ""Jurassic"" film for Michael Giacchino ; and excellent and colorful cinematography by John Schwartzman . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Colin Trevorrow . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . Other entries of this fantastic saga are the followings : ¨Jurassik park¨ by Steven Spileberg followed by ¨Lost world¨ directed again by Spielberg and ¨Jurassik Park III¨ by Joe Johnston . After Jurassic World became the fourth highest grossing film of all time, Jurassic World 2 was announced for 2018 , being directed by J.A. Bayona . The film will appeal to teenagers and grown-up , but no for small kids by violent , realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

In a marketing scheme to create buzz about the park, scientists create what is known as the Indominus Rex, but what they have created is worse then they could have ever imagined.I remember watching this once, shortly after it was released on dvd but I couldn't remember specifics until I started watching it. Watching it again I found that my initial reaction was that this is a great film. But upon further reflection, I found that I do consider this movie to be good but not great.The reason my opinion changed is because of how fun this film is. Once you get the initial character introductions done the film is very thrilling, but that is a very big distraction to some poor writing.Chris Pratt is incredible as Owen Grady and is easily the best character in this film. His connection to the raptors is handled very well and whenever their on screen you feel the sense of fear but also mesmerization. Bryce Dallas Howard is also very good as Claire Dearing and I throughly enjoyed her characters arc. The two kids on the other hand played by Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are both very underdeveloped. They are given some interesting back story's but once the dinosaur mayhem begins they don't touch on it at all.Their are a good amount of subplots that are all as well underdeveloped. The subplots involving Vincent D'Onofrio and BD Wongs characters are touched on but not visited enough for them to be intriguing.Although their are underdeveloped characters and plots the core of what makes Jurassic movies so fun is there. The movie is constantly thrilling and in my opinion the visuals are across the board great. The use of the new dinosaur is great and as I mentioned I really enjoyed the use of the raptor training.Overall this is a good film with a couple of great characters and a thrilling plot, but the underdevelopment of certain characters and sub plots taint the overall quality of the film.7.5/10

I was very wrong... this film held a great amount of action and surprises, I could not even blink during this film in case I missed something, it has to be the most exciting and thrilling film I have ever seen and people will disagree with me when I say I think it is better than Jurassic Park, it felt like we really saw the sights of the island in much more detail and the story was absolutely brilliant. I do think they should end it there for the Jurassic Series as this film makes an excellent end to an excellent series. Well Done to Colin Trevorrow for directing such an excellent film. Cannot wait until this is on Blu Ray because I just want to watch it again!10/10, Stunning Movie.","117 out of 203 found this helpful.

The cast is also 10/10.But now comes the most important question, would I want to see this film again? The answer is a solid ""no"". Even if someone gave me a free ticket I would just give it back to him. The reason is this: predictable ending. The good-guys always make it without a scratch. Now why on earth would we go to see a film where we already know the outcome? Because we are born suckers. We spend all of our money on such filthy, depraved, generic trash films instead of doing something good with it such as buying a homeless person a meal or visiting and comforting someone who is terminally ill. Do not show any of your kids movies unless they are of an educative purpose or documentary, where they learn something. Take your kids to the park, camping or seaside rather then these films. Limit and monitor their internet use as well. Teach them to do simple household chores in your spare time. And make sure they are doing their homework.Back to the film: Twenty-two years after Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs on the Central American island of Isla Nublar, a new park, Jurassic World, has become a successful resort. The Masrani Global Corporation – owner of the genetics company InGen that creates the dinosaurs – has been operating the park on the same island for the past ten years. Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World to see their aunt Claire, the park's operations manager. Claire, a busy workaholic, assigns her assistant to be their guide, but the boys evade her and explore the resort on their own.Verdict: pure 100% grade CGI effects churned by modern computers. Vincent D'Onofrio is the pick of the bunch followed by both Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. The direction was so professionally handled, that I thought maybe Spielberg or Lucas was directing the film. Well it turns out that Colin T. Trevorrow who won the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award for Safety Not Guaranteed(2012) had been given the chance to direct this film. And thoroughly deserved. Also I'd like to mention Irrfan Khan is becoming a Hollywood regular with good films like The Amazing Spider-Man and Life Of Pi.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The only reason I went to see it after reading those reviews which all pointed that its not all that also said not bad yet not great was that I had nothing else better to do that evening!! and Boy was I so wrong!!!! Seriously at least 70% of the comments out here are so damn faithful to Jurassic 1&2 to the extent they became blinded to anything that could actually be better!! And to be fair to those who dissed this movie they all pointed out that it is better than the 3rd installment which to me meant nothing much because Part 3 was a total waste of time and anything compared to it will be better!! Therefor I seriously considered waiting for it to come on DVD instead of wasting valuable time driving down to me local IMAX to watch it!! Well I went with almost zero expectations which is not good in my case because it makes me see the worst in a movie instead of being optimistic and boy that movie rocked me side way upwards downwards you name it and the strength ultimately came from the amazing extra ordinary story line and the effects combined with some amazing direction and camera work that blow me away!! I immediately went down to memory lane to remind myself how good really Jurassic Park 1&2 actually were?!!However I could not help myself thinking this story line and movie all together is actually better way better than the original Jurassic Park and the reason for this is that this movie is more serious you may say and darker than the first two with a solid captivating story line that I would expect would catch the attention of almost anyone serious about movies. I consider myself one of the world's best movie watchers and if there was an award I would surely run for it because I have seen almost every decent movie that has come out from 1965 till now with a few exceptional ones beyond those dates!! That doesn't mean that my taste in movies would appeal to everyone nor it means I know better than the rest of you may be just a little bit!!!! This movie is world class and by far the best Blockbuster of 2015 Hands both Down!! Go watch it folks and be fair when you rate a movie","100 out of 172 found this helpful.

I did sort of like Bryce Dallas Howard, though. Also Katie McGrath. I realize that it is not intended to be super-realistic movie. But a couple of the numerous plot holes bugged me immensely. One is kids(!) being able to start and drive a jeep that had been abandoned for 22 years. Wow. Another was Ms. Howards ""ridiculous"" shoes. She runs full speed on pavement and through jungle (!) wearing high heeled pumps, and never breaks a heel or loses a shoe.

This, however, realizes the story of Jurassic Park wasn't so much about the Dinosaurs as it was about their creation and the science behind it. The other movies just had people vaguely interacting with the Dinosaurs, not expanding upon this cloning science. This movie smartly serves as a direct sequel because it introduces the idea of splicing multiple pieces of Dinosaur DNA together to create an ideal or modified new species. It also smartly serves as a direct sequel by actually talking about the Park in question, where the sequels took place on some other island with events having no direct affect on the Park or the dinosaurs there in the end. Different people in the fictional universe unconnected to those working on the park, such as Ingen and other scientists working on something new, were plaguing the sequels but here it we know what the main players are up to after all these years.The problem I have with this movie is obviously the characterization. The story has many similar notes to the original but how those similar events are carried out in a new way make the movie watchable. The new ideas presented make it interesting but it was almost difficult on the first viewing because I genuinely did not care even a little bit about a single character in this, other than the Ingen Scientist from the original film. The characters were just there to fill the roles they were needed for, but that was it. They didn't add a new personality to go with it, they just had them carry out their roles and nothing more. Furthermore, the constant shoving down our throats that we shouldn't care about the park as Dinosaurs are old news and don't matter makes me bored because it makes the viewers think the dinosaurs are boring, making us care less about the main events. It's very difficult to ignore which would make caring about the positive part of this movie, the story, easier.","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

If you expect ground-breaking CGI, look elsewhere. As has been repeatedly stated, some of the special effects felt low-budget. There were some recycled scenes that paid homage to the other movies in the series, but since they have been done before they lacked the original suspense that caused so many of us to grip our seats in fear and anticipation. Most of the deaths were so outrageous that they were laughable. A lot of the subplots were dropped halfway through or in the middle of the movie. Characters who started off playing a somewhat central role seemed to disappear without us knowing if they survived or not.Overall, the acting wasn't awful. Chris Pratt does a surprisingly excellent job of breaking away from his usual comedic roll into an action star. Bryce Dallas Howard and Infan Khan also play their roles quite well. Everyone else is Meh. But that seems to fit with the sometimes good and sometimes meh script and special effects. So why 7 stars?Because despite how implausible and cheap some of it was, overall it was still a FUN movie that everyone should see once in the theaters. Don't see it expecting to be wowed, see it expecting to be entertained. Then, and only then, you won't be disappointed.","14 out of 31 found this helpful.

The dinosaurs looked very real and that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this movie. For the rest the storyline is very lame and predictable. From the beginning I had an allergic reaction to that little kid Gray (played by Ty Simpkins). You wish the whole time he will die in the most atrocious way possible. But you know it will never happen. I hope that one day he will play in Game Of Thrones because there all the main characters die eventually and that's what makes it so much better then those predictable movies. That kid is one of the main reasons I will never have kids. What an annoying kid he was. Another guy that I don't really like is Chris Pratt. In Parks and Recreation he was the only character that really bothered me. And since I know he is an avid hunter and Jesus worshiper I can stand him even lesser. I was also hoping he would die, but you know it won't happen. Bad acting doesn't make you die when you are the so called hero in those movies. All in all you will like the movie for the dinos but don't expect anything from the story.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

The movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I've watched the Jurassic Park movies at least a hundred times and the first one has always been my favorite - but this one blows it out of the water. The CGI is excellent. It's got a good storyline. The acting is excellent. And it's also quite funny. Chris Pratt does an excellent job and really brings a lot of laughter, especially at times when there is suspense. I highly recommend this movie, it's definitely worth the money.","88 out of 150 found this helpful.

Oh, and not to get confused with the Marvel connotations at all, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard (Guardians of the Galaxy and Spiderman actors respectively) star in this brain-fart of a blockbuster side by side, and have no emotional chemistry most of the time they're on screen.Despite the script being pretty dumb even for blockbuster standards, Colin Trevorrow does a good job at directing an otherwise maniacal story unfold on the screen. It's an entertaining film, but for a movie that broke so many records, it's surprisingly forgettable and disposable compared to other more substantial blockbusters in recent years: The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, and Mad Max: Fury Road just to name a few more substantial films, at least for my taste in movies.Entertaining, but not the kind of blockbuster that will be remembered for generations to come; it's more of a come-and-go kind of film.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

It is indeed the most fitting sequel. It's clear that the corporate sector and humans in general haven't learned from their mistakes. They have created a new hybrid to increase the visitor count to the park. In the process, they have compromised human safety and thoughts of how devastating the consequences would be. That's what JW uses as the primal theme revealing the consequences of the violation of the natural order. The Indominius Rex, a product of human intelligence and progress turns back on it's creators and anything that crosses it's path. Now, it's up to Owen Grady and Claire to contain and restrain the 'killing machine'.Acting: Chris Pratt fits into the skin of Owen Grady. He gives a serious and intense performance. He doesn't make the scenes involving him training the Velociraptors cheesy.Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress. She prove it in ""The Help"" and she has done it again. She is convincing as the serious corporate woman struggling to keep her foot firmly on the floor and her evolution into an action heroine is entertaining.Though Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are fine but Tim and Lex were far better. The latter two had the best scene in the franchise involving the raptors in the kitchen.Direction: Trevorrow goes close to Spielberg in his direction of the film. He took up a linear plot and gave it a fine execution. Hats off to him for providing Jurassic Park with the most fitting sequel.Story: Though the story was far better in the first film, yet the script in JW shines and entertains. It rests firmly on the screenplay that succeeds in entertaining the audiences. The second half was epic and the climax was grand and applause worthy (best in the franchise). Definitely worth the wait, the hype and the money spent.Technical Aspects: The background score is effective as always and carries a feeling of nostalgia with it. The CGI and the animatronics have been well blended. The editing was tight. The only complaint the running time could have been at least 15 minutes longer.Acting: 6.5/10 Direction: 7/10 Story and Screenplay: 6/10+ 8/10= 7/10 Music: 10/10 Technique: 9.5/10","23 out of 58 found this helpful.

So while we get a remix version of the first movie with some enhancements (Dinosaur and people-wise), this can be fun to watch.So why ""just"" 6/10? You get Chris Pratt in this, who ""killed"" it (not literally of course), but even if he has some real ""suave"" (scenes), he can't lift this higher than it can get. Visually stunning with some very nice action scenes indeed. Of course there is sequel material to this reboot. And it's as predictable as it gets.

By today, very few were expecting to seethe dinosaurs to strike back again for more explosive considering the development hell of the third sequel that is was eventually thrown out. With over decades past since the series debut, many will go into this film and wonder whether or not director Colin Trevrrow and executivep producer Steven Spielberg are able to effectively capture spirit of the predecessor, if not the everlasting nostaglia. Judging by the screenplay and visual effects put to great use, this reboot of the series succeeds at doing both, if a little flawed in it's execution. So goes on this time around? Well, this takes place twenty years after the events of the first film, Jurassic Park has re-opened with dinosaurs who are now genetically modified. Working at the park is operations manager Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) who is scheduled a visit with her two nephews Gray (played by Ty Simpkins) and Zach (played by Nick Robinson, and velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt). What starts off as a fine day of enormous tourism turns into utter chaos when the dinosaurs break loose and causing havoc throughout the park.When it comes to rebooting a classic franchise, it is understandable to be fearful of the spirit and novelty to be lost in a sea of failed ideas. Luckily, this film manages to capture almost same fun and excitement fans experienced 22 years ago when the dinosaurs began chomping and roaring on the silver screen. Though the absence of John Williams' classic score and the direction of Steven Spielberg can be gently felt, they both do little to take away from the endless excitement Colin Trevorrow brings the picture. The anticipated intensity begins not long after our prehistoric creatures break loose from their confined territory and launch a massive onslaught throughout the titular theme park attraction, and thousands of calm tourists are quickly triggered into panic mode running and screaming for their dear lives. These sequences are beautifully brought together in sweet CGI and surface level special effects to dazzle the eyes. But the fun doesn't quite end there. The charisma of Chris Pratt is gracefully brought to the screen often alternating between comic relief and light-hearted heroism. Pratt fits perfectly in this role, and his light-hearted personality he brings to the character is often too likable to ignored.Jurassic World is definitely one of the best films of the summer, and by man means makes for a solid, if slightly undermined return for the Jurassic Park franchise. With the wide plethora of explosive visuals and action sequences the feat the eyes hardcore movie goers everywhere, it is a film destined to see a bright sunshine at the box office.","35 out of 95 found this helpful.

However 'Jurassic World' doesn't try to be anything new, in fact it goes back to the original movie and adds on a few tasty elements. The film is set twenty two years after the original park was closed down after the disastrous events, and an Indian tycoon has now invested in a bigger and better park. However events take a disastrous turn once again due to genetically created experiments that are taking place behind the scenes. The story is good but not too inventive and the action sequences are breath-taking, whereas predictably some of the characters are abit two dimensional. The film is huge and highly enjoyable whether you are a fan of 'Jurassic Park' movies or not, this is old fashioned mayhem. In fact it is much better then the highly rated 'Godzilla' movie from 2014, which never got going. Jurassic World does what a great sequel should do, which is to take what the original had and change a few things while adding on a few sub-plots. Take the family and settle down to a a couple of hours of summer movie fun!","115 out of 200 found this helpful.

So how did the latest instalment in the franchise by Colin Trevorrow hold up against the rest? Lets start off with the story, a well paced blockbuster, with some nice turns that while aren't mind-blowing, they will surely keep you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to say too much and give it away, but they also wrote in some wonderful nods to the original which the fans of the first will adore and the younger fans will love when they are told about them. There is times when the subplots do not seem to make that much sense, that could be due to longevity that the project has gone through with numerous rewrites and tweaks, notably the parents getting divorced it didn't add anything to the film and didn't change the view of the young lads. That aside the story was solid and simple but a nice ride.Another stellar cast for a Jurassic Park film, who would have thought that they could build a cast that was as enjoyable to watch as the original? I surely didn't, there was some brilliant performances some that really stood out for me were Ty Simpkins who at 13 is kick ass in the acting world, Nick Robinson, Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt who is fun in ANYTHING he does, the dude is just a joy to watch plus his and Bryce's on screen chemistry felt real. D'Onofrio serves as the human villain in the film and to be honest he really isn't as good as we are used to seeing him, it feels over the top if you will. Saying these performances stood up does not mean I found the others lacking, just not as great as these specific ones. Not the right place to say but yet again another performance from Nick Robinson that adds credence to my personal opinion that he would make a pretty good Peter Parker, thought it since I first seen him in ""Melissa & Joey"".Yet again another film in the series that had some breathtaking cinematography, which was done by the very talented Academy Award nominee John Schwartzman, some of the wide shots are beautiful. Which for the Jurassic World franchise is a big thing, I mean look at the first, it has one of the greatest all time pieces of cinematography, so this one had to have some wonderful shots too, which do not worry it does.Hard to believe this is only Colin Trevorrow's second feature film, which he did not only direct he also co-writ with his previous writing partner Derek Connolly who he worked with on ""Safety Not Guaranteed"". Which was an enjoyable film according to the people I have spoken to about it, Colin does what many directors over the past decade have worried they couldn't do, he made a film 22 years after the original and still was able to keep that wonderful charm the first had. This film is by no means better than the first, but was easily the second best in the franchise, after this I can see Colin going VERY far in the movie world.My only complaint really was the lack of practical effects, I have always been an advocate for practical effects. The use of them in the original especially when the dinosaur hatches from the egg was something that made me fall in love with the art form that is practical effects. I just feel more drawn in when it comes it practical effects, not to say the CGI was poor or anything, the film was still visually stunning, it is just a personal preference of mine to have visual effects if and when possible. If so we would still have masters like Rick Baker working in the business and not retiring. That all being said, the visuals effects were amazing to watch and I'm sure anybody would agree, they also had a wonderful use of scale on the dinosaurs to really give the audience the feeling of how big these ""monsters"" truly would be if around today.Overall this film was a thoroughly good watch, heck good it was great. I enjoyed it start to finish, it was not what I expected but it was brilliant none the less. Throughout the film there is a few misses, however the rest of the film really delivers in a big way I found. While it doesn't hit the heights of the first film it was truly a masterpiece in the blockbuster, bringing back the summer family blockbuster I really hope. Fingers crossed this gets Steven Spielberg to jump back into this world and he picks up Chris Pratt for the next Indiana Jones film. This film excelled in all categories and is a brilliant film for all to see, truly a revival of the franchise.","33 out of 90 found this helpful.

In fact it's very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg's deft touch.There's a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick. The writers introduce a couple of new mighty monsters to the series, hell of beasties for sure, while the photography, stunt work and musical score all impress greatly.The Velociraptor plot line is crummy and daft, almost as daft as Bryce's high heels character arc, and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times, but it's a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like it's some sort of series disgrace. 7/10","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

I was just hoping this film would keep me awake, luckily within the first 15 mins of this film I was already attached to the characters and as the film carried on you could start to tell what suddenly was going to happen for the two characters Zach and Gray. At this point I was literally yelling at the screen telling the characters to either 'watch out', 'run' or 'move out of the way'. I'm pretty sure I ended up waking the guy next to me up, but I didn't really care at that point I was too busy watching this movie to really notice.

I kinda felt like the trailer showed a lot from the movie itself, mainly the big bad dino. Well, I was wrong. I don't like to judge a movie by the trailer, but when I watched the actual movie, I was clearly surprised.The movie starts off with very-well done character development, and you get to know what Jurassic World theme park is all about. The way it works, the main attractions, the overall park functionality are actually believable. The characters stand out for they personality and it's quite impressive the way they connect through-out the movie run- time.Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is able to think like the dinos, and he raised 4 Velociraptors to obey his instructions. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is in charge of the park functionality. Zach and Gray are Claire's nephews. They get into serious trouble by running away from the park.And then, there's Indominus Rex, the genetically modified hybrid, that is able to think, hunt and make chaos like no other dinosaur. It's huge, and it's the most vicious creature ever seen in a Jurassic Park film yet. The Indominus like every other dino in the movie looks absolutely astonishing, it's wonderful to see how much the CGI advanced since the first movie.There's tons of detail in the dinos expressions and CG landscapes. But it's not all CG, like the original they also used special effects with real life props of dinos in some scenes.It's predictable in some parts, but I can assure you that it won't cease to amaze. A movie like this, is the perfect example of what a well-done sequel is, even though the movie ignores the existence of The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3.This was, for me, the most anticipated movie this year, because I've been waiting for it for several years and it's finally here. I recommend to anyone who's a fan of Jurassic Park series.","161 out of 286 found this helpful.

Jurassic World's plot was pretty basic. It was clear that it wasn't going for a deep, engaging plot. And it certainly didn't have a deep, engaging plot. It was still lot's of fun to see how everything played out though. The characters were actually a lot better done than I expected. All four main characters received relatively equal amounts of screen time, so no one ever felt more important than another. This made it difficult to figure out who the main character was. This was actually really impressive to me, considering it's typically blatantly obvious who the most important character is. The movie was very entertaining. Although some things didn't go well with the rest of the movie, they were always drowned out by the fact that dinosaurs were everywhere. But instead of being small-scale like in the first movie, this was large-scale so loads of people were constantly getting eaten and killed by dinosaurs. Overall Jurassic World is just a heck of a lot of fun. The plot isn't amazing, the characters were good and quite impressive, and there was lot's of good, clean, dinosaur fun. If this movie's goal was to simply entertain, then they achieved that multiple times over. Sure, there was one scene in particular that I felt was out of place, but once again, it was drowned out by everyone getting eaten and the dinosaurs. In the end I would recommend Jurassic World, but not for someone looking for something amazing, but for something fun and entertaining.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

Even taken on its own, more lenient popcorn-merits though, this CGI-laden dinosaur romp is a bag of liquorice all sorts. On one hand there are some rip-roaring set pieces that evoke a child-like joy, on the other a clutch of embarrassingly corny moments (hello, heroic velociraptor in slow-mo) that should have never made it past the drawing board. For every amusingly tongue-in-cheek line delivered by Chris Pratt's charismatic protagonist, there's an equally dumb plot hole – like a ludicrously stupid creature cameo in the climax – that reeks of a subpar script. The CGI is not as distracting as you might think and provides director Colin Trevorrow with the opportunity to craft a few spectacular sequences, yet there's a disappointing lack of tension and scares on display. The hit and miss output stays true for the eclectic cast. Pratt is affable, Bryce Dallas Howard is steely but likable, Jake Johnson is humorous in full-nerd mode, and Irrfan Khan and Omar Sy add gravitas in small roles; whilst Vincent D'Onofrio is depressingly one-dimensional, and child duo Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are unbearably awkward and bland. An admirable effort to rekindle the dino-magic that falls squarely into the good-but-not-great category, its spate of flaws makes it hard to recommend with confidence.","13 out of 31 found this helpful.

The film depicts the Isla Nubar 30 years or so after the original Jurassic Park fiasco. The difference is that Jurassic World is bigger, hugely popular, with many more genetically-mixed dinosaurs.The cast stars some young actors as the kids, not sure who they are - their acting extended as far as being scared. But Bryce Dallas Howard (Girl in the Water; The Village) was outstanding as Claire, the aunt who runs Jurassic World, and has thrust upon her these two nephews for whom she has no time - busy working single lady. Of course, enter Chris Pratt as Owen, semi-mysterious Dinosaur trainer with special skills to direct the Raptors (you remember them from the original). The movie was worth watching just to see these two interact with each other. They were the stars.The other major stars are the dinosaurs, or the CGI people who did a fantastic job putting all these dinosaurs into almost every scene. Tremendously life-like depictions really are the star of the show.I hope/trust you are not going to this movie for the story line. Shocker - something big gets out - things go wrong - people get stomped on and killed. Can't someone save the day?Of course, because Bryce is already signed up for a sequel. Although you know the story, and it's pretty much a repeat of the original series, the two main stars pull off a tough job and keeping you on your seat with some innovative chase scenes I have not seen before.All told, a satisfying story, kind of like putting on those well worn shoes you have, which feel so comfortable and familiar. Enjoy.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

The film is cleverly made and the storyline is credible and in my opinion not to far fetched as you would expect from an American produced film. It touched on the reality aspect that mankind want to control nature and use this as a way of profit by creating a dinosaur (asset) bigger and stronger than all. The theme tune of what we all know well has been slowed down and is played at the right points in the film which adds a nice effect. I also like the scene where they find the old building from the original park which brought us back to the original film and provided a nice touch. Excellent film, and will definitely purchase this on DVD when available. A job well done!","69 out of 116 found this helpful.

I went to the pictures as a kid to watch the first one, and I'm absolutely glad I was talked into going to watch this one with my fiancé all these years later, who also watched the first one at the time. Dinosaurs, although obviously not real, are still pretty cool to look at, and they look absolutely boss in this film! And that's why I don't get why people are moaning about it. I think that the idea of a bigger , angrier, smarter dinosaur wasn't the most original idea admittedly, but again, as dinosaurs ARE NOT REAL anyway, it hardly matters. This film was boss because it was quite jumpy at times, funny at times, and during loads of it I found myself thinking how cool it all was, and how I was gutted that dinosaurs actually don't exist to run riot, because it all actually looked quite good fun. Anyway, I've been telling anyone who has listened to go and watch it since last night, and this is actually the first time I ever wrote a review for anything, I just felt I should when I noticed how much the ratings had dropped since it came out , for mad reasons such as being predictable. A dinosaur film about dinosaurs eating people? What else should they have done then.

My only hope was that it would be at least as good as Jurassic Park III, which, despite its reputation, is a perfectly decent sequel to the first one. Thankfully, it exceeded my expectations - at least by a bit. It is better than JP III by a nose, and a lot better than The Lost World. All I wanted was plenty of dino mayhem, and Colin Trevorrow delivers it with good humor. There are lots of dinosaurs and lots of action. Not a single setpiece as good as the big two from the first film, mind you, but the pterosaur attack is pretty awesome and the final battle is satisfying. The human characters are much less interesting than those of the first film, who aren't very interesting, either. Chris Pratt is a fine lead, though. I could really have done without Bryce Dallas Howard running around in her high heels. Even if she does get a big heroic moment, the character is just a lame stereotype for most of the film. The two teens could have easily been eaten the second they appeared and it wouldn't have bothered me. I enjoyed the presence of New Girl's Jake Johnson and Orange Is the New Black's Lauren Lapkus in the control room. There's a moment where Johnson looks at Pratt and in my mind he was asking Pratt off camera, ""You think in a couple years when my sitcom ends I could get a comic book franchise?""","14 out of 36 found this helpful.

It's one of those ""Love it or hate it"" where everybody has such intense feelings for it. I think that's because there are two main ideas of what a Jurassic Park movie should be. Is it a cerebral franchise that illustrates the hubris of humanity's attempts to control nature or is it just a fun monster movie romp with thrills and chills? I guess that's up to the audience so I won't tell you how you should judge the movie on those standards. I'm just going to judge it from your basic movie going perspective.Let me just say that all the dinosaur fights were fun, I almost always laughed at the comic relief, the story was easy to follow with generally believable character motives, and it moved at a nice pace. Some of the acting was pretty good. Chris Pratt was a fun character, and probably the best thing going for this movie. I do have complaints though: Vincent D'Onofrio's character was entirely one-dimensional, the CGI just isn't always convincing, and there are a lot of moments throughout the film that just strain your credulity. I realize it's a movie with dinosaurs come to life but it was a bit much at times. It even has a number of monster movie clichés that make the movie a bit predictable.I enjoyed my time with the movie, but it wasn't always as tense as it could have been. I guess if you judge it as a monster movie, it's fine. In all honesty, the plot felt like a Syfy original monster movie, only with a sizable budget and bankable actors - that's not entirely as bad as that sounds. If you're looking for something intellectually stimulating that forces you to think about the human condition, you might have a little meat, but you're going to be left hungry. Your enjoyment boils down to what you expect from the franchise.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

It does entertain at times as long as you shut down your brain for a while and I guess that's how these films are meant to be viewed. Just plain old entertainment. It looks visually great with great landscapes and realistic dinosaurs, unfortunately the plot is weak and the script whilst having a few snappy one liners falls a bit flat. Chris Pratt does a good job as the lead but Bryce Dallas Howard's character is a disaster. I spent much of the second half of the film praying she'd be eaten. Sadly that would require a more imaginative plot and we are instead left to suffer one of the poorest performances from a lead in quite a while. The rest of the cast are OK but nothing more than the usual stereotypes. For all it's flaws there are some great scenes especially in the first half and I was intermittently entertained. This will probably appeal more to younger audiences than older ones who have seen all this before. Jurassic World just about scrapes a 7 for me but I won't rush to watch it again for some time.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

Pretty much all the characters give decent performances for an action flick but almost all the characters have been taken from other films. The plot kind of resembles How To Train Your Dragon 2 near the end though I'm not complaining that much because it does add that ""animal food chain/social dominance"" theme created by the big dino asset. There's a enough funny and heartwarming moments to make this film good popcorn, but nothing groundbreaking.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

Well that claim is patently absurd since this movie offers nothing unique of its own, but rather plays with the groundwork laid by the previous movies (particularly the first). Jurassic Park was an instant classic that had a little bit of everything. This one is just a very good movie and, yes, it's probably the best of the sequels so far. I did like the third one better than many did, however. The cast here is decent, with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both likable leads. The two little kids are kind of forgettable, though, and the character played by Vincent D'Onofrio is straight out of the Big Book of Clichéd Villains. The script is good with plenty of humor and nods to the first film. Michael Giacchino's rousing score is nice but tries a little too hard at times to match John Williams (an impossible task). What everyone watches a movie like this for is the dinosaur action and this has that in spades. We get regular dinos and souped-up genetically engineered hybrid dinos, as well as the fan favorite velociraptors figuring into things in a clever way. The special effects are great and the monster fight climax is kick-ass. If you go into it with just the expectation of being entertained, you'll have fun watching it. If you go in expecting to be 'wowed' like you were with the first Jurassic Park, then you'll probably be a little underwhelmed by it. It's a good movie but it doesn't offer much that it can call its own.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

I will start I suppose by saying this is in my opinion the Best movie in the series thus far and I know there will be a debate about this but that is how I feel. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I will start with the story which is basic it's about the park finally being opened to tourists after twenty plus years and everything going to Hell. I loved the pacing of the movie though because it doesn't just start with guns blazing it's a slow sizzle to some Fantastic set pieces in cinematography. I would also like to note that they had everything you would want to see in terms of tourists interacting with the park and enjoying it before the fun begins. I would compare it to ""28 Weeks Later"" and them settling down before the Zombie outbreak starts. I will move on to the acting which was very well done Chris Pratt killed it as Owen and was by far the star of the movie. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and also Vincent D' Onofrio who played Hoskins. I also enjoyed the banter between the brothers in the movie. Overall they all did a wonderful job of bringing life to the movie. I will now move onto the final part which is the action. I absolutely fell in love with the action set-pieces they were utilized perfectly and not overused. I can only compare it to Godzilla 2014 in terms of fight scenes between the Dinosaurs. I must say that once Blackwater or AKA InGen soldiers came into the mix I was sold. I will say this without spoiling anything that they had a nostalgic scene with Raptors just like the scene in ""The Lost World"". I will close by saying that if you are debating on watching this movie just GO and watch it and I guarantee that you will love it. The final fight scene was Phenomenal.","105 out of 185 found this helpful.

Usually I tell myself to wait till the next day to rate it because normally it is higher when I sleep on it. The movie was very predictable I knew what was going to happen before it happened, although a plus would be that I loved all the references they had from the previous movies, but again I was never ""wowed"". Till the first half of the movie my rating barely hit 5/10, it had a dull start; also there were many other flaws that could have been fixed but again it's a movie. Things that got on my nerves: (spoiler alert) - how can that 8 year old kid get that original Jurassic Park jeep working after sitting idle for 22 years? Also, the raptors being trained (though shown in the trailer). Meh. I prefer it to be dinosaurs vs humans not dinosaurs and humans vs dinosaurs. Also those kids had a hundred chances to run instead they just stare at the big dinosaurs. And what was the deal with the older brother? Why was he so grumpy the entire time? The action however was superb and because of that the movie got a passing grade, otherwise it would have hovered at the 5-6/10 mark. The acting was average at best, some did above average and some below average. Overall, it was exciting (second half) action packed movie. Still - nothing compared to the original.

And then there's the gender issues. And the stupidity of all the characters. All of this is very much out in the open.What is more interesting, is to see all the effort the filmmakers put into acknowledging the expectations of the audience, and responding to the expected reactions they would have to the plot.One of the first scenes acknowledges the feathers-or-no-feathers-situation, and they make passing mentions to it later on in the movie as well. The same goes with the over the top plot of the movie, which it acknowledges and comments on. But it all falls kind of flat,a s it only acknowledges the choices they have made, but do not really comment on them. For instance, it makes fun of naming dinosaurs after products, but still features product placement heavily. It mentions how the audience always expect more and more, and the only way to make them happy is to give them more. Which is what this movie does just after.Basically: It acknowledges the challenges of making Jurassic Park 4, but rather than provide a solution, the movie gives up and blames the audience for wanting what it gives us.That said: It's a fun movie. It's hard to go wrong with dinosaurs and Pratt. But I wish they had higher ambitions.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

Don't read the negative reviews by some who argue that the main characters do stupid, illogical things, that the story is predictable, blah blah. Walking into the theater, 22 years after I saw the first Jurassic Park in 1993 as a teenager, I had the following expectations: a full working Jurassic Park with lots of visitors and exciting attractions built on the foundations laid out by Jurassic Park 1, kids getting into trouble, a male (or female) lead who do ballsy things and cool dinosaurs whose realism should surpass the previous 3 Jurassic movies. And that is exactly what Colin Trevorrow delivered. The dinosaurs look bad ass ; the hybrid dinosaur is believable and the velociraptors rule the movie. The pace is fast, the actors well cast and lots of people die. I won't spoil it any further so you just have to know that you can feel throughout the movie that it was directed by a new generation of directors who understand better than the old masters (Spielberg) how to combine humour, cgi, action and a tight direction. Humour you say ? Yes, Trevorrow manages to put in lots of funny bits even at tense moments and watch very closely to the dozens of winks to the first Jurassic Park movie he put in. The movie's score is somewhat in the background and makes full use of the original score by John Williams which was a smart move by composer Michael Giacchino, he knew not to try and do better than Williams. At certain scenes it was so quiet in the theater you could hear a pin drop so a bombastic score would simply have ruined it. Oh and the last 15 minutes .. pure epic dinosaur magic.","71 out of 123 found this helpful.

I don't care that it's fiction and highly improbable, what matters is that these films take me to another land and in many ways another time.....65 million years ago to be precise. To be honest there wasn't anything terribly new in this film, two children, a rugged hero type, a woman running around in her high heels and a man with an alternative agenda. What we did get however, was dinosaurs on our side, and I love that. As portrayed in the film, the public want bigger, scarier attractions and a film going audience in a sense want that too. In this film however, we got more of the thinking man's dinosaur and a gaggle of well meaning people whose intentions were good but misplaced, a a couple of characters who really need to get eaten.

The movie starts off with two brothers leaving the city to visit Jurassic World, a theme park with real live dinosaurs. As the audience gets introduced to this park, with all kinds of different attractions and animals, we learn that the park has problems keeping a constant flow of guests. Dinosaurs are now mainstream and the attractions are mainly for children. To combat this, the park creates a new type of dinosaur ever couple years to boost attendance. However, things go bad when they bread the perfect predator, who of course gets loose and starts killing for fun.The brothers are out in the park when the dino gets out, and Chris Pratt must rescue them, while at the same time avoiding this new dino. He must also battle other people, as Igen, a government agency, is planning on using dinosaurs for future wars and they have a special interest in this new dino.The movie itself was really good. They skipped on making the dinos new a magically and took a different route. They introduced a theme park where the average people could pet, feed, and even ride dinosaurs. I loved this idea, of actually having a park created. The story line was not too complicated and easy to follow. Sometimes too easy and too predictable, but there were other moments which, at least myself, was surprised. The acting was pretty good, Chris Pratt was of course the best actor. The female lead, Bryce Dallas Howard, did a good job in her role, despite being in high heels in the entire movie(not likely). There has been criticism for the lack of a strong female lead, but she wasn't suppose to be the tough one, she was a business women and when everyone life was on the line, had the idea that saved everyone.So overall, i recommend this movie, it was really fun, lots of action, the best dinosaur fights I've ever seen, and some comedy thrown in that was, for the most part, not forced in. The raptors were not as domesticated as the trailer and appear, and I've heard criticism again about taking away the raptors as the sneaky deadly dinos, but they were amazing. The CGI was very well done, and made the movie a joy to watch......I gave it a 8/10 because it did have flaws, the women were always crying while the men were the strong ones, the comedy felt forced once or twice, it had predictable moments, but overall, it was very fun, very funny and worth the crazy expensive ticket price...Go see it, and sit back for a good time.....and people need to stop being so nit-picky","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

This can mainly be pinned down to the cast, starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, whose characters are all (eventually) likable enough to want to follow their journey, especially Pratt, who was initially criticised for appearing too 'wooden' with his role when the first trailer made its way online. ""Jurassic World"" thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously either, with a nice handful of jokes and light-hearted moments scattered throughout, mainly in the latter acts of the movie.The film is dazzling, its vibrancy making it visually appealing to large audiences and also contributing to the fact that the film is not meant to be incredibly 'serious' (by alternatively employing a dark and washed out colour palette; a trope popular with 'rebooted' movies to imply a somber, grittier re-telling of a popular story). The CGI, which is definitely something of concern when involving the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise, can look incredible at times (the Mosasaurus being my favourite example) but is undeniably overdone, especially when the previous trilogy evinced that animatronics are a plausible alternative in the appropriate shots. The illusion of dinosaurs being real and tangible in this movie universe is sadly broken by the overwhelming use of CGI.As a result, one of the major aspects missing from the film is the 'wow' factor that the previous movies instilled; dinosaur reveals just aren't exciting enough, especially when ""Jurassic World"" takes too long to even reveal the dinosaurs in the first place. Also disappointing is the fact that one of the first times we hear the grand and well-recognised ""Jurassic Park"" theme, composed by John Williams, is not for the dinosaur reveals but for a shot to establish the 'updated', modern theme park, glistening with standardisation and uniformity as it looks no different to any other immaculate holiday resort that we might expect, making the audience feel more 'amazed' by this 'modernised' park than the dinosaurs themselves.However, this all ties in to the themes and comments made on society's present consumerist ways, the fact that we want 'bigger' and 'better', the whole reason for creating the hybrid dinosaurs in the first place; we have been so used to seeing the various dinosaurs in ""Park""'s trilogy that the novelty has now worn off, hence the introduction of hybrid dinosaurs, a means to reel in a bigger audience and generate more excitement (and revenue).The Indominus Rex, the result of hybrid experimentation, is an interesting concept to begin with but soon loses its novelty as the film progresses. This terrible lizard can be easily replaceable with a 'Spinosaurus' or any other large, intimidating carnivore, and subsequently produce no change in the latter half of the movie whatsoever.""Jurassic World"" makes it tempting to dose off in the first half of the film as it takes its time to introduce its attractions and dinosaurs, most of which were spoiled and revealed in the trailer anyway. After most of the plot devices and characters have been established, however, the movie finally grabs your attention and launches into the action, although more of an effort could have been made to create more suspense and tension as the stakes just never feel high enough, especially with the main characters, who hardly feel as if they're in danger.Cutting right to the bone, ""Jurassic World"" is a solid film. While it isn't the most innovative out of the whole franchise and is sadly missing the 'wow' factor from its predecessors, it is entertaining enough and not too somber to appeal to and reel in wide audiences everywhere. Fans of the original ""Jurassic Park"" will also appreciate the many nods and easter eggs found throughout. I wouldn't particularly recommend ""Jurassic World"" but at the same time, I have no reason for deterring anyone to watch it at all.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I also couldn't name a single one of them. There was more character development in the Flintstones. People did the same stupid things that NO ONE would actually do in real life (yelling when there's a big killer dinosaur looking for them, standing up on high ground etc.) The story was so thin it was probably written on a cocktail napkin. Special effects guys did the usual amazing job, and Pratt tried REALLY hard, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I was grateful when the turbulence hit my plane and the pilot interrupted it.

It wasn't wasted money but being a sequel to a classic I really didn't enjoy what it became. It was too similar the old one, theme parks, forests, trapped in cars. Honestly I got abit excited to the end but that was it. Nonetheless, the movie is watchable and I would recommend it but don't expect something way better then the ones before.

We did not see the 3D nor the IMAX. We went into the normal 2D and expected to enjoy this movie, nothing really more. Having now seen it, I can now confidently say that this movie is the best Jurassic Park sequel and a great time in the theater. I went into this knowing that no sequel will ever match the awe and wonder of the original, so I just expected to see some great Dino mayhem, and this movie delivers extremely well.The story follows some interesting characters working on the Jurassic World resort. In this day of age, people are no longer impressed with regular dinosaurs. Because of this, InGen, the corporation in charge of running the park, called on the laboratory scientists working on the park to make a new hybrid dinosaur to be scarier, bigger, and better than all the other dinosaurs in the park. Enter the Indominus Rex, Jurassic World's answer to the unimpressed customers coming to the resort. However, as expected, not everything goes according to plan. Thus ensues a movie that is as chaotic as the trailers have promised.As for the characters themselves, Chris Pratt confirms once again that he is able to lead an action movie and is sure to see more movies like this in the future. Bryce Dallas Howard is fine as the stern corporation employee who only sees the dinosaurs as ""assets."" The rest of the characters and actors fit well into the story and add more to the tension. (And the body count)Viewing the movie from a technical standpoint, there are various flaws, but none to take away from the enjoyment of the film overall. The script is a little uneven in places and there are a few characters whose arcs could have been explored more.Overall though, Jurassic World excels in its wonderful visuals and tense action scenes. Colin Trevorrow crafted this film amazingly and has shown himself to be an up and coming director to look out for. Lastly, a compliment must be given to Michael Giacchino's wonderful score that manages to recapture the wonder from the first movie and also add to the tone of this sequel. Jurassic World is everything you can ask for from a summer blockbuster bearing the ""Jurassic"" title. ""Monster is a relative term. To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat.""","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

Hell's teethAnyway, taking the wise decision to ignore the second and third films of the series, this was a fun, well-made action romp with plenty of clever - but not smug - nods to the original (including themes from John Williams' score). Scary bits, funny bits, somewhat gruesome bits and the CGI held up to scrutiny in a way it so disappointingly doesn't these days! My only problems with the film were the occasional OTT Hollywood moments (esp. towards the end, but then again you can't really complain about a Hollywood blockbuster having Hollywood blockbuster moments in it!), and the fact that the female characters were either Cold, Childless Monsters, or spent most of their screen time crying. Because everybody knows, your life cannot possibly be complete if you don't have children. I know this because Hollywood told me so. Also, Ty Simpkins is a cracking little actor - it'll be interesting to see if he carries this on into adulthood.

On my way to the theater, I kept trying to think of what I exactly wanted ""Jurassic World"" to accomplish as a film, and it didn't take long to realize that I was over-analyzing a lot of my expectations. The only thing I wanted was the element of wonder and danger that was missing in the third installment, but heavily present in the first and underrated second film.On that note, ""Jurassic World"" delivers quite a bit of suspense and exhilaration. I would even say it goes far beyond the thrill and intensity factor of the original film with what it chooses to show. There's much more blood and violence than in any of the previous films, and the special effects are some of the strongest the series has ever seen. Aside from occasionally appearing to be a Samsung sponsored commodity with the heavy emphasis on product placement, in addition to elements that almost seem like self-parody for a summer blockbuster, this is only one of the many summer blockbusters we've been spoiled to so early in the season.Our setting is Jurassic World, a monstrous theme park housing real-life dinosaurs, some of which genetically modified, that provides the thrills and excitements of living with dinosaurs. We immediately focus on Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins), two young boys who venture out to Jurassic World to visit their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who runs the park. Claire, however, is busy trying to attract financiers to see the park's new ""Indominus Rex,"" one of the genetically modified dinosaurs that combines eight different species of animal to, in turn, create a humongous dinosaur.The park's main dinosaur trainer is Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), an ex-Navy member, who immediately works to help after a catastrophic turn of events has Indominus Rex leaving his concubine, wreaking havoc on the park. Numerous failed attempts to cage and detain the beast eventually result in several other dinosaurs being let out of their cages, causing for a complete meltdown of the entire facility. Despite lacking in proper artillery and being responsible for hundreds of thousands of lives, Owen and Claire work together to try and stop the beasts from terrorizing the park.The original ""Jurassic Park"" worked so well because of its emphasis on peril. The film put you into a barrage of situations that felt like you were at the mercy of the same large, hulking beasts the characters on-screen were running from. ""Jurassic World"" restores that element, constantly trapping the viewer in an awkward or frightening position, with Colin Trevorrow commanding controlled but large-scale direction at all times. This is the essence of why ""Jurassic World"" is such a thrill; it plunges us into many different scenarios and gives us a variety of evocative landscapes and dinosaurs to feast our eyes on at all times.Through starring roles in some of Hollywood's loftiest and most expensive productions, Pratt has finally asserted his ability to command a presence. If ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" didn't convince you that he wasn't on top of his game, ""Jurassic World"" will be that deciding factor. He has the subtle, suave goofiness that doesn't make him bumbling and incompetent and the right amount of intelligence as a character actor to be taken seriously, and he rises to the occasion with this picture at every turn. His character is actually so interesting that it makes focusing on the two young boys feel like a burdened change in direction, mainly because Robinson's character is such a moody, unlikable teenager.In itself, ""Jurassic World""'s burdens come in the form of excessive product placement, to the point where if Starbucks or Samsung isn't being shoved down our face, it's Coca-Cola or Beats by Dre. Some don't pick up on product placement as easily as others, but when we're immersed in a theme park setting like this, which is predominately wilderness as is, these sorts of things are much easier to spot, especially when it seems that Trevorrow is trying to make sure that said product is always at eye-level with the audience when it's in frame. Furthermore, there's the obvious element of events occurring to the characters' advantage just in the nick of time, which, while common for the summer blockbuster genre, is nonetheless cloying and overly obvious. We've already been asked to suspend our disbelief for dinosaurs, so scenes like a dead Pterodactyl's beak coming dangerously close to one of the young boys' faces before slowing to a halt feels like a cheap shot at suspense and convenience.These burdens, however, do not discourage the fun ""Jurassic World"" brings. Few franchises from yesteryear that are revisited in the modern day have the ability to excite, but just hearing the name ""Jurassic Park"" brings to mind a multitude of different visuals that capture the imagination. ""Jurassic World"" is a testament to the imagination and proves, yet again, that even franchises that have laid dormant for several years can still get off the ground and morph into something worth watching.","13 out of 36 found this helpful.

Yes, that's right...1993 Jurassic Park! This movie holds true to the movie's legacy, the original movie's legacy (not those other failed attempts at continuing Jurassic...). It has been a long time since I have sat in a theater and listened to the audience shriek, yell, boast opinions (yelling out like they were watching the show from their home TV), cheer, and finally clap at the end of the movie! The movie was well composed, with a strong plot containing a spectacular balance between predictability and complete blind-siding moments. I doubt anyone will say that this movie was poorly directed. The movie has a gripping ability to elicit emotions from the viewers, drawing strong bonding moments that will have you expressing your emotions either to yourself or out loud (as most did during the movie). Casting for the movie was well selected; with familiar faces most everyone who watches standard TV shows or other great movies would recognize. And, must I include the original himself...BD Wong! Yes, that's the same actor from the original movie (some may know him from Special Victims Law and Order). What a contribution to the original movie than to have members from the original casting appear nearly 20 years later to pick up where they left off! The last show I can recall doing that was the movie Tron staring Jeff Bridges. That just add a certain heart felt compassion for the movie to us who were lucky enough to view the original Jurassic Park upon it's release. Take notes directors, this is how a movie should be directed; with the audience in mind and promising to take them on a ride during your entire film. If I had more than two thumbs, I'd certainly hold more up. This is a must go see movie. Hell, I may go see it again.

It's a very enjoyable fourth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, the effects are amazing and there are some great intense scenes that will keep you at the edge of your seat, the two leads, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, are very likable and the chemistry between them is superb, if the studio orders sequels, which I'm sure they will, they need to return. I enjoyed the movie but it certainly had a lot of flaws, I think it's better than the Lost World and Jurassic Park III, but it was certainly the most predictable in the franchise, you could easily tell what characters were going to die and which would survive, and there are a few ""twists and turns"" that were very expected, the film seemed afraid to take any risks and do something that would differentiate itself from the previous movies, which is never a good thing for a sequel to do, it should have wanted to stand out more. The story tends to drag as well, running for over two hours, it really should have only been 100 minutes, no longer than that, there is way too much build up for the main story to finally happen that it leaves you bored at times, I think Jurassic World has some great potential to be a terrific new franchise, but they have many things they need to improve upon before they can move forward, and if they could get Spielberg back on the directors chair, even better. It has many imperfections and fans of the original Jurassic Park won't be thrilled, but Jurassic World is still a fun ride that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure or action film. The original dinosaur theme park that was envisioned by John Hammond is now a reality, however, a new attraction designed to bring back people's interest begins to backfire horribly.

But if you manage to leave your brain turned on, given that you have one, you will have a lot of fun watching this one. Not that this film is so bad that it's good, but if you just walk into the theater expecting a fun monster movie you won't be disappointed.The fact that this movie is ironically ripping of Godzilla, might annoy a few people, but the movie is well aware of this. Things like the leader of a group of soldiers, who are basically the Tokyo military, being an Asian, that some people are wearing bullet proof wests while hunting a dinosaur or a dinosaur running in slow-motion, just to name a few, leave the impression that you are not supposed to take this seriously. Also, there are a lot of hilariously clichéd moments like the human villain and the forced family drama of our main characters which are supporting this impression even more. The downside of this though, is that the ""emotional"" scenes are almost painful to sit through because of our main characters.The Characters itself weren't that bad, but sometimes during my view i got the feeling, that the writers didn't know how to write teenagers. I mean, i know that wanting to go home to his girlfriend is the only character trait that Zach has but no one, no matter the age, would be bored watching dinosaurs. But in the middle of the film he instantly switches mood with his little brother and is ready to pick up other girls. Grays trades are also only serving as a plot point and Chris Pratts character basically never changes throughout the whole film which means that the only somewhat believable character we have is Claire who at least has something that could be called development. I know that i said that you shouldn't take this seriously, but that doesn't mean that you cant have good characters. However, i have to say that the acting is really good, even the kids are not that bad. There where only two scenes where i burst out laughing because a character spontaneously decided to cry in an instant with no reason other to have an emotional scene but it was just hilarious to me. However, i was glad that all of them are somewhat connected to each other and not some random strangers who just happen to run into each other. The action is pretty good and makes for some really cool fight scenes and the fact that you can predict everything that is going to happen doesn't make it less fun.The directing and overall cinematography wasn't anything special but it was descent enough. The only thing that i really didn't like was the the use of the score. First of all, it's not really a good soundtrack. Not bad, but also not something that i haven't heard before. My problem is that the soundtrack was way overused. Ther are a lot of scenes where the movie tries to build tension without knowing that some of them would be way more intense without any background music whatsoever. If a director doesn't allow the imagery on the screen to speak for itself and puts in a soundtrack that tells the audience that they should be afraid or something, than it kinda ruins it for the people paying attention. Not that i demand no background music at all but it could be at least a little bit more subtle because there was basically no scene where the score didn't try to tell you how you should feel. There where also a few other things like no explanation why the Park suddenly works, why they need dinosaur holograms other than to function as another cheap plot point even though there are real dinosaurs in this world or a forced death scene of some random dinosaur but those are only minor issues and didn't bother me that much during my view.Overall, i'm really glad that this film doesn't really try to be a successor to the original, but rather just having fun with the idea of dinosaurs running amok. I'm happy to say that with this one we got another good monster movie the third year in a row and i had a lot of fun watching it.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

While the park's operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is off on the other side of the island preparing for the genetically-modified Indominus rex to be a future attraction, it ends up escaping and has no where else to run except in the direction of the tourists, including Claire's nephews (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins). One of the few films that are worth seeing in 3-D, but like most action flicks, it forgets that roller-coasters go both up and down.

The visitor rates are declining, and the only option to increase them is to design their own dinosaur; the Indominus Rex, a decision that the InGen team would soon regret. The side-plot is fairly suitable to the movie, as a worker at the resort secretly hatches a plot to turn the inhabitants into living bio-weapons, but takes away a sense of realism.The movie itself takes a seemingly long time for the main plot line to develop, but when it does, you are in for a roller-coaster ride of action. I will not go into further detail as it will reveal the events, but for a movie this fantastic, it was very hard not to.CGI however is relied on heavily when it comes to the dinosaurs. When you compare them to the original, they all look much more realistic due to the use of mechanical devices. However, there are moments when you forget the Dino's are computer animated, and they truly do look realistic.One last note to the people wishing to see this movie, please take into account that there are some moments that younger children may find disturbing, as there are plenty of bloody moments.To conclude, Jurassic World is perhaps one of the films of the year, but I wouldn't expect it to win many academy awards, however I would truly recommend this to fans of the original.","72 out of 127 found this helpful.

The children in distress, dinosaurs on the loose, greedy industrialists, the sensible man no one listened to, where have I seen that in this series of films? It doesn't help that while most of the dialogue is decent, we get the occasional scene of inept writing. Add to that things like, ""I'm the Alpha Raptor,"" a poorly thought out plan for the villain, and an oddly knowledgeable Superdino, and things can get dumb real fast. This isn't to say Jurassic World has nothing to offer. The film is good diversionary entertainment with solid directing. It clips along at a good pace and engages with enough fun and thrills to maintain our interest.The film picks up twenty two years after the first film. Isla Nublar is now a fully fledged amusement park that continues to see increasingly more patrons and money every year. Despite the exponential success, park supervisor Claire FEELS that the park is in financial hardship and wants to expand the ""wow factor."" A new hybrid dinosaur(the Indominus Rex) has been engineered to accommodate this desire. As a matter of course, dino chaos ensues shortly thereafter. Claire along with Raptor trainer Owen strive to save her visiting nephews and stay alive in the process.I would be remiss if I did not mention the dinosaurs. They look very good, befitting the money and time spent on the project. As always with the Jurassic Park series, the dino action is nice and a solid appeal. I would say that the herbivores got a much nicer showing here than in the previous two entries(which I appreciated.) Ultimately, while I enjoyed the film, and it is better than Jurassic Park III, I don't see a need for another journey into the park.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

A high official work-a-holic (Bryce Dallas Howard) invites her nephews to the part for some fun and sure enough when the dinosaurs break free they are lost somewhere in the forest. With the help of Owen (Chris Pratt) the two try to locate the kids as well as to prevent more attacks.I think a strong argument could be made that JURASSIC WORLD is the best of the four films in the series. I've found all of them to be good three-star movies but this one here is a few notches above the rest of the series thanks to an incredibly fun and tense ending, which I'll discuss more in a bit. The film offers up some terrific effects, a wonderful score, some nice characters and there's no question that the battles towards the end are exciting and there's no doubt that the recent remake of GODZILLA should have been more like this film.I'll get the flaws out of the way right now. For me, the entire ""must save the kids"" was a rather tired element that we saw in previous movies and I must admit that it really wasn't all that thrilling here. I saw that people the finale of the movie has the dinosaurs attacking the people inside the park and this is where the real fun happens. I'm not going to spoil anything that happens but it's quite the treat when these dinosaurs end up making contact with visitors to the park and it leads to some really intense scenes. It's really too bad that there wasn't more of this because it works perfectly to give you the popcorn, summer entertainment that people look for.The special effects are certainly a major plus here as the dinosaurs are certainly the stars of the picture. As with the previous entries, there are several scenes where we get up close and personal with them and the effects are so great that you really do feel as if real dinosaurs are right there in front of you. There are some terrific battles between the creatures that happen towards the end and they are some of the most exciting scenes that you're ever going to witness. The human actors are also good with Pratt making for a great hero and Howard is also good in her part. Vincent D'Onofrio is good as the heavy as is Omar Sy, Judy Greer and BD Wong.JURASSIC WORLD also benefits from the actual park used. I really liked some of the vehicles that people traveled around in as it really brings a nice sci-fi element to the film. There's no question that the park itself was put together wonderfully well and it really did return a sense of wonder that the series hadn't shown since the first one.","13 out of 37 found this helpful.

Well this one is pretty much the same. The plot is pretty much predictable. The characters are fairly mediocre. The bad guy is a standard Hollywood villain which means that he is utterly despicable but boringly predictable and serves little more purpose than instilling bad feeling, which of course he does pretty well.The movie starts 22 years after the original theme part met its premature demise. The ""you should not play good"" prophets can say what they want, I think the idea of reviving the Dinosaurs (without the reckless gene manipulation stuff) is a quite cool one and I would certainly endorse the idea of they could make it work. I really do not care much for the nonsensical stories of these movies where there is always some thoroughly stupid Hollywood villain that screws things up with some ludicrous evil scheme but, unfortunately a lot of people seems to buy into that stuff and think it is ""what could happen"".Anyway, having said that, the story is not bad for this kind of movie. It generally holds together although the stupid plot of the main villain really did (censored) me off. It was the usual dumb-ass stuff where you could see where things were going from the moment the dumb-ass in question opened his mouth.I did like the hero although I was pretty much a stereotype one. I did not really like the equally stereotype woman lead character and I certainly felt that the silly nonsense about a couple in the process of divorcing sending their kids for a vacation with their aunt who obviously is not interested in the well being of the kids. Typical soap opera material.This is a special effects movie and the special effects where not bad. I would not say that they where wow impressive but then that might be due to special effects overload. Today you are so used to wonderful special effects that it takes a lot to impress you. At the time when the original Jurassic movie was released one would have gone all wow over the effects in this movie but today they are just ""just"" what one would expect. Still good though.If you are looking for a good plot, well then you are going to be disappointed. It is pretty much standard, brain-dead, Hollywood fare in that department. I really fail to understand why they constantly fail to provide anything remotely intelligent in terms of plot. Are the average audience really that stupid? Well, having offloaded that bit of frustration, and parked my brain in the closet, I did indeed enjoy the movie. It was pretty much what I expected nothing more, nothing less.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Jurassic World promises an entertainment high and it delivers with a monstrous bite.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3259740/?ref_=tt_urv","LloydBayer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20871749/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2015","Some films are critic proof. Sometimes even the most verbose film critics will find themselves in gleeful abandon, for no other reason than pure cinematic indulgence. I know I did. Likewise, Jurassic World will do that to you in the most eye-popping, heart-racing way a tent pole summer movie can.Right off the bat I'll say that after the disastrous Jurassic Park III (2001), this fourth installment has no reason to exist. In fact, Jurassic World is filled with so many inconsistencies, calling it flawed would be an act of kindness. Comprising of uneventful drama about corporate excess and consumer supply and demand, pacing is a major issue during the first half of the film. Symbolic to the film's subtle theme on humanity's greed for bigger and better material possessions, this part of the film is nothing more than a talky filler leading up to the non-stop action saved for the second half. However, the pay-off is extremely gratifying and worth the wait, and it only gets better with each passing minute.Set 22 years after the events of the first film, we are taken back to the Eastern Pacific island of Isla Nublar, where the titular theme park has reopened and is once again a major tourist attraction. In the tradition of preceding films, the story revolves around a female protagonist, this time park operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) who believes in enticing tourists with newer attractions. Richard Attenborough's John Hammond is replaced by Bollywood thespian Irrfan Khan as Simon Masrani, the new owner of Jurassic World. Masrani is uneasy about Dearing's new attraction – a bigger and meaner hybrid creation called Indominus Rex. For the cinema audience, this aptly relates to a bigger, louder and scarier prehistoric monster. Wish granted! Even before Indominus is released as an 'attraction', expert Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) discovers something abnormal about this new creature. And so it begins like it always does – an accident is shrugged off as a near-miss incident. It should have been a warning. When the second accident occurs, it's already too late.Running, screaming and utter pandemonium forms the rest of the film, punctuated with the occasional yet distinctive sound of a predatory 'chomp'. This is when the film lifts off with blistering pace thanks to well executed action, suspense driven terror and technical achievements that include fluid animatronics, and fantastic visual and sound design. Production design is also massive in keeping with original author Michael Crichton's intricately detailed world in the Jurassic Park novel. In only his second foray as director, it's safe to say that Colin Trevorrow has done his homework, especially with special effects bigwig Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as executive producer. Look out for two new ferocious creatures and an old favorite brought back for an amazing finale. And just to appease fans of monster movies, Trevorrow also interjects the action with several references to the first film, along with memorable scenes from King Kong (2005) and even James Cameron's Aliens (1986). Although this doesn't say much about originality, it still works as solid aid to the entertainment factor. On the downside, and if there is a weak link in human characterization, it would have to be Howard's stereotypical damsel in distress. Only here, her character is written off as a pushy corporate executive who can outrun ravenous dinosaurs with high heels! On the other hand, Pratt anchors the film with an Indiana Jones getup and is genuinely engaging throughout. Cocky yet equally charismatic, this is an actor highly capable of becoming the next Tom Cruise.That said, Jurassic World and its older siblings have never been about an actor's depth. It's all about the dinosaurs and their fight for supremacy in the food chain. After all, these were creatures of calamity but also creatures that dominated the planet long before we did. Bringing them back to full celluloid life is where this film excels and by the looks of it, no expense was spared. In other words, if there's one film that gives you your money's worth this summer, this is it and does so in Jurassic proportions.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

J.W.'s mix of humor, action, adventure, horror, and suspense makes it a great movie for anyone to enjoy. The movie is about Jurassic World, a theme park dedicated to dinosaur-themed attractions. Every time a new attraction is released, attendance spikes. One of the park's high officials, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), talks about a genetically modified hybrid, something no one has ever seen before, to be the next big attraction. It is known as the Indominus Rex. The movie features Chris Pratt as Owen, a man who has a lot of experience dealing with dinosaurs and proves to be very useful. As you've probably already predicted, things go awfully wrong in this movie. Some of these things are very unrealistic and would never happen in real life. At that point in the movie, I wanted to give it an 8 or 7. As I advanced further, the witty remarks, brilliant acting, and stunning visual effects made me forget the minor plot holes and such and made me truly love this movie. The movie is mostly rated PG-13 for its bloody scenes, which there are a few of, and its frightening jump scares, which are relatively frequent. All in all, Jurassic World is a great movie for the family, although younger viewers might get scared at some parts. If its story wasn't predictable at times, it would easily be the best Jurassic Park movie ever made.","69 out of 122 found this helpful.

I love dinosaurs, (2.) I love island adventure and (3.) it's the third top-grossing film in cinematic history, as of this writing. I thought that it would be at least be as good as the first movie (1993), which – contrary to popular opinion -- I never felt was great because the story and characters were never that compelling. Yes, the dinosaurs were great and the t-rex and velociraptor sequences are exceptional, but most of the rest of the movie was average at best, even forgettable, although Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Ariana Richards were effective. Despite my criticisms, I gave the film a solid grade of ""B"" or 7/10 Stars.The second film (1997) and the third film (2001) were serviceable, but forgettable and somehow a letdown, which brings us to this fourth film in the series, a whopping fourteen years after the previous sequel. So how does it stack up? While ""Jurassic World"" is better than the two previous movies it's not as good as the first one. In fact, the plot's pretty much a retread with marginal changes. The big difference here is that it's 22 years later and the original Park is now a Disneyworld-like tourist attraction called Jurassic World owned by Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and ran by an all-business woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Chris Pratt plays the male protagonist, Vincent D'Onofrio the bad guy, Omar Sy the token black dude and BD Wong the token Asian scientist. Katie McGrath is on hand as the boy's hired quasi-nanny at the park, Zara, but she's not fleshed-out as a character; flesh-eaten maybe, but not fleshed out.Actually, that's the main problem with this movie. The characters have little depth, although Bryce shines as the preoccupied-with-work Aunt and Pratt has the gravitas for his role. Unfortunately, the two kids (brothers) are decidedly dull. My wife thought so as well, so it's not just me. The writers should've worked-in the older brother's girlfriend to spice things up or, at least, some other girl at the park.Nevertheless, there are a few effective sequences or concepts, like the Pterosaur attack on the tourists, the rousing Indominus/t-rex fight and the earlier revelation about the former.The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot mainly in Hawaii, but also California and Louisiana.GRADE: B-","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

I however absolute loved this new Jurassic adventure almost as much as the original. Jurassic Park was unique for its time by showing us the most realistic Dinosaurs we had ever seen on screen. The problems people are reporting having with the new Jurassic World are in a way ironically addressed in the movie's plot, ""people aren't impressed by typical dinosaurs anymore; they need something bigger, louder, scarier, and with a lot more teeth."" The film is no longer primarily focused on a select few quirky guest who set out to test an accident waiting to happen called Jurassic Park. This movie is more action, dinosaur oriented and that's what I love about it. While watching the original, more than a few times, I've wished there was just more to the story, more dinosaur interaction but the plot line always seems a bit short to me when talking in terms of event A making it to event B. The original villain/code monkey/douchebag was overly cartoonish and I hated him in all the wrong ways.I can see what they were trying to do with this movie. First off I'm a big fan of animatronics over CGI any day of the week but to get these animals to move at a proper realistic speed it just had to be all done with computers this time around. The CGI was well done in my opinion so I had no real complaints about the dinosaurs being done on a computer. People are complaining there are way too many product placements, well that's because the movie is trying to depict an overly commercialized theme park that really has no care about man or beast as long as the earnings at the end of the day are big enough. So ya I'm not saying it wasn't a strategic money making decision to get a bunch of sponsors but it does make sense to a degree to have all these well know products in a movie were everyone is only concerned about the newest and latest thing.Another complaint was the acting and character development was lacking, yep your right. Many times the characters bordered being too cliché or stereotypes, and more than a few times Owen looked like he was hamming up that ""I'm a bad ass who likes to get dirty in more ways than one and that's why I'm so sexy,"" walk of his, plus the brooding went a bit too far. In the end I ended up feeling for most every person in the movie. So they may not be super deep characters but they are not cardboard either, plus I really enjoyed the relationship between the raptors and Owen (Chris Pratt). Oh, as for Bryce Howard or Clair running the whole movie with high heels on, yep that was a little out there but there were more than a few long distant shots of the actress really having to run with the same high heels on and never missing a beat alongside her sensible shoe wearing costars. That was enough for me to look over that plot hole. Lets all face it this movie was made one for the money/ merchandise, two to bring the concept of Jurassic Park to a new generation (one that values visuals over plot and character development), and three to expand the Jurassic world for the fans who loved the first one and wish it were a real park. I felt like a kid while watching this movie. The way I felt during this movie is the way I would imaging feeling if this were a real park that I was visiting for the first time. It was very entertaining and for me who has seen it all that's saying a lot about this movie. I hope people can give it some slack and except that it's a different take on an old beloved movie from our childhood.","69 out of 122 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A fun movie, but has a few downfalls","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3278379/?ref_=tt_urv","Simon_vargas","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52466841/?ref_=tt_urv","16 July 2015","Jurassic World is the newest addition to the Jurassic Park franchise (4th movie). To be honest, I have not seen any of the previous installments of the Jurassic Park franchise because I was never interested in dinosaurs (not even as a kid). I went and saw this movie primarily because I thought it looked more like a modern action movie and less of a dinosaur movie. That was certainly a wrong assumption on my behalf because it is wholeheartedly a dinosaur flick. I still had fun with it but not as much as I had hoped.The action is absolutely my favorite part of this movie. It's not that kind of exhilarating and intense action that one would find in Kingman: The Secret Service; rather, it is fun, dumb action that one would just enjoy while munching on some buttery popcorn. I found the action very entertaining especially in the second act. There isn't much action in the first act and I had some problems with the third act. The third act mostly focuses on the dinosaurs and there is a lot of action with just the dinosaurs. No big spoilers but at the end there is literally a dinosaur fist fight between these two huge dinosaurs. It was even choreographed like a human fist fight so it looked really odd when dinosaurs were doing it. I disliked the third act because it focused a lot on the dinosaurs combat and seeing that I'm not interested in dinosaurs, that got almost boring for me. The second act had some awesome action though which I enjoyed immensely.The story/plot in Jurassic World is decent. For the most part, it's easy to understand and there aren't too many plot holes. Yet some of the plot points are a little muggy and not fleshed out well enough. The pacing in this movie was absolutely fine and character development was generally good as well. Speaking of characters, these characters were so darn clichéd that it was laughable. Bryce Dallas Howard played the usual uptight business woman, Chris Pratt played the scruffy, stubborn adventure type guy, and Vincent D'Onofrio played the stupid military dude who wants to use everything as a weapon (like dinosaurs). All these characters were extremely clichéd which was kind of off-putting to me. Also, probably the biggest issue this film has is the dialogue. Holy moly it is cheesy! Almost every other spoken line is a one-liner cheese-fest! The cheesy-ness is cringeworthy that's how bad it is. The writers could have tried a little harder right?Finally, the acting in this movie is really good given the amount of cheesy dialogue and everyones characters being clichéd. Chris Pratt is one fine actor and he did well in his role. Bryce Dallas Howard was good in her role especially at the end. The rest of the cast was just as good and really surprised me.In the end, Jurassic World had fun action and great acting. On the downside, it had a relatively weak story/plot, unbelievably clichéd characters, and laughably bad dialogue. I had fun with this movie but many things could have been improved. Like I said before, I'm not much of a dinosaur fan but I still gave this movie a chance thinking it was not heavily oriented towards dinosaurs. I was wrong which slightly disappointed me but I still had good fun with Jurassic World.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's a huge success financially, but was it a success in my eyes? For the most part, yes! This is an action-horror movie at it's roots, much like the original, and has some new additions to the lore of Jurassic Park. While the previous two sequels felt like retreads, for the most part Jurassic World is a step in the right direction and feels fresh. The leads do a fairly good job, (even if sometimes the writing isn't great) and the effects are solid. I was extremely excited to return to Isla Nublar once more to see a fully functioning dinosaur theme park. However, as stated previously, there are some corny lines and the characters feel underdeveloped for the most part, but the spectacle of the park and feeling of adventure and tension overcome these flaws. There is also at least one touching scene featuring an animatronic similar to those made by the late Stan Winston that is very effective. The finale is a love letter to fans of the series, and I could not contain my excitement during the film's final act. In the end Jurassic World is not a perfect follow up to one of my personal favorite movies of all time, but I never expected it to be as good as the original, so I was fully satisfied. 7.5/10","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

There are only so many ways to peel a grape.

That's all movies like this are-- entertainment--and to poke at the plot and the characters as if they are calling on their best Siskel & Ebert is a joke. Some of the highest grossing movies got mediocre reviews. No wonder, because their job is to view movies as art. Having said all this, I enjoyed Jurassic World for what it was.

Michael Crichton's exploration of dinosaurs resurrected - the unveiling of man versus our most revered beast – is cinematic gold. Steven Spielberg did a masterful job with the original installment, Jurassic Park. This type of story was made for the master of adventure, wonderment, and spine tingling thrills. Steven stumbled on the sequel, hampered by a hokey script – but still delivered more creepy little foes from the prehistoric. The third lacks any compelling characters and is largely forgettable – although the unveiling of the Pterodactyl.JURASSIC WORLD is the fourth installment from Crichton's classic legacy.* JURRASIC WORLD is a homage to the original film sprinkled with a delicious dabble of current culture and technology. If you don't know the premise, the original Jurassic Park has now become a fully functional island resort run by a corporate conglomerate. Over 20 years later, it is now called Jurassic World. As opposed to the three previous stories, the island is filled with tourists and multiple attractions.Dig in. JURRASIC WORLD employs the classic plot points from Jurassic Park and a myriad of timeless horror movies – such as Aliens and The Birds. It's a tasty dish.The hero played by Chris Pratt is a young Indiana Jones – an adventurer living in the wild – adorned with the classic brown vest (although minus the hat). Bryce Dallas Howard is a high powered corporate employee that runs operations of the island. The Howard/Pratt relationship - the clichéd rugged hero matched with the high strung upper class beauty – works surprisingly well. Howard breathes life into the role of heroine. She avoids many dialogue/screenplay/character traps that could've nabbed another actress.The new director manages to hold the pressure and weight of the Jurassic universe. I give this guy props. Outside of yelling action on the set, I can't imagine the grace it would take to deal with the studio, multiple writers, and master of cinema, Spielberg himself. This newcomer has what it takes and the studio is reaping the benefits - he re-lit a giant franchise! It's the third highest grossing film of all time, I believe.SPOILERS *Any adventure movie requires suspension of disbelief. Spielberg has been aware of this since day one and carefully tows the line of fictional reality and fictional unreality.Unfortunately, The Jurassic World director screwed up an obvious detail – and it drove me crazy.Would any human being survive the rampage wearing a pair of high heels? Bryce Dallas Howard drops her fancy clothes, gets dirty, and dawns a Ripley tank top – yet does not remove her high heels throughout the movie!! This means she's sprinting from dinosaurs, explosions, and near death instances in a pair of high heels. This ridiculous problem could have been remedied easily. One scene of her working out at the park's fancy athletic facilities and keeping a pair of sneakers close by – that she throws on before joining in the rescue mission.Honestly, take one look at a woman walking to work through Manhattan in heels and then try picturing her escaping a velociraptor. This one details bothered me enough to give Jurassic World a B minus as opposed to a B plus.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

I had read quite a fair share of reviews slating the film for being predictable, no character development and/or no likable characters with bad plot. Now, I get everyone is subjective and a movie one person loves someone else hates; sure the film had its flaws but come on! As a fan of the series I went in full knowing what was going to happen (park is successful, everything is dandy until disaster breaks loose and dinosaurs eat people) And that is exactly what I wanted to see. As for characters I thought each actor/actress portrayed their character well; plus its the dinosaurs I was more interested in not the people. As a summertime blockbuster it certainly delivered, It's not a film made for critical analysis, it's made for uncomplicated enjoyment. Additionally nobody seems to know what they want in movies anymore; movies made simply to take audiences out of reality for some non complicated amusement are bashed for not being smart enough. Not only that but the film was beautifully made, gorgeous cinematography, great CGI and good pacing. Overall it was truly a well made film. But this again is just my opinion, as individuals everyone is entitled to their opinion which is why I say go see it for yourself and make your own judgment. Just don't go around saying it's the worst thing ever or that it shouldn't have been made when it has actually given a lot of other people and enjoyable experience; proving it deserves to exist.","66 out of 117 found this helpful.

"","","Has spectacle but does rather feel like an unnecessary reboot/remake/sequel (whatever it is)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3277073/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2015","It is many years since the summer blockbuster season excited me; I don't mean that in a snobby way, it is just I no longer really want to pay out such money to sit in a noisy cinema to watch so-so movies, where really I can pay less in the Fall when they can be rented for much less money and be watched in my own home. This is not to say I still do not go, and on this occasion it was Jurassic Park that caught my fancy. I'm not sure if it is a remake or sequel or reboot, because it has elements of all of those in here – basically delivering the same story as the first film with elements from the second thrown in; theme park, dinosaurs escape, two specific children are our focal point, etc.As such it all goes where you'd expect it to, and, in keeping with the times moving forward, there are now many more dinosaurs across the film. This adds to the spectacle, and for sure the film does have plenty of money on the screen in terms of the effects shots. In terms of story though, it is not so good. In the original, chaos theory was the handy device that kept it all moving forward, whereas here we have things that make even less sense but that we are just meant to go with. Really it doesn't matter the who's and what's of it all, because we know where we are here; it is disappointing though that it doesn't have more genuine tension to it, and that the set pieces are not as strong in that way as you would want. The film is also not helped by their being very clear replacements for many of the character types from the previous films – which really only serves to highlight them for being less interesting and more generic characters. By the end, most of the people were fairly unengaging as villains or heroes or whatever.With this in mind, it is interesting that the female characters get such a rough time of it. The female lead berated for the distance between her and her extended family (I could not tell you precisely the ages of my nieces/nephews without a bit of thought), and kept fairly cold and bland throughout. Many have already mentioned the quite hideous death of another, totally incidental female character – it is so bad that I do not think there was any judgement involved, so I don't think it is sexist, but it is unfortunate that it stands out as such a statement death. Otherwise, the deaths are mostly the standard anonymous type – they will shock children, but after a while they blend together and only shock by how sterile they become (torture sequence aside).As a whole, the film did entertain in a broad way, and it has enough spectacle to it to keep it moving forward. The detail of the narrative is clunky, the characters bland, and generally the set pieces are not as great as you would want, but it is a summer blockbuster and on that level at least, it does provide distracting noise.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

It all ends up being entertaining enough, but it is empty as they come and it loses steam along the way, ending with a lazy lazy last part.Isla Nublar is opened to tourists, but after so many years the clients and investors are asking for more and more: bigger, badder, more threatening. It seems seeing velociraptors or playing with triceratops ain't fun anymore. A couple of kids (the typical couple of kids that seem to have to be our center of attention in these movies) go visit the park, where their aunt Claire (yes, we have all talked about it, those shoes) is working. Also working, as a raptor trainer, is manly man Owen, always sweating, always being very hairy and manly, always half-step away of saying his sentences growling.We all know what is going to happen, right? The new dinosaur, a dinosaur that has some tyrannosaurus rex in his DNA (and the rest, secret secret) is going to go on a trip around the island wreaking havoc and making bad, very bad things happen. The way it gets loose is lazy as they come and kind of laughable, but OK, we will accept it. The rest of the plot, I don't need to tell you. You already know it.However, the movie is fun. The acting, even if hilarious in all the machismo the male characters seem to be suffering of, is good enough. The pace is high enough, and even if the plot and its twists make less sense than Claire's shoes, keep things chugging along. And the CGI makes us (more or less) believe in what is going on.If it had had a tighter running time, and if it had left out some risible moments, though, it would have been better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) was one of the biggest movies of 1997 however there were a lot of mixed reviews. Jurassic Park III (2001) was also a box office success however the movie was critically underwhelming. Jurassic World was a welcome entry into the Jurassic Park series and it was enjoyable, although it was more of the same.22 years after the original Jurassic Park went horribly wrong, a fully functional dinosaur theme park called ""Jurassic World"" has become a reality and opened up on Isla Nublar. Originally envisioned by John Hammond, Jurassic World has proved to be a huge success over the past decade although in recent times visitor rates have started to decline. Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) are sent there to visit their aunt, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park's operations manager however Claire is too preoccupied with recruiting more investors to fund bigger dinosaur attractions to maintain the park's attendance as well as being a stickler for statistics. It is evidenced throughout the movie that despite Claire's high maintenance personality and drive for success, she does not know much about her nephews and seems to be distant to them as well as her own sister and the boys' mother (Judy Greer). To revive the theme park's success, the InGen corporation genetically creates a new breed of dinosaur as a new attraction named the Indominus Rex. This experiment is spearheaded by one of the original scientists from Jurassic Park now the chief geneticist Dr Henry Wu (B.D. Wong). Things go terribly wrong when the Indominus Rex manages to escape from captivity and it wrecks havoc on the island, endangering many lives. A former Navy sailor turned Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) must also help Claire and slimy InGen Security Chief Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio)take down the Indominus Rex.Chris Pratt is always a pleasure to watch on the screen and he continues to cement his status as a down-to-earth, heroic and humorous action star, especially after the success of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). In fact Chris Pratt was the only real likable character in the movie. Bryce Dallas Howard seems unconvincing as the parks operations manager Claire Dearing. For a manager who knows all her statistics and business operations, she came across as someone with limited social skills, common sense and emotions. Vincent D'Onofrio seems like a slimy villain with no purpose only to throw his weight around with his massive power tripping ego as well as to carry out his own selfish motives to take down the Indominus Rex yet his plan fails. Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell were quite good however some of their scenes just seemed like they were thrown in to show they were just token kids of the modern age. The only original cast member to return was B.D. Wong, and at least it was good to see someone from the original movies.Director Colin Trevorrow did a good job resurrecting the franchise with Jurassic World and hopefully he will go onto bigger and better things.Jurassic World was a lot better than Jurassic Park III in my opinion. I felt that Jurassic Park III was underwhelming. The Lost World: Jurassic Park seemed to be over-hyped but still watchable. I haven't seen Jurassic Park in years however I still remember from when I was a young kid all the hype surrounding the movie, deservedly earning its spot as one of the biggest blockbusters of 1993.The action in Jurassic World was a lot more exciting and the movie was still very enjoyable however you felt like it was done three times before, thus running over old ground. Still it was good to see the Jurassic Park franchise being resurrected with Jurassic World and it was well worth seeing it at the cinema.Will we see a fifth Jurassic Park movie? Who knows given that Jurassic World has been a success at the box office.Watch Jurassic World and enjoy it for what it is.7/10.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

He is now 15 and has multiple copies of all the movies and collected almost every JP dinosaur toy that was ever made (plus many other dinosaurs). He has been waiting for this movie since it was originally supposed to come out in 2005. A couple of years ago when it was finally solidified as actual movie it renewed his interest. Since then he has followed every detail available with the making and release of the film. Needless to say we saw the movie last night at the first possible showing. The movie did not disappoint and delivered on being one of the best installments to the franchise since the original. We both felt in a lot of ways it was better than the original! What shocked me today was a lot of reviews posted here. Many complain about a weak story or lack of character development. Seems to me that most of them completely missed the idea behind Jurassic Park/World in the first place. The characters and story in all of these movies are the dinosaurs and not the live actors. Jurassic World was actually the first of the franchise that focused more on the story of the dinosaurs and their character development and not the actors. Make no mistake here folks the star of this movie is Indominus Rex and not Chris Pratt. In fact this movie had many less annoying human characters than the three other movies. Think of the two kids in the original -annoying. I wanted them to be eaten. The next two movies only increased the number of annoying human characters. Jurassic World gave us human characters in the right amount and none of them stole the show from the dinosaurs. My son and I thought it was a great installment to the franchise. Go see Jurassic World you won't be disappointed.","70 out of 125 found this helpful.

It successfully evokes a hint of the wonder we felt back in the day when ""real"" dinosaurs on screen were a decided novelty. Who can forget the first appearance of the T Rex in Jurassic Park? Spine tingling, awesome, and terrifying all at once. This is a more jaded age, and we have seen dinosaurs in many guises since then, so it's not easy to WOW us in that way. Yet, in spite of that, Jurassic World does create some awe, tension, and excitement. As with Jurassic Park, the dinosaurs are the best part--the people not so much. But, at least there is no character in this film quite as annoying as Dr. Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park, and some of the characters are actually quite likable. It's worth seeing, but not more than once.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

Then later there's running and screaming. - Dr. Ian Malcolm (The Lost World) Walking into the cinema... The original is considered a classic, but the sequels were forgettable. 22 years later, can this storyline resurrect itself or should it have remained buried? Cinematic rating: 3 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 3.5 starsSee if you have heard this story before: scientists make a new creation out of things they have unearthed from the ground. These new creations seem good at first, but begin to turn from the power of their master and turn to terrorise the local community. Most of the people run away from these monsters, but the hero must stay and either save or destroy the monsters. Familiar?Throughout literary and cinematic history, from Frankenstein to Jurassic Park, mankind has been running from his creation. Twenty-two years after the groundbreaking film, Jurassic Park (and two forgettable sequels), we stay within the monstrous tradition and are re-introduced to the dinosaurs of Jurassic World. A fully-functional dinosaur theme park that inhabits the island of Isla Nublar. The vision of John Hammond has come to fruition, but there is trouble in this Jurassic paradise. The park has been in operation for ten years and attendance is declining. The corporation who oversees the park wants to develop dinosaurs that have the 'wow' factor. In creating bigger and 'badder' dinosaurs, what could possibly go wrong? The question that has to be asked at the outset of this review is 'what does Jurassic World provide that you cannot get from the original?' The answer: Bigger villains, more teeth and Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy). Understandably, technology has also changed over the past two decades and the special effects are pretty incredible, but the value added comes down to the terror factor of the new dino-villain, Indominus Rex and the appeal of the hero, Owen. Both of these distinctions deliver something new that is worth watching. The multitude of new dinosaurs and the adapting villain provide the necessary terror. It cannot match the originality of Jurassic Park, but it delvers the necessary fear factor expected in coming to a Spielberg-inspired creation. Also, with the inclusion of heroic central character, there is now an Indiana Jones-type foe for the newly created meat eater. Pratt manages this role well and provides the cockiness and humour needed for this popcorn adventure. Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi), BD Wong (Focus) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black) provide all of the necessary characters to give the story depth and ultimately the bridge for the inevitable sequel. It will not go down as a cinematic triumph, but director Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) provides enough new ingredients and includes enough nostalgia to make you want to come along for the ride. The ending is completely unbelievable, but we are dealing with a story about a Disney Dino-world, so suspend all disbelief and hold on for an entertaining visual experience. Similar to 2015's Ex-Machina, Jurassic World opens the discussion of mankind tinkering with the original creation. Striving for new scientific breakthroughs should be encouraged, but the bigger considerations could be in relationship to the original plan for this world. In a story like Jurassic World, making subtle changes to the original creation seems to lead to disastrous conclusions. The precise nature of this world seems to leave little to randomness. So, if that is the case, could there be consideration for an ultimate designer to it all? Take time to think about it and maybe even read up on it, but in the mean time, allow yourself to go have some fun at the cinemas with Jurassic World. Leaving the cinema... Jurassic World had enough 'wow' factor to justify it being re-booted. It was unbelievable, but enjoyable. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What can we know about creation? (Genesis 1-3) 2. Can we solve our own problems? (Proverbs 3:5, Philippians 4:6) 3. Why do we need a saviour?

But have the organisers learned from their mistakes? Thankfully for us, of course not. Scientists have added genetically modified super-dinos to the park, in an effort to whip up media attention and increase attendances. However building a half-decent fence to keep them in must have been a lesser priority. With typical cat and mouse chase scenes, stunning imagery and cheesy one liners, this film is as much fun as the original. Hopefully this film can inspire a resurgence of palaeontologists, whilst informing and entertaining children and adults a like about science. Worth a watch, I'd say.","10 out of 28 found this helpful.

""Jurassic World,"" directed by Colin Trevorrow, is a perfectly entertaining thriller, serving as both a soft-reboot and sequel to the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy.From the moment the camera flies over the park, letting you bask in its sheer scale, ""Jurassic World"" has a great sense of fun and wonder. Dinosaurs perform crowd-pleasing tricks in various attractions, children ooh and aah as they feed miniature dinosaurs at a petting zoo, and crowds gather in utter disbelief at what they are witnessing; everything feels very magical, as it should - the calm before the storm, if you will. Starring Chris Pratt as Owen, ""Jurassic World"" also boasts a charismatic and badass star that's believable in his confidence around dinosaurs, and along with his chemistry alongside Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, the film has a strong sense of emotional resonance that is sure to keep you invested.One thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the slow burn approach it took before throwing you into the chaos - it let viewers feel comfortable and bask in the glory of the park before unleashing the dinosaurs on them. And if you're watching ""Jurassic World,"" you're likely wondering how the dinosaur action is - the answer is: very badass. There are multiple intense action sequences here, and the slow burn really enhances the thrill and makes the inevitable dread more effective. The CGI is genuinely impressive and immersive, and the entire film feels like a big roller-coaster, and it works. This isn't a movie that you go to for its Oscar-winning plot, but instead to kill two hours and have some fun, and it delivers.And speaking of the two hour runtime, my only complaint would be that the movie feels a touch too long. I feel like if 15 to 20 minutes were shaved off this film it would've been the perfect thriller, but the two hour length does slightly overstay its welcome. That said, I had a lot of fun in this movie, and never found myself bored, which is always a good sign. So, if you're a fan of the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, check this out! You'll be sure to enjoy.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So moving ahead of any such comparisons, the world of dinosaurs is back after almost a decade of its last sequel, especially inviting the young viewers eager to witness the phenomenon in theatres (in 3D) for the very first time after having seen all its earlier parts on the smaller screen through their home video discs. Having said that, this fourth instalment of the series thankfully holds some novel surprises for the not so young viewers too featuring one of our own talented actors Irrfan Khan in a significant and much bigger role as the owner of the beautiful amusement park.In short, realising the pressure to deliver the content conceived in the time of much better CGI and VFX as compared to the last three parts, JURASSIC WORLD doesn't disappoint and comes up as a fairly entertaining joyride with many fresh attractions in its kitty to excite one and all.Co-written and directed by Colin Trevorrow, this time we have a much bigger and stunning theme park with the main attraction of a new genetically modified, extra ordinarily intelligent hybrid dinosaur called Indominus Rex. The killing machine gets introduced with a fine build-up along with the four terrifying raptors tamed by their brave trainer. And then we have a gigantic water beast too brought in with a terrific public show sequence providing the much expected thrills.Following a set pattern that's predictable right from the word go, the first half of the film is a visual delight establishing the new characters of two young brothers, their aunt who is the manager of the park, their ultimate savior and the owner trying to show the world some unbelievable creations of his hired scientists. Not much happens in terms of action in this first hour taking you on to the tour of this much advanced park and the tension actually begins when the dangerous Rex manages to escape from its specified secured area to kill every living being found in its way ahead.As expected its the second half that has the entire action, thrills and fights between the man and the animal also showcasing hundreds of flying creatures attacking, terrorizing and killing the visitors of the park unlike any other sequel in the past. And that indeed turns the film into a much more bloody and brutal sequel in comparison. The deadly fight between the Rex and the raptors makes the young viewers cheer and the CGI department just executes it perfectly. However, the forcibly added romance element in the script is just there to generate some lighter moments and it's the sheer predictability of the script that doesn't let you rate it as something really outstanding ending on the same repetitive note as usual.In the performances, Chris Pratt superbly plays the character of Owen with great conviction and Bryce Dallas is fine too in her given role along with the two kids. But its Irrfan Khan who gives you a pleasant surprise in probably the biggest role ever played by an Indian actor in a foreign film with such an elegant ease. Interestingly another life teaching fact about his association with the series is that, the man who once had no money in his pocket to watch the first part of JURASSIC PARK in the 90s, can presently be seen playing the owner of the park in its latest sequel of 2015 after two decades. Personally speaking, this certainly is one of the most amazing play of DESTINY I have ever seen till date.Summing up, Colin Trevorrow's JURASSIC WORLD is surely a must watch for every youngster who hasn't experienced the famous dinosaur show in the big theatre ever before (preferably in 3D). Plus it has enough in store for the grown-ups too with new inventions especially incorporated for this particular section of viewers expecting something fresh. Yet, one would have to keep the comparisons out of the mind to enjoy it in a much better way taking along the kids to this 'wonderful show of dinosaurs' invented by Spielberg, Trevorrow and their exceptionally talented team designing the incredible graphics.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now we have part 4, which is called ""Jurassic World"" and while it's a major league improvement over the dismal ""Jurassic Park 3"", its still can't live up to the quality of what Spielberg achieved with the work he did with the first two Jurassic Park films ( The original and it's sequel ""The Lost World"".) This film takes place 22 years after the original and Jurassic World is fully operational but the mystic of dinosaurs has worn off and the resort needs a new attraction to bring in new customers. So they create a new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex, a leaner, meaner animal that is made to bring in and wow the crowds. At this point of the film for me when they introduce this monster, I can hear what Jurassic Park's mainstay Ian Malcolm would have said during this moment and it would not have been kind. If you remember the character of Ian Malcolm (played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum) he's pretty much the best character in the Jurassic Park films. The reason being is the fact that he not only represented what the audience was thinking during the films ( Well, the first two movies, not the god awful 3rd one) but was the voice of sarcastic reason and reality to John Hammond's flights of fancy. Too bad he's not around in this movie because he would be pretty much putting down almost every character in this film for their ignorance and stupidity, which was the audience's reaction in my theater through out this entire duration of the film. Chris Pratt plays pretty much the only likable character in the entire film and pretty much the only character with some brains in his head. That's a good thing considering that we would have no one to root for to at least survive the massacre that comes when the Indominus Rex finally and predictably goes on it's killing rampage. Bryce Dallas Howard really does not have much to do other than be surprised by her character's stupidity, which is a shame cause she really is a good actress and Vincent D""Onofrio is given a one note role which is a crime cause he's a damn fine actor. Throw in two of the most annoying kids ever to be stranded on a dinosaur resort ( (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) and you have a cast of characters who almost deserves to be dino chow. Despite the dumb characters and the leaps in logic and common sense, the movie does work as a entertaining time waster. There are some pockets of excitement to be had and the climax really does deliver the goods but this is all this film is about. It's really a monster movie, not a Jurassic Park film and while Chris Pratt gives us the only character in the film to root for, not even he can cover up the film's huge mistakes in story, logic and characterization.","90 out of 166 found this helpful.

Jurassic Park was one of those movies. When the first dinosaur was shown my eyes opened as wide as Dr. Grant's and my mouth opened wide in si ple wonerment. Unfortunately, there's none of that wonder in this film. Henry Wu genetically re-engineered for Jurassic World? He was killed by veloceraptors in the first film and he should have stayed dead. And considering how many people were munched in the first film is it possible that human greed can honestly produce such monumentally foolish and ignorant people? Well, according to Hollywood: Yes. Claire and just about everyone associated with the park is obsessed with greed and blinded by tech. It's all rather disgusting and if I may say just plain dumb. The older kid is a twerp , we have a park manager in waaay over her head, an incompetent and poorly armed security staff, personnel completely untrained for emergency, a hapless owner, a head mad scientist, and an implausible mercenary angle that falls off a cliff. The movie is sorta exciting but it's so silly that it's hard to feel sorry for anything but the poor animals. I was honestly rooting for stupid humans to be trampled or eaten, and plenty of them get munched. There are 4 sympathetic humans, the rest of them should have become dino food beginning with the park manager. Irate the musical score much higher than the script.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It seems like being harsh is so cool for them. But I don't like them. Seriously, this movie is awesome. They say the dinosaurs don't have such connections with humans and so on....as if they were in Jurassic period. The truth is why can't?! also the movie is based on dinosaurs created by small changes in original DNA gaps filled with present day animals. So they could exhibit such connection with human being. Anyways some people are always dumb and you can never make them understand. So overall I say don't believe in those negative reports. Also the movie was wonderful with cool scenes. Its not like Godzilla where I had to see the monsters for just 20min in whole movie. The Jurassic World gave me more satisfaction. I never got too tired to wait for the monster to appear unlike the Godzilla where I saw it clearly at the end LOL! I don't like to compare but if people think Godzilla was good then this movie far better than it!

Most of. All, ""Jurassic World"" also lacks originality, with several of its set pieces copying a great deal of what was done with the first two Spielberg Jurassic Park movies and it lacks their tension and kinetic energy. Chris Pratt and cast are game and they are likeable but their characterization is somewhat shallow and the pet raptor angle get tiring after a while. This film unfortunately continues the trend create in ""Jurassic Park 3"" with a super dinosaur that wreaks havoc for everyone around it but fortunately in this movie, the premise works in a fun B movie way.

The trailer excited me and awoke a childish nature in me I haven't felt in years. I was stoked for this film and what I was was... interesting.I will say this, the story was predictable. I liked some elements of the plot but I wish that the creators had taken a slightly different route with it all. I loved the I.Rex and how it worked, it was the first genuine smart animal that we encountered that wasn't meant to be smart. I liked some of the characters however the acting was a bit wooden at times (I don't mean to bash the actors in any way). I feel like the script writers went too 'cliché' with this film and didn't realise it until after it had released (if they realised it at all).There was still something magical about this film. It wasn't really as gritty or hard paced as the previous three but a lot of time had passed since them and we came to expect things from people who wanted to change some stuff. What you have to remember is it's been 22 years since the first Jurassic Park was released, things have to change otherwise we'll be repeating the same story over and over again, just with different technology involved.All in all, I liked it. Some parts were disappointing but I got the Jurassic Park vibe that the other films managed to beat into us. When I first watched Jurassic Park (the first film) I was one years old, nearly two and it was at Christmas. I sat on my Dad's chest and was captivated even at such a young age. Jurassic World may be cliché and the acting may be a bit off at times but I'm extremely impressed with it all. The ending has become one of my favourite sequences in film history and it probably will be for years to come.In short, take your kids to go see it. To the people who watched the originals, it's not awful but it's not the 10/10 movie we were expecting but it still stands up for itself.","38 out of 65 found this helpful.

So, I suppose, if you really like all the Marvel movies (which I do too) then you know what you're getting; however, if like me, you were hoping for a more tense thriller without comedy quips to break any tension that is ever brought up then will will also be disappointed with this film.

But things goes horrifically wrong when Indominus Rex escapes and wrecks havoc across the park.I'm a huge fan of the Jurrasic Park series. The original is my favourite by far but the sequels were still enjoyable if not a little silly. I didn't have high hopes for Jurassic World but i was pleasantly surprised - thus a good solid film. It's still no Jurassic Park (1993) but it's just as fun as The Lost World (1997) if not better. The special effects and CGI are magnificent, although i personally dont think anything beats thr animatronics of the original Jurassic Park. The action scenes and dinosaur reveals are fun and scary and there's a few throwbacks to the original for nostalgia sake. Now, I'm not a huge fan of the casting. I like Chris Pratt but I didn't really buy into his ex-military, raptor training persona. Bryce Dallas Howard was believable but her character didn't really serve much purpose. Vincent D'Onofiro plays the villain but I feel his chops are wasted playing a generic character. Anyway, you come to a film like this for the dinosaurs and you get plenty of them so I was still very happy even if the actors didn't quite do it for me. The action scenes were mostly believable if not a bit far fetched, same goes for design of the Park, but Indominus Rex was a great creation! Probably my favourite carnivore of the whole series if I'm honest. The dialouge could be cheesy at times but you can look past that as it moves briskly and never lingers too long on anything boring.Final Verdict: More dinosaurs than you can shake a stick at and just a fun movie all round. The characters arn't exactly believable and certain action scenes feel a bit ""hollywood"" at times but it has the right amount of nostalgia and new plot elements to perfectly merge the old trilogy with the inevitable new trilogy. Highly recomended!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie will not illicit the same response from today's children. Spielberg (and his team) broke new ground and painstakingly created new effects that became the standard. This movie uses techniques that already exist and while these effects do look awesome, they're not awe inspiring. The ""spielbergian"" effects aren't the only thing missing, his storytelling style is sorely missed. No time is set setting up characters, situations, or (most importantly) SUSPENSE.Not only is the script, at times, cringe worthy with terrible dialouge, and plot points, but no time is spent setting up these characters. This leads us to really not care about these characters, especially since only 1 of them is even remotely likable, the rest are incredibly ""douchey"". Making matters worse is the atrocious acting from all parties involved (all of them). Pratt is a rehashed yet wooden Star Lord, Howard is her usual C-Word role, the 2 teens are annoying, and D'Onofrio is clearly there for the paycheck. It also must be noted that none of the actors have any chemistry, watching Pratt and Howard together is difficult to say the least.But let's be honest, nobody went to see this for the acting or the plot, they go to see the effects and the dinosaurs. On that front the movie is a success, however 3-D adds very very little to the film. While it doesn't break new ground with revolutionary techniques, it's still the coolest looking dinosaur movie you'll ever see. Despite the myriad of flaws I must say I was highly entertained throughout the entire film, which is really all I can ask of from a movie about a genetically engineered dinosaur theme park.Did it illicit that same childhood wonder and excitement of Jurassic Park in me? Of course not, I'm a grown up now and there's no way the movie could. But it did remind me of a time I felt that way. Will the children of today be as blown away as we were? Probably not, they have much more sophisticated technology in movies now. What we experienced was mind blowingly original, what they experience will not be. But there's nothing wrong with that. Without Spielberg there was never a chance of this topping the original but again it doesn't have to, it just has to top The Lost World and Part 3. And it easily does so, anyone who says it doesn't is probably just holding on to the way the original made them feel. Let's keep in mind that no Jurassic sequel has ever been really good just good for a dinosaur movie.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

Everything is going well until the park's newest attraction -- a genetically modified giant stealth killing machine -- escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.This film was going through various stages of development since at least 2003, and who knows how many changes were made in the process. Keira Knightley dropped out, Chris Pratt became the lead actor (something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago) and a virtual unknown was given the director's chair.Typically, by the fourth film in a franchise, the budget is smaller and the film ends up going straight to video. Instead, someone decided to make this the big comeback, and it pays off. Maybe not as good as the original, and arguably a notch below part two, this film easily outdoes part three and made a ton of money in the process.Credit should be given for not doing a ""reboot"" or ""remake"". Although it still confounds me that anyone would try (and succeed) in building a theme park, it works in the storyline. And even though they did not have Malcolm, Grant or pretty much any other main character return, they brought back Dr. Wu (this time a bit more sinister). That was a great choice, and keeps the franchise strong. How a part five is possible, who knows, but it seems bound to happen now.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

Jurassic World is a fully functioning dinosaur theme park & has fully realized John Hammond's dream all those years back, of creating such a spectacle(John Hammond appeared in Jurassic Park, played by the wonderful Richard Attenborough). Jurassic World has been in operation for about ten years. However, the theme park's visitors have been steadily losing interest in the dinosaurs, over the years. The scientists who have created these dinosaurs come up with a plan to reignite visitors' interest in the park. On the order of the chief executives who own Jurassic World, the scientists create a new & terrifying genetically modified dinosaur to up the 'scare & wow' factor of Jurassic World & bring the park to its former glory. Unfortunately, this new 'attraction' escapes. Now, it is up to a dinosaur handler named Owen(Chris Pratt) & Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard), one of the head employees at Jurassic World, with help from the technical team of Jurassic World to find & stop the dinosaur before all hell breaks loose at the park. Jurassic World is a fantastic movie! When I first saw the trailer of the film, I was intrigued. I thought, there's no way it can match up to Steven Spielberg's 1993 cult classic. However, I was pretty sure that it would be better than the slightly disappointing sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park(1997) & Jurassic Park III(2001). With a great cast & Spielberg executive producing, I knew this movie would come darn close to being as good as the original. Then, I watched it. This movie blew my mind & roared past my monstrous expectations! Not only does it capture the magic of the original film but also, modernizes the Jurassic Park movies for a new generation of viewers. The viewers will get excited when they see the huge gates of Jurassic World open & enter this incredible park. The 3D lets us see Isla Nublar(the island where Jurassic World is located) in all its magnificence. All the dinosaur set pieces look amazing in 3D. You actually feel like the dinosaurs are chasing you, roaring at you & creeping towards you. One of my favorite set pieces in the movie is the pterodactyl set piece. This is just one set piece out of many superb set pieces involving dinosaurs. I love the fact that the chaos involving dinosaurs doesn't take place immediately. This way, there's a growing feeling of dread during the early stages of the film. This adds to the overall thrill factor of the movie. The special effects are outstanding. The dinosaurs look even more realistic than they did in the previous Jurassic Park films. I liked Jurassic World better than Jurassic Park(1993). Director Colin Trevorrow ably takes the reins from Steven Spielberg & makes a movie that both fans & newcomers will love. Another reason the movie is so great is because, all the actors give us superb renditions of their characters. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Owen. After delivering three back-to-back hits with The Lego Movie(2014), Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) & Jurassic World, Pratt has clearly established himself as the latest Hollywood superstar. Bryce Dallas Howard is superb as Claire. Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as Hoskins. Ty Simpkins is adorable as Gray. Irrfan Khan is charismatic as Simon Masrani. Nick Robinson is great as Zach. Jake Johnson is hysterical as Lowery. Omar Sy is effective as Barry. BD Wong is impressive as Dr. Henry Wu. Judy Greer is good as Karen. Jurassic World will satisfy fans of the original film & will gain millions of new fans. A must watch!","86 out of 160 found this helpful.

Some kind of swimming dinosaur ate a shark i think, some kids were attacked by a dinosaur inside a hamster wheel thing and a red head who was kinda hot are just a few things that I can recall. Chris Pratt was pretty cool too, he was some kind of raptor whisperer and a pretty wild guy too. The original Jurrassic Park is definitely the best one but this one is pretty cool.

I mean we live in a world where Vacation, Ben Hur, Mad Max, and Jurassic Park are all getting remade, re-quels, or long overdue sequels. There aren't many studios who pull the trigger on an unknown property, so here we have Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to the previous films, but more so just a film that calls back to the original but ignores the events of the next two. Is it better than the original? No, probably not. But it's definitely not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I really enjoyed the film. I know some people will still take issue with the fact that there's no reason there even should have been more than one film. Why are people still making dinosaurs? It's a good question. But if you just look at the film as more of a monster movie and not compared to the original classic, I think you will have a good time.Set 22 years after the events of the original, Jurassic World has the island as a full time theme park, just as John Hammond had hoped. But as people are growing tired of seeing dinosaurs, scientists create a new hybrid dinosaur as a way to boost attendance. Chris Pratt stars as a Velociraptor trainer, while Bryce Dallas Howard stars as one of the heads of the theme park. There's a lot to like about the film. Pratt is a true movie star and the films action was actually better than I expected. There's also several nods and callbacks to the original film. But I think the film suffers in it's lack of unpredictability and even in the lack of animatronics. The old films used real props in close up shots and only used CGI when needed. I just feel like at times it felt like there was an abundance of CGI where there didn't need to be. And as cool as the final fight was with the new dinosaur, I would have liked to have seen more of the genetics side of the story. I feel like that side of the film was glazed over within a few minutes.But the film is beautiful. It's fascinating seeing the island as an actual theme park attraction just as Hammonds vision called for. Hearing John Williams vivacious score (now done by Michael Giacchino) as a backbone to the gorgeous scenery is an added bonus. I also love the idea that people are getting bored of seeing dinosaurs. I mean they're frickin dinosaurs! The film also gives us some great humor as well, but not as much from Chris Pratt as you would think. But Jake Johnson perhaps has the most memorable performance, playing the Samuel L. Jackson-esque character from the original. But we watch these films to be entertained. And Jurassic World definitely entertains. Maybe not as much of the immense tension that the original had, but the dino-fights are top notch and ended with a fantastic climax. Yes, the people who you think die, die. But the film is loaded high octane thrills and enough humor to keep your eyes pealed. I could have done without the clichéd romance and even the predictable kids side story. But I wasn't let down with Jurassic World.+Great finale +Pratt and Johnson's humor +Beautiful landscape & score+Fresh enough idea to feel necessary -Cliched romance -Too much CGI7.6/10","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

Director Colin Trevorrow and his team has accomplished a quite impressive job! It is basically the same old story, only the scale is proportionally swollen, now Jurassic Park is a fully operating theme park, and our antagonist here is a genetically mutated creature, Indominus Rex (not a dinosaur in the traditional sense, as its DNA carries more undisclosed samples from other species), who is smart enough to trick its human creators and runs amok, wreaks havoc on both human visitors and dinosaur habitants on the island of Isla Nublar. The park's operational manager Claire (Howard) teams up with Owen (Pratt), a veteran now is a raptor trainer on the island, to find Gray (Simpkins) and Zack (Robinson), Claire's nephews who are entrapped in the dangerous zone, and bring them back to safe places. Meanwhile, Hoskins (D'Onofrio), the head of security, thinks it is a great opportunity for a field test of the trained raptors, as he intends to use them in military uses. Under the commander of Owen, four trained raptors are released to track Indominus, but the scheme backfires as soon as they realise the latter contains the former's DNA too. The prolonged survival battle will need the old ruler of the food chain to settle the scores. Chris Pratt is presently the mascot of North American box-office, his down-to-earth persona and his respectful attitude towards dinosaurs attainably confronts Bryce Dallas Howard's high-maintenance facade and her commodity view on the genetically created behemoths, their clashes are metered out with beguiling charm to appease the lowest common denominator, as the latter can literally outrun a T-Rex in her high-heels, and generously the film grants her a trans-formative curve to be connected to the living things and her nephews. Ty Simpkins, who has stolen the thunder from Robert Downey Jr. in IRON MAN 3 (2013), again here he is utterly adorable and conspicuously heartwarming in a role doesn't expect to demand too much other than screaming and running! Irrfan Khan, as the owner of the entire enterprise, Masrani, stands out in his caricature of a man whose leisured passion eventually becomes his doom.The SFX is in its full-blown fashion as we can get a glimpse in the trailer, it aspiringly offers more leeway for the interaction between visitors and its permanent residents, like the ""gyrosphere"" experience and the mosasaurus splash. However, as Indominus is the only villain most of the time, its ubiquitous presence, does feel too contrived, which later can be also referred to the ""betrayed"" raptors, as viewers have the full knowledge of how enormous the island is. It certainly tones down the sense of ""epic-ness"" one might expect from such a ginormous project. Otherwise, JURASSIC WORLD hits all the right notes, massively enhanced by Michael Giacchino's golden accompanying score, as a studio product tries to parade its most generic appeal to lure as many as audience possible, and nothing is wrong of that, as long as viewers can identify with some respect has been thoroughly taken into considerations during the production line.","9 out of 25 found this helpful.

Total mayhem on the screen.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3258795/?ref_=tt_urv","PWNYCNY","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6458242/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2015","This movie is about what happens when people dabble in areas of research that are best to be left alone. It is about what happens when military and business interests conspire to engage in projects without any outside controls. It is about what happens when people become smug and complacent to the point of recklessness. It is about what happens when science is perverted for the sake of profit. It is about what happens when caution is tossed into the wind. It is about what happens when nature is violated. It is about what happens when freaks of nature are produced for all the worst reasons. It is about what happens when the scientist loses his moral compass. It is about the arrogance of man. It is about the consequences of unrestrained materialism. This movie contains all the elements of a great science fiction movie. First, it has an excellent and highly inventive story. The idea of dinosaurs working with humans is engaging. Its rationale as explained in the movie is not beyond the realm of plausibility. Second, the special effects are spectacular. The movie contains numerous scenes depicting many different species of dinosaurs, some friendly, some lethal. Third, the dinosaurs are not demonized. Instead, they are portrayed as creatures who are being manipulated. Fourth, the story includes good guys and bad guys. Fifth, the action is nonstop. The principle characters are literally running throughout the movie. Sixth, the script includes many clever and corny lines that evoke laughter. Seventh, the movie dramatizes what happens when safety is sacrificed for profit. The cast is excellent. Vincent D'Onfrio is especially strong as the head of park security who is actually a sell out for the profiteers. But the biggest star are the special effects which in this movie are entirely necessary and in no way gratuitous. For this movie to succeed as a drama, it has to be able to depict the total mayhem and terror caused by the irresponsible conduct of those who sacrificed the public good to make a quick buck. One other point: This movie succeeds in drawing from other great science fiction movies, like Predator, Frankenstein and Jurassic Park to produce an original, unique and powerful dramatic story.","85 out of 159 found this helpful.

Even the story was great but nowadays those effects are seen in every movie. Just see what Godzilla did last year. So yes, on part of the effects it's all great but nothing new and the story isn't going to put you at the edge of your seat. This is exactly what it must do, no gore, no nudity, no shocking things, just a flick you watch with your whole family. Even if they are under 10 it's all watchable. And the story, well, it's what you've seen in the original one. Things go wrong at the park, and children have to be saved. The raptors are back again and their alpha is a human, can see coming from a stone age what they will do at the end.

Unlike the first film,of which I can recall large parts as if I saw it yesterday,I barely can remember anything of the two successors.And let's not mention the awful rip offs that were subsequently thrown on the market (recently I gave ""Jurassic City"" a chance and already dropped off after 10 minutes due to lousy special effects).In ""Jurassic World"" they returned to the successful formula of the well-known theme park.Only now it's not an empty amusement park,which should be approved by a select group of scientists,but a crowded park where the owners want to add a new attraction.But again the end result is less attractive and cozy.It's perfectly summed up by the words of Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) in ""The Lost World"" : ""Yeah.Ooh and ah, that's how it always starts.But then later there's running and screaming"".The two teenagers Gray and Zach,the first one is a dinosaur fanatic and the second one has more interest in the opposite sex,are on their way to the amusement park of InGen,where their aunt Claire works as a operations manager.Of course,the latter doesn't have time to babysit and she leaves them in the hands of her assistant Zara.To ensure the income of the park and meet the demands of the main sponsors,the small army of geneticists fabricated a hybrid version which would be even more frightening than the existing species.They use the genes of prehistoric predators and contemporary species.The owner of the park wants Owen Grady,the Velociraptor trainer,to check the enclosure of the hybrid.And soon Owen comes to the conclusion that once again they are playing with fire.Is ""Jurassic World"" an impressive film? Yep. Did the special effects and computer animation make me drool again ? Yep. Are those fearsome dinosaurs overwhelming again ? Yep. Did it exceed the first film ? Uh, actually not quite. What makes this film memorable ? Well, the park itself for starters. A sort of Disneyland but with unparalleled attractions. The monorails, the infrastructure, the holographic displays and the overall total picture were impressive. The mosasaur was the masterpiece of this film. Superbly imaged. Both the physical appearance as his natural living space. The ""gyrospheres"" and the accompanying scenery is the first attraction I would like to try out. The action-packed part at the pterosaurs cage was breathtaking. But the rest of the used scenes showed similarities with the first film. A park where the situation turns out to be life threatening. Again a couple (who had a thing in the past most probably) need to bring two teenagers in safety while they are surrounded by dangerous prehistoric creatures. Even Claire imitated the dress of Dr. Sattler at one time: an unbuttoned shirt over a T-shirt.What I didn't get while watching ""Jurassic World"", were shivers down my spine and goosebumps moments. Emotionally, I don't think there'll ever be another movie (with prehistoric monsters) that surpasses the experience I had while watching ""Jurassic Park"". When Dr. Grant turned around,peered over the valley where different prehistoric species wandered around and said ""Look at that. It's a dinosaur."", my hair stood straight up. When the T-Rex left his cage and started chasing the jeep and you could see the gaping mouth approaching in the rear-view mirror. The raptors sneaking through the kitchen with two teenagers scared to death. These are all particular moments I've missed in ""Jurassic World"". Yes, it was terribly exciting and impressive to see. But that subtle difference was there anyway. I also missed a character like Jeff Goldblum with his dry humor and pertinent observations. And then of course the charismatic dreamer John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who saw a fantasy collapsing. In some ways it was all there, but it didn't feel the same way.But forget about my nitpicking and hurry to a cinema to watch this two-hour action packed, exciting and entertaining film. The success of ""Jurassic World"" is its link with the first movie and the overall nostalgic value. You can add the question ""How did you feel after watching Jurassic Park?"" to the long line of historical questions such as ""Where were you when Kennedy was shot ?"" And ""What were you doing when the radio broad-casted Elvis passed away ?"". ""Jurassic Park"" had a major influence on films that appeared after wards. My main conclusion is that ""Jurassic Park"" was far ahead when it's about CGI, because the creations at that time looked as lifelike as those in ""Jurassic World"". But I am quite convinced that I'll never set foot in such a park, would it ever exist in reality ...PS. Funniest moment for me : pay attention to what a visitor does during the pterosaurs attack ... Yes, he saves two cocktails ! I almost choked on my coke! More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Dear mother of god, Where is Jeff Goldblum when you really need him?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3256332/?ref_=tt_urv","sleepinghoward","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23588312/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2015","Before I get to sink my claws in what I think is very wrong with this film, I have to say upfront that it's an hell of a lot better film than ""Jurassic Park 3"" just for the glaring fact that ""Jurassic Park 3"" was that bad of a movie. So much so that poor Sam Neill can't live it down for the way the screenwriters ruined his character and the credibility of the series as a whole.Now we have part 4, which is called ""Jurassic World"" and while it's a major league improvement over the dismal ""Jurassic Park 3"", its still can't live up to the quality of what Spielberg achieved with the work he did with the first two Jurassic Park films ( The original and it's sequel ""The Lost World"".) This film takes place 22 years after the original and Jurassic World is fully operational but the mystic of dinosaurs has worn off and the resort needs a new attraction to bring in new customers. So they create a new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex, a leaner, meaner animal that is made to bring in and wow the crowds. At this point of the film for me when they introduce this monster, I can hear what Jurassic Park's mainstay Ian Malcolm would have said during this moment and it would not have been kind. If you remember the character of Ian Malcolm (played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum) he's pretty much the best character in the Jurassic Park films. The reason being is the fact that he not only represented what the audience was thinking during the films ( Well, the first two movies, not the god awful 3rd one) but was the voice of sarcastic reason and reality to John Hammond's flights of fancy. Too bad he's not around in this movie because he would be pretty much putting down almost every character in this film for their ignorance and stupidity, which was the audience's reaction in my theater through out this entire duration of the film. Chris Pratt plays pretty much the only likable character in the entire film and pretty much the only character with some brains in his head. That's a good thing considering that we would have no one to root for to at least survive the massacre that comes when the Indominus Rex finally and predictably goes on it's killing rampage. Bryce Dallas Howard really does not have much to do other than be surprised by her character's stupidity, which is a shame cause she really is a good actress and Vincent D""Onofrio is given a one note role which is a crime cause he's a damn fine actor. Throw in two of the most annoying kids ever to be stranded on a dinosaur resort ( (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) and you have a cast of characters who almost deserves to be dino chow. Despite the dumb characters and the leaps in logic and common sense, the movie does work as a entertaining time waster. There are some pockets of excitement to be had and the climax really does deliver the goods but this is all this film is about. It's really a monster movie, not a Jurassic Park film and while Chris Pratt gives us the only character in the film to root for, not even he can cover up the film's huge mistakes in story, logic and characterization.As the character of Ian Malcolm said to John Hammond in ""The Lost World"".John Hammond: ""Don't worry, I'm not making the same mistakes again."" Dr. Ian Malcolm: ""No, you're making all new ones.""This pretty much sums up Jurassic World as a whole.","706 out of 1,404 found this helpful.

Yeah, I think that's what lead me to rate that movie 1/10 on IMDb. Cause we see too much, too early i the movie, and that absolutely nothing makes sense.

I wasn't a massive fan or anything like that, but it was somewhat of a groundbreaking film. The sequels were pretty crappy, but I don't really remember them. My expectations for this movie were very low. I wasn't against another Jurassic Park movie by any means, but I wasn't exactly clamoring for one either. When my friend asked me to see it with him, I figured I'd give it a shot. It was technically well-done. It looked really slick. That being said, there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on. Then it dawned on me! It lacks genuine tension. Steven Spielberg is a master at creating thrills and tension. He knows what the audience wants. Colin Trevorrow obviously did some research. In many ways, this is like a love letter to Jurassic Park. There are a lot of references to Jurassic Park. As amiable as that is, he falls short. There is plenty of action, but it felt mechanical and I wasn't all that entertained by it. I will say the Dinosaurs looked pretty cool. The performances are above average. Chris Pratt handled himself adequately. I didn't think he was great, but he did the job. I didn't fully buy him as a ""tough guy"" Bryce Dallas Howard is a cute and fared pretty well. It's too bad her character was thinly written. Robinson & Simpkins are decent as the kids. My main problem with the cast is the lack of depth. I wasn't given enough to work with. This film isn't worthy of breaking box office records. I'm still shaking my head about how this made over 200 million on opening weekend. It's never boring and there are some good moments, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. It could have been better.6.3/10","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

I really liked the 'old' movies and since this was supposed to be right up that ally, I was excited. Also a little worried though, because if the 'old' movies, especially the first one, were so good, would Jurassic World be able to live up to those standards? The answer is yes and no. The storyline is cliché, it doesn't have the same level as innovation as Jurassic Park, the cast (in my opinion) in the original trilogy were better than the cast for Jurassic World, ... But when I saw the movie it felt like a good old dinosaur movie with lots of spectacle and providing good entertainment.

Alright, more like a total meltdown disaster. But, InGen corporation has figured out how to smooth out the bumps of the earlier park. John would have defiantly been proud of what it has become or would he? Did we learn to keep these dangerous animal in or do we once again get to hear the roaring screeches of these magnificent animals as we run for our lives in the opposite direction.Not only has InGen cloned and made extinct creatures, they have been able to fully incorporate this place into an incredible petting zoo with 5 star hotel and for the ladies shopping area's. The park is running so smoothly that they decided to up their game. The investors wanted something bigger,faster and scarier to add to the attractions and bring more people to the park. So the lab whipped up a genetically super beast made up of a T.Rex and a bunch of other top-secret animals that are being kept on the down low. They call it Indominus Rex. A new enormous attraction .Which gives the park administrator, Claire a lot more work on her plate. Who is frantically putting things together to get ready to show to the public. A hectic job yes, but she knows what she's doing and knows the business very well.She is a no nonsense kind of person, that's why when she has to work with Owen, and ex navy seal. Who was brought in to care for the raptors and learn how to control them. Owen was difficult to convince about the Indominus Rex, he had questions about safety, and how smart it was to genetically cross species to create a monster we know nothing about. Claire thinking he was just a silly boy who knew nothing about the business aspects of making the Indominus Rex. But, then disaster hit, again. As the Indominus starts doing things no one could have predicted it could do. Claire does have a little bit more to worry about however. Her nephews Zach and Gray were sent to the resort over Christmas break while their mother and father work through some marital problems at home. They are more of a problem for Claire because she had not connected with her family in a while she only had one thing on her mind, becoming the best business women she could be.Even though with the dinosaur on the loose, this becomes a good thing for the boys as the band together and bond like never have. Both Claire and Own risk their lives and save each other numerous of time while look for these lost nephews and try to capture the Indominus Rex.There is no sexual content inappropriate for children, the violence however is a little bit of a different story. There are a few moments of animals getting torn apart, things that is dripping with blood or it spattered on the wall and a few flesh ripping scenes from the dinosaurs. A lot of raptor attacks where a raptor does rip off a human's arms. Raptors attack and rip soldiers apart in a forest. Pterodactyls swooping in on large groups of people using their large scary talons to throw people around like a rag doll. A woman is grabbed and pulled back and forth back and forth by two dinosaurs flying in the air then reach up and grabbed then swallowed whole. Many gun scenes with bullets blazing. And the worst of all Owen punches Hoskins in the face. Okay, that not true.Not too much crude or profane language. Only a few drug and alcohol content where we see a guy picking up two margaritas at the resort, and only one joke about the craziness of a diet that does not include tequila but, nothing your child will pick up on.We see that a park for dinosaurs is just not a great idea it didn't work 20 years ago why would it work now? Those investors have got to stop investing in these things. You enjoy the great acting put on by the entire cast you will feel a few cheesy parts, but what movie doesn't have little cheese? You'll witness a scary, thrilling, exhilarating ride through these giant reptilian CGI that captures the dinosaur in a very lifelike way. You'll not be disappointed. You will be on the edge of your seat grasping at the hand of the person next to you, even if you don't know them.","10 out of 14 found this helpful.

I've only seen the original, which I thoroughly enjoy, but I had heard that the sequels were terrible. Because of that, I did not expect this one to deliver anything special in terms of plot or character. With a dinosaur movie, there's only so much you can do and, as this was intended to give the franchise new life, it is unsurprising that they would ignore plot and character in favor of really cool dinosaurs. And after seeing the movie, I was totally okay that they did. Yes, we had seen the stock characters before, but they were likable enough and didn't detract from the movie at all. In fact, I really liked Chris Pratt's Owen and his deep care for the animals he worked with and his paternal nature. I also really enjoyed the genetic modification aspect of it because it did ring true to our society where we are so easily bored and demand more without thinking about consequences. Apart from that, I liked the dinosaurs. It was a fun run away from the monster movie that delivered on the action. While there was nowhere near as much suspense as in the first movie, that did not make it unenjoyable. In particular, seeing the film in IMAX, the final showdown did not disappoint. All in all, if you're looking for an unique plot or great character development, this is not the movie to watch. However, it did succeed in being a fun summer blockbuster, which is exactly what it should have been.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

I even enjoyed THE LOST WORLD more than most people. I've read Michael Crichton's novels more times than I can remember. So yes, I am a fan. I wasn't thrilled at the idea of reopening the movie franchise more than a decade since the third film solidified my belief that the series had run out of steam. I was cautiously optimistic when I read that Colin Trevorrow, director of the fun SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED, was brought on to helm the project and I was even more excited when Chris Pratt was cast in one of the lead roles. Trevorrow was loud and proud about his love for the original '93 film, so I began to believe he might do the series justice and somehow reinvigorate it. JURASSIC WORLD seems to ignore the previous two sequels, setting it in an operational and mega-successful park built on Isla Nublar. Claire (Bryce Dallas-Howard) is the operations manager, whom we meet when she's balancing a busy schedule of shuffling off her visiting nephews onto her disinterested assistant and presenting the park's newest attraction, the Indominus Rex, to potential investors. Meanwhile, former Navy SEAL and Ingen contractor Owen (Pratt) takes a break from training a team of velociraptors to inspect the Indominus's pen for safety concerns; in what should come as a surprise to no one, the Indominus outsmarts Owen and the park crew and escapes from its pen, endangering the lives of thousands of park guests as it murders its way across the island.Trevorrow was not lying when he expounded on his love for the original film. In fact, JURASSIC WORLD is his love letter to it and it's probably the film's biggest flaw. You can't go more than a few minutes without some sort of reference to JURASSIC PARK. The visitors' center is featured in a sequence where we see the ""When Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth"" and skeletal remains from the climactic moment. We see a night vision headset (twice!), famous from the T-rex escape sequence. There's little nods scattered around in the background (visual and audio) and even a character in the Jurassic World control room (Lowery, played by Jake Johnson) who seems to encapsulate Trevorrow's own raging fandom. A few references would've been fine but, by the time the film was halfway over, it just made me wish I was watching the original film. I wanted JURASSIC WORLD to be its own film, reminding us why we loved the '93 film without constantly nudging us with its elbow, winking, and murmuring ""Remember that part? It was cool, wasn't it?"" Even the core plot is pretty much a slightly modified version of the original: dinosaurs get loose, rational man who knows what he's doing makes it his mission to bring two key children back to safety, big climactic moment to close it out. Except the characters in the original film always felt as if they were in constant danger. There was suspense. JURASSIC WORLD isn't all that suspenseful. Maybe it's because the dinosaurs are 99% CG now. Sure, they look pretty good but, no matter how many people the Indominus swallows whole, it's never as scary as the T-rex was in the first film. The lack of suspense could also be attributed to the hollow feeling behind the action. Most of the deaths are nameless extras, be they asset containment crew or park guests. The moment when I knew this would never live up to JURASSIC PARK: when a helicopter crashes in a fiery, gratuitous, unmotivated explosion just so it can happen with the Indominus roaring in the foreground for that perfect ""trailer shot"". It was almost offensive in how cheesy that moment felt.Speaking of cheesyhow about that final confrontation with the Indominus? I'm not going to lie. That whole sequence had me rolling my eyes. Especially at the end. Not going to spoil anything here, but you'll probably know what I'm referring to. I'm being sort of hard on JURASSIC WORLD but that's only because I wanted it to try harder. It's not a bad film. It's still pretty entertaining. It's got some great casting (Pratt, Johnson, Irrfan Khan as the park owner, Vincent D'Onofrio as a nefarious Ingen overseer) and I loved the concept of setting the film in an operational park. On the topic of D'Onofrio's character and the whole subplot of ""trained"" velociraptors: I was wary at first but I thought it was done well. If anything, I think it should've been the main plot the film or, at the very least, saved for a sequel. The sequence in the middle of the film where the raptors are given a field test (which is glimpsed in the trailer with Pratt running with the pack on a motorcycle) was probably the best part of the movie. Overall, I felt JURASSIC WORLD was a tad overrated and, while it was an entertaining couple of hours, teamed with AGE OF ULTRON to jumpstart the ""Summer of 'Meh'"" (a term I've come to use for the summer blockbuster season of 2015 where I was continuously underwhelmed). Based on the money this film raked in (all of it), a sequel was guaranteed and, just as I was for JURASSIC WORLD, I'm hopeful. This spent too much time pining over the franchise's glory days but there were some promising nuggets in there. For anyone who for some reason hasn't seen it already, it's worth a watch and you'll probably really enjoy it. Personally, I'm more interested in where the franchise goes from here.","20 out of 32 found this helpful.

My recommendation is that if you haven't seen any of the original 3 movies (unlikely but possible ?) don't be tempted to now, watch this and it will be all the more enjoyable, well they say ignorance is bliss ! Of course you probably have seen the original and best film from 1993 and even the still very enjoyable JP2 of 1997 which this film compares favourably to. It is leaps and bounds better than JP3 of 2001 which was inevitable because that film was scraping the barrel for ideas. The CGI has improved quite a bit and that is where the money has been spent I guess (another £100 000 000 film !) with the added bonus of 3D which I thought was really good. OK the story is obviously predictable , we aren't expecting all the dinosaurs to stay in their pens and behave themselves are we !? The newish ideas come in the form that we have trained the dinos to be more entertaining a bit like sea-world and for that extra wow factor that is of course needed we have a new chimera of a dinosaur in Indominus-rex a real badass monster who inevitably runs amok. There are some funny and romantic moments dropped in here and there and of course the baddies in the background with their own agendas for the dinosaurs. Chris Pratt shows us again how entertaining he can be as the action hero and will obviously be doing more comedy action in future. BD Wong is again the scientist from the original 1993 film, it would have been nice to see Sam Neil but you can't have everything ,maybe JP3 scared him or should I say scarred him ? Anyway ,if you want to see an action packed entertaining big blockbuster of a movie go and see Mad Max Fury Road, if you want to see an entertaining action movie about dinosaurs , Jurassic World is a good option.","266 out of 542 found this helpful.

Yes, it's better than Jurassic Park 3 and its really dumb fun but some of the praise seem bit robotic, like they are going through talking points given by a press agent. Nostalgic? Because this movie takes place on the same island as the first Jurassic Park? Honestly, this does not look like the same island but whatever. Bring back your childhood? Was your childhood memory of Jurassic Park filled with cardboard cut outs as human characters, sexism, bad acting and an over indulgence of CGI? Seems so. The sequel that Jurassic Park deserves? From what I remember from Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, it had smart characters dealing with a moral dilemma about messing with the natural order of things and dealing with the consequences of their actions. The only sequel in the Jurassic Park series that carried over the themes of the original Jurassic Park was Steven Spielberg's follow up, The Lost World. While The Lost World was not as good as the original Jurassic Park, it still manages to be a strong sequel that at respects and accomplishes what the original sets out to do. Jurassic World only really has dumb characters running away from a monster bend on killing everyone in a amusement park. Again, Jurassic World is for a fact a much better film than the horrendous Jurassic Park 3 but that's because it's dumb fun, not the second coming of the original Jurassic Park.Chris Pratt is playing his usual roguish frat boy self and it does gives the movie one of it's few likable characters but he can't hold this movie by himself with with bad card board cuts outs as characters, some very bad acting and out of place sexist stereotypes of women. Not to mention a script that is pretty flimsy with pretty bad dialogue. With what was once a science fiction thriller with the first two Jurassic Park films went off the rails with Jurassic Park 3 when it became a sad family film with dinosaurs. Jurassic World tries to bring back the thrills somewhat with some dumb B movie fun with a monster on the loose film but its hurt by the hint of the bad family drama and unlikable characters of Jurassic Park 3 with two boys trying to get their aunts attention. Because of that, none of it works very well off each other and while Chris Pratt is likable hero, he's not given the tools necessary thanks to the bad script and so so directing to hold back the tidal wave of cheese that was thrown on the audience once the film was done.So yes, it's better than Jurassic Park 3 but no,it's not nostalgic and its not the sequel that Jurassic Park deserves. If this bring you back to your childhood, you really do have issues you need to deal with. In reality, Its a semi decent B movie entry to the series that manages to entertain despite its many problems. If you go in believing the hype from talking points from publicist trying to sell this film to you as the second coming of the original Jurassic Park, you will be very disappointed. Go in with realistic expectations and you will be rewarded.","552 out of 1,104 found this helpful.

As if all the people gobbled up by giant reptilians run amok over the course of three previous movies wasn't enough, a giant corporation thinks it's a grand idea to open Jurassic World, the Sea World of dinosaurs. And because dinosaurs have become de rigeur, audiences demand bigger and meaner ones if they are to continue buying tickets. Thus, a team of geneticists manufacture monsters intended to satisfy customers, until they do too good a job and create one that's a sort of super hero and has all the best traits from various other dinosaurs combined into one. When it escapes from its pen, things go predictably badly.Once I recovered from the disappointment of realizing that Bryce Dallas Howard was not going to be swallowed up or torn apart by the movie's end, I was able to settle in and enjoy this movie for what it was, which is a game if somewhat lacking attempt to recreate the roller coaster thrills of Steven Spielberg's first installment. Remember that one, that ancient relic of a movie that came out way back in 1993? Yes, it's so old I'm surprised it was even in color. Of course we need a reboot -- God forbid anyone should be bothered to push a button and stream the original from any number of available services.""Jurassic World"" has lots of set pieces that sound good on paper, and they manage to offer up a moderate does of entertainment, but there's something lacking from the whole enterprise that made the first one so special. It's got the same slick production values and technical wizardry (though the visual effects in the first one look better than the ones in this, despite being more than 20 years old). But it feels like a movie written and directed by a committee; you never appreciate Spielberg's ability to direct an action sequence until you see someone try to imitate him.Chris Pratt, once again, is not up to the nominal challenge of the role he's been given. Every time I see him in a movie, he's just missing whatever essential quality the character he's playing needs in order to work. In ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" it was a roguish scruffiness. In this, it's a macho resourcefulness. But he's never convincing as anything other than a pretty boy bro. It's like ordering Indiana Jones and getting a doofus frat boy.The most memorable sequence in the movie is one where a flock of pterodactyls swoops down on the unsuspecting visitors to the theme park and wreak all kinds of havoc. The rest of the movie is a blur.Grade: B","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

In this movie, there are more comic relief moments, more content regarding family, and we also know for a fact that none of the major characters won't die. A lot of people say that this movie is predictable, that there is just one big monster and it's powerful, it does a lot of damage and then it gets defeated. But I feel that this generalization of the plot is kinda bs, because every detail of this movie is very enjoyable. You got the cool new dino, you got great chase scenes, you got dino fights, you got a sense of an apocalyptic event, you got good music, and you also got T-rex. I feel like people are judging this movie too much, comparing it to jurassic park and lost world. But we should realize that this is something different, and it is enjoyable, that's all that matters.","22 out of 36 found this helpful.

There is not, in many ways, much to remark about Jurassic World: it does not overstay its welcome; its second unit content is exciting; it a least attempts something resembling character study and manages to take a franchise into new directions without wrecking too much of the nucleus of the initial idea. Unlike, say, recent ""Die Hard"" or ""Terminator"" entries.Many of the ideas coined in the aftermath of the blow-away 1993 success ""Jurassic Park"" by critics and theorists remain; observations which were never meant derogatorily, but are either included here out of a rooted urge to stick to the source material or by way of academic homage. Thus, much of what was written twenty years ago with regards to the symmetry between a theme-park ride and a movie going experience with films such as ""Jurassic Park"" still stand. I believe it was Tom Shone who once remarked that, in a post 1977 Star Wars era, cinema/film-going experiences are becoming more like trips to an amusements park with each passing summer-blockbuster line-up.In Jurassic World, a tracking shot once we are in the park after some formalities is deliberately set up so as to resemble a standard person's height as the park is entered and a woman steps before us with the line ""Welcome to Jurassic World"" – it is the closest to a process of breaking the fourth wall that one can realistically come without cordially turning to the camera and asking the salivating multiplex audience if they are ready for what they are about to experience over the next 90 minutes. It does, in many ways, call to mind Spielberg's self-conscious references to the various items of ""Jurassic Park"" memorabilia which were actually on sale in shops anyway in 1993 by way of his otherwise needless tracking shot around a gift-shop full of theme park memorabilia towards the end of that film.Two strands set the film running, the likes of which somewhat clumsily merge towards the end. The first revolves around two minors: essentially one child and a teenager with Justin Bieber locks and an eye for the girls. They head to Central America and Jurassic World: a realisation of John Hammond's dream to one day build a theme-park where the dinosaurs are the attraction. This is doubly rewarding, because the head of the park is the aunt Claire, played by Bryce Dallas-Howard.The second strand follows an Alan Grant-knock off by the name of Owen Grady, played with a really good balance of energy and vulnerability by Chris Pratt. Grady works in a strange capacity as some sort of dinosaur trainer; a process whereby the once-feared velociraptors are now essentially pets performing tricks at a click. Occupying him on his strand is Vincent D'Onfrio's shady Vic Hoskins, who wants the raptors signed over to the military to essentially fight Al-Qaeda, but we have previous experience of this archetype by way of Paul Riser's character in James Cameron's ""Aliens"".He is present in the park to help Claire with a new hybrid dinosaur the park has created: the Indominus-Rex, which is director Colin Trevorrow's taking of the franchise to bigger places: ""The Lost World"" needed to put a Tyrannosaurus Rex in an urban environment; ""Jurassic Park 3"" needed its Spinosaurus to juice up proceedings and now the 2015 vintage technically needs something that doesn't even exist to keep people interested. With a Tyrannosaurus-Rex in place of the lab-creation, but the film exactly as it otherwise is, things just wouldn't be as much fun. The trouble is, this new creation, echoing perhaps Frankenstien's Monster, is a bloodthirsty killer which does not take to being caged up, and it is not long before things get out of hand once it cuts loose. What follows is essentially a B-movie trussed up like an A-movie, an old adage which, I believe, was once attributed to Spielberg's ""Jaws"" anyway, although not in a derogatory manner, as the kids strive to survive in the wilderness; the park tries to contain the Indominus and Vincent D'Onofrio refuses to take ""no"" for an answer.Along the way, we get plenty of dino-on-human and dino-on-dino action, but Trevorrow has a trick up his sleeve and it is the development of the Dallas-Howard character, whom is transformed from cold and robotic bureaucrat barely able to recall her nephew's name to hard-bodied supporting heroine on the front-line saving their lives. A very physical epitome of this might be the moment she physically tears away some of her clothes beside a waterfall in order to shed one 'skin' and embrace another. Various ""body"" theories have been coined about allowing the viewer to technically gauge just how far along the film has progressed by the state of a lead character's ""body"" without so much as even glancing at a watch.Alas there is not much to marvel at away from the heavy spectacle of dinosaurs doing what dinosaurs used to do to one another, not to mention what they would almost certainly do to human-beings if in close proximity to them, aside from Dallas-Howard's aforementioned arc. Colin Trevorrow should strike us as a shrewd director, in that he manages to pay homage to the 1993 original in fairly audacious ways without ever really encroaching on it. Despite this, he manages to take what now appears to be a franchise that has been re-energised and reinvigorated to new and exciting places. The film is for sure a success, but is not innocent of lacking in several areas.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

After digesting the story and events, and viewing the film a few more times, I think I'm getting closer to understanding why Jurassic World did enough to please the palette of JP fans who anxiously awaited the next installment of this epic franchise, but not enough to capitalize on a very promising opportunity. Several scenes in this film are executed very well and create real moments of suspense like you would hope for in the scientific survival- horror genre. Michael Giacchino's inventive score plays a big part in this, paying just enough homage to keep within the original universe while accomplishing a modern tone to create a stark and somber atmosphere as well as the more joyful and playful moments that are common with Spielberg matinée-action films. I highly recommend, if nothing else, to give a listen to the soundtrack and immerse yourself in the wonder, adventure, and genuine thrills that exist on a island where humans rank a few spots down the food chain if not secured by their propensity to control nature and the environment (as Ian Malcolm eloquently monologues)But back to the original point, many scenes are filmed and directed very well on their own, primarily the dino-scenes, but the dinos should only be a subsidiary of a greater human narrative, as was on display in Crichton's original novel and the 1993 film.The story arc seems to be on a train track that's continually shifting the rails. As a ""passenger,"" you know the destination and have a sense of what's to unfold - and in many ways the characters and events are too predictable - but upon arrival you'll be left thinking, ""that was an unusual route to get to where we wanted to go."" I sit back and think about the characters of this film and just envision so many different interactions that could've taken place in order to help the viewer absorb the universe and feel the gravity of everything at-stake rather than being relegated to a mere observer of chaos and destruction.The film had charismatic elements, for sure: - Chris Pratt delivers his character very well, even with an at-times limited and underwhelming dialogue. - Irfan Khan is a natural as the eccentric president and owner of the park (his accent can be thick, but I appreciated the sincere disposition he carried as a caring owner and leader) - The intelligence and impressive capabilities of the I-Rex and Henry Wu's engineering are fun thoughts to toss around in theory, but don't necessarily play out to their full potential on-screen - The immense level of detail put into the park is truly astounding upon close inspection - And once again, Michael GiacchinoHowever, many elements will leave many underwhelmed: - Bryce Dallas Howard, though her acting is fine - even great at times, her character just didn't command enough charisma or engaging traits to be the film's leading presence. Perhaps it's because she switches too much between a dictating administrator, panicked/less thoughtful reactor to chaotic events, and simultaneously dismissive yet empathetic family member and lover. Her character arc, while identifiable, is like the overall story and prone to confusing turns - Hoskins, the InGen leader, has valid reasoning for his motives (even if far-fetched, DNA modification through gene-splicing as a mode of creating bio-weapons deserves to play out on film, and what's more fun than using extinct animals as the base genome) but the character is treated too often as a wily cartoon-villain too busy twiddling his mustache to present a convincing case for his ideas. - The forced love component between the two leads, and ""forced"" really is the best word because, while everything seems to be positioned for a survival situation to bring two people closer together, the audience doesn't really get the opportunity to 'feel' the bond being created. We're given a backstory and both Pratt and Howard possess charm, but the on-screen relationship that unfolds feels too much like a product of movie-making and doesn't possess enough humanity. At one point, Howard's character even goes so far to dismisses her borderline negligence on a ""technical malfunction"" that nearly resulted in Pratt's death - so where exactly is the caring and affection, I ask?On the whole, I still enjoy watching this film for the cinematography and direction during action sequences, but I wish the script and story- board would have been tweaked some more. It feels like some early ideas were stubbornly implanted into a film that tried to break free and become something transcendent but ultimately settled into something more comfortable.","8 out of 23 found this helpful.

The movie does a good job tho in bringing the franchise to next generation. The transition and references work quite well. I was pleased how solid and well directed the movie in whole was. In the very beginning it felt as if it might be awkward, but once it started, it worked quite well.Acting was pretty good. I don't watch many Hollywood movies anymore, so wasn't familiar with Chris Pratt, but he makes a good Indiana Jones style lead. Bryce Dallas Howard is a bit over the top at times, but her character works in a blockbustery clichéd way. The kids were OK, altho a bit underdeveloped.What I didn't like was the violence. In my opinion the movie is way too bloody and violent, even warlike. It's been a while since I last saw the original, but I kind of remember it being more on the scary side than action violence. I personally prefer a few tense scary scenes to full throttle violence. This movie does not have the same suspense factor - in my opinion - as the original with raptors. Then there is one quite prolonged death scene, which isn't too graphic, but you have time to feel the despair.I also felt that there were a bit too many different themes thrown in. There's a very under developed divorce theme, the military theme, the profit theme, the marketing theme, love story theme etc..Seeing this movie made me both slightly worried and also intrigued of how Trevorrow will direct his Star Wars IX. He seems like a capable director, able to handle a lot of stuff including surprisingly working jokes amidst action, but also seems to create a tad violent stuff.Not showing this to my kids yet, but pretty good movie otherwise.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It has more thought and effort put into it than those other 2. I went to see this in theaters with my friend and we both agreed it was fun to watch but wasn't anything spectacular like it could've been. Once again though, this isn't a bad film.It is about these kids who go and visit their aunt (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is the director of the park which is now open and functioning. She decides that the park is losing money because dinosaurs no longer mean anything, so they make a new hybrid dinosaur. Now of course there is a problem and it turns into an action adventure.The acting is actually surprisingly good from most of the actors and they do a pretty well job of reacting correctly in the scenarios they are thrown into. However, unlike the first one, I feel like there isn't as much wonder in this one. That may however be though to reinforce the idea that dinosaurs are now just a regular thing.The CGI is very detailed and intricate with the dinosaurs but honestly looks very fake and easy to tell that they aren't really there. Despite some problems it is still action packed and fun to watch. It is up to you if it is your type of movie.","9 out of 27 found this helpful.

Massive kudos to Bryce Dallas Howard for all the running she did in those heels.I'm actually quite surprised at the amount of references to the first Jurassic Park; I expected at least one but there were quite a few and not ones that were thrown in your face either.I'll be interested to see the story for, the inevitable, sequel because who is going to go to another park?An enjoyable, entertaining movie that I will see again in the cinemas and will definitely be an addition to my bluray collection.","16 out of 25 found this helpful.

That said, it was actually an enjoyable summer blockbuster. The plot is poor and completely predictable, pretty much a rehashing of Jurassic Park 1 & 2 without the character development or the moralizing, but the acting and the direction were more than passable, certainly far better than the third installment. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were decent with pretty hollow characters to work with. But lets be real, this movie is about the graphics... ferocious dinosaurs on the hunt and that's where this flick makes up for it's shortcomings. Flawless CGI shows off what two decades of technology can do for you. Not that the original doesn't hold up because it does quite well, but its amazing what is possible now. I was hesitant to catch JW in 3D, but ultimately opted for IMAX and glad I did, if only for the scenes with the top down view of the Mosasauraus leaping out of the water to snag its meal. This shot is shown in the trailer but seeing it in 3D is alone worth the price of admission. If you're looking for well made cinema, this film is definitely not for you... but if you're looking for a fun monster flick with eye-popping visuals, Jurassic World will definitely do.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

A first one against the Jurassic franchise, which I've never been a huge fan of. A second one against 4th installments in film franchises (that's right Crystal Skull, I'm looking at you). And a third one against easy, bigger-is-better blockbuster. One by one, this film destroyed these biases. The cast's performance, led by an astonishing Chris Pratt was tremendous (even though child actors will remain child actors). The new park was as immersive as one could have ever hoped for. The link made to the rest of the franchise was not only skillful but impregnated with a subtlety unknown to blockbusters. The film was overall one of the most terrific movie-going experiences I've ever had. Not only immersive, thrilling and wowing, but also quite reflective on the effects of consumerism on our society.","25 out of 42 found this helpful.

Simply put, the movie company waited until enough time passed and a new generation is the focus of their marketing. Not only is the storyline a complete copy of the original Jurassic Park, but even with all the developments in technology since the original, they still managed to screw it up and present a mediocre offering. All I can say is that I hope the new generation go to the trouble of viewing the original Jurassic Park, so that they can see what an utter load of rubbish this so called movie actually is. It seems the buck reigns supreme in Hollywood and any attempt to improve on the original just simply does not exist. They want your money, and quality or value is not a concern. By all means watch this rubbish, but please do yourself a favour, and watch the original as well, just so you can see how little interest Hollywood has in your enjoyment.

Furthermore I'm not familiar with Colin Trevorrow (the film's director) as I heard this is one of his first films to direct and it shows. The film had a mixture of good and bad parts. Some that take you back to what you loved about Jurassic Park. While others just make no absolute sense. However the good things that stand out are the dinosaurs. Meaning the film did it's job of giving us what we came for - and the dinos are the reason why this film is worth the price of admission. With that I was satisfied but where there is a good side there is a bad side as well. The bad almost out ways the good. First off all the human characters with the exception of Chris Pratt's character were so damn annoying and cartoony. It's been a while since I saw a group of characters I disliked. But there are the characters I disliked more then others. Those would be the children. Oh my goodness, these kids make me want to punch them in the face. You got the generic whinny brat and the know it all jerk. I prefer the kids from Jurassic Park over these any day. But I was however blown away by the end which I won't spoil but it made me feel like a kid again watching Jurassic Park. And it made watching the movie worth while. Now to grade it.

After 10 years of operation and visitor rates declining, in order to fulfill a corporate mandate, a new attraction is created to re-spark visitor's interest, which backfires horribly.'Jurassic World' is high on thrills & action. The intension between the humans & the dinosaurs, is engagingly mounted. Through the first-hour takes time to gather pace, it's the second-hour that truly blows your mind with excitement. The Special Effects & The Action-Sequences are simply outstanding. A special mention for the climax, which truly, left me overjoyed by all its power.Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Derek Connonlly & Colin Trevorrow's Screenplay is slightly slow initially, but it gathers tremendous momentum later-on.

Michael Giacchino's Score is exceptional. Performance-Wise: Chris Pratt is in good form, once again. He enacts the heroic part with the much needed energy & toughness. Bryce Dallas Howard is fantastic. Vincent D'Onofrio is alright. Irrfan Khan is first-rate. Ty Simpkins & Nick Robinson are sincere. Judy Geer is passable.

Of course, it doesn't stand up to the original, because there are still some flaws with character development, pacing and visuals, but on the whole this is a really fun and exciting movie with a good script and thrilling action sequences.Let's start with one of the biggest successes of this film, its atmosphere. Whilst The Lost World and Jurassic Park III treated Isla Nublar like a haunted house, this film restores some of the wonderment and awe that you felt at the beginning of the first movie, seeing it once again as a park where dinosaurs roam, making this a much more exciting film to witness at first, and leaving its transition into disaster all the more shocking than the previous two films.One of the most interesting things about this is also the fact that it's set in the functioning theme park, Jurassic World, that we all wanted to see since the original. It makes an interesting note on scientific experimenting and capitalism, something not done since the original, whilst the fact that the island is full of helpless tourists makes the threat of the dinosaurs all the more scary.And strangely, this is quite a scary film. Of course, it's nothing to give you nightmares, but the thing that really stands out from this whole movie is the excellent action sequences that are both exciting and destructive, but also tense and patient, much like the classic sequence in the car in the original Jurassic Park.Although the story takes a little bit of a while to get going and should definitely have been cut down, once everything begins to kick off, this turns into a properly exciting film, and it's that stunningly powerful tension in pockets throughout that makes it so, leaving you squirming in your seat as you fear the terrifying Indominus Rex.Let's talk about the dinosaurs, because they are, after all, the reason you want to watch this film. The CGI is fantastic, although I still don't think it's as exciting to look at as the practical effects in the original, but still, they do a great job of giving this dinosaurs a really strong presence on screen, and that main antagonist, the Indominus Rex, is really striking to watch.Finally, the characters are the only disappointing part of this movie. Whilst Chris Pratt does a fantastic job, as well as some of his co-stars, none of the characters are particularly interesting or appealing like some of those in the original, and it's that that decreases the fear factor to some degree.Overall, though, I'm giving this a 7, because it's a properly exciting action movie with patient teasing and powerful tension throughout, and despite some character issues, it's got a strong, intriguing premise that will make for a lot of fun for the duration.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Before you starting to throw rocks at me, here is the only reason why i think this movie is the best in the series (including the original) - simply because it is superbly entertaining.The first film had a groundbreaking special effects, and the first hour or so was amazing, but when the shix hit the fan, it wasn't so exciting anymore. I always believed the human characters were weak in the first movie, although actors and acting were very solid, somehow for me second part of the movie was simply boring. Yes. Second movie was the worst Steven Spielberg's movie yet, even Steven Spielberg have admit it. The third was OK, better then 2nd by a mile. That said, ""Jurassic World"" should have been the true sequel to the original. It is bigger, louder and more entertaining - everything that a good sequel must have. Special effects in here are truly special, i don't see any movie this year who could steal the best special effects Oscar from ""Jurassic World"" - they aren't groundbreaking, but they are truly spectacular. Acting was very cool, as well as cinematography and very solid directing. Now i kinda see why this guy will helm one of the new ""Star Wars"" movies, which about i was skeptical before seeing ""Jurassic World"". Overall, ""Jurassic World"" is a highly entertaining movie. Best of all is to see it with friends on the biggest screen possible, it is a helluva entrainment, not a perfect one, but the best from this franchise yet.","45 out of 82 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Highly Overrated, but Still a Very Fun Dinosaur Flick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3428765/?ref_=tt_urv","nmholland","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62906690/?ref_=tt_urv","9 March 2016","Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow and is the long awaited sequel to the Jurassic Park trilogy, especially after the bomb that was Jurassic Park III (2001). This movie takes place once the dinosaur theme park known as Jurassic World has been open and successful for some time now. However, people seem to be getting bored of dinosaurs recently (we'll talk about that later), so the park manager, a young woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), orders the genetic assembly of the most scary dinosaur ever seen, the Indominus Rex. Once this beast breaks loose upon the island, Claire, a raptor trainer named Owen Brady (Chris Pratt), and Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson) must try to defeat the dinosaur, while also trying to survive.This film is highly overrated. Coming out of the theater on June 12, the release day, I heard people saying it was ten times better than the first Jurassic Park (1993). Really? Better than one of the best movies ever made? I don't think so. However, that doesn't mean it's bad. This film is actually a very fun movie to watch. I enjoy it a bit more, in fact, each time I watch it. But it's not perfect.The best thing this film has to offer is the mix of special effects and dinosaur action. Every time a dinosaur got into a fight, whether it be with people or another dinosaur, look amazing. None of the special effects look fake at all. All shots of the Indominus Rex look very real, and never look even near bad. This even occurs towards the beginning, before any chaos is even happening . The action with dinosaurs is very abundant as well, and is directed very nicely. All action shots are very clean, and usually wide when CGI was in use.The worst thing this film has to offer is the subplots. One in particular is a certain character trying to militarize Owen Brady's raptors. Yes, there is a character wanting to make soldiers out of dinosaurs. This subplot is completely unnecessary and should've been wiped clean from the script. If this subplot didn't exist, the film would be much better. Another pretty useless subplot is background with the children. Not that the children are bad characters, but the back story with their parents and their home life could've been easily taken out of the film, and Jurassic World would've been better off.Chris Pratt. This man has truly proved himself as an amazing actor, after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and especially now after Jurassic World. There's been a lot of talk of Pratt portraying Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones 5, but I'm truly confident in him being this ever-so-loved character if that's the decision that is made. After the trailer hit, there's been a lot of talk about Bryce Dallas Howard, and whether or not she would do good in this movie. Well, she did. She was one of the highlights, equipped with a major character arc, and good on screen charisma. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson also did rather well, despite their characters not being all that interesting.This leads me into my next and final point, the characterization, especially of Zach and Gray, the two kids. Zach is the older brother of Gray, and actually has a pretty good arc within their relationship later on, but it takes a while for this to fully kick in, and that is a little frustrating. Their background, like mentioned before, is a useless subplot, and could've been removed altogether. However, both actors did pretty good, despite my expectations.Overall, Jurassic World was not perfect, and pretty overrated. However, it was very fun, thanks to Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances, great visual effects, and very cool action. Jurassic World deserves a B+, or an 8 out of 10.","19 out of 31 found this helpful.

The internet has brought the numerous plot-holes of the original film to the fore-front, but it still holds up. We can watch that movie and ignore the fact that this supposed hacker genius teenage girl isn't smart enough to not turn off a flash-light that's attracting the attention of an angry T-Rex. We can watch that movie and ignore the fact that Hammond spares no expense in everything, but hires one man to write all the code. We ignore these things because the special effects in that film, hold up to this day. The feeling of terror during the T-Rex reveal scene, still holds up. We forgive the fact that it's not a perfect film logically, because it's still a perfect film technically and emotionally.There's no way of topping the first film. Spielberg couldn't even do it himself with The Lost World, you just can't recapture that nostalgia, and to expect that much of THIS movie is pretty asinine...the best it can do is be it's own clever film that still respects the original.That being said, the film comes pretty dang close. It's probably the most entertaining Jurassic Park sequel thus far. It's not overly stupid like the third film, and not overly preachy and emotionless like the second film. Instead it's just kind of stuck in the middle. There are MANY of good things in this film, but SO MANY missed opportunities.The actors do a good job. Chris Pratt is pretty much just playing Chris Pratt. Vincent D'onfrio is a decent dumb bad-guy. The brothers get a few good scenes and prove to be somewhat capable actors. Surprisingly the best character is Bryce Dallas Howard, she's still a stereotypical character like the others. But at least she goes through some form of an emotional arc throughout the story. She's pretty much the Alan Grant of this film, the only character that changes during the movie. The other characters are pretty much just there to help that character to survive.The big missed opportunity with the film, is the special effects. They're god-awful. Apparently they used animatronics on set, but the entire film looks fake. All the dinosaurs look like CGI cartoons. I'm guessing they ""polished"" the animatronics to make it look more realistic....it didn't. It just looks like the actors are responding to air.So the film failed to be as technologically inventive as the original, but at least the film TRIED to be as emotionally effective. It's not just a bunch of disaster scenes with dinosaurs. It does actually stop and let the characters breath. The action doesn't even start till about half and hour into the film. Everything up to that point is letting the characters explore and showing off the park. Even when the action does start, there's still a rather sad scene with Claire and Owen and a Brontosaurus. But that's not to say there isn't a ton of cool scenes with the Dinosaurs. It does actually try to show-off the coolness of the dinosaurs. The scenes with the Mosasurus is cool, the Pteranodon attack is a blast, and the climatic battle is AMAZING!!! Such a thrill!!! I walked out of the film, satisfied. The special effects are garbage compared to the original. But the actors all do a good job with their stereotypical characters (The original had it's fair share of stereotypes), one of the characters does go through an emotional arc, it's about as logical as the original was, and the film does actually stop and breath and show off the real stars of the show, the dinosaurs.It's okay.7 out of 10","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

As a kid, I would spend hours in the library reading about them and their awesome size and power. I loved the original movie, and I thought its sequel, ""Lost World"" was even better. If you have any respect for those films, do not give up your money to see this movie. First off, it is riddled with extremely ostentatious product placement. The movie opens with a close up of beats by dre. No, seriously. There is a kid with beats on in the middle of the screen for at least 2 minutes. Later in the movie, the heroine is driving an armored truck. What is on the front of said truck? A GIANT Mercedes logo. And those are only two of the many ads in the film. The other major problem is that zero effort was put into writing. Clumsy homages and continuity errors riddle this film. Basically, it bears the name ""Jurassic Park"", but it has the writing of ""Dinoshark"". Bottom line: It's rare that a movie makes me angry, but this one did. (This is coming from a guy that has watched the entirety of ""Titanic 2""). If this film were a standalone, it might be a 4, but such poor execution on a long awaited and greatly anticipated franchise is unacceptable. This movie is thoughtless, eye candy garbage, and its success is setting up equally terrible films for the future. So do yourself a favor. When your friends tell you how great this movie is, nod politely, change the subject, go home, warm up some popcorn, gather up the family, and watch the original or sequel instead. You'll be glad you did.","273 out of 551 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Its time to go back to the island","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3259708/?ref_=tt_urv","olivercation","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53732188/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2015","Colin Trevorrow helms the newest installment of the prehistoric thrillride started with Jurassic Park in 1993 as we are introduced to a theme park fully functioning on Isla Nublar with reanimated dinosaurs, corporate sponsorship and golf courses. After the comparative disappointment of the previous sequels there may be some trepidation with Jurassic World, but the formula presented is more than effective and really propels the canon rather than pushing it towards extinction. Jurassic World has been open for a decade, the initial failure of Jurassic Park has been forgotten as a wealthy investor Simon Mansari takes over the vision of John Hammond and now has dozens of dinosaurs living in harmony with petting zoos, Sea World style aquatic displays and a very special aviary. But in the face of audience apathy, a new hybrid dinosaur is in development while we see some military interest also threatening to derail the happy harmony of the island theme park. There for the ride are some young brothers on holidays. The overworked operations manager of the island facing declining numbers and balancing ethics with excitement. And finally Owen Grady, a trainer at the park living close with the dinosaurs and concerned about the direction management is looking to take. We already know what's going to go down but ill let that unfold on the screen for you in a very satisfying way.Trevorrow with Spielberg's notes and assistance has created the film that most Jurassic Park fans always envisioned, the successful realization of the theme park that was intended in the original. The detail is incredible. From a Margaritaville and Samsung sponsorship (and product placement) to the laconic employees and administrative back alleys, the creative team have obviously spent a lot of time in theme parks and put to film a world i had to remind myself did not actually exist a few times. Further than that we get shot recreations from the first film, but this time teeming with tourists and then later in the movie some scaring imagery. Jurassic World is a visual smorgasboard and a film worth watching on the largest screen possible. The characterization of the leads in Chris Pratt's Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire are spot on, we are given enough chemistry to keep the plot rolling, their gender balance is constantly at play (with the talk surrounding Mad Max it is likely to be a talking point) as Pratt and Howard take turns supporting each other and while Pratt is held as a compassionate warrior, there is no doubt Howard can do what is required. The only gender stereotype upheld is the oft used trope of a successful business woman in her mid 30's being pressured into a traditional family role by overbearing family or societal concerns. I noticed nobody suggested Pratt needed to settle down, but i digress to a minor cinematic familiarity at this point. The supporting cast is competent, Vincent D'Onofrio is a two dimensional villain, his motives clear from his appearance alone. Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus as tech heads play off each other well and BD Wong, Judy Greer and others round out the numbers as needed. The child stars of the film Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are just passable in their co lead performances. For the first two acts of the film, their wooden acting is a distraction and it is only in the third act where their interplay comes to the fore and are enjoyable. Obviously the youth is used to add tension and a wide eyed wonder to the world, but at some point kids in peril need to be able to act for me to not want them eaten at the first sight of danger. The dinosaurs are the stars of the show here as always. With the expanded theme park we are given glimpses of a wide variety of beast as well as the returning favorites in the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and more. We are shown baby domesticated Apatosaurus being ridden in a petting zoo, a gargantuan Plesiosaur jumping for sharks like a dolphin at Seaworld and more which would lead us to believe domestication after a decade is the goal. Obviously this isn't the case and even Owen's attempted to coerce the Velociraptor are seen as him still at their mercy despite their bond. The Carnivores are again the villainous focus of the piece, the brutal hybrid Indominus Rex the most savage dinosaur in the franchise yet, cunning and modified to suit its surroundings. The fate of the island is largely uncertain as the movie goes on and this is due to the Indominus Rex's seeming invincibility and cunning. As more dinosaurs are introduced they run the risk of emasculating the image of some for the benefit of others, but a nice balance was played here as each dinosaurs defining skill was broadcast. It is interesting to see if potential future franchise films will be able to top this offering or will have to offer vastly new creations and settings. Jurassic World is an amazingly fun film, I was captivated for the entirely and it was able to provide fear, anticipation, laughs and jaw dropping imagery throughout. I wish Jurassic World was a real thing, as I would enjoy interacting with some Herbivores, but alas, we see the perils of caging such large beasts. Trying to recreate the park wasn't a great idea for the poor tourists who ventured there but making a movie and continuing this monster movie defining franchise was a very good idea indeed. If Godzilla left you underwhelmed and films like Sharknado are just too lowbrow, this is the perfect mid ground of story and visual spectacle that will have you churning through popcorn. A true blockbuster.","52 out of 97 found this helpful.

The problem that this movie suffers from that the originally didn't, is that we have seen this type of movie already and not just from Dinosaurs anymore but also from Alien-Machines that turn into Cars, Mutants and let's not forget about every disaster movie that has happened since the first Jurassic Park up until the time of this Jurassic World sequel. Is it bad? No, it's not a ""bad"" movie, he has the same feel and pacing as the first and it doesn't try to be innovative at all really but as it stands people (us) are just not entertained by this genre of man vs. nature anymore and because of that the overall feel of this movie will not be as ""awe-inspiring"". It's still that franchise that can entertain the family though and does it without having to go complete Disney/Pixar.

I don't want to jump to hasty conclusions, the movie was good, above good, and it has some mesmerizing very well-made sequences and amazing action, but it lacked something... a spirit maybe.Yes, its very heavy on the nostalgia, and yes there are moments that will bring tears to your eyes if you are a die-hard fan, also it's full of Easter eggs, but the awe and wonder were not enough. Some said that Jurassic World is the best sequel since the original, maybe it tops ""The Lost world"" at some parts, but The Lost World has more strength points over it. If you are expecting it to be more then a generic creature film, I think then it is not the one for you.I actually don't know how to feel, and the funny thing is that all the issues I worried about, turned out to be the best stuff in the movie. The I. rex, the semi-friendly raptors, the Apatasaurus head. They even threw a line that explains the scientific inaccuracies in the dinosaurs, now everything is acceptable within the universe. On the other hand, the story had its corny parts, and It lacked depth, there wasn't any kind of scientific debate as to the first 2 movies, nothing at all.The CGI was beyond awesome, settle down all your fears, It's perfect, and works very well on the big screen. Only a couple of moments you may feel that it's a little off. The T. rex, oddly and unfortunately, she was the least impressive CGI in the movie, along with the Ankylosaurus.The animatronic shot was brilliant, I wonder why they didn't use more animatronics, as from what I've seen they seem to have improved vastly over the years. There were many close-ups here, especially for the Raptors, that animatronics would have worked perfectly for, but they didn't go with that option.It will take more than one viewing to really see everything in this imagined little world they have created. The park is open, and yes, the park is awesome, but I think it will take some consideration to fully endorse it.Maybe the long wait raised my expectations up to the sky, maybe this is why I'm a little disappointed... but the one thing I'm sure of, It's that Jurassic World doesn't get anywhere near to the level of Spielberg's original... long live Jurassic Park.","244 out of 492 found this helpful.

If you just want to veg out and see a few man vs dinosaur battles this may fit the bill as well. Certainly Jurassic is watchable, and as usual it explores the possible societal relationships and methods of the dinos in an interesting way.

It may not have best best script in the world, but I still had a lot of fun watching it. I don't think it's as good as Jurassic park, but it is a big improvement over Jurassic Park III. It is certainly a must watch.For the curious: Visually, this movie is a massive improvement over Jurassic Park III, in term of CGI, which looks incredible, whether it be the dinosaurs or the environments. Sure a little bit of it looks meh at best, but for most part, the computer generated imagery works well. Colin Trevorrow is also great at the direction, creating lots of tension and suspense to the incredible action sequences, which are also backed up by great set designs. I don't want to spoil the nal ght scene for those who have yet to see the movie, but it is honestly my favorite action scene of the entire series so far, not just because it looks awesome, but it is just so creative, with what they did in that scene.The story line though was completely predictable and few characters like the two brothers show a weak bond towards the main storyline of the movie. Imran Khan had his versatile contribution to the movie. This pretty much sums up the characters in the movie along with the hero and heroine.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It took the dinosaur experience to a whole new level. Inside Jurassic World gave a much closer look to a variety of dinosaurs. It incorporated new innovative techniques such as hologram technology to provide a closer experience in the museums.The velociraptors were ferocious in their usual way. But they came with a twist. Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt, was a trainer for the velociraptors. He was able to establish a disciplined relationship with the velociraptors as humans do with dogs. There were a select few commands that Grady was able to teach the velociraptors and receive the desired action. Vic Hoskins, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, wanted to capitalize on this opportunity and militarize the velociraptors. That move was totally uncalled for and took away from the Jurassic Park experience.The Indominus Rex was not anything out of the vernacular.

This sequel is a direct plot,straight to the point.To thrill audiens. 2. I love the idea about the hybrid new dino, Indominus Rex which is more clever,more vicious,cam climb a wall,even can change it's skin colors like a chameleon (invisible),so this dino is really lethal.B)What i don't like about this sequel? Actually 1 minor thing. How the hack can you run with your high heels on with a T-Rex behind you. That's what really annoys me.The idea that human finally can take limited control of some raptors is a bit too much,cause scientifically,it tooks minimum 4 generation of human to finally can take limited control on some beast like cheetah. But i can take that.C)The story?A cliché.A holiday turns to be screaming day.But generally,this sequel is really thrilling.When this movie ends, i still keep thinking what kinda new dino will be introduce to us.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The plot was a series of bad out- of-character choices seemingly only made to drive this movie from one cool visual to the next. Pornos have more compelling plot lines and character development. Everyone involved in the script should never get work again. Everyone involved in performing in it was clearly doing it for the cash.","104 out of 201 found this helpful.

Is it as good as the original? Definitely not; however, it will send you on a nostalgia trip and put a smile on your face. Full of great action sequences and a ton of dinosaurs, both new and old, I'd highly recommend this film! The one con or slight downfall, if you consider it a downfall at all, is the lack of practical effects. Being young and very reminiscent of the original I just felt it lacked something. Although I must say a lot of the computer graphics were used great and helped create this fantasy world, it seemed to lack something and just wasn't the same as having something physically in front of the camera interacting with the actors. This is a small ""fanboy"" gripe if you want to call it that, and for younger audiences CGI has become the norm so overall I will finish by saying definitely check this one out!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Every situation the characters are in is due to their stupidity or the stupidity of someone else. Remember in JURASSIC PARK​ when there were smart people who found themselves in an extraordinary situation beyond their control? Nevertheless, the fact that there were many moments where I either gasped in awe or terror is a testament to how freaking awesome dinosaurs are and how much we've missed seeing them in almost 15 years. The nostalgia is strong with this one, although some callbacks to the original film feel obvious and cloying.However, the climax is pretty damn wonderful. It's the one thing I can safely say made me feel like a kid again. Additionally, Chris Pratt is great (no surprise there). He's the best actor in here, but it's too bad the supporting characters are either expendable or aren't developed enough. Oh, well.... JURASSIC WORLD ain't no JURASSIC PARK. The CGI is apparent, and there aren't a lot of practical effects (I can count only one scene). It's a film for a modern audience, and I'm not saying that to be cynical. There's literally a scene where Bryce Dallas Howard's character says that outright. Overall, it's a dumb, fun movie for the most part. Just leave your brain at the door because you won't be using it. You'll regret it if you do.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Universal Pictures plans for a fourth instalment was on hold for many years until Jurassic World was released to record breaking box office.Here we have billionaire Industrialist Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan) running Jurassic World along the lines of John Hammond's legacy. To bring back dinosaurs to life in a safe environment and visitors to enjoy themselves. However to keep visitor numbers up the park needs to innovate bigger, newer and cooler creatures.Dr Wu (B D Wong who presumably did not get eaten in the first Jurassic Park) returns as a more sinister scientist who has mixed and cooked up new DNA to create Indominus Rex, a dinosaur who is big, cunning and has some kind of superpowers. I can only think that Dr Wu got hold of some Predator DNA from a passing Arnold Schwarzenegger. How the creature escapes from her pen is reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs in the way she fooled her keepers.Bryce Dallas Howard is workaholic executive Claire making sure the park runs efficiently and at a profit. She does not even have time to spare for her two nephews who are visiting the park and staying over with her for a few days.When the IR goes loose in the park its up to Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire armed with high heels to come to the rescue of the kids in peril and the park in general. Owen we presume is a sometimes boyfriend of Claire, A navy seal and dinosaur trainer as he seems to have trained Velociraptors like trained dogs. The same Raptors we have been told in earlier films were ruthless, cunning and effective killing creatures. Now they follow orders leading to a ludicrous side plot of having some independent defence contractor hatching a plan to train Raptors for military use in third world countries.I think Universal is confident that this film will not play in Afghanistan given a region of that country is specifically named in and where its people (already ravaged since 1979 by various wars) would be eaten by the said dinosaurs. I will take this opportunity to remind people I used to gain a dubious pleasure in watching Universal movies specifically to see how long would it be before the black guy died. In fact in the first Jurassic Park, Samuel Jackson did not last long!Now the film is an enjoyable ride, finally we have a functioning theme park with dinosaurs and those scenes look great because part of the movie was actually filmed in a disused theme park. The CGI dinosaurs look good but its noticeable some of the climactic scenes were set in the dark.Directed by relatively newbie Colin Trevorrow who has only previously made one notable indie film directs in an efficient manner but without any of the Spielberg flair (nothing like kids climbing over a fence to escape the dinosaurs but unbeknown to them, the electricity is coming back on.) Marvel Films have shown that these days almost any competent director can shoot a blockbuster action film, after all even that Shakespearean legend Kenneth Branagh has directed a blockbuster superhero film.There is a big problem with the screenplay. Its purely a functional plot lacking in any imagination. It gets to it destination in almost robotic manner. There is hardly any characterisation we know nothing about our heroes except what we can gather from a few broad strokes. Compare this with how we get to know Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough's characters in Jurassic Park, even some of the minor characters were well drawn like Wayne Knight. Here zilch, they are merely to function as heroes or dinosaur fodder.Apart from the preposterous plot about training Raptors for military purposes the whole IR going loose story is based on people entering its pen before determining from its implanted tracker device where the hell she is in the first place.I think Universal is pleased that such a slipshod script has turned out to be a monster hit.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

There are no philosophical questions here about nature and playing with DNA. No lesson about how not to force evolution. This is a summer blockbuster and that's about it.It contains action, comedy, mystery, a few good laughs and a few ""I wonder what is going to happen next"" moments.I haven't seen the other Jurassic Park movies (except the original and the 3D release) but if you want an enjoyable movie which is not too deep nor that revolutionary, but well executed, watch it. I just wish that in the next sequel they'll move away from the formula. It would be interesting to see how dinosaurs escape on the mainland, not on the island. For better or for worse, there isn't a lot of tension knowing that they can simply bombard the entire island and get it over with.However, again, this is no Citizen Kane.

The visuals are stunning, it has more humor & isn't as dark as Godzilla. This maybe can be because Jurassic movies tend to target a normal movie goer who doesn't want to think of the complex universe of Marvel or DC with their superheroes. This makes it easy for any one to follow up on the story with a clear mind unlike how we keep creating alternate scenes in our heads when watching something like Avengers (or its just me).

It's legendary. Though it was followed by two lackluster sequels, The Lost World and Jurassic Park III, they did not take away the magic of the original film. Now, after 14 years, we have a fourth installment.Jurassic World begins by giving us something the other films never did, a fully functioning park filled with visitors from all over the world. Also, unlike the first two sequels, our expectations are brought to an all-new low within the first act thanks to concepts that threaten to spoil what made the first film so iconic. Jurassic Park did for velociraptors what Jaws did for sharks. Both are forces of nature that should never be tamed or trained. Chris Pratt plays a rugged raptor trainer. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the woman in-charge of running the park. Her two nephews, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, are two of many visitors on the day the events of the film unfold. We are also introduced to two villains, Vincent D'Onofrio, who wants to train velociraptors to be soldiers, and a hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex.A hybrid dinosaur and training raptors to be used as weapons for war - it all sounds pretty dumb and it is. As all of this ridiculousness plays out, the original theme music that would play to help build up the most wondrous parts of the first film is over-used and in all the wrong places. Even worse, after the film moves into it's second act and the action has begun, we are forced back to ride along with the boys, who the screenwriters seem desperate to make us care about with an out-of-place conversation about their parents getting a divorce. It's almost as if Jurassic World sets itself up to disappoint, putting the bar so low in it's first hour that it can only be raised in it's second. If this is the trick Colin Trevorrow is trying to pull on us, he is very successful at it.Jurassic World is a complete failure at being smart and frightening. With all the advanced technology and far-fetched concepts, it's hard to feel any sense of reality or familiarity, two essential ingredients in making us feel as if we are in the character's shoes. There are moments where the filmmakers try to startle us but these attempts at jump-scares are so obvious and poorly executed, they fail. What Jurassic World succeeds at is destroying it's own creations. It's only when the character's lives are in danger that they finally come alive and prove their worth. In the end, Bryce Dallas Howard becomes as bad ass as Chris Pratt.Everything new Jurassic World introduces us to twists back on itself and lets us know that we were right all along, they were all bad ideas. A big part of what made us love that first film so much is brought back in the most exciting of ways. The climax is what we've always wanted out of a Jurassic Park sequel. It's dumb but it's also as exciting and fun as blockbusters get these days. It has the potential to make you feel like a kid again, even if just for a few minutes. But, you have to be willing to let it.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

We've seen these dinosaurs attack humans and other dinosaurs before. The new one, a genetically engineered killing machine that has parts of other dinosaurs, is no more remarkable than its predecessors. I didn't see it doing anything more intellectual than any other dinosaur. Once again, the cheap use of vulnerable children is at the center of things. They have been sent to be with their aunt who is a big shot in the Jurassic Park business. She is self centered and insensitive, even when her orders lead to carnage. Vincent D'Onofrio is the heavy, although there are enough of those to go around. Chris Pratt is the take charge guy who has learned to bond with velociraptors. The kids, of course, pay no attention to orders given, and get themselves into a life or death situation. Now everyone has to try to save them. Of course, there is a huge dose of intensity as things go from bad to worse. The two leads who have virtually no personality begin to bond from a caustic first encounter. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's just the same old stuff. There is nothing new here. The other thing. What about all the people who have been killed or maimed? Do our heroes really care? If you want to consider the real world, imagine the lawsuits and medical claims from gross negligence. Not to mention charges of manslaughter. And our red headed heroine would be hung out to dry. Finally, we do need a better, more creative story other than people being assaulted time after time by creatures fifty times their size and somehow managing to get away.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

It's just there and the joy of the movie is in the eye of the beholder. Let me explain: As a monster movie (comparing to King Kong, Godzilla,...) this movie actually looks great and is well worth your time. The action's there, the chemistry between the characters is there, you got a nasty looking Frankenstein of a dinosaur, the scenery is breathtaking and Chris Pratt does more than a decent acting job.However, if you're looking for a good story that makes sense and equals the magic of the original film, them i am afraid that this movie won't float your boat. There are just too many flaws in the story plot and many ridiculous script choices, like for example turning the Velociraptor into pets. And yes it does sound as silly as ""Alien: Resurrecttion"" where they want to turn one of the most feared monsters in human history into a trained pet that obeys commands like a good dog... No matter how they explain it in the movie (with mutual respect for each other), it's still a silly plot choice in the script. Not to mention a genetically modified dinosaur that hunts for sport instead of food, Predator flash-back anyone?

I'm guessing that most anyone who enjoys movies and is at least 30 years old, has vivid recollections of Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park from1993. The iconic theme from John Williams, that initial awe-inspiring look at the dinosaurs grazing in the valley, the reminder that ""objects are closer than they appear"" in side mirrors, and the late Sir Richard Attenborough stating that he ""spared no expense"" in creating the park  all merged to became part of an incredibly moving and huge new movie theatre experience. This latest (and fourth in the franchise) offers us ""big"", but very little ""new"", and unfortunately nothing very ""moving"" in its presentation.Set two decades after the tragic and messy park trial run of that original movie, we find Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help) managing the financially-challenged theme park owned by Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi). Chris Pratt is training Velociraptors, while BD Wong is cooking up hybrid and genetically modified monsters such as Indominus Rex – designed to excite the audiences who have become bored with an old-fashioned T-Rex.Even though this is technically a sequel, there are numerous similarities to the original film, and a fun parlor game consists of spotting all the homage's and tributes sprinkled throughout. Two of my favorites are the ""Winston's"" shop in the park, and the ViewMaster shot early on. These two are tips of the cap to Stan Winston and Ray Harryhausen  two giants in the world of special effects.In what has become the Hollywood ""go to"" for evil-doers, the secret plan to militarize the dinosaurs is being carried out by Vincent D'Onofrio. Of course, this clashes with Pratt's ideal life for ""his"" trainees. The mandatory kids-in-peril are played by Ty Simpkins (Insidious) and Nick Robinson. Much has been made of the absurdity of Ms. Howard's numerous scenes of sprinting in high heels, and I found her overall demeanor to be every bit as exaggerated and unbelievable as her actions in heels. Jake Johnson (TV's ""New Girl) and Omar Sy (so wonderful in The Intouchables) were the most ""real"" characters, though neither was given much to do.Much of what is written here is ""in comparison"" to the original. While this may not be fair, it is inescapable when dealing with such a respected and iconic film. Youngsters unfamiliar with the original film, are likely to find this one exciting – even terrifying at times – and that's an important distinction to make. The Mosasaurus alone is worth the price of admission  and good for a few nightmares! And who among us wouldn't pay up for a Baby Triceratops ride in the Petting Zoo? For the Jurassic Park stalwarts, the inconsistent (sometimes great, sometimes fake-looking) CGI will be as tough to overlook as Ms. Howard's cartoon character. And yes, composer Michael Giacchino is new to the Jurassic series, and he is wise enough to work in the terrific and familiar John Williams theme in more than one scene. However, none of the downsides will keep the true fans away, and there is an entire generation of kids who should have the chance to marvel at lifelike dinosaurs on the big screen courtesy of director Colin Trevorrow (previously known for his work on the indie gem Safety Not Guaranteed).","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Forget about all these reviewers that thumb their nose due to a ""lack of character development"" or that they needed more ""story"". Those lines are so overused and rarely ever applied correctly. Sometimes I read reviews and I'm not sure if I actually saw the same movie.I refuse to give away any of the movie. You should stop reading about Jurassic World and just go see it.

However, it fails to execute quite a few favourable ideas that, were they tackled by a filmmaker dazzled not by visual effects or money but by story and character, may have proved Oscar-worthy. Should you see this film? I'll list some pros and cons to help further your decision:Pros: Thrills and excitement typical of the average Hollywood blockbuster. Nostalgia that most Jurassic Park fans might embrace. Satisfactory storyline with satisfactory characters to fulfill it. Visually stunning locations that introduce a sense of wonderCons: Repetitive.

I had fun watching the film. I felt that it lead into a possible sequel very well and very unintentionally. The designs of everything in the film were top notch. I haven't seen a better film than this in a long while (definitely since before 2015). I think Colin did right in having the film delayed. The story was better than it could've been if it had been lie that Jonlo leak from last year. I was so amazed that I was stuck in my chair until the end of the end credits. If you get the chance, go see it in 3D/ This film really made my day. I can't wait for Jurassic World II. 10/10 rating.","58 out of 115 found this helpful.

Now the question is was it that good?When all the previous Jurassic Park movies had almost the same theme and story line this movie gave the theme a new touch. Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (screenplay writers) succeed in intelligently surprising the audience at many scenes.I am here giving you a briefing about the plot (for the viewers who have not watched the previous movies): 22 years after failure of the first dinosaur theme park by John Hammond now the park was rebuild and is well functioning until a new attraction gets out of control and becomes a threat.Apart from the story the roles portrayed by all the cast members was appreciable. But this movie was mostly about the 3-D effects and the more than awesome animation. The story also was well connected and makes the viewer involved for the whole 124 minutes.The only disappointment that I had was it didn't create a lot of thrill that was being expected from the movie or the thrill that could be experienced in the previous movies.So if you are expecting it to be scary and lot thrilling please lower your hopes because this is action packed adventurous film that features dinosaurs.I would say this is a really enjoyable movie with a lot of surprises. Go and watch it.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

I know, most of us were somewhat skeptical about another 4th franchise movie since **ahum** Indiana Jones **ahum** which I refuse to acknowledge exists. But anyway, I also had my reservations and was not really excited for this. But I went anyway without any expectations really.The good:Chris Pratt... I mean obviously. I'd almost watch it again just for him. He's definitely on the right track with his role choices and I hope to see more of him. Great mix of fun and action. Could be the next John Mclane or Indy if he wanted to. Jurassic Park memories. The beginning of the movie, where everything is just fine, you really get thrown back into the whole hype of dinosaurs. It's not on the same level as the actual Jurassic Park era but the soundtrack helps a lot. Still one of my faves.Special effects. OMG, it just all looks so realistic. Very impressed and not too much as would be very ease to go overboard with this.The bad: Story. Bad is not really the best word for it, it's rather safe than bad. If you haven't seen the movie yet but think about what the storyline will be, 9 out of 10 you'll be right. So nothing really out of the ordinary happens, although there are a few WTF moments for sure.Open ended... You all saw this coming right... you have to leave room for sequels if this one makes some dough. And it sickens me... but hey, chewing out sequels just for money is what Transformers are all about so. So yeah, I'm glad I saw it and it's a fun, somewhat brainless, action family movie.

This film is a mix of things, part Spielberg movie, part monster movie and part brainless summer popcorn flick.Let's start off as I usually do with the plot. Let's be honest, the first film had a lot subplots that went nowhere like the sick triceratops, the lysine contingency, the dinosaurs breeding and especially the stolen embryos. Sorry Spielberg fans.Here there is simple albeit a very cohesive plot. The park is now operational for many years but attendance is dwindling so they engineer a hybrid. The hybrid gets loose and chaos ensues. It does get silly however, especially in the third act with the velociraptors.So yeah, lets talk about the dinosaurs. From a technical standpoint, the CGI it....sucks. The first two films had such gorgeous digital dinosaurs because the animators used a lot of computing power to produce altogether 4 minutes of shots. They got the lighting and the physics right and they were only used in wide shots. In this film they are ugly, pasty, floaty and cartoonish looking things. Also they seem to behave more like movie monsters than animals. The velociraptors are supposed to be intelligent, I get that, but its supposed to be in the sense of opening doors and cornering their prey and not in the sense of communicating with Chris Pratt and what happens in the third act.Then the human characters. They are all very one dimensional. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard's character, no one else seems to have a story arc, again something the first film did really well. Chris Pratt is basically Muldoon but he just espouses Legolas like commentary like 'she's killing for sport' which is very insulting to the audience's intelligence. Bryce Dallas Howard is this uptight corporate person who wears high heels throughout the entire movie, even during chases scenes. Vincent D'Onofrio is this military industrial complex guy who wants to weaponize dinosaurs- yeah you read that right. BD Wong who had one scene in the first film returned for a much more expanded role here.Then we have the two kid actors who are supposed to be Lex and Tim. And oh god I hated them. This was one of the more futile attempts to make the film more Spielberg-ish and no, let Steve handle child actors from now on. Among all this silliness though there are unusual flashes of brilliance. What am I talking about? I actually saw some of the themes, motifs and imagery of Michael Crichton's original novel. The original novel went at great lengths to describe unstable systems and chaos theory which sadly the original film just glossed through. In the novel the park was said to be an unstable complex system doomed to fail by Ian Malcolm, then Nedry shuts off the power. In the film it shows Nedry being more or less responsible. In this film its actually more subtle when we hear the guy from Let's Be Cops hint at it and we see the Indominus Rex destabilize the park.Also the death scenes are very akin to Crichton's book. For a PG-13 film there is a lot of blood spatter. However there was this one death that was in very poor taste and I felt should've weighed in on the characters a bit more but no. And that's what I meant when I said this more or less is a brainless film.I still think the movie is pretty silly overall but whenever it goes away from being a Spielberg wannabe and a Michael Bay film, it actually has its moments. It will never be as good as the first film, hell even the second which I actually liked but it more than surpasses JP3 as it does manage to capture the theme of Man vs Nature again pretty well.","9 out of 31 found this helpful.

The dino fights were ecstatic and the thrill of the film was right up there. Where it fails, is the complete stupidity of the characters. However, knowing this going in makes the film a little more tolerable and less frustrating. A good film. Not like the original, but an exciting film.

How creepy it was? And original? Okay this doesn't totally match up to the first, but it comes very close. We're familiar with the big beasties but Jurassic World goes one step further and makes humans interact with them. Enter, the rather delectable Chris Pratt as the Raptor Whisperer who - of course - tries to save the day. Possibly more interesting than the earlier films in the series, as it's got more sensible behavioral ecology/science and quite interesting thoughts on the environment and our responsibility in it. Pratt is believable and controlling. He owns the screen. He has good chemistry with the animals (okay they're CGI so that's a bit of a stretch) and co-stars. D'onofrio and Dallas-Howard were worthy of the film and the entire cast did very well - especially the child stars. It didn't have the fear-factor and visceral tension of the first film - nothing will beat Ariana Richards' screaming - and I was a little disappointed not to see Jeff Goldblum as a cameo - but it took the franchise to a whole new level. Amazing SFX - the animals were beautiful. Really enjoyed the film, super-entertaining and a good evening out at the cinema.

Are we suffering from nostalgia here? I think you're remembering these movies in a better light than they actually were. Let's keep in mind that the Jurassic Park franchise was brand spanking new with unbelievable special effects two decades ago; lifelike special effects don't wow like they used to- they're commonplace. Moreover, in the first trilogy the forward motion of the plots/events was almost entirely predicated at every point by someone doing the most moronic thing you could think of for the given situation. That is where the suspense and drama came from in the earlier movies... COMPLETELY by the characters being morons who got themselves in to danger, where otherwise any even modestly intelligent human would not, and narrowly escaping.Jurassic World manages to move the plot without making the audience yell at the characters' for their incomprehensible stupidity. It also continues most of the themes from the previous movies. As well as being an amalgam of story arcs from all the previous movies, without losing the entertainment.","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

The only problem I had with this was that the story felt like a modern copy of the original Jurassic Park, there are plot holes, and the first half was clichéd, but it was still fun and worth watching. But the characters weren't really amusing or worth remembering except for Owen, who is easily the best one. The other sequels, the lost world and Jurassic park 3 have barely any connection with this and they were pointless. Like if you watch the first Jurassic park and then watch this, you wouldn't miss any plot points. The special effects are great like other modern day. films by the way as well.

Barry (Omar Sy) In any other context, communication is the cornerstone of prosperity and progress, for humans anyway. But when the dinosaurs in Jurassic World are accused of communicating, it is a formula for mayhem. Control is the operative metaphor in that world, and as we're reminded more than once, complete control doesn't exist, most of all when you're playing in Mother Nature's backyard.And so another summer comes with blockbusters pandering to our primal fears of death, for surely this fourth iteration of Jurassic Park (22 years—a millennium of evolution in Hollywood terms) is a child of the others, about survival for humans and animals. The real enemy is not even our brutal inclinations but rather the corporate expansionism that promotes aggression leading to mayhem. As scientist Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), who has lost his humanity, says to a corporate financier (Irrfan Khan), ""You wanted scarier."" The actual word in his memo,we are reminded, was ""cooler."" Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) says, ""Every time we unveiled a new attraction, attendance has spiked."" Ain't that the truth for these summer scare-a-thons as well? Claire, a career park manager, in her perpetual high heels and self-absorbed ambition embodies the dangers of insensitivity driven by selfishness.Jurassic World makes fun of itself promoting even more exotic summer fare that begins with creating a fiercer tyrannosaurus to meet the excessive expectations of a growingly literate summer audience. ""Bigger, louder, more teeth"" is the corporate mandate.Even with the multiple incidences of obvious green-screen shots and hokey setups, Jurassic World remains steadfastly respectful of Steven Spielberg's—he's exec producer here—plan since Jaws: Let the monster bond the families, who together face the ultimate fate and are better for the scare. The attack of the pterodactyls on the visitors reminds us how much Spielberg adores movies like Hitchcock's Birds.The less we see of the creatures, the more suspense we get. While we see more of raptors and rexes than Spielberg's minimalism allowed decades ago, director Colin Trevorrow keeps the emphasis on the evolution of the familial and social bonding rather than raw rapaciousness.""I can't wait to tell my mom about this!"" Gray (Ty Simpkins). The boy's exclamation at seeing an enhanced T-Rex pretty much sums up my feelings about this garden variety summer blockbuster. Regardless how many CGI monsters we see, bringing back Steven Spielberg's nightmares, be they Jaws or Jurassic, appeals to the wonder of kids and the kid buried in our jaded adult hearts. Survival is still the name of the ancient game.""What do you want?"" Claire asks donors-to-be. To the response, ""We want to be thrilled,"" she says, ""Don't we all."" We get it delightfully in Jurassic World, summer, 2015, a long 65 million years after the dinos but alive on our screens.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

If you have a kid definitely let them see this movie as they will be completely enRAPTORed (sorry). I can definitely see that.As an adult you may have a different opinion. It starts like a TV movie with parents sending their kids off to the Jurrassic World errm park.One of the kids is inexplicably completely bored with the idea of seeing any dinosaurs...it's like wise up, they've only been extinct for millions of years.The CGI looks a lot better in the dark than in the light, but this is true for any current movie.The characters are all lacking the emotional depth and humour that made the first film so endearing. Chris Pratt is fine but basically just plays an obnoxious loudmouth with little likability. Bryce Dallas Howard's character is so under-developed - I swear her script probably ran for less than a page and all it said was 'Sigh' here and 'Gasp' there. The two boys are fine, if not a bit annoying.What, incredibly, is something that is completely lacking is that there are no moments of tension or anticipation AT ALL. If you think about the original when the ripples in the water gave the sense of foreboding doom and how much this added to the whole atmosphere of the film it's unbelievable there's absolutely nothing like this in this film.Some of the homages to the original are good but all in all I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Perhaps nostalgia has elevated my expectations and rendered any continuance of the series inferior. Having said this, a praiseworthy translation of a follow-up movie I believe is achievable. To date we have not witnessed characters who inspired as much empathy as the combination of the original cast and I feel that no amount of SGI can fill that void. Despite the above, the SGI is outstanding at every turn and offers some distraction from the aforementioned negatives. I would urge any curious individuals to watch this film purely to be visually astonished. However, if you're a fan of the original then I would advise lowering expectation in regards to being drawn into an emotionally journey.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat.""We finally get to go back to Isla Nublar after all these years (22 to be exact). It is a given that creating the same feel and magic of Jurassic Park is impossible. SO instead of just trying to recreate everything and doing it in a lesser way, director Colin Trevorrow went with a different approach and it actually payed off. Jurassic World takes place 22 years after the events of the original film. A new park after the events of the original film, on the same place, was opened and has been functioning for 10 years. They create a hybrid dinosaur as a new attraction but everything goes to hell when it gets loose. Now, I had somewhat low expectations going into the movie and while it wasn't as good as the original, nor did it had its magic and feeling (obviously), it turned out to be a whole another entertaining ride. The movie did a good enough job of paying homage to the original. Couple of scenes had the awesome John William's original score and they just had this very nostalgic and awesome feeling to it. I just wished they used more of it, and some of it in a better way. Chris Pratt was great as the lead. This guy just has a natural charisma about him and the character he played was likable and badass. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard character as well. She seemed like a typical corporate emotionless being at first but actually developed into something likable. Another thing that was surprising was that the KIDS DID NOT ANNOY ME. Something that rarely happens in movies. Their brotherly bond stuff went fine with the movie. Other characters were either OK or a huge miss.As mentioned earlier, the director went with a different approach. The movie was more of a summer blockbuster monster film, with some of the Jurassic Park elements to it. Many fans might be disappointed by this fact but I was fine with it. Better to have a generic/typical entertaining film instead of a lame recreation attempt. The greatly teased indominous-rex, the hybrid dinosaur, was awesome. The movie did a great job of showing it as this unstoppable monster science and corporate greed created. It was smart, it was ruthless and it was what a monster should be like. The raptors, which have always had huge importance in Jurassic Park franchise, were yet again great here. The whole training them scenario was risky and I didn't know what to expect from it but the way movie handled it was really pleasing. The dinosaur scenes ranged from good to great, with the finale being OH SO SATISFYING. Seriously, my inner dinosaur/Jurassic Park fan was screaming with joy in the last 10-15 mins. The CGI was mostly great. There were some inconsistencies here and there but they weren't that distracting. The soundtrack, apart from the original's, wasn't that great or unique or memorable though. Now the movie definitely had plot issues. I mean the whole idea of creating a hybrid dinosaur because the park is losing its spark sounded really absurd. Also, there were some really stupid moments, created for the convenience of moving the film forward, where you just can't let it slide. Also, the movie had this synthetic feel to it in a lot of scenes. I guess it was because of the lighting and too much use of CGI. It didn't had that gritty and naturalistic feel of the original. All in all, the movie had its quirks but I still had a good time with it. It was entertaining and thrilling, just like how a summer blockbuster should be. Whether you're a fan of the original or just wanna have a good time, this is a must watch. 7.8/10","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

'Jurassic World' reminded me of 'Martian' – episodes that should have had tense and thrill are dumbed down with jokes and humour. It feels like nobody is ever scared. There is not a single moment in the movie when you are actually afraid for any of the characters.It's a perfect, cheesy, Disney-style commercial movie. All relevant deaths can be counted using fingers of one hand, and thorough preparations (justifications for their deaths) have been included in the script. If somebody dies – you have been shown multiple times that this was a bad person. No good guy gets spared, basically.

Jurassic World left that unexplained, but I had two hours of good entertainment. Every scene made me eager to know what will happen next. However I still think that Jurassic Park was the best film in the series. In my opinion most of the times the first film of the series is always the best one with a few exceptions like Back to the Future, but Jurassic World was not bad. This film must be on your next watch list.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

JP followed a pattern I always associate with The Birds; throw us into the tedious entanglements of uninteresting people until we're almost asleep, then start the mayhem. There is very little soap opera in Jurassic World, and most of that comes in brief spurts later in the movie. The film begins by establishing how incredibly cool Jurassic World actually is, with charming scenes at a dinosaur petting zoo and a dramatic giant-fish feeding that made me feel like I would really, really like to go there. One also sees where things are going to go awry, although the score never telegraphs those moments, sounding perpetually chipper even when you're thinking, that's not going to turn out well.While JW doesn't subject viewers to the degree of pure tedium that JP did, it's still a movie that doesn't really take off until things go wrong. Once they do, the movie becomes a series of big, wild dinosaur disasters that keep getting bigger as more and more people die. While this is exciting, by the end it feels as though the movie is a bit too focused on making things big. JW has a lot of excitement, but the original JP had more suspense. JP was a movie that understood waiting for the right moment; JW believes the moment is RIGHT NOW.There's also some sort of story with Chris Pratt as the guy with sense and a bunch of other people without any, including a greedy owner, a military guy whose ideas are so ridiculously poorly thought out that even a cartoon villain would say, ""maybe you should take a minute to think this through,"" and an executive who gets to run around the jungle in high heels. Her character has been called sexist, and I can see why, but I would say that this comes as much out of a lazy reliance on character clichés than anything else. But what I like about this movie over JP is that it has far less interest in its characters. It knows that all anyone cares about are the dinosaurs, and it delivers those beautifully.","18 out of 32 found this helpful.

An ex-Navy officer who now trains Velociraptors to respond to commands, is brought in to inspect the holding pen of a newly created genetic hybrid predator. The park staff, including the park operations manager Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, believes that the new Indominus Rex to be the next big thing.However, like Ian Malcolm in the first film predicted, ""Life will find a way.""

The first two were incredible but the third film left a sour taste in most people's mouths so this movie had a lot on its plate. If it flopped it would've certainly been the end to this franchise for a long time until years down the road Hollywood gave it the inevitable remake treatment. However, if it succeeded in delivering a quality product that fans would enjoy, the sky was the limit. Well, lucky for us fans, it delivered a really good film. With regards to the cast, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do a great job as the male and female lead counterparts; Vincent D'Onofrio once again takes the role of the villain and he does so masterfully; Jake Johnson provides great comedic relief throughout the film (maybe too frequently to be honest); to be frank, the only weak part of the cast were the two child leads. In what has become an unfortunate cliché in this franchise, children were given too large of a role and they couldn't deliver the necessary emotions. The first film got lucky there... more often than not, banking a large portion of your film on the capabilities of child actors is a mistake. Thankfully this was not a movie entirely reliant on acting so it wasn't a grave error but trying to emulate the magic of the first definitely hurt the movie a bit. The film also failed to deliver quite the same edge-of-your-seat thriller experience that the first two did. A lot of that had to do with any sense of unknown being eliminated almost immediately. In the first movies, you rarely caught a glimpse of the ""villains"" (T-Rex or the Raptors) during the build-up of the suspense. This helped create a certain tension that really captured you. This movie doesn't manage to do that at all. Instead, Jurassic World is an action movie that has dinosaurs, humor, and solid acting. Essentially it felt like a 21st century superhero movie but instead of Iron-Man or Captain America it had Velociraptors and an Indominus Rex. The problem is, it shouldn't be that type of movie at all. Nonetheless, the action, the nods to the original film (which was probably my favorite part of the movie), and the dinosaurs devouring people makes this worth the price of entry. Just don't go in expecting it to building on the originals.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

After that however the film is a big roller coaster ride, it is not a remake, it does have respectful references to the original.

To date, the film has grossed more than $1.4 billion worldwide, good for fifth most all time, so nothing anyone was going to say could influence the desire to watch this highly anticipated return to Isla Nublar and the world first created by Steven Spielberg. Why audiences were so eager, however, is in ways more intriguing than the film itself.From the trailers, nothing about ""Jurassic World"" appeared to be novel — the park was rebuilt, and now something bigger and scarier than a T-rex has gotten loose. So that suggests the film was an exercise in nostalgic thrills, the excitement of the big bad dinosaur running amok that inspired studios to produce countless '90s and 2000s monster-driven blockbusters. And to that end, ""Jurassic World"" succeeds.A long 14 years since the failed ""Jurassic Park III"" and more than 20 years since the original adventure, enough time passed to build up this franchise's novelty value, a wisely calculated move by Universal Pictures to be sure. Although ""Jurassic World"" doesn't inspire awe and wonder in the same way ""Jurassic Park"" did, it feels refreshing to return to the franchise's overall aesthetic.Entrusted with created the ""dinostalgia"" is director Colin Trevorrow of the indie sci-fi comedy ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" and screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver of the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" prequels. While Trevorrow must simply keep the thrill and pulse of the film alive and throbbing, it's Jaffa and Silver who must create a captivating story that stays true to the formula of ""Jurassic Park.""Jaffa and Silver were an ideal choice, having taken a previously bygone franchise in ""Planet of the Apes"" — not to mention one focused on animals and humans — and surpassed all expectations with the quality of storytelling. ""Jurassic World"" has plenty of compelling moments, effective suspense and a strong sense of danger — it's the character development that's lacking.Not that anyone remembers ""Jurassic Park"" for the characters, but ""Jurassic World"" can't lean on the ""wow"" factor in the way the original could. The main characters comprise an undeveloped mess of two boys, the park director and a dinosaur trainer. All the lovable charisma of Chris Pratt, who gets top billing as the man who has tamed velociraptors, can't save the two- dimensional Owen despite getting all the big reveal/epiphany lines, and as a selfish stick of a character, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire takes a long time to warm up to. Yet neither is the movie entirely about the two young brothers, Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), trying to survive. Their troubled home life and fraternal bond gets shoved into a film much more concerned with its dinosaurs.All of these flaws feel irrelevant until the story loses a grip on the suspense it so effectively builds in the first act and most of the second. In fact, there's a quiet moment amidst the chaos of pterodactyls descending upon hapless park tourists that marks the beginning of the film's unraveling. Something happens that proves the film has a poor perspective on its characters and it betrays the credibility of the story in a really unfortunate way.From that point on, ""Jurassic World"" finds a few nice plot twists, but devolves into your typical mindless blockbuster rather than an extraordinary or noteworthy one. You can sense its desire to be the biggest and most epic ""Jurassic"" film rather than holding onto the simplicity that made the original so great — that opened up a sense of wonder, fear but most importantly, curiosity. That's where the heart of Spielberg's film (and so many of his films) comes in, and ""Jurassic World"" never strikes those chords. The most obvious candidate for a sequel since ""Avatar,"" the franchise can only succeed in this way going forward the with a focus on Owen, filling in all that was missing in his back story and giving Pratt a chance to actually shine with the talents he has. That, or wiping the slate clean and giving the new faces a chance to connect more with this exciting world of ""Jurassic Park.""~Steven CThanks for reading!

Only actors to save face were Pratt and D'Onofrio. Pratt's part was so underwritten it could have been played by pretty much any actor (at least he seems like a decent person in real life). The part called for being stoic. That's it. Not even any Bruce Willis- type ""Die Hard"" lines. Terrible, terrible dialogue - embarrassingly so. Bryce Dallas Howard's part was so poorly written and clichéd (the writer seemed to be pretty misogynistic in light of how every woman in the movie was portrayed) and she obviously was directed to ham it WAY up. I wouldn't be surprised if this killed her career (I hope not, she's done terrific work in so many other films - but, in this one, she truly was awful). Spielberg should be ashamed at producing or having any involvement with this garbage - as bad if not worse than any piece of trash I have seen from Michael Bay. This clearly was just a big scheme to steal $$$ from the movie-going public with no interest in the work. I hope the writer and director never make another film again.

Probably not a good idea.""This review of Jurassic World is brought to you by Mercedes Benz and classy high- heel running shoes. After the success with his sci-fi indie film, Safety Not Guaranteed, Colin Trevorrow was given the reigns to direct the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. With the help of his collaborator, Derek Connolly, he co- wrote the script based on Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver's story. It was a pretty risky move considering Trevorrow hadn't worked on a big budget film before, but with all the product placement included here you can tell he was probably very restricted and controlled by the executives. But I'm not going to complain about that because if you think about it Jurassic Park also had tons of product placement and that is one of my favorite blockbuster action films of all time. Jurassic World tries to pay homage to the first film ignoring most everything that happened in the sequels and once the dinosaurs are set lose it succeeds in doing so. The set-up was probably unnecessary and by far the weakest part of the movie as most of the characters here were uninteresting and we could've done without the introduction of so many of them. Fortunately Chris Pratt shows up soon enough with his domesticated raptors and saves the movie from derailing entirely from its rather stupid plot. He's the new Indiana Jones and he can make the dumbest screenplay seem cool and entertaining. He delivers the perfect amount of comedic relief and has some great actions scenes to carry the movie. The dinosaurs are spectacular as always and there were a couple of thrilling scenes, although Michael Giacchino's score never matches the brilliance of the original (there is a cool piano cover of the original Jurassic Park theme however that delivers plenty of nostalgia to fans). Jurassic World doesn't live up to the high standards set by the original which was a masterpiece, but it's as slightly satisfying a sequel as the rest of the films in the franchise. I wouldn't go as far as saying it is better, but Chris Pratt does make it a lot easier to enjoy.So Jurassic World is set some 20 years after the events of the original film. John Hammond's vision of a dinosaur theme resort has been functioning for over a decade now in Isla Nublar. Unfortunately the attendance rates in recent years has been dropping as the enthusiasm and novelty of seeing these live beasts has died down a bit. The owner of the resort, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), has ordered his scientists to genetically engineer a bigger and meaner dinosaur knowing that this will spark more interest. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is in charge of organizing and managing the park and one of her responsibilities is making sure this new dinosaur remains contained. Simon asks her to talk to Owen (Chris Pratt), one of the on-site staff members who's in charge of conducting behavioral research on Velociraptors, and ask him to give his opinion on the safety of the creature's new home. Owen had no prior knowledge of what these scientists had been doing and is not happy about the management's decision, but before he has time to do anything the creature escapes and now they must alert the thousands of people who are at the park that a dangerous dinosaur is on the lose. Claire's nephews, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson), happen to be visiting the park and of course they don't pay attention to the warning and are left stranded near the danger zone. Claire asks Owen to help her find them and thus the thrills begin. There are several other characters in this film that aren't given much depth. It's a shame because a talented cast including Vincent D'Onofrio, Jake Johnson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, and Judy Greer are entirely wasted. Johnson has some fine scenes and it's cool he got to wear a Jurassic Park vintage t-shirt, but his character didn't have much to do really. The entire plot revolving around D'Onofrio's character felt recycled from the first sequel and was quite silly. Omar Sy, I love him, but he wasn't given anything remotely interesting to do. The two kids in this film are as exciting as watching two brothers who don't get along. I've already said that Chris Pratt is the saving grace of the film along with the dinosaurs, but he also has some great scenes with Bryce Dallas Howard as well. She's perhaps the only other redeeming character in the film although at times it felt like she was trying too hard to be Jessica Chastain. It's kind of hard to feel that same level of suspense we all got from the first film when there aren't many characters to root for here. Fortunately the film doesn't take itself too seriously and it ends up being a lot of fun and the less you sit down to think about it the more fun you will have watching the dinosaurs hunt down the visitors. I think that Trevorrow knew the premise was silly and used the genetically engineered dinosaur story as an allegory as to what the audience wants from a sequel: They've already seen the dinosaurs and are getting tired of them, so why not give them a more threatening one, and so he did. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The acting is decent in this newest installment, while the plot was completely predictable since the beginning; however, and I will say this - it delivers on the action, especially towards the last half hour. The ending was quite possibly the best ending of all three of the Jurassic Park movies. The ending alone makes the whole movie worth the price of admission, so definitely go and check this one out! ;)","38 out of 77 found this helpful.

Granted, we weren't really expecting that much in the first place. I was thinking it'd be along the lines of Jurassic Park 3, a non-sense, BS cash grab movie. But not at all! It clearly explained, why Jurassic World exists even after all the terrible mistakes of Jurassic Park. After 22 years, the public has pretty much forgotten everything, and they just want to be shocked and awed at HUGE dinosaurs.I don't want to explain the plot, because the trailers pretty much sum everything up. But I'll address my concerns going into the movie: 1) The boys.. The parents that just tell the boys at the airport, ""If anything chases you, just run!"" sarcastically. - They weren't nearly as bad as any of the previous children's characters in Jurassic Park movies. I was worried it was going to be a whole bunch of crying and screaming and near death experiences with dinos, only to be saved by some freak accident at the last possible second... And it's not nearly as bad as that. They served a purpose in the movie, and never left me shaking my head in disbelief.2) Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's on screen chemistry. There was one trailer that shows a clip of them talking by Chris Pratt's Bungalow. And in that clip, they seemed stiff and unnatural. - For whatever reason, in the actual movie, their chemistry was great! Even that scene played out super naturally.. So I don't know.. Maybe it was weird cut in the trailer, or taken too much out of context.. But yeah, they were both great in the movie! Chris Pratt is badass the entire movie. He killed it.The 2nd half of this movie, my jaw dropped, and stayed open. Even though you probably have a pretty good idea what's going to happen from the trailer, watching the ending was still a super shocker and surprise for me. So badass..Alright, I'm a terrible reviewer. Just wanted to say, if you're on the fence about this movie, go see it! It's totally worth your money!","53 out of 112 found this helpful.

If you convince yourself to ignore the plot holes, the woman who sprints in high heels and the complete absence of Jeff Goldblum, it's loads of fun. It's two hours of popcorn munching spectacle, full of Dinosaurs ripping people apart and pulse pounding set pieces. It's not as good as the original, but it surpasses both 'Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III' to stand as the superior JP sequel. You'll be riveted to the screen constantly and it'll only be a day or two later that you realise how many cracks there are.Set twenty years on from the original, 'Jurassic World' sees John Hammond's dream as a reality. The park is now fully functional and incredibly successful, with attractions ranging from gyroscopic tours through fields of herbivores to the childish joy of riding a baby Triceratops. According to the people in charge however, this isn't enough and the growing public apathy towards the scientific marvel of 'de- extinction' has seen attendance figures drop. In an effort to keep the crowds flocking in, Dr Henry Wu and his boffins have created an entirely new species - the Indominus Rex. This all new reptilian monster is a mass of teeth and claws that has been bred for the specific purpose of being a total nightmare. Wonder if that'll get out? Surprise, it does! From the initial security guard-shredding breakout, 'Jurassic World' plonks an escalating series of action scenes on top of each other as the Indominus goes on the war path. In true sequel style, the fights are bigger, the body-count higher and while there's nothing to match the tension masterclass of the original's Raptors in the kitchen scene, it's still eye-popping escapism of the highest order. Thought the Rex fighting the Spinosaurus in 'Jurassic Park 3' was cool? You ain't seen nothing yet. Where it falls down though is the characters. Sure, Chris Pratt is effortlessly engaging and Irrfan Khan's upbeat billionaire is a worthy successor to John Hammond, but it's obvious that this script has been written and re-written too many times for anyone else to remain consistent. Bryce Dallas Howard has a good stab as the ice- queen turned worried aunt, but that doesn't explain why she would interrupt a frantic search for her nephews to coo over a dying Brachiosaur. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson meanwhile are likable enough as the kids in peril, but Vincent D'onofrio's military nut has blatantly had a few scenes cut to speed up the running time. It's not the fault of the actors but the numerous alterations to the story during the years in development has left them behaving irrationally, while one plot strand especially has a ""oh, just throw a Raptor at it"" feel to it. Plus, the solution to the Indominus Rex problem isn't really a solution at all and it'll be clear to anyone that spends more than ten seconds thinking it over that they've solved nothing. When it comes to pure spectacle though, 'Jurassic World' is going to be a tough one to beat in 2015. The new 'Star Wars' has a fight on its hands if it hopes to beat the Pterosaur swarm, the Mosasaurus leaping from the water and the Raptors taking on the army. In terms of pure visual appeal, this can go toe-to-toe with the likes of 'Pacific Rim' any day and despite the weak script, there's more delights to be had here than in four 'Transformers' movies. Definitely needs more Goldblum though.","5 out of 17 found this helpful.

"3","/10","We're gonna need a bigger park","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3256164/?ref_=tt_urv","rooee","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17067687/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2015","Jurassic Park is now 22 years old yet still holds up thanks to well-rounded characters, an explorative script, expert direction, and a less-is-more attitude to CGI. The two sequels offered dismally diminishing returns, culminating in the shark-jumping raptor-chat of part III; so the sight of Starlord hunting with a pack of pet dinosaurs in the trailers for Jurassic World did not bode well. What did bode well was something that's been surprisingly overlooked in the series up to this point: The presence of an actual, functioning dinosaur theme park. This instalment returns us to Isla Nublar for the first time since Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking first film. Indeed, Jurassic World unashamedly uses the original movie as its template and sole predecessor. A wise move... on paper, at least. This time our Alan and Ellie are Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard; the kids are Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson); the Hammond role goes to Irrfan Khan as rich boy Masrani; and the new Nedry is Vic (Vincent D'Onofrio). The Jurassic Park incident has been buried, and Jurassic World has been operating without incident for years. But the visitors are bored and want bigger, louder, toothier. So Henry Wu (B D Wong, the only surviving cast member from the first film) creates Indominus rex, a genetically-spliced monster which basically amounts to a T-rex with less dinky arms. Suffice to say, a breakout is imminent. The kids get lost in the wild and Owen and Claire head out to save them. Meanwhile, Vic senses an opportunity to do the Weyland-Yutani thing and seize the dinosaurs for use as weapons. Good luck with that. Obviously Indominus rex embodies the idea that the entertainment industry constantly needs bigger 'n' louder products to keep the dollar signs rolling. It's a flash of satire but really it amounts to a, like, totally awesome new monster smashing stuff up. Relentlessly. Boringly. Jurassic World ruthlessly indulges what it seeks to satirise. It criticises corporate logic yet is just as disingenuous and bloated as any other Marvel-ised multiplex factory product. It smashes up its gift shops but has the depth of a plastic toy. It would leave a bad taste if it weren't so tasteless. Director Colin Tevorrow's previous credit was Safety Not Guaranteed, and Jurassic World serves as a lesson in why you don't hand the reins of a big budget behemoth to an indie guy. The direction is static and lifeless. The action is adequate but rendered tame by a staggering absence of tension-building. Visceral setpieces are connected with floss. The dialogue is as thudding and clunky as a brachiosaurus with a club foot. It took four people to write this trash – I wonder if the legal wrangling over the screenplay credits was to take their names off the poster. The characters are dull cardboard cut-outs. Pratt is stolidly sincere as the ex-Navy jock who starts and ends as a badass. Dallas Howard channels Lindsey Brigman from The Abyss as tight-ass Claire – but even Lindsey got to loosen up and take her heels off in the end. The kids... who knows? I guess they're meant to represent the indifference of youth, which as an audience experience translates as indifference as to whether they live or die. Then there's Masrani, who starts by criticising Claire for chasing the dollar and moments later gives the non-lethal order because the rampant dinosaur cost him X million bucks. Bad, bad writing. It's not just the words that sound lame. Michael Giacchino is occasionally hailed as the new John Williams, yet the only notes of distinction in his score are those of Williams himself. There's a great moment early on when young Gray swings back the balcony doors and we see the park and that music soars... But it's a false dawn, as we're subsequently lumped with scene after lumbering scene scored with indistinct music which sounds like it was 65 minutes in the making. Whether we can and whether we should were the Big Questions posed by author Michael Crichton. The reason the original story was so potent is because it took a distant scientific possibility and brought it intriguingly into a plausible reality. That's science fiction, folks, and that's why a single shot of a lagoon could produce such wonder and awe. But tantalising possibility is not drama enough anymore, it seems. Today we are at a point where anything is possible with CGI so the tendency is to throw everything at the screen. And in this new World, by the final reel, with its risible monster mash showdown, you realise everything has been thrown and nothing has stuck. As a work of storytelling it's as vaporous as dino-breath on a window. As a JP sequel it's just as bad as the others. Maybe it's time to close the doors on Hammond's glorious vision. It just isn't working out.","169 out of 343 found this helpful.

Jurassic World doesn't have any ripple in the water moments, the white knuckle tension of a kitchen full of velociraptors and there are no ingenious moments like poor old Newman being discovered in the safety of a toilet block, and when the star performer of your film is a dinosaur called Blue, Jurassic World pales in comparison to its beloved original but did we ever really expect that to not be the case? It could actually be argued quite strongly, that World is in fact the second best movie of the 4 film franchise.With an empathise on fun and a wealth of huge ideas, World feels relatively short and sharp compared to most other recent bloated blockbuster tent poles and while a large portion of set pieces in the film feel underwhelming and slightly undercooked the film's final 15-20 minutes will be a sure fire hit for fans of the franchise and those keen to get there dinosaur laden destruction fixes on. Colin Trevorrow and his 3 fellow screenwriters also understand the importance of recognising the work that was laid before them and there are neat homages throughout this picture to the foundation Steven Spielberg built, from a visit to a very recognisable visitor centre through to the return of BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu, the legacy of Jurassic Park looms large over the picture yet thankfully never overshadows this much shinier product. Much was made about World's look when trailers started hitting the internet and many fanboys were outraged at what looked like some highly shoddy CGI work but it's with great pleasure I can say World is one of the more spectacular visual popcorn films of some time. The quintessential dinosaurs look fantastic, the Island of Isla Nublar looks splendid and overall the film looks about as polished as you could hope for. With our dinosaurs on point, it's also helpful that our main cast members work well together and while Chris Pratt has virtually transplanted his Starlord persona to a park working, ATV riding hero of the hour, his still a very easy to like presence and shares a good rapport with the always good Bryce Dallas Howard. The human big bad of the piece Hoskins played by Vincent D'Onofrio is a bit of a stumble for the film and his appearances often feel unneeded and distracting in an other wise frequently moving adventure, but luckily the monster big bad is all types of menacing if not quite up the original T-Rex's greatness. Likable and enjoyable without ever reaching grand heights, you wouldn't call Jurassic World overly memorable but it's certainly worth the price of admission for all those seeking adventure, no matter their age. With some hugely impressive visuals, a fantastically designed theme park full of prehistoric wonder and with a mostly likable cast, Jurassic World offers us a great excuse to journey back to the island that wowed us so all those many moons ago, just don't expect to be left with the same feeling received from our first trip to the land before time. 3 and a half Jimmy Fallon safety videos out of 5","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

It even has a reasonable plot for most of the movie. I won't spoil anything, but I will try to give you an idea of what to expect. The story follows the visit of Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), two kids, who visit Isla Nublar where their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) works. After ten years of operation Jurassic World has relied on new attractions every couple years to keep the visitors coming back for more. This time they create a hybrid dinosaur from gene splicing. Owen (Chris Pratt) works with the velociraptors on the island and is brought over to check out the containment center where the hybrid is kept. This is where the story picks up. And for the majority of the film it keeps a good pace with an entertaining story and decent dialogue. Chris Pratt is the stand out in the film and continues to show that he can carry an action flick. The movie starts to dip toward the end and you are left with the feeling that the writers didn't know how to end it. The film did so good for almost the entire film, but what you're left with is a jumbled final act. That doesn't mean the film isn't worth watching, but tailor your expectations for a complete package. It will sure to impress and is well worth seeing, but as far as rankings go it deserves a 7 at best.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

The more fitting, and maybe too misleading for the film as a whole, would be Jurassic Pets.Just when it seems everything is contained and cute, you realize you may be watching a more realistic prequel or actual Godzilla (2014) film, which was good but dependent on more science fiction stretches than this.What it adds to the Jurassic series is more realistic, as mentioned pettable/touchable, dinosaur visual FX and a more realistic follow-up to the original film, especially one taking place 20 years later. It doesn't ignore the original, but rather embraces it and integrates what happened there into the story. It also adds the missing sea/ocean dinos and some believable technology to observe and run with dinosaurs. The adult relationships are also more complex/realistic than the original (though also some unnecessary melodrama).

Like the other films, this one is led by an ensemble cast. Basic Set-up: Brothers Zach Mitchell (HS Age), played by Nick Robinson, and Gray Mitchell played by Ty Simpkins (Appears to be Pre-Teen to early Teen-Harley Keener in Iron Man 3) go to visit their Aunt Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who is the Operations Manager of ""Jurassic World"" a theme park of Real Dinosaurs on Isla Nublar in Costa Rica – first envisioned in the first movie by the character of John Hammond. Another main player is Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt (Peter Quill/Star-Lord of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and Andy Dwyer of TV's ""Parks and Recreation""), a Velociraptor expert and trainer. Like the previous movies, as you can imagine, things will go array with the Dinosaurs, and chaos ensues. Like the previous films, the Special Effects, particularly the Dinosaurs, are first rate. The cast, which is good mix of races, generally do a good job. The two young boys I thought were outstanding, not a surprised with Simpkins, who was I felt was also so in ""Iron Man 3"", 2 years back. While slow at the start, Bryce Dallas Howard improves as the movie goes goes on. Pratt, does admirably playing a character that is not at all a carbon copy of ""Star Lord/Peter Quill"" from ""Guardians of Galaxy"" which released last summer, heightened him to super stardom – And he got the role prior to ""Guardian's"" release. Overall, while at times the film is entertaining, it is also at times uneven, trying to do the dual stories of overall the Mitchell family aspect, involving the parent, and the dynamic of Howard character and her sister – the boys' mother, and the plot line of how things go array with the Dinosaurs in this installment. Both plot lines, particularly the family aspect, could have been developed more, and be executed more evenly. and there are a 1 or 2 moments which just didn't fit. With that said, it still entertains you a great deal of the time. It's an improvement over the last film the series, and overall I would rank it third behind the first one, and ""The Lost World – Jurassic Park"". 2 ¾ Stars out of 4 – 7 ½ out of 10 Stars.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

Absolutely not. It is way better than the god awful sequels? Absolutely. I didn't fall in the love with this movie, but I can certainly say that I liked it. It's a fun popcorn monster movie that just about everyone can enjoy. Be warned though, there is a lot of really stupid stuff in this movie. First off the notion that this park would ever open is ludicrous. This takes place after the first movie, so the events that took place there still happened. I find it hard to believe anybody would come to this place after people died on the first attempt. Bryce Dallas Howard's character was wearing high heels the whole time. Keep that in mind when you're watching this movie. There's also a really stupid decision made by the kids in this movie that I can't say without having spoilers. But in the end, all those things don't ruin the movie. I got to see dinosaurs kill stuff and I was entertained by it. I say go see it.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

It is actually made in a way so kids would love it and yeah from that point it is good, but the only thing which may disturb parents may be dinosaurs attacks.If I have to speak about music, it was epic , kind a remembered me something from Star wars, special effects were really good.The only , but one of the most important thing for me, when ever I watch a movie is story and I kind a felt that Jurassic Wold was lacking it! I found it rather flat. There were a lot of scenes which were too predictable, action parts were too predictable and of course faith for main characters were kind a known in the movie beginning, in my opinion nothing will surprise an adult, but for kid this may be really good movie!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

""Jurassic World"" offers plenty of awesome dinosaur fights and chases, good special- effects, and a story that will entertain you in the way that summer action movies do- but that is pretty much all that you are getting here.I believe this movie is the kind of movie you watch when you're home, on the couch, maybe on your laptop or smart-phone, and you have the TV on. The movie tried to make you care and invest in characters that almost seem copy and pasted over from the first installment of the series, except it doesn't really work. I felt very uninterested in pretty much all the characters besides Chris Pratt, because he was the only one that was they took time in developing. One could argue that others were enjoyable, and I would agree if they weren't just killed off or if they took a bit more time developing their interests and motivations.Throughout the film we are exposed to beautiful scenery and landscapes that were very pleasing to the eye.The dinosaurs looked good, but are almost entirely CGI and not enough practical effects. What made the dinosaurs look so realistic in the first and second installments of the series were the life-like animotronics used in the close up scenes, which is absent for most of this film. Don't get me wrong- the dinosaurs still looked great, just not as good as they could have been.Chris Pratt's character was my favorite, and he really ground this movie. Unlike his other role in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", he plays a down to Earth, stoic raptor trainer. He's the guy who cares about the actual people in the park, his raptors, other characters, actually understands the danger of the dinosaurs, and did not wait to act. Though, I don't find it appropriate that the weight of this movie is on Pratt's character's shoulders, when it could have included other meaningful characters like park-workers and tourists that could have made this film live up to it's name. But hey, the dude trains friggin' velociraptors for a living, and you will grow to love this character.There were a lot of times that this movie rides the line of scientific accuracy, like certain dino-fights and executions, but that doesn't take away from the movie at all. In fact, when I saw the many abilities of the hybrid dinosaur in action, that were then explained in awestruck and furious dialogue and monologue, I was at the edge of my seat for the duration of the scene. The only problem I had with the hybrid dinosaur was that it wasn't as built up as it could have been to get that emotional punch or some kind of moment where I cover my face so I don't see the monster of my nightmares prowling around on screen. When it is not on screen, it almost feels as if it isn't in the movie.""Jurassic World"" was an enjoyable movie that I will turn to when it comes on cable, but my experience with this movie did not lead me to believe it was a great work of film.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The scale of the story also was expanded from one small ""Park"" to A ""World"" sort of like comparing a county carnival to a Disney site. I know I will watch this movie many times again and possibly buy the DVD or Blu-ray when released. I rarely do that; I thought it was that good. Will be recommending it to all my friends.

The script is fine, the dialogue was cheesy, I think people just want to see dinosaurs, which is fair, but overall, it was ok. I don't hate these kinds of movies, in fact, I think there was plenty of action sequences and the visuals was good at it's time. And in my opinion, it deserves a lot less hate that it's getting right now, to really be honest, the big positives in this film are the cool dinosaur action sequences and the visuals, the villainy was lame, and that led to the travesty that is called Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. Anyways, if you like monster movies like Godzilla, this is your film, but if you want a movie that is smart and intelligent, This ain't your film

Now that I see this, I see they're driven by the same strategy; plucking iconic elements of the original and transplanting them in a context that acknowledges that we can't do it the exact same, the world is different.The idea here is that we consciously enter Jurassic Park as the cinematic themepark we've known from prior visits. Now it's essentially a huge themepark / cineplex with tons of different rides, screens and dinosaur attractions for crowds of parents with their kids. But we want bigger, showier, ""more teeth"" in the attraction so producers of the show oblige, genetically creating a new rex for profitable thrills.Unleashed beast wreaks havoc, narrow escapes, chases through woods and around compounds, mercenaries who fail; much of it stays the same, with a few extra rides. The themepark is leveled, the audience scattered in hysterics; the real themepark is the film where this is the ride, the same one that spills from staged to real with the animals on the loose and us being rocketed through. Along the way we stop to see a dilapidated segment left over from the first Park, explored with something like hushed awe. In the end the old beast is unlocked from the vault of nostalgic memory and brought into the fight; this time we cheer.All told, none of these can ever be like the first time, which was first of all something we discovered new. So this is fine for what it is, what room they had was try to engineer the themepark to extend a little while reminding of the place they're renovating. That's what they did.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

So going into this I felt there was a lot of pressure in terms of my own self preservation, for this movie to be good.And it definitely was.The nostalgia theme throughout this is excellent, they do a fantastic job of tapping into your younger self and making you feel like a kid again. Confidently playing the old JP score without any apologies, and it works!The action is almost non-stop and very well paced, never feeling like there was too much nor too little. The CGI is fantastic, and of course it would've been nice to see more Anamatronics but this is a new age of movie making that we have to adapt to.They do an excellent job of portraying the I-Rex as a creepy, mastermind villain but also as an animal that you overall feel sorry for as it didn't ask to be thrown into the world like it is.The rest of the Dinosaurs have the perfect amount of screen time, and the Raptors are definitely my favourite and I found myself more connected with them than I did with most of the human characters characters.Chris Pratt plays his role fantastically. He was cool, calm, collected but not invincible. And I felt both him and BDH did the best they could with the script they were given. Cheesy dialogue is rampant throughout and very clichéd, however, if you go into this movie being prepared for that I can guarantee it won't be a deal breaker.This movie had an enormous amount of pressure on it. It has dealt with so much criticism over trailers, CGI usage, actor selection, too name a few. Yet it has delivered everything we hoped for as true JP fans and I don't see any of the cheesy dialogue and clichés ruining this movie.I ultimately would've preferred a bit more progression into a darker theme as the story went on, and honestly, although the child actors did a good job, I really didn't care about their back story. It almost seemed tacked on to provide some kind of ad-hoc character development, but was completely redundant.JW is a great movie, not a perfect movie, but delivers on so many levels that only the true harsh critics and general trolls will think its awful.I loved it and I left the cinema feeling very satisfied after months of waiting.A solid 7/10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

He plays the military liaison with a vested interest in using velociraptors in the military - you know, to carry out missions in dangerous war zones. It's hard to say it with a straight face, so we're obviously dealing with talented actors. Usually angry dinosaurs alone are sufficient when it comes to creating suspense, but this would require some decent writing, and seemingly incapable of this task, the writers decided to create a genetic hybrid monster-type dinosaur to try and elicit some emotion (although he is not a great deal scarier than the original T. Rex). I found it really challenging to care about any of the people who are trying to avoid getting eaten - despite the expressions of panic on their faces - and the frantic calls to the nanny. Some of the expressions of brotherly love between the children was well done, and, in line with the concept of ""summer blockbuster"" you certainly get your share of big bad beasties. There were also a couple of excellent comedic exchanges with the secondary characters working the control room.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

While nothing will ever be able to replicate the wonder and joy the original film brought, I can say that this one comes very close. It is a worthy sequel that makes you forget the mistakes that The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III had made.Twenty-two years after the events of the first movie, Isla Nublar has been revamped and redesigned into a properly functioning dinosaur-themed park named Jurassic World, as was originally envisioned by John Hammond. However, after 10 years in service, the park's popularity and tourism rates are declining. In an attempt to attract more tourists, the park's genetic engineers come up with a plan to introduce a new dinosaur, a hybrid Tyrannosaurus Rex known as the Indominus Rex. This idea backfires horribly when Indominus escapes its enclosure and goes on a rampage.This film gets right what its two predecessors got wrong. It manages to expand the fictional universe that Jurassic Park had started without seeming too contrived or forced. The characters were likable as well, especially Chris Pratt's character Owen Grady, a bad-ass, yet kindhearted raptor trainer. The third act alone redeems the franchise of The Lost Word: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. My only real complaint is that the CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) dinosaurs didn't always look very convincing. I guess CGI in the 80s and 90s looked better than the CGI of today.I rate it 8/10.","23 out of 45 found this helpful.

Scenes such as the T-Rex in the wing mirror, the car 'chasing' the child down the tree, rapidly alternating between humour and suspense as Sam Neil leads the children over the electric fence; this was Spielberg at his very best from start to finish. Sadly, all that directorial guile has been thrown out the window in Jurassic World in favour of relentless action and great special effects, and the movie is worse for it.It's not a terrible movie, but it says something about the acting and direction that I wound up caring more about the dinosaurs than I did about the principle characters. If Jurassic World had come first with 1990's sfx, I doubt the franchise would have anything like the popularity it now does.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

And that's exactly what I saw, a visual spectacle that reminded me of the first film. Jurassic World is pretty much a monster movie, which you can say the same for the other movies. Sure it's script isn't the best, and it is understandable (unlike what some people say). Chris Pratt is great, didn't expect anything less from him. Bryce Dallas Howard was great, I don't think I had seen her in anything before but she was a surprise. And the rest of the cast, some were good some were bad. The film itself did something different, creating a genetically spliced dinosaur. It was thrilling, visually great and payed homage to the first film in multiple ways. This movie was very nostalgic and revitalised the series. Overall I'll give it 10/10, it wasn't the best in terms of the script, but because it didn't set out to make some deep, down to earth drama, I'll let it slide.

My complaints shouldn't suggest that it isn't an entertaining, enjoyable film; they should suggest that, despite a pining for more teeth and more thrills, you won't find yourself experiencing anything besides a popcorn ready case of déjà vu. But the action is visceral, the attitude adventuresome, the actors affectionate and enthused. Jurassic World doesn't have a lot of originality whirring around in its tiny little head, but it's just well-made and buoyant enough to provide for big-budgeted escapism worthy of one's precious time.The plot remains the same: dino-based amusement park seems sound at first glance, but goes haywire after its biggest exhibit knocks down its apparently impenetrable restrictions. This time around, the beast is not a sassy T-Rex but a selfish, genetically modified Indominus Rex, who is larger, more intelligent, and only content when killing for sport and terrorizing civilians. Our male lead is a wily Chris Pratt, his love interest a waspish Bryce Dallas Howard. I won't go into details regarding the characters — it's the same old, same old, all patrons relatable, all with baggage that does nothing besides add intrigue to the recycled plot.Movie consumer guide The Dissolve put it best when describing Jurassic World as being ""fun"" though ""ultimately more of the same in brand-new packaging"". It doesn't so much insult our intelligence as it does figure that bigger is better, that we won't notice that just because the I-Rex is larger doesn't mean some of the attack sequences won't feel vaguely familiar. Take a look at the scene, for instance, in which Howard's nephews, portrayed by Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, are trapped in a tour vehicle while the I-Rex roams the premises. Eventually (and expectedly), they are nearly killed, but escape in just the nick of time. But wasn't this exact moment caught on camera twenty-two years ago with Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as the young, would-be victims? Wasn't it just a little better, just a little bit more, I don't know, new? Whatever.Complaints abound. I could roast Jurassic World all day for making us go along with the fact that Bryce Dallas Howard spends the entire film in high heels, that Chris Pratt is able to ride a motorcycle sixty miles-per-hour through the jungle without running into any obstacles, that villain Vincent D'Onofrio somehow believes that one can actually weaponize dinosaurs to replace drones (???)(?)(????) (get out, you unnecessary side-character), that characters decide to run from hideout to hideout during a dino brawl when all they have to do is simply leave the premises. But I digress. Jurassic World provides everything a fan of the franchise could ever want — the monstrous reptiles are back (though they looked less computer animated in the '93 original) and better than ever, and the new cast is sound. By keeping in mind that nothing new will be in store, Jurassic World will make for a satisfying, well-made update.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Despite its doomed exhibition, corporate still has not learned and this time has created a fully functioning theme park on the island of Isla Nublar of Costa Rica. Funded by Samsung, Verizon, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, DQ, Mercedes, Hilton and Beats by Dre, the amusement park wows and amazes with interactive petting zoos, Sea World-esque tank shows and voyeuristic tubes that put attendees right in the thick of the dinosaur jungle. What's the next step to shock patrons and remedy declining visitor rates? Why, a genetically modified dinosaur whose predatory skills are only just scratching the surface.Despite the movie world of Jurassic World coexisting in the same universe as the original Jurassic Park, humanity apparently has learned very little since the treacherous misguidance in arrogance of Hammond's park. And it is in these blundering and arrogant human behaviors that audiences will find Jurassic World most infuriating.The story of Jurassic World is more complex in comparison to the original's plot, what with it being the fourth film of the franchise. We have the story of a family on the brink of dissolution, we have a career oriented woman managing one of the most complicated theme parks in existence, we have a trainer who takes charge to save innocent bystanders when hell inevitably breaks loose, simultaneously we have the action plot of a vicious genetically modified dinosaur voraciously wreaking havoc.There are aspects of the narrative that are completely unneeded and without which would have yielded a simpler more engaging story. Components of the film are spot on, specifically Chris Pratt and the role he plays along with the slight humor the kids inject in moments of tense terror. The tone of Jurassic World ebbs and arcs, at times perfect and at other times completely interrupting the flow of the film. The kills and action scenes are not memorable and sloppily difficult to follow. And while the CGI is adequate, it is at times overly wet and fake looking, prohibiting the ability to become fully immersed and engaged and we wish more practical effects were used, despite the budgetary burden they may inflict.Those sponsors mentioned above aren't just for the fictitious amusement park's bank roll but are also undoubtedly key financial supporters of the film itself. Their inclusions are a laughable distraction and the director is so heavy handed with his token features of the brands, one can only assume he is dense or was completely against corporate sponsorship in his film.The aesthetic of the park itself is the most wondrous aspect of the film and most closely resembles the wonder Jurassic Park induced. Creatively, Jurassic World as a theme park is amazing and perfectly thought out. As a film it is uneven but satiates the dino-craving.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

A very good and worthy sequel in the Jurassic World series and I for one would definitely welcome another instalment, hopefully with Chris Pratt returning and maybe teaming up with Jeff Goldblum to tie the connection further.","22 out of 43 found this helpful.

Like what another reviewer was saying, if you're going to see a Jurassic movie, what were you expecting to happen, that they would just clean themselves in a cage? Yah, that would be totally unpredictable.I also thought the acting for this type of movie was very good, especially from the little boy. Also loved Chris Pratt in this, he was enjoyable to watch. I'm not going to read too much into a dinosaur movie, went to see it for the adventure, loved it and my kids did too. It filled the gap that Godzilla didn't, especially at the end. We had fun so money well spent.","61 out of 136 found this helpful.

Jurassic World is full of giants and what I mean by that is giant dinosaurs. Jurassic World is set 22 years after Jurassic Park and in this film they have genetically modified dinosaurs which makes them intelligent. Let me tell you what is good about this film (spoiler free).The film is very pretty and futuristic and it is filled to the brim with CGI. The film has some funny moments that just make you giggle. The dinosaurs have feelings and also you get the sense of scale in this film. The story is set well and is definitely going to take over Jurassic Park 2 and 3 which were in my opinion just over the top and poor.Bad points about this film is the bad dialogue and also some very small plot holes and very awkward moments and in my opinion is quite dark and gory especially to the fact that it is a 12A (PG-13) but overall this is a dinosaur of a film.The story is set around two brothers aged around 17 and 12 Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) who go off to an island called Jurassic World they go there on a holiday set by their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) the two brothers have such a fun time then eventually it all goes wrong. Then the story goes to another character Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) who was in the Navy signed up for Jurassic World to train some raptors specifically four but again it goes wrong. Zach and Gray go off on their own adventure without their Aunt Claire they basically have their own responsibilities. Eventually the park get's overrun and everything just goes wrong. Now the hybrid dinosaur not the one seen on the Jurassic World is literally colossal over fifty feet long and she is extremely intelligent and smell people from a mile away but that is enough about that.Finally this film is spectacular. 10/10. A must see.","46 out of 100 found this helpful.

We remember that moment when our jaws dropped when we saw that first Brachiosaurus appear on screen. We definitely felt the fearsome terror of the T-Rex and the Velociraptors as they went on their rampages. Everything looked and felt so real, fully deserving of all the technical awards it won. Now, 22 years later, ""Jurassic World"" brings us back to Isla Nublar where it all began. John Hammond's vision is now a very popular theme park, with interactive rides and activities with the dinosaurs. Claire Dearing is the park's uptight all-business operations manager. She is having a particularly hectic day when her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) arrive for a visit. Serious problems arise concerning the park's latest, largest and most vicious hybrid creation, the Indominus Rex. Claire calls on Owen Grady, the park's onsite Velociraptor trainer, to save the day.Despite the existence of ""sequels"" ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" (1997) and ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001), ""Jurassic World"" is THE true sequel to the first ""Jurassic Park."" It is set in the same Costa Rican island where the first film was set. We see numerous references about the first film here as characters stumble into the ruins of the original resort in this film. We still see Dr. Henry Wu (B.D.Wong), the park's chief geneticist, the only human character from the first film in this one. And of course, there is the T-Rex.Now under the ownership of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), the dinosaurs of the park have become mere commercial assets of a big business. The initial scenes show us the shallowness of what the park has become: kids riding baby Triceratops in a petting farm, boating and safariing among the plant-eaters, watching the gigantic Mosasaurus performs like a dolphin in a pool. The stuffy Claire, in her stiff hairdo, designer outfit and stilettos, represents this cold corporate philosophy. It is this philosophy of wanting to be constantly ahead that led to the ill-advised splicing of the DNA of various dinosaurs and other species creating the ultimate high-IQ killing monster, which would later be the park's own undoing. Practically all the adult human characters in this film are unlikable: greedy, petty, heartless.Lead star Chris Pratt plays probably the only likable character in this film. His Owen is the only one we all rooted for as he badass-ly led his posse of Velociraptors on a motorbike. He basically plays his charming ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" character, but a smarter, less goofy, no- nonsense version. That her high heels get more attention than her acting does not speak too well of Bryce Dallas Howard's annoying performance as Claire. I guess her character was really supposed to be annoying so she is probably doing it right, yet she was blandly uncharismatic as a leading lady. The original timeless theme music by John Williams effectively evokes a sense of nostalgia as it gets played. The story telling by Steven Spielberg in the 1993 original though, remained superior over this one by newcomer Colin Trevorrow, riddled with some illogical close calls and questionable dinosaur psychology. The brotherly bonding between Zach and Grey was used as an emotional core, but it did get a bit too unrealistically sweet in the end (predictably so). Owen and Claire's love affair did not really seem to be necessary, yet they also put that in for some romance angle. The ethical and political issues about genetic bioengineering are touched on once again, just as the first did, with a bit less sting this time.Overall, the main highlight are still the dinosaurs. The awe we felt during the first film cannot be replicated, but the thrill is still there. Every time a giant meat-eater approaches a human character, the fearful tension created is heart-pounding, as it was before. The visual effects are first rate as ever, made even more realistic by updated technology, as are the sound effects that accompany the action. We all felt we were those kids riding that cool glass gyrosphere gazing up in wonder as the vestiges of a lost world roamed around us. 7/10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Finally! A 'Jurassic Park' movie that finally hearkens back to the original film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3257555/?ref_=tt_urv","shadowyx12","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22630675/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2015","'Jurassic World' takes place 22 years after the events of 'Jurassic Park'. In this movie, we see that a fully functional and hugely popular dinosaur-themed park has replaced Hammond's failed theme park. However, since the park is suffering from a decline in visitors, the scientists at Jurassic World are tasked to create a brand new dinosaur (Indominus Rex) to help bring up numbers. Of course, things go wrong once again - and a group of employees are forced to stop the newly created dinosaur.To me, 'Jurassic World' feels like a retread of 'Jurassic Park' - only with higher stakes. That being said, there are elements in the script (from the characters, to the plot, and even certain moments and scenes) that don't feel all that fresh. Aside from Chris Pratt's character, Owen Grady, none of the other human characters were all that memorable. I also found myself caring very little about the family conflict that the two Mitchell Brothers were going through (which the movie itself paid very little attention to). If the human characters were actual people instead of reused stereotypes, then maybe I would have cared a little more about the movie.Actually, now that I think about it... the script also contains PLENTY of plot points that the movie never bothers to mention again! Maybe they'll be addressed in the sequel?Who cares! Because...DINOSAURS! ...Which don't look all that believable when compared to what Spielberg and his team accomplished 22 years ago. Seriously, I'm not saying that the visual effects are bad (they're oftentimes quite believable), but I wish that Trevorrow didn't rely solely on CGI to bring to life the beloved beasts. Even today, the animatronic/CGI dinosaurs we see in 'Jurassic Park' still hold up! I can only imagine how much better the dinosaurs would look if the same method was applied for this movie!'Jurassic World' delivers heavily on the suspense, action, and thrills one would typically expect from a 'Jurassic Park' movie. Although there are a lot more intense fight sequences this time around (and not just between dinosaur and dinosaur), I never once got exhausted by what I was seeing. The movie is well-paced and the screenwriters knew just when to deliver the movie's WOW moments.Despite its lacklustre script, 'Jurassic World' is certainly a spectacle that demands to be seen on the big screen. The story may seem predictable and even trite at times, but if you're a fan of dinosaurs, mayhem, or giant monster fights, then check out 'Jurassic World'.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

A terrible cliché, but a series/sequel will always be compared to its predecessor(s), whether consciously or subconsciously. So let's get that out of the way first. The reputation of the first film is so positive, this film will always have had mixed reaction. However, relating to this issue, the main response from people seems to be this; it doesn't matter.People I spoke to tried to go in to a screening without having any expectations, and this is obviously the best way to treat the film. What you get is a popcorn movie with big dinosaurs, but wasn't that what the first film was? Well, let's come back to that in a bit. The main dinosaur antagonist in Jurassic World is well designed, and suitable scary and loud. The initial carnage scenes in which it makes itself known (the dinosaur) are well paced, violent, and probably some of the most gripping scenes, setting the tone for the rest of the film. However, that tone hardly changes, and when it does, it gets more ridiculous than scary or tense, something that the first film excelled at (Though, it's strange to say the Jurassic Park 'excels' at things, because, you know, Steven Spielberg and all).The action sequences are, expectedly, the film's strengths. Some of the individual sequences are very good, including the one mentioned in the previous paragraph, and one involving the main protagonist, played by Chris Pratt, zooming into the deep forest on a motorcycle, surrounded by a team of raptors (as seen on the trailer). However, others are absolutely ridiculous, in a kind of, ""this is absolutely ridiculous"" way. The finale is laughable, though still somewhat entertaining.There's not much point in speaking about the plot, as it's sort of irrelevant (and incredibly hole-y), and the characters, well, there aren't any (the best 'characters' are easily Pratt's gang of raptors, led by the more-charismatic-than-anyone-on-screen, 'Blue'). As we know, Pratt is an entertaining performer, but here, it feels that his talents have been wasted. I would have personally liked to have seen more 'cheekiness' and more one-liners from him, but he can only work with what he's given. In relation to this, some of the dialogue scenes so corny and ridiculous (there's that word again), that you just wish it was Jurassic Park....OK, so I guess it is difficult to talk about Jurassic World without frequently relating it to the first film. And it's this reason as to why I was slightly disappointed by it. It's fun, sure, it's loud, it's big, it's great to look at (most of the time), it's fast. But it's not (as) scary (as the first), and, unlike the first, it's not smart. It's dumb. Dumb fun, but dumb nonetheless. Going back to what I said about it being a popcorn movie, which was also the idea for the creation of the first film, is where the problem lies. The first film has a reputation as one of the greatest popcorn movies, but it's smart. It has a minimalist, yet classic adventure plot. It has characters; it has people you care about. I know it's difficult to come out with such gold as Spielberg and crew did, because, you know, it's Spielberg and all, but why couldn't it be smart as well as fun? Why couldn't we have a great time as well as caring about the characters? There's plenty of proof out there that films can be all these things.Yeah, I know, they shouldn't replicate any of the previous films, and they should make it their own. But simply by dumbing it down? Is that the main thing that summer blockbusters should be nowadays, as opposed to the days of the first film? But maybe I'm out of touch.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

But then again, Chris Pratt being lead actor made me fear I was going to see a cliché action movie. But enough of my expectations, let's get into it:Story: 22 years after John Hammond wanted to open a dinosaur theme park called Jurassic Park and failed, his dream has now become reality in the form of ""Jurassic World"" - same basic idea, just bigger. But as the audience wants to see more impressive attractions every year, a genetic hybrid has been created - based on the DNA of a T-Rex, but with lots of other elements. The problem is: The hybrid got bigger, stronger and more intelligent than expected.As I'd thought, there is nothing revolutionary in the story. I was afraid it was going to be just Jurassic Park all over again - that's partly true, but there are some new elements in there. In addition to genetic manipulation and capitalism, the movie also tries to criticize military and war through the character of Hoskins, portrayed by Vincent D'Onofrio. I really liked that and it brought in something new, but it could have been done a lot better, it felt like the character was literally just there for setting the movie apart from the original a little bit.Acting: The acting was fine all in all - no outstanding performances, but no failures either. Especially Lowery, the character played by Jake Johnson, makes for a few nice humorous moments. But, as I was afraid, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard make for some terrible cliché moments. That's more of a writing than an acting problem though.Setting, Costumes, Props: Everything looks really good and seems to fit perfectly into the movie. Jurassic World looks exactly like what it's supposed to look like: a huge zoo with fantastic beasts. Only the control room seems a little cliché. And, of course, the lead actress has to get rid of more and more of her clothes and look more and more badass as the story progresses.Visuals and Action Sequences: The CGI looks very realistic, and especially at the beginning of the movie, everything seems very big and impressive. But towards the end, the hybrid looks less gigantic than I expected. On the other hand, it's a good thing that nothing is completely exaggerated. The action sequences are not as terrible as they could be, but a lot of things are pretty predictable and there is no real suspense like in Jurassic Park.Miscellaneous: Especially during the first half an hour or so, there is a lot of really annoying product placement. But it gets better. Or maybe I just didn't notice it any more. In a few nostalgic moments, the movie actually manages to revive the old spirit of the original Jurassic Park.Summary: All in all, Jurassic World is a really good-looking action movie with a few funny moments and nice references to the original, and as a 22-years-later summer blockbuster sequel, it doesn't do much wrong (at least it didn't ruin the franchise for me). But, as in most action blockbusters, there is no real suspense, no really touching emotion, and a lot of clichés.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I don't know for a fact but that's gotta be quite the thing to get used too. For a blockbuster debut effort it was awesome, I can't help but feel like his work is only going to get better from here.I guess this film does have it's ""flaws"", the dialogue (like so many have pointed out) is fairly weak in some places but let's face it, did you really go see this movie expecting mind blowing dialogue? it's a dinosaur movie people. I found they could have used the original John Williams score at more opportune times but even that was still done quite well I felt. Some of the characters and their story lines didn't need to be in the movie at all, at some points it seemed like it was all kind of jammed in there, felt a little crowded at times. Those are all the issues I had with this movie and I can't stress enough that they DID NOT stop me from enjoying the hell out of this movie.Now for the positives folks, I'll start by saying they vastly outweigh the negatives. The new dinosaur.. wow, that thing is amazing, I was worried they were going to overdo it by making it crazy colours or covering it with spikes and horns all over the place but they didn't, they kept it simple and terrifying. The visuals in this movie were incredible, very Spielberg-esque shots and I'm not going to give anything away but if you are a massive fan of Jurassic Park such as I am there are some locations you're definitely going to recognize. This movie was made by a Jurassic Park nerd FOR the Jurassic Park nerd.If Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't convince you that Chris Pratt is a force to be reckoned with than this film will, that guy is outstanding. Bryce Dallas Howard has gone overlooked in this film for no justified reason at all, she was terrific, I've heard that some people thought the character arc was awful but to be honest I would relate it very closely to the Alan Grant character arc. I've been hearing a lot of negativity towards the two brothers in the movie and I can honestly say yeah, maybe it wasn't a great example of perfect character development but I thought both the kids did a great job, at no point did I wish they weren't in the film. Every character in this movie was portrayed very well I felt.In conclusion, I loved Jurassic World, Colin Trevorrow did a fantastic job taking me back to my childhood and for that I thank him, I can't wait to see his future work. Do me a favour folks and go into this movie trying to feel like you did before you became a critic and had your childhood and imagination intact, don't over think it, get a big greasy bag of popcorn, sit down and enjoy, I think you'll be happy you did.","30 out of 63 found this helpful.

But we humans never seem to learn, as 22 years later and we've got a brand new park even bigger with new deadly attractions bound to cause more chaos. We spend the first 20 minutes of the film seeing the park itself. It's more modern than the tribal feel of the first park, instead going for something more like Universal Park being a fully fledged tourist attraction with modern high tech designs with things like holograms to boot. But despite the park being a success with 20,000 visitors daily, apparently it's still not enough and they need to make a new attraction to lure in new audiences. So they've had the scientists create a new dinosaur that's even bigger and more dangerous called the Indominus Rex. What could possibly go wrong? But then everything goes wrong. The Indominus Rex escapes and begins to hunt for sport, killing every dinosaur and person that it comes against. We see the new dinosaur hunt its prey in interesting ways blending into environments, clawing at thick skinned enemies or armour to find weak points and just charging dead on with brute force to chomp its enemies to bits. On top of the terror of this new dinosaur we also get plenty of cool scenes with trained velociraptors, who despite being trained like circus lions still always pose a threat to the human characters who risk being turned on at any moment. Their uncertain allegiance does lead to some pretty tense stare offs. Whilst the dinosaurs are great, the human characters are far less enjoyable. Most of the characters in the film are either idiots or just plain annoying. Just like the first Jurassic Park we get two new kids here that are visiting the park and who seem to do nothing but get in to trouble and become damsels in distress despite this being a family film and obviously never being in real peril. There's an underutilised Vincent D'Onfrio as a military type who wants to use the dinosaurs for hunting who doesn't seem to have much purpose in the film other than rubbing in the Jurassic Park message that corporations are bad. And Irrfan Khan as the park owner, who comes across as a more annoying, douchey version of Richard Branson. The only good characters are the leads Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). They're both the basic archetypes you'd expect in a blockbuster film playing the Pratt playing the typical quick witted action hero and Howard playing the park manager who goes from a busy bureaucrat to being a caring bad-ass. But they play the archetypes well by remaining likable and getting a fair number of laughs over the course of the film.At times the film does come off as being self contradictory in some of its messages. For example at one point in the film a character jokes about selling out to corporations and that they may as well just name one of the dinosaurs after them. But then the film sells itself out to corporations by naming several products they could name it and filling the film with many product placements from Starbucks to Mercedes. Then there's the way that they mock some blockbuster clichés like the woman ripping her dress up to become a bad-ass, but then indulges in others like the typical stereotypes. Other than one fight scene (which I won't spoil here) none of the fight scenes ever reach anything close to the likes of the iconic T- Rex scene in the first Jurassic Park. At times the action can even begin to feel a little dull or repetitive. And if you think about it too much then you'll be bound to find many plot holes. But there's still enough here to put it ahead of the previous Jurassic Park sequels and is still an enjoyable turn your brain off b-movie blockbuster.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

But after a fairly average beginning, the intensity and thrills gradually increase, with some fantastic effects making it all so very watchable.If you go into this film with expectations above what the film is trying to be, then you will no doubt be disappointed.

So in that sense the movie fails. Apart from that this is a very entertaining movie.This movie was like a resurgence to the whole franchise and it does a pretty decent job in resurrecting the brand name, but then half way into the movie the director loses that grip and moves into a monster movie genre rather than sticking to the plan, which is annoying. The movie has got a lot of negatives, which makes it a mere one-time fun flick action movie The cast: OMG, what a waste, its like each character is dispensable, nobody gives you that involvement and even if they die you would rather not be surprised at all. The actors should make the audiences more involved, which is not happening at all. The brother duo chemistry was horrible, the mom/son relationship was dismal, the lead actors romantic trial made them even more unlikeable. Some of situational comedy are cartoonish, like the hero catching a fly from mid air, seriously?? you might still be giggling about it while somebody is being ripped into pieces. The actors couldn't even cry and sure as hell couldn't make the audience laugh The plot: Create something evil and it will turn evil. seriously, that's it. Why have someone train a raptor? Raptor are clever and evil as they are, the first movie addressed that very clearly and it clearly stated these are monsters will hunt everything, despite this the Hero is training them like pet dogs, no movie no! If only the movie had believed the animals for what they are and constructed some plan to get them out of the mess, i would be more than happy to call it awesome, but it clearly does not understand this and tries to make a Godzilla movie when it should have been aiming for the Predator. Honestly Jurrasic Park was hit because of the thrills: The first appearance of T-rex, the Kitchen Scene, etc. Movie makers please know the genre of movies before making them The only fact this movie is rated high is because people have seen Jurrasic Park 3 and that has made this movie stand tall and look much better. So Kudos for making a crappy Jurrasic Park 3 which set the bar really low for this mediocre movie to look like a monumental success","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The story kind of winks at its own over enfranchisement by depicting Jurrassic park as a failing enterprise that is doing everything it can to stay in business, including breeding new species of dinosaur. Jurassic Park in the cyberspace era includes pods, monorails and projections that are all more convincingly animated than the dinosaurs. It makes us yearn for the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston.Fronting the Cast is Chris Pratt, who is dressed like an Indiana Jones sidekick and is training raptors to respond to commands. Some may find this interesting but I found it laughable. The relationship with his domestic dinos loosely resembles a director trying to get an unwilling Russell Crowe to cooperate. Dinosaurs are far more interesting when they are in the wild. Then there is a moment where a shark is fed to a giant Marine Reptile which breaches like a whale to snatch it off a wench in front of a full audience. This kind of material is just as boring because it is condescending of its subject matter. Steven Spielberg's Jurrasic Park was a Safari in a real environment. This one is just an amusement park.Every scene in the movie (save one or two) feels like it was pulled from the script of one of the previous three films. Michael Crichton is probably turning in his grave.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

To the departments and the manual that you're consulting for color codes, please be aware that WE CAN SEE THIS COLOR ON SCREEN. It's worth updating the color so that it isn't so obvious on both the big and small screen (unless the tranny look is what you're aiming for). This is the third high-budget film I've seen with this phenomenon.So yes, go ahead and watch this film if you liked the other Jurassic films. However, beware if you're into hard-core dinosaur films -- you might find this to be a bit fluffy.I enjoyed this more than the first Jurassic film. It's much better than the second movie. However, it's not as good as the third. So far, Jurassic Park 3 is the winner.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

And although the computer-generated-imagery is better than ever, it also carries with it a certain amount of cheesiness that the others (thankfully) lacked. What was the source of this ""cheesiness""? Two brothers, Zach and Grey, visit Jurassic World to see their Aunt Claire, but she has work to do so they have to tour Jurassic World on their own. The youngest is a highly emotional but clueless young boy, and the oldest is a high-schooler who is fascinated with girls, and while endangered on the island they form a bond. That's the part that makes the movie a tad cheesy. On the other hand, there's Chris Pratt, a raptor trainer, and Bryce Dallas Howard's Aunt Claire, both of which do a remarkable job of acting.The dinosaur escapee in this one is the Indominus Rex, who can camouflage (a characteristic he inherited from his TREE FROG DNA!!!!), and also detect thermal radiation, and teleport anywhere he wants to. Kidding on that last part, but apparently he's an insanely super-powered dinosaur, even bigger than a T-Rex. ""What have they cooked up in that lab?"" as one of the character asks. The answer? A very unappetizing reptile. Anyway, using his superpowers he inherited from Odin-osaurus, his father, he tricks the supervisors into thinking he escaped his confinement, and thus, using their naiveté as his weapon, (HUGE spoiler follows) he actually does escape. It appears they're never going to learn how to contain those dinosaurs.The action scenes are quite awe-inspiring, just not as thrilling as the previous Jurassic entries. Another foothold ""Jurassic World"" has over the other Jurassic movies is more amusing humor, from both Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. Although not quite as good as the first Jurassic Park, Jurassic World is a worthy entry into the spectacular series.","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

When it inevitably escapes and begins to chow down on everything in sight, dinosaur wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt) is called upon to help track it down.22 years ago my jaw dropped at the sight of CGI dinosaurs rampaging across the screen in Jurassic Park. Four years later and I wasn't anywhere near as impressed with the inevitable sequel, although that was probably more down to the lousy script than the special effects. 2001 and Jurassic Park III tried to make amends for Part 2 by going large, introducing viewers to the Spinosaurus. But while it may have been bigger, it didn't do the trick for most people—dinosaurs were so last millennium.The people behind the Jurassic Park franchise have wisely waited for a new generation of dinosaur fans before trying again. Now, fourteen years later, the park is once again open for business—and, boy, has it been doing a roaring trade, with record takings at the box office. It's spectacular, blockbuster entertainment for the masses, but the problem—for me at least—is that I've seen it all before: Jurassic World might feature a few new attractions, but it's essentially the same thing all over again. Not only was I bored by the predictability of proceedings, but I also became irritated by the excess of CGI, the lack of genuine suspense, the logic-free script, and the regular blatant product placements.The next time Isla Nublar opens for more dinosaur mayhem (given the money this film has made, I think that is a certainty), I reckon I'll save some cash and stay at home.5.5/10, generously rounded up to 6 for featuring my favourite dinosaur, the ankylosaurus.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The sideshow has finally arrived...once again! Thrills await! Step right up and see heroic derdoings! Gaze at the reptilian marvels on display before they are unleashed to the masses wreaking havoc on their prey. Watch damsels-in-distress flee from the monstrous hordes of wizardly lizards. (And man, can she run in high heels!). Witness scenes of spectacular state-of-the-art CGI. The media circus is here as the summer movie season descends with Jurassic World literally leading the pack for your attention and enjoyment. It has been 14 years since the last dinosaur outing of the Spielberg trilogy. This latest installment is not directed by him but he was involved in its making. Now, solidly directed by Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World doesn't earn its rightful pedigree like its more original and innovative source, but it qualifies as delirious sloppy seconds in its earnestness to create scares and its ability to entertain.There is no sly wit, no clever banter, no memorable set pieces (like in the classic kitchen sequence with the Raptors in the original Jurassic Park). It just one chase scene after the next with no character development in sight. But the action is good and somewhat suspenseful. The dinosaurs are real and lifelike, especially compared to their human counterparts.Chris Pratt takes on his Indiana Jones role with much charm and bravado. Bryce Dallas Howard has the thankless stereotypical role of the icy career woman who will thaw out once she gets her man. Vincent D'Onofrio is all caricature, a cartoon villain and nothing more. Only Nick Robinson, Judy Greer, and Jake Johnson bring some nuance to their one-dimensional characters. Basically, the rest of the actors are just pawns to a weak script. They are there solely as appetizers for the scaly inhabitants of the island. The biggest shock is that this screenplay-by-committee was created by a quartet of writers (including the director) who were all unable to bring any depth or logic to this lamest of stories. The set-up is so formulaic from all of its other versions, even down to its incompatible couple and two children in peril.At best, the film lampoons our insatiable need for ""more"" thrills and targets our self-serving theme park mentality of instant gratification. Yet in so many scenes, product endorsements with the likes of Coca-Cola, Pandora, and Mercedes-Benz become glaringly blatant and lumber in gargantuan proportions that rival T Rex. One character in the film aptly states about the public's taste for entertainment, ""We want it bigger and louder...and with more teeth."" That may sum up our movie-going appetite as well. This upgraded fourth generation of dino-thrills may certainly possess two of the former descriptive terms, but it's in the latter category in which the film has no bite. Jurassic World, while still fun, is a bit toothless.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

"","","'It's not Fellini, it's a dinosaur flick' and how I WISH I saw ANYTHING but, this...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3266821/?ref_=tt_urv","UNOhwen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22108743/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2015","The latest film in the 'Jurassic' franchise is here, and It's plot is creakier then the 4 previous flick - ALL pretty much copies of the 1st film.The makers of this 'film' follow the template for most Hollywood big-budget 'films' of the past few decades. In fact, everything which is wrong can be traced straight back to the first of these so-called 'blockbuster,' which was made by - who else - Spielberg.Since Spielberg showed Hollywood the 'blockbuster' way, with Jaws (A HUGER film - with a huge following prior to it's release, based on the numbers of people who had read the book), Hollywood's drastically changed - from making many films, with, perhaps, one film every year, or so, which would be called 'formulaic event,' i.e., The Towering Inferno, Earthquake, etc, to now, where most of each studios' budget's concentrated SOLELY on these 'blockbusters' - one for each season' - with massive budgets, big-named actors (where a BIG percentage of these things' budget goes), so they can (hopefully) recoup ALL the money in one, big fell swoop.Now, the following formula is followed;If you remember Jaws, it's dialogue was sparse - the film was mostly man vs. shark, and since Spielberg had to almost entirely concentrate on the action, his (in)ability to write (even decent) dialogue was irrelevant. This doesn't mean he was/is a good writer of dialogue - he isn't. He's terrible, which - in Hollywood of today, it doesn't matter, as it's all about international sales, and since dialogue doesn't translate easily, dialogue is irrelevant.But, action does, so, the makers' concentrate on it solely.Keep it simple, heavy on action, and make all major characters generic - as 'translatable' - as possible; the lead hunk hero, the (at the beginning) lead woman who's 'conflicted,' the 'Mcguffin,' as Hitchcock named it (Mcguffin is something in a film which seems to be important to the plot, but, in fact, isn't) in this film, it's the kids.Then, there's always a baddie (sorry, no spoilers),but, since that role's taken in this film by the real big (i.e; expensive) villain - the dinosaurs, the human part of the villain must be able to verbalise (at least) HIS intentions for doing what he did, or will do, etc. (it's usually ALWAYS about; money).Here, in this film, the makers get '100,' but, all this means is, it's hollow - predictable as 'which side your toasted bread will land on the floor?Before I continue, let me cite some lines from 2 opposing reviews, here;'Bad acting, bad plot, terrible acting, ham-fisted approach to storytelling, horrible acting, you name it. All of this - and more - is in this movie. It's basically a remake of Jurassic Park - it's the exact same premise, with mostly the same characters. Can Spielberg think of anything else other than child geniuses? 'Now, let me share with you someone who loved this recycled, re-heated mess; 'I loved this movie. I don't understand some of the negative ratings here. This is not a Fellini movie we're reviewing. It's dinosaurs. And plenty of the'No, it's NOT Fellini, nor does it ever pretend to be.The point this person is missing, is staring him in the face; WHY pay the (exorbitant) price to see it in a theatre, when you can rent the 1st for a fraction of the price, as it's nothing more than the same, exact film - only different character's names.It's like a movie 'Mad-Lib' - a fill-in-the-blank film; Sweet kids, one, a teen (make sure he's cute, and make sure it's 'wholesome' flirting he does), make the other kid younger, but, a genius - who'll save everyone at the last moment (the 2 aforementioned boys - one- the older - who appears to being groomed as Hollywood's latest hunk Jr.).  Male lead a cardboard copy in the Indiana Jones template macho hero (with a heart of gold), who's preoccupied by work too much to notice icy lady likes him - here played by Chris Pratt (who I really did like in the excellent, head-over-heels better than this garbage, Guardians Of The Galaxy. I would recommend THAT film over THIS dreck by far), lead woman with an icy exterior, but, inside, she's in love with male lead, and she'll have an inexplicable about- face from her initial iciness (played by the utterly charmless, interchangeable for any actress - Bryce Dallas Howard - a VEY poor man's Julianne MooreThrow in some baddies (the always t terrific Vincent D'Onofrio (I guess he needs a pay check) is here (as an antagonist)Popping up as a 'talking head role (literally - from her desk, to repeatedly exclaim things on her headphone mic), is Laura Lapkus as one of the park's controllers, who, if you watched Orange Is The New Black 1st & 2nd series episodes, was much better utilised in her role as a CO Susan Fischer, than here.The dinosaur CGI's act much better than the humans, because, they - the dinosaurs ARE the true stars of this dreck (As the 2nd quote I cited - from the person who loved this said, 'is NOT Fellini, it's dinosaurs'), and to be out-performed - appear LESS artificial THAN these CGI's, is really sad.I'm not a curmudgeon, I DO hate being pandered to, have my intelligence so mocked.This is a picture in which ANYone watching can tell what will happen next, who will live, who will die, WAY a before it happens. It's predictable bullshit.Your kid will love it.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

My expectations were simple i just wanted an entertainment i wasn't expecting quality or good story from movie and after watching the film i can say i am completely satisfied with the movie. It entertained me lot,it kept me busy. I never feel bored while watching it. Makers never wanted to make it as critical acclaimed movie they wanted to entertain people so here they have made a complete money making movie. We have seen dinosaurs in movie before and enjoyed it but this time its not natural its man-made. Story is not that much good but screenplay is very tight and with short 2 hrs runtime it feels much much tight. Visual effects were damn awesome and in 3D its much lovable,it will blow you. If you will ask me what i liked the most in this film then it will be their technical work,vfx and eye catching visual effects. Direction was good. Director cared about what audience want from film and he gave it to us. Sound effects were thrilling it gave me goosebumps. Actors had nothing much to do in film cause film is centralized on dinosaurs still all actors did quite good job. Overall an awesome entertainer which you cant afford to miss. It will give you jitters,goosebumps and dinosaurs will scare you will blow you. Go for it 7 * stars by me.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

Luckily, I'm happy to say, the film was entertaining and it gave fans a little bit of what they always wanted to see: An opened and functional park that goes from being a dream to a nightmare! The story begins with two young boys - Gray (Ty Simpkins) and his older brother Zach (Nick Robinson) - on their way to Jurassic World as special guests of their aunt, park curator Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). But, as you can probably guess, this isn't the best time for them to visit because soon, the park's new attraction, the genetically created Indominus Rex, will break loose and create, in the words of Dr. Malcolm, ""the essence of chaos."" With the the help of raptor whisperer Owen (Starlord himself, Chris Pratt!), does the group stand a chance? Lets start with the good. As someone who loved dinosaurs as a kid, this film delivers some of the best dinosaur action in years! The Indominus Rex is awesome looking, and as you probably know from the previews, this isn't your grandfather's T-Rex. It's highly intelligent, can camouflage, see in fared, and is something you don't what to come across (All the more reason why we should just go ahead and create it!). As the main villain of the film, the Indominus works as a constant and credible threat to the characters. Another dinosaur plus is the introduction of the sea reptile, the Mesosaurus, something that was never included in any of the previous installments. As for acting, I'd say everyone here did a good job, though the human star of the show is Chris Pratt. Channeling the cocky energy of his character from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", Pratt provides some of the humor relief as well as a center of sanity in an insane situation. So much so, Pratt does a good job making you believe his character is capable of actually training raptors. Bryce Dallas Howard also gives a decent performance of the uptight Claire (Some have said her performance was forced, but I thought it was okay) as does Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoskins, a man seeking to use the raptors and Indominus as military weapons (What do you think the chances are of that succeeding!). The two kids here are okay, and at least they're not annoying enough that we want them to get eaten. It also helps that the filmmakers include a little nostalgia here and there, whether it's the cameo of Mr. DNA in the visitors' center, the casting of B.D. Wong in the role of Dr. Wu (the only actor to appear from any of the previous films) or seeing the remains of the old Jurassic Park and one of those old Jeep Wranglers. As for bad, there were some parts of the film that felt kind of forced, such as in the beginning when they were playing the theme music and trying to capture the magic from the first film but didn't quite succeed. Another issue concerns the level of CGI used. Anyone hoping for some animatronic action will be disappointed, as their is only one scene that features it. While some of the dinosaurs looked good in CGI, such as the Indominus and the raptors, on others it looks a bit cartoonish. Case in point, the T-Rex. Supposedly, this is the same T-Rex featured in the first film but you wouldn't know that by looking at it! The thing doesn't look anywhere near as cool and threatening as it did in the first one, particularly because its head looks a lot smaller and is poorly drawn. For all the money put into this film, you'd think they could have done a better job with it. Another issue is the lack of explanation as to how and why the park managed to be reopened. We know that the park has been open for about ten years but the film doesn't really give much background plot, something that I was really hoping to see. All in all, while ""Jurassic World"" is entertaining, it doesn't have quite manage to create that feeling of magic or awe that the first and even the second one were able to create, a magic you can still feel no matter how many times you watch them. Never the less, the movie is a big improvement over the third installment - which I don't think was quite as bad as some people said but no where near as good as the first two - and in the end, that's all we can ask. Either way, no matter how you feel about it, the movie's going to make a boatload of cash. If you're looking for some dinosaur fun and maybe even to capture some nostalgia of being a kid again, ""Jurassic World"" isn't a bad way to do it.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

I was anticipating the odd scare and, admittedly, a lack of plot. I was very wrong. The film topped my expectations - it was a simply fantastic.Firstly, I really do not know why anyone is complaining. The only reason people are naming it ""disappointing"" is because of the first movie (which, remember, is one of the best films of all time). If Jurassic Park had never been made, there wouldn't be a single complaint.The gripping plot is full of thrills, scares, and even the odd laugh. From the very start, you fearfully anticipate what the consequences of engineering the Indominus Rex (the villainous Dino of the film) will be. In addition, although there are moments that reflect what happened in the other movies, the basic plot is original and there are a couple of surprising twists along the way. The special effects are brilliant. The dinosaurs were so convincing that I actually believed the were real, which only added to the tension I experienced from beginning to end. Although, apparently, not all the dinosaurs represent what they were actually like (the Raptors, apparently, had feathers on them - an image that would not be very scary) there is a reasonable yet non-confusing amount of science discussed in the film.The acting is also top-class. Ty Simpkins and Chris Pratt in particular give very convincing performances. During the movie, you also gain a developed understanding in the personalities of the characters, which is something most action movies lack. For people and humans alike, we get an insight into either their vicious or caring characteristics.I would highly recommend this film to anyone (although the movie may not be suitable for anyone younger than 9 or 10). And, with the greatest respect to people criticising the film, nobody should listen to them. Sadly, some people are never pleased.","46 out of 105 found this helpful.

One thing I liked about this film was the references or what I thought were references that were portrayed throughout it. This made the film a little more interesting and fun to watch. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct this film, to me it still proved to be one of the best along with the first of the series so I can only image how good it would have been if Steven Spielberg did direct it and I'm not just saying that just because Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite director/producers in the industry. I've read a few reviews saying that this film was better than the first. In my opinion it wasn't but it is good enough to stand on its own and be a good film to remember. Colin Trevorrow did do a good job in directing this film but he wasn't a Steven Spielberg. This film is loaded with action that will keep its viewer at the edge of their seat. The performances in this film were good as well. This along with the thrilling action and great visual effects made it a perfect popcorn fest.

If you loved Jurassic Park, you could skip Colin Trevorrow's mishmash sequel/reboot. In fact, you should skip it. What made the first Jurassic Park (even the two sequels, really) work so well is that Steven Spielberg clearly decided not to make a monster movie. Genetically engineered or not, the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park were living animals, skillfully brought to life with personality and gait, pace and vigor. They were neither heroes nor villains. Get in front of them and you're in trouble, get behind them and watch in awe. They, like all wild animals, were dangerous if you didn't respect or understand them, but they were also entirely capable of all the other things living creatures do: resting, rearing young, hunting, etc. The dinosaurs of Jurassic World? The film can't quite decide. Characters pay lip service to the idea that they are complex, living creatures, but on screen they're ultimately little more than toothy action figures, placed clumsily into scenes to bonk around gyrospheres, bite the bad guy or rumble against one another. They don't behave the way animals would behave, nothing they do confounds, intrigues or surprises. Instead, the little monsters snap and slash and are completely tamed by Trevorrow's limited vision, doing exactly what he and the scriptwriters want them to do -- exactly what the audience expects.And that might have even been okay, if only it had been a good script. It's not. Nostalgic touches intended to link the film thematically to the franchise only serve to remind us that a better film was made out of this material over two decades ago. The relationship between characters is wafer thin and, even from the start, stale. There is absolutely no chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, at least partially because Howard is forced into a prehistorically sexist role as corporate yes woman/damsel in distress. And yet, even when she transforms into an action hero and rescues Pratt from a flying reptile attack, her nephews ignore her completely, championing Pratt as a ""bad ass"" and their chosen hero of the film. The villain of the show, played by a husky Vincent D'onofrio, is even less interesting, chewing out his motives for a dino military force in a constant stream of GI Joe-meets-Halliburton chatter. His exit is absurdly staged, and serves as a marker for when the film is going downhill at full speed. I won't give away the ending. I don't need to -- everyone in the theater knew exactly what was coming. It's a wreck of CGI and pyrotechnics, insulting to the eye and ear. It clearly was meant to honor the titans of the original Jurassic Park, but it ends up being a poor kind of parody. I found myself wishing that all of the creatures involved could have just been put down, and met a more humane ending than the one they're left with: the prospect of more of this kind of franchise re-engineering to come.","156 out of 321 found this helpful.

No one actually expects any kind of emotive story or philosophical meaning in these kinds of movies. However, even without looking at the part about how well it delivered any kind of a message to the audience, there are flaws and inconsistency in the flow of the plot. There are also happening that really were not necessary, and some parts were just way to unrealistic that it made me lose focus and cringe at it. For example, there is no way a woman in skirts and heels can faster, or as fast as a T-Rex, even if it's a fake, man-made one. But still, the movie didn't get boring in any part unless the easily predictable story line does. For me, I didn't mind the usual old story, because I had watched it for the physical experience itself of watching the magical creatures and being scared by the way-too- loud roaring and screaming of both dinosaurs and humans.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't let the low ratings by some viewers fool you, this film is not as predictable as they say. To even say that the second film in the franchise is better than this is redundant as well. the CGI in this film is better and always will be more superior than the ones in the other movies. people expect this film to have a build up like the first film did but the first film already established what the dinosaurs were and what they had looked like. this film is not comparable to Jurassic Park 3 in any way as Jurassic park 3 had lazy writing in it. I will admit that the film had some subplots that led nowhere that were unnecessary. this film brought nostalgia to me and many others in the theater as we sat in for the first viewing of the evening. Colin trevorrow and cast did an amazing job. anyone rating this film low is not a true Jurassic Park fan as much they say they are. Jurassic Park had its major flaws as well. it's a fact that Tyrannosaurus Rex and Stegosaurus were misspelled in the first film when nedry stole the embryos. if a few holes in the plot are enough to ruin the movie, that would ruin a film for me as well. this was better than the original Jurassic Park to me but to actually compare them would be a mistake. this film had its very own feeling but it did make me feel like a child again. I also refuse to acknowledge anyone's existence if they even say the CGI was bad or that the dinosaurs have a lack of feathers. this is Jurassic Park, a fictional novel turned film that uses improbable science to splice dino DNA with frog DNA.

I saw that movie at least 20 times but tell you the truth the second and the third entry in the series didn't met my expectations. I only saw those 2 times. I was very happy when I heard that they started the production of Jurassic World but I had concerns as well. 22 years have passed and I grew up. When someone becomes adult it is much harder to bring his inner child to the surface and to enjoy a movie without criticizing small things and searching embarrassing goofs.I decided to go to the cinema without any expectations and try to spend the next 2 hours focusing on the fun factor.Friends, this was 2 hours well spent. I enjoyed every single second of this movie. The dinosaurs and CGI is unbelievable, the story is cool, the park is awesome and the characters are likable. The conversations are solid and there is lot of things to smile and laugh at. I almost forgot to mention the atmosphere: It's scary but also believable. The whole movie is just working.I got exactly what I had gotten 22 years ago and what else I could wish for?Thanks to everyone who were involved in the development. You brought back my childhood for 2 long hours. I hope this journey will continue soon.","68 out of 162 found this helpful.

The newcomer children actors are watchable until the 'divorce' subplot is introduced randomly. The music is excellent by Michael Giacchino, the new John Williams. The dinosaurs are fun for the first half when they are just being shown off, but become nonsensical in the films final battle. Far too many references to the original Jurassic Park, great acting, an annoying divorce subplot and a pointless military subplot, fun humor, nice visuals, a lackluster story.

Thousands flock to an island paradise where they see the mighty lizards put on display. Naturally, since this is meant to be a thrill ride, colossal human error will dictate that our ferocious antagonists get loose and wreak havoc on park visitors and personnel. Chief among them is a genetic freak called an ""Indominus Rex"", created because at this point people supposedly consider ordinary dinosaurs passe.One has to put up with some ridiculous, insipid characters and lame dialogue in this, the most recent entry in this ongoing franchise, but if all you want is to see big lizards run about and attack and eat people, you'll get it. Director Colin Trevorrow, with the assistance of such talents as production designer Ed Verreaux, cinematographer John Schwartzman, and editor Kevin Stitt, is able to create lots of brainless thrills. And make no mistake, it is pretty brainless. There are the standard absurdities to tolerate on the way to enjoying ""Jurassic World"". The main ones would be these human characters. This viewer certainly wouldn't have minded seeing most of them, if not all of them, become dinosaur chow. Surviving with his dignity intact is studly Chris Pratt, as a guy who's actually succeeded in training raptors. Forced to play a real archetype is Vincent D'Onofrio as a schemer who believes the ""Indominus Rex"" and the raptors would make excellent military weapons.The dinos, of course, are the *real* stars of this show. The visual effects are generally pretty good, and we see menaces that also include an enormous swimming mosasaur and numerous pterodactyls. Things get a little too precious, however, when we consider the bond that Pratt has developed with his raptor friends.The finale pulls out all the stops for any lover of dinosaur cinema, so things do end on a reasonably high note.Seven out of 10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jurassic World tends to skim the last two films and continues its own timeline by assuming that the Park was a success despite of the events of the first film. And the vast distinction is it manages to innovate what else behind this universe. We get to see more dinosaur species and what they're capable of, we're hooked on a particular mystery, we explore the history of the characters, and some tense moments that are perfect enough for a nerve- wracking thriller. The story is kind of strung with a lot of ideas and subplots, but surprisingly, the movie handles them well. Some of them end up being underwhelming, while some work for exceeding the action and some humanity. Overall, Jurassic World is a fun time at the movies.There are so much characters to focus on: we see the company trying to make a daring new exhibit for the park, then there's a sideline about Claire's two nephews wandering around the theme park, then it somehow centers a raptor trainer who happens to be the main hero of the entirety, and finally, we meet an oppressed security force leader who wants to use the raptors as soldiers/weapons. It's scattered around, but the movie knows how make them feel consistent. Some of them aren't too compelling enough, like the human villain who has an intriguing introduction, but ends up being a caricature. The two young brothers seem to have an interesting characterization, but they're stuck being some of the victims who run away from one disaster to another.But the real payoff here is the main villain: the Indominus Rex. Whenever the plot concerns the information and the threat of this dinosaur, it instantly becomes gripping. It also ties-in with intriguing questions about the genes spliced into this hybrid. Some of the answers may not be so mind-blowing and sometimes making the scientists behind it look even more unforgivably irresponsible. But nonetheless, it's always exciting figuring out the mysteries of this creature feature. The direction is slick and knows how to bring up tension. It may be overly CGI-ed and not as equally clever as Spielberg's direction, but the thrills are still spot-on. The camera also effectively represents the scale of this dinosaur which makes it visually terrifying. It's basically a loving tribute to classic monster movies.The characters are more interesting if you look onto their background and what they do rather than who they are. Again, not all of them are compelling, but if some of them manages to be one, then it's worth the attention. The better defined character here is obviously Owen, played by Chris Pratt, who is basically the action hero among who could have friendly connections with the dinosaurs, even if there are setbacks with their loyalty. The acting is decent, with Pratt showing everything he can do as an action star, but at the same time brings a new personality with it. Bryce Dallas Howard is supposed to carry the whole thing, and she does a well job in her role, but Pratt is the one who steals the spotlight.The clearest way to say is Jurassic World is the sequel that Jurassic Park deserves. The storyline is a little spotty, but still, it's smartly directed, full of solid suspense, and brings a satisfying degree of dinosaur craziness. It didn't surpass the quality of the original, obviously. This installment is more of a respect and inspiration to what Spielberg has done back in 1993. The update is cool, the innovative ideas keep the experience engrossing, and of course, it's a whole lot of fun. This is mostly the movie that we like to see for a Jurassic World.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The second part had its moments but being nowhere as memorable. And the third was even more forgettable.One thing that distinguished the first one from the sequels was the island. Along with the dinosaurs and the story of adventure, also the park itself was an super interesting setting with its techno-thriller vibe. The sequels happening in some other islands just didn't create the same electrifying atmosphere.Jurassic World returns to the original island and even though the park is built brand new, there are still relics of the original park to be found which nicely ties together these movies. The story, even though quite similar to the original is still very interesting and exciting. The special effects are ok too, especially the end battle of the dinosaurs was quite cool (says me who is not a fan of cgi monsters). All of the characters are not the best possible but they do the job I guess. My biggest complaint is that the story is not explained enough to start with; John Hammond is mentioned but it is not told why is this random greedy woman leading the park and how did they get the licence from Hammond to recreate the park. And who is her sister whose kids are in the park. The reason why these characters are in the story seems random.Overall Jurassic World lacks the heartfelt atmosphere that was in the first movie but it's still worthy tribute and sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi adventure films, and quite an exciting movie in general.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now we're able to see the diosaurs eat people in modern fashion.This is what a dinosaur movie should be. It doesn't surpass the original in any way, but does the most of the stuff perfectly well. There is for example a scene where Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson jump down a waterfall when they're escaping from a dinosaur. And I spend a lot of time thinking if I would do the same thing? I hate heights, but I'm not a big fan of being eaten alive by a dinosaur either. So I would certainly jump.Now, let's talk about the casting. I love the cast of this movie. In lead roles, you've got that guy from Parks And Rec and GotG, and that lady from Spider-Man 3 and Rocketman. In smaller roles, you've got Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3) and Nick Robinson (Love, Simon) as the nephews of Bryce Dallas Howard. They're lovely in this movie. You've also got that guy from The Office and that girl from 13 Going On 30 as their parents. Fun fact: How likely is it that Judy Greer played the same role as a family mom who's worried for her family in Ant-Man (which also came out the same year). I even had forgot that actors like Jake Johnson, Vincent D'Onofrio and Lauren Lapkus was in this movie. I recently rewatched this movie, after 5 years.But everything in this movie is a blast and fun to watch. The only thing I don't like in this movie, is the final battle between two major dinosaurs (don't remember any dinosaur's name). It feels a little bit boring, but not, like, ""boring"" as the final battle in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (which, btw, was not boring), but boring like the whole Godzilla: King Of The Monsters. It literally has one hour total destruction with two monsters fighting each other, and guess what?? I slept through the whole thing. But in Jurassic World, it only lasts for like fifteen minutes.But besides for that, this is a very fun movie to watch, and I liked it a lot. Not as good as the first one, but good enough to entertain (cause that's the whole purpose).","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It may not be here on the calendar but it is here in Hollywood. The Avengers Age of Ultron kicked the summer movie season off in May and the big budget blockbusters have rolled in week after week. As for me, I saw Age of Ultron and I held on to my precious dollars until this highly anticipated film.Jurassic World set a single day record this weekend bringing in $511M internationally and $209M domestically. That's an insane amount of money. I never expected it to do that well. I'm old enough to have seen Jurassic Park in 1993 and that movie was a game changer, an absolute classic. Jurassic World was good, but record setting good??? I wouldn't say that.Jurassic World looked to me like a remake of Jurassic Park with more people and the assumption that you know all of the DNA stuff. Again there were two kids without their parents, a male hero somewhat knowledgeable of the animals, a fat guy looking for a chance to exploit the dinosaurs, a security system not quite up to snuff and a big toothed predator on the loose. Of course there were some storyline differences to differentiate it from the original as well as the other two sequels; and there were shades of Deep Blue Sea and Man's Best Friend.The characters were bearable enough although there was an interesting dynamic between the kids and their aunt whom they were visiting. If you don't get too caught up into the characters and the potential symbolism of each of them then you can really enjoy the movie. This is just a purely entertaining movie of man v. beast with some excellent ""oooh"" moments.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

The production values, design, cinematography and special f/x (despite some reviews I've seen to the contrary) are all top notch. But what it's sorely lacking is substance and originality. I get that a movie about rampaging dinosaurs isn't exactly going to be a character study, but the original still managed to give us at least a little characterization for our human players. And it's an unabashed rehash of the original, but plays more like a mediocre tribute band than the real thing.But ultimately the worst sin committed by 'Jurassic World' just may be that it isn't very much fun.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Jurassic Park had captured the imagination of the world, and is personally my favourite film. It was followed by two enjoyable sequels that failed to really capture that magic. 3 had failed so much that the series was put on hold for over a decade, and people genuinely thought it was killed off. Then came the trailers and posters for this, and the hype was enormous. When it finally did come out Jurassic World did what it said on the tin, and nothing more. But that isn't always a bad thing.Jurassic World has been open for years and has been successful. But (in a surprisingly meta move) marketing believes that audiences are tired of dinosaurs and that the way around the issue is to create something new, something bigger with more teeth. But when that gets out, a whole theme park full of people is in danger.Jurassic World did get some things wrong. There is a military subplot that goes nowhere and is really stupid, not to mention it wastes the talent of Vincent D'Onofrio. It over uses CGI, which doesn't always look the best. Despite the concept, there is only 1 scene where dinosaurs attack the public on mass. The rest of the film is very restricted, with four characters running through the jungle. The script feels like it was written by 2 different people or groups of people (it was), and that one of these groups was more skilled than the other (Jaffa and Silver).But Jurassic World also got a lot right. First off, it is a blast to watch! It doesn't capture Spielberg's magic, but it does thrill and awe in its own way. It is the tamest of the entire series, but it does feel a little more geared towards children than the others, which isn't a bad thing.It has some likable characters, who aren't as memorable as before, but you don't want to see them die, with a couple of exceptions. All are played by good actors. The story with the hybrid and the raptors is fun and well handled. I personally really enjoyed the kids part of the story, and could have followed them all the way through. While it doesn't reach the heights of the original, it does understand what made it special.The park being open was a wonderful treat. The one scene where crowds are attacked is great. The climax is one of my favourite action scenes of the 2010s. It's visually nice, has a wonderful sense of adventure and is simply good popcorn fun.World gets a lot of flack, especially after the release of the disappointing Fallen Kingdom and the even worse Dominion. But the fact that it had such hype and, for the most part, met it is a huge accomplishment. For my money, it is the best of the Jurassic sequels: being more creative than 3, not as confused as Lost World. It is just a bit of chaotic dino fun, which is fun for the family, even those with little kids. And in the end what more do you want.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Perhaps you have heard/Seen the movie ""Jurassic Park"" or the new one ""Jurassic World"". This story is about a group of scientists who made ""Jurassic World"" and they genetically created a modified Dinosaur killing intelligent machine! That manages to break free and camouflage to hide from the scientists and then eat them. So the scientist's and a boy named Grey are on a trip with his brother Zach to Jurassic World but didn't know there was a outbreak.So basically the whole start of the story is Zachary ""Zach"" Mitchell is a teenage boy who was present for the incident at Jurassic World, with his younger brother, Gray. He is the older son of Karen and Scott, as well as the older nephew of Claire Dearing, the Park Operations Manager of Jurassic World.Gray Mitchell is the younger brother of Zach, as well as the son of Karen and Scott and the nephew of Claire Dearing. Jurassic World took place at A marvelous place called Jurassic Park it took place in 1990 Claire Dearing is the park operations manager of Jurassic World, the younger sister of Karen Mitchell, the sister-in-law of Scott Mitchell and the aunt of Zach and Gray. Owen Grady is a dinosaur researcher employed by Jurassic World, and one of two main protagonists in Jurassic World, the other being Claire Dearing. He conducts a behavioral research on Velociraptors. Personally In my opinion Owen was a really good actor in Jurassic World and so Was Aunt Claire Gray did a pretty good job too it was intense in the movie and Zach was always the Hero in the movie, For example he jump started the Truck. The stuff I liked about Jurassic World was it was intense and dangerous and I felt sad and maybe I cried when the raptor part but you won't see me cry unless i'm really hurt. But the character I hated the most was Dr. Hoskins he is evil. The lesson I learned from this movie is don't mess with nature and or modify it otherwise we are all dead. I think others will learn not to trust their Aunt because Aunt Claire messed up she almost killed everyone with just a stupid modified dinosaur.The group of people I think would like this movie are adventure seekers maybe kids 8 Or 9 and adults but otherwise it's pretty intense and I would not","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

We find ourselves in a world where after twenty so years we now have an active park open for business in Isla Nublar. That's right, after the disaster of the original park, the island also known as Jurassic World, is open to the public. Won't people ever learn? So now we have dinosaurs and people, like a zoo however in the background we have scientists and greedy people who are continuously exploiting the study of genetics. Due to the executives needing to gain more market share and more money, they need more impressions which means, more teeth. The scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur, the Indominus Rex and what happens when a monster is created from the science lab escapes from its cage? It prowls around onto the park with a knack to hunt and kill...so yeh everything goes horribly wrong!This new world still touches on the original series, which can be highlighted by the control guy wearing the original Jurassic Park shirt proudly. The new flick has awesome new characters - one in particular played by the always cool Chris Pratt who plays Owen Grady, an ex-military who trains a group of raptors since they were hatched. He plays out the alpha to the raptors. Grady's character understands that dinosaurs are living creatures, not science tests. Pratt's performance is awesome here, the motor bike scene through the jungle among the raptors on the pursuit of the Indominus Rex was savage and gangster. His training of the raptors and his bond with one in particular, Blue is cool as. The co-stars including Bryce Dallas Howard playing as Claire has her own moments from a corporate marketing slave to yeppp we stuffed up and now its to save people I love and survive. One thing I do not get is what is with the heels????? To me I feel like the writers held her back, she did have a cool bit with the T-Rex, but again the heels?? As mentioned, there are throwbacks to the original including the mad scientist Dr. Henry Wu, the DNA cartoon which you see for a second or two, the analogy of birds and dinosaurs, how flares hype up a T-Rex and Hammond's ""spare no expense"" phrase.The director does justice in this film by ensuring there is a homage to the original films while making this new flick its own. There are other great parts including the Indominus Rex having camouflage like abilities, an unlikely prehistoric duo battling the Indominus Rex, which is really impressive and a great watch of the final battle. I also like how the T-Rex went through the Spinosaurus skeleton as a nod to the third flick 😉 A few nods include the pterosaurs flying around the resort and the death of an unlucky assistant who gets devoured by the park's whale like attraction, the Mosasaurus. Unlike its original predecessor there is no animatronics, so the film is heavy on the CGI. If you like action and adventure and how man and dinosaur can fight side by side, then watch this film - overall 8.2/10","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

In the year of studio attempts to re-vitalize dead sci-fi franchises, it's Jurassic Park's turn. We all know how most of these types of films turn out(Mad Max excluded.) It's rare when the fan base of a film embraces one of these. They've got greed, marketing, and goals to make it big overseas all over them. So it's up to the director and the writer to try and get around it, to get their vision worked into to something that is the closest thing to a manufactured product in the movie industry. With this film, director Colin Trevorrow(Safety Not Guaranteed) has tried to turn it into a ""meta"" joke. Constant references to how ""the old park was cooler"" or how ""these dinosaurs are becoming products"" are funny when they work, and a little painful when they don't. And that's basically the movie. When it works, it re-captures, if not Spielbergian wonder, at least early Michael Bay. When it doesn't, it feels more like late Michael Bay. In the film, Jurassic World is a national sensation, and they are trying to boost their sales by making a ""new dinosaur."" In the indominus Rex. The head of all this is a caricature of a working woman, who is super-organized, not married, and bad with kids(a worn out cliché we've seen a thousand times.) She's played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who's fine, though she's not given much. When said dinosaur escapes, she teams up with a sexy man with huge abs that's basically good at everything. This caricature of a male hero is played by Chris Pratt. He's definitely the joy of the movie. His lines are the funniest, hit the hardest, and made me wish I was watching Guardians 2. To further complicate things, Dallas Howard's two nephews are also in the park. One is really horny and the other is sad about his parents divorce. A representative from Ingen(Vincent D'Onofrio) is trying to buy velociraptors for war in the middle east. That actually happens. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is asinine, and when Dallas Howard breaks down and cries over a dead dinosaur when she's just watch 10 humans get brutally murdered, I lost all hope for a return to form for the franchise. There's also the matter of the child performances. It's safe to say that most sitcoms get better kid actors nowadays. But, on the positive side of things, the film looks great, and the action is shot well. That in itself is a revelation. When Pterodactyls fly over a screaming crowd, when a giant sea monster eats a shark, when the indominus Rex attacks, it feels like a real blockbuster. In one scene, an assistant suffers a prolonged demise at the hands of several dinosaurs. It's easily the best scene in the film. It feels like the original, when a greedy lawyer met his end in a prolonged sequence inside a bathroom stall. Like I said, a lot of the self-referential jokes actually work, and add a bit of depth to this otherwise childishly shallow affair. Honestly, ""Jurassic World"" isn't terrible, but it's certainly not good either. It's a bit of a mess, but a mess that kind of works. It's just okay, and for a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made, just okay is not good enough.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Seeking a way to boost visitor attendance the park scientists create a new, genetically modified hybrid dinosaur known as the Indominus rex but, just like in years past, they quickly learn it's unwise to fool with Mother Nature when the creature escapes captivity and threatens the safety of everyone (both man and animal) on the island. Now the race is on as the park's head trainer (Pratt), and the park operations manager (Howard), attempt to quell the crisis before some venal corporate types can carry out their own agenda.

That's always a bad sign, and means usually inconsistent, at times messy plot and other not good things. While I'm sucker for dinosaur movies. Later prevailed, so I went to watch it. It was better than expected in first 30 minutes. Not that whole family picture and departure was even close to something original, but was decent, and idea and explanation of need for creating new, more spectacular dinos because ""classic"" ones became boring is actually pretty realistic description of today situation in entertainment industry.Idea about training raptors is a bit of extreme, but don't forget that raptors were shown in Crichton's book (where all this started) as super intelligent, fast, cooperative specie. At least in movie they gave more realistic top speed for them than in book (80 instead 100 km/h) . Talking about 2 leg ones, just to add. But here ends short list in what this could be better than book, or first two Jurassic movies. Character development is just poor, 2 main character relation development was what made me laugh couple times - kiss in first place, then wise words at end :-) a CGI was not bad, but could be better in 2015. For a World, there should be really more dino species shown.Now the bad, and very bad part(s): lot of it was just replica of first Jurassic movie, and little from second: the kids on Islar, stupid park (Island/World) control ... Ending should be some climax, but it was just lame. There was no sense in that attacking of I-Rex by raptors after what happened before. And all it was in first movie, almost same. I hope that everyone saw it, so this is not spoiler. It seems, that writers went out of ideas completely at end. Military subplot was also pretty lame, and really unrealistic - not that I think about them as some very smart people, but this was way too low.Rating is still 6 after all bad words about, because good start, some good (for pure fun) scenes, like attacking by pterodactyls.

My favorite childhood franchise is ruined, thank you Howard and Trevorrow . If jurassic par 3 is 5.9 rating on IMDb, this movie must be rated 0, stupid unfunny family action, with no suspense, no thrilling, no logic, with white mutant dinosaur who symbolized - new CGI Hollywood era, who is killing old Animatronic dinosaurs ( scene with dying Diplodocus). Studios used our favorite characters for making stupid 12+ movies for big box office like the main human antagonist of this picture. No dark atmosphere, no rain, no jungle,no chase, only stupid jokes. The whole movie set in sunny day, u can't make a good movie without atmosphere, characters in JW talking that dinosaurs are no more interesting for people and specially kids, but problem in shitty performance , in woman as a lead character( this movie for teens for boys who care about redhead witch) , in shitty jokes, in cliché dialogues and good old dinosaurs and bad new dinosaurs, come on this is story about people vs nature, not about bad and good monsters. A lot of characters just disappeared with no end of their story line ( where is Omar Sy?) velociraptors are tamed by Chris Pratt, seriously!?!!? If you are shitty director- even great CGI dinosaur battle can't save ur adventure movie. The whole movie redhead witch is talking about budget of Jurassic World, wtf? Use this screen time foe showing rare types of dinosaurs... Okay this is the shittiest movie of the year, Stephen, dear, please come back to sci-fi movies, we don't want to see another boring, trivial biopic dramas like Lincoln, im done.","125 out of 255 found this helpful.

So awesome.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3258597/?ref_=tt_urv","rachel-673-19946","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22919981/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2015","If I were to tell you the dubious sequence of sheer unlikely happenstance that leads to, well, the whole plot of JURASSIC WORLD, you would shake your head in abject wonder. Wonder at the downright ballsiness of the writers who decided to make coincidence their bitch throughout proceedings. Wonder at the director who pondered the laws of random chance and decided statistical anomalies happen all the damn time, not to mention consecutively and to the very same people. And then you would stop shaking your head, and simply begin to wonder: why don't I care?After which, since I am certain you have seen the first movie, along with possibly one or both of the earlier sequels (the second being the slightly lesser of two evils, but only in the same way that Kourtney is less insufferable than Kim), you would doubtless realize why it is that all the shoddy plot-devicing, lame expositioning and cynical jump-scaring does not matter a jot. Because the first JURASSIC PARK was also full of shameless flukes and incongruous twists of fate, but you, me, we all loved it anyway. Because: DINOSAURS.And here, woah are there dinosaurs. There are dinosaurs of so many shapes, sizes and varieties that they had to make up a whole new kind of one just to keep things interesting, because people apparently suck and somehow dinosaurs being ALIVE and IN ARMS REACH can get so very dull after a while. See, the folks at InGen, the company founded by the late demented, er, lamented impresario John Hammond have somehow recovered from no less than three deadly dino-rampages across a couple of decades – not to mention the pterodactyls that remained at large in San Diego at the end of III – and have built themselves a theme park the likes of which crazy old' Hammond could only have dreamed. Twenty thousand visitors a day, we are told not infrequently, now visit this exotic CGI wonderland on the ill-fated Isla Nublar in order to be dazzled by formerly extinct life- forms both docile and dangerous -- because, yeah, obviously. There are DINOSAURS there. No one is going to worry about that one time Newman from SEINFELD got killed when you can go hang with a Stegosaurus and be all like, whatever man.Overseeing all of this marvel and majesty is Claire (the preternaturally beautiful Bryce Dallas Howard), a woman who has time to painstakingly maintain a shiny blowout in South American humidity but not to take personal charge of the nephews she hasn't seen in seven years. These nephews have been sent thither because there is Trouble at Home – of which we are told but honestly DO NOT CARE and why this is even a thing we are told WE DO NOT KNOW – but Claire is far too busy getting Verizon to sponsor an exhibit (hello, one of many product placements!) and engaging in a love-hate romance with heroic raptor trainer Owen (an even-buffer-than-GUARDIANS Chris Pratt) to escort them around the park. Too busy, that is, until a convoluted and bordering on impossible string of nonsense conspires to see the boys – the older of whom is Ryder from MELISSA AND JOEY, and no, you may not mock me for knowing that – lost in the rain-forest with, and you won't even believe this, a killer dinosaur on the loose.The killer dinosaur on the loose part is actually good news for Ryder from MELISSA AND JOEY, because it is one of the few times he notices he's on an island full of dinosaurs. See, he's a disaffected teenager with Beats by Dre headphones and an eye to the cuties, so Triceratops rides and baby dino petting zoos are kids' stuff, yo. He's all about the hardcore adventuring, like recklessly taking his dinosaur-obsessed little brother deep into a restricted zone in a personal gyroscope that I hope is a real thing, and thence almost getting killed by, and you won't even believe this, a killer dinosaur on the loose.So it is up to the sparky Claire and Owen to save the boys, and also try, and you won't even believe this, to stop that killer dinosaur on the loose from killing everyone on the damn island. All the usual suspects are present and accounted for: there's a mad scientist, a mad billionaire and a mad weapons dealer (the always excellent Vincent d'Onofrio, in a very strange choice of role). There is also a somewhat mad but lovable system tech (NEW GIRL's Jake Johnson) who is the funniest thing in the film by far, since Pratt plays his action hero lead almost entirely straight—and, somehow, with a straight face. ""THAT is no dinosaur!"" he pronounces sternly at one point. Riiight.But it is actually the dinosaurs who do most of the heavy lifting in this movie, and it is for them that you really need to see it. Because you know what the other movies in this franchise were always missing? Giant dinosaur death matches! And, much like TRANSFORMERS – giant robots vs. giant robots! – and PACIFIC RIM – giant robots vs. giant monsters! – it is this spectacle that makes all the wackiness here worthwhile.There are several reasons to see this movie. Nostalgia is definitely a factor, as is the cast, as are the stunning visual effects up to and including the kick-est-ass dinosaurs you have ever seen on screen. The only real reason not to see it is that it has so many story problems it would make a daytime soap writer working on this month's seventh amnesia plot line grimace incredulously. But really, if you like dinosaurs, and if unconscionable acts of improbable concurrence aren't a deal-breaker for you, then I'm betting you'll find JURASSIC WORLD and its killer dinosaurs on the loose so much fun you won't even believe it.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

We went a couple weeks after the movie was released and it was possibly the greatest IMAX experience ever! I loved almost every minute and every second of Jurassic World and although it's not as good as the first Jurassic Park, I think it's equal to The Lost World which I also enjoyed. When we ere sitting in the theatre, I was already hyped when the Universal logo popped up on screen and that may tell you that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park Franchise and I love all of the movies minus Jurassic Park III which i'm not a huge fan of, but it's ok. And I had a BLAST with Jurassic World and I think the idea of adding the new hybrid The Indominus rex is genius! The story really hooked and caught my attention, the CGI was good enough, but I really think they should've added more animatronics and that would've improved the film because in this movie you will find A LOT of CGI and a very little amount of animatronics. The actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great! They're not as great as Sam Neil or Laura Dern from the first Jurassic Park, but they still are very good actors who play as very interesting characters known as Owen and Claire and their performances are really good in this film as well as the kids who are played by Nick Robinson and Ty Sympkins. Jurassic World really surprised me! In fact, it surprised everyone in my theatre. After the movie was over and the credits were rolling, the audience was clapping and I have NEVER in my life of any movie theatre experienced that kind of feeling and I felt very happy when I left the theatre. Jurassic World is a great sequel even it does not live up to the original,I respect it for what it is and I'm proud to be a fan of this franchise and i'm gonna give Jurassic World a 9.5/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The events don't, however, seem to be etched well enough into the minds of those running Jurassic World, the massive dinosaur theme park that would leave original visionary, John Hammond, beaming with delight. Set twenty-two years after those fateful events, the fully functioning theme park that now occupies Isle Nublar faces dwindling crowds, as visitors grow weary of familiar attractions. In a bid to draw back the masses, a corporate mandate oversees the creation of a new attraction in the form of a hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus rex. Happily for us, the fun merely begins here; although I am sure the island's occupants would strongly disagree. Effects well advanced for their time were what made the original films stand out, and if the effects were good then, they are phenomenal now. The dinosaurs are so realistic; every twitch on their face as they breathe draws you further into the frantic chaos that unravels. Jurassic World certainly ups the 'wow' factor, leaving you awestruck in childlike wonder. There is no comparison to experiencing the might of some of earth's most fearsome predators, with which humans could most definitely not share the planet. The narrative world grows infinitely vaster as new habitats are explored and new exhibits revealed. As Hammond would insist no expense be spared on the park, it seems no expense was spared on creating the films environments, which are truly a spectacular sight.An early released scene, featuring Chris Pratt's Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing debating the park's new addition, received a brutal assessment from Avengers helmer, Joss Whedon. The apt description is unfortunately not limited to that scene, as the ""70's era sexist"" theme seeps further into the plot than could have been intended. Apart from some dodgy dialogue and an incredibly ill timed love story, the leads pull off their roles well. Owen embodies the essence of an alpha male, quite literally when leading a pack of Velociraptors, and Claire, despite her stickler tendencies, proves that she can hold her own, even if it is in heels throughout.Jurassic World explores an interesting human condition: our tendency to bore easily. In a world where tech grows more refined by the day, and scientific leaps are becoming more regular, there is little left that truly amazes us. So when dinosaurs on display have become the norm, people will naturally want more. This in turn invites scientists to push the limits of what is possible; too far in this case. The park's geneticists experiment with an ancient, extinct species, in an attempt to create bigger and better, without full knowledge and understanding of the potential consequences.While the geneticists play 'design-osaurus', an enclosure is created that proves completely unsuited to the formidable creature it is intended to contain. Far more intelligent and subsequently more dangerous than they could possibly have imagined, the Indominus rex renders the park's resources and infrastructure largely inadequate. In an attempt to swiftly clear up a potential financial and reputational disaster, poor planning and lack of preparedness only exacerbate the situation. Jurassic World's shiny new addition is quickly figuring out where it belongs in the food chain, and what they don't want it to realise is that it holds the top spot.You would think a genetically modified dinosaur would ring instant 'bad idea' alarm bells, but failure to see the magnificent creatures for anything other than assets on a spreadsheet means that history is bound to repeat itself to an epic extent. The action certainly doesn't hold back; these creatures are built to kill and the film shows their immense power with chilling consequence. To top it all off, references to the original films, mostly due to Lowery's (Jake Johnson) fondness for collectibles, serve as delightful treats to fans. Jurassic World is not perfect, but will no doubt be a colossal crowd pleaser.https://lilmac4.wordpress.com","19 out of 39 found this helpful.

I was actually squirming in my seat as the opening credits started to roll. (Note to self – to prevent severe anxiety in future, ditch your mates and see a highly anticipated film on opening day, instead of waiting 4 DAYS so you can see it with your Buds. The struggle was real). I mean, look, I'd seen the trailer, I knew going in that it looked a bit shady, some dodgy dialogue and hollow characters, but that didn't dampen my excitement – I mean, its Jurassic Park man!! Right?!?! Dun Daaaa, Dun Daaa, Dun Dun Daaaaa, da dun dun daaaaaaaa.So if you've been fan-girling over this film like me in the lead up to its release, here's some truths that can set your mind at ease. It's not terrible. It doesn't ruin the franchise (At least no more than #3 did – William H Macy, Tea Leoni, I'm lookin at you dudes). Chris Pratt continues to be awesome. Dinosaurs are BADASS.The script however, is not. The plot of this film (The Park is open, scientists created a crazy scary monster hybrid dinosaur, you've seen the promos) is almost irrelevant, it's simply a vehicle that gets us to our most desired destination – Seeing big-ass dinosaurs tearing s**t up. Characters are given exceptionally weak set-ups that are so uninteresting that my patience was tested – get to the dinosaurs already!! Chris Pratt rocks as a Raptor trainer (a concept not as far-fetched as the trailer will lead you to believe) however other than channeling his inner Burt Macklin, there's really not much to him. And Jessica Chastain as his co-lead is a total bore – without going too Patricia Arquette on you here, is it too much to ask to have a strong female lead it a film as huge as this? Chastains Claire is your stereotypical uptight and overworked single woman, who has it all except for a man in her life spew. I was half expecting her and Pratt to do the old 'accidently fall on top of each other and almost kiss' moment but thankfully it didn't happen.An over-riding theme of the film is the argument that this Hybrid dinosaur was an unnecessary addition to the park – Dinosaurs are cool enough. You gotta wonder then, how this concept was missed by the writers in applying the same idea to the story. This unstoppable beast of a monster makes the film seem less grounded in the reality that we are used to from the previous films, and more of a fantasy land that is less accessible. No spoilers here, but it's not until the T-Rex is brought in that I felt that old rush of excitement that I had 20 years ago – Dinosaurs are cool enough.But it's still not awful. It's lazy, for sure, and for a film that was pretty much certain to make a TONNE of moula a lot more effort could have gone into making this movie as good as the first. But man, it's still Jurassic Park, still has that feel, that excitement, that sense of fun. And no matter what the reviews, you're still gonna watch it. So go watch it!","4 out of 21 found this helpful.

It was difficult to become endeared to the characters, although by the last 40 minutes they grow on you quite a bit. The action picks up fairly early on but peaks just after the gyroscope scene, in which the film hits a bit of a slump for about 30 minutes.After the gyroscope scene the film becomes a much more by the numbers action movie, but as previously mentioned, by this point the characters are much improved, even though the relationship between Owen and Claire reeks of misogyny.Obviously the main thing you're going to watch this for is the dinosaurs. The Indominous Rex is the star of the show, and the Raptor's are pretty damn good as well even though the sub-plot involving them and Owen is extremely cheesy. Plus there's an appearance from a familiar face who everyone will be cheering for.To summarise, whilst the film fails to emulate the standard of the first film in terms of plot and acting, there is a lot to enjoy here, and the plentiful action scenes are a lot of fun, albeit a little short in duration, but this is understandable as the film pushes the boundaries for it's 12A/PG-13 rating.Overall I would give this film a 7/10.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The dinosaurs look as real as cinematic dinosaurs have ever looked. The storytelling is thuddingly dull. I loved the Steven Spielberg / Michael Crichton 1993 ""Jurassic Park."" During this film I kept looking at my watch. Even the music is used badly here, something you notice in the first five minutes of the film. The plot: Jurassic Park has been updated to Jurassic World. Two cute boys visit without their mother. Their aunt is Bryce Dallas Howard, spokeswoman for the park. Vincent D'onofrio wants to weaponize the velociraptors, to use them in the fight against Al Qaeda. Chris Pratt is a velociraptor trainer. Jurassic World has genetically modified dinosaurs into indominus rex, a larger version of a tyrannosaurus rex. Chris Pratt is hot and masterful and deserves a better movie. Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty but lacks charisma. Vincent D'Onofrio's twitchy, creepy opportunist is the single most interesting and menacing performance in the movie, and that includes the dinos. None of this – the two cute boys, the absent mother, the aunt-nephew relationship, Pratt's animal training skills, the weaponization of velociraptors – matters worth a darn. Each subplot is given approximately five lines of dialogue and four minutes of screen time. BD Wong pops up at the last minute and he acts like a mad scientist for about ninety seconds; that subplot goes nowhere like all the rest. There are many scenes of people in a control room staring at a large video screen. Sometimes on screen action is presented in a color- bleached format, to resemble the image on a computer screen. This control-room-point-of-view device serves only to break up the action into smaller, shorter bites, because in the internet age we all have shorter attention spans and we see reality as on a computer screen, don't ya know. The opening scenes show visitors enjoying the park. Then of course something goes wrong and the I-rex escapes. The I-rex eats a bunch of people. Some escapees find a twenty-year-old Jeep from Jurassic Park days and drive it away from the I-rex. I don't know much about cars but I do know that there is a car in a local parking lot that's been there for three months and two of its tires have gone flat. I would believe that you could make dinosaurs out of amber before I could believe that a twenty-two-year-old Jeep could be driven. People outrun dinosaurs, if they are people the movie wants to survive. If they are extras or bad guys, no such luck. And why is it such a bad idea to use velociraptors to fight Al Qaeda? Bryce Dallas Howard outruns dinosaurs while wearing spike heeled shoes. Really. It's amazing that dinosaurs have one goal in life – to eat as many people as they can – given that dinosaurs and people didn't inhabit the earth at the same time. An aviary containing pterodactyls is broken. The pterodactyls swarm out of their aviary and have one goal – to eat people. All the pterodactyls immediately fly to the park full of humans and start snapping them up as if they were potato chips – you can't eat just one. This is especially ridiculous given that pterodactyls were lightweight dinosaurs who evolved to eat fish. Animals in nature kill to eat, to defend their young and their territory, and to establish dominance. Killing is hard work and animals conserve their energy. They don't burn up any more precious calories than they absolutely need to. Timothy Treadwell spent thirteen years annoying one of earth's largest land carnivores, Kodiak bears, before one couldn't take it any more and finally broke down and ate him. Dinosaurs in Jurassic World race through forest, swamp, and parking lots, top speed, mile after mile, passing up other potential prey, in order to eat one particular human being. No real animal has ever behaved that way. I just didn't care about this movie at all. I missed the original. Wayne Knight, the obnoxious fat guy, and Jeff Goldblum, and his priceless pronunciation of ""chaotician."" I missed Spielberg's magic touch in moments like the impact tremor in the footprint and ""objects in mirror are closer than they appear.""","136 out of 280 found this helpful.

This movie not only reminds you how beautiful the story is of restoring Dinosaur and put them in place where people can see them, but also how advanced science can be a messed up thing if you play with it too much and can create a deadly weapon if it got abused...

The introduction of a brand new genetically modified dinosaurs was clever, and probably one of the only things they could've done in a new installment. The cast gets a big party of the success of this film. Bryce Dallas Howard was great here, aside from her acting, she ran in heels through entire movie, I don't care what you say, that's impressive. Chris Pratt was awesome in his role, he really nailed it! The film had great action sequences, good special effects and pretty good dialogue too. They really transformed and modernized Jurassic park for a new generation. The kids were great in their roles as well! I'm glad this film is getting good reviews so far, it deserves it! It wasn't too gory or disturbing, it had just enough roughness and gore. But overall it was very fun and entertaining! I think if your a Jurassic world fan, you'll like it!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, some of it is overdone. As a huge fan of the original (Jurassic Park), I was slightly disappointed as I was waiting for the awe that never quite happened. The story line was weak, the acting nothing special but the movie was visually stunning at times.I have little doubt Jurassic World will be a great winner for those who are not familiar with the original (Jurassic Park) and I am sure that number is massive since it has been 20+ years. It is not necessary to know the original to enjoy this movie although some references might be slightly clearer.All in all - a good endeavor and, after all, it is hard to beat that scene in Jurassic Park of the first look at the dinosaurs in the plains.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Surely Universal Studios cant be so short of money that they need to resurrect a franchise that finished fifteen years ago ? That said dinosaurs have an absolute fascination to humans in general and children in particular and I used to love these dinosaur movies courtesy of Ray Harryhausen and who can forget the classic DOCTOR WHO story Invasion Of The Dinosaurs where the population of London has to get evacuated due to the sudden appearance of papier mache reptiles . In short you can't go wrong with dinosaurs if you're after mass commercial appeal . Despite the dangers of flogging a dead horse Universal are probably playing things a bit safe by bringing out another franchise film And play it safe they do . There's not a lot of originality on display here and much of the first half plays out as you might expect it . These greedy corporate capitalists have changed the balance of nature by opening a theme park featuring animals that died out tens of millions of years ago and worse than that they've modified the dinosaurs so that not only do you think you're watching a retread of the original JURASSIC PARK movies complete with the same musical soundtrack you're also watching a reworking of The Company from the ALIEN movies . This is also reflected in the rather one note , thin characters who populate the story At this point you might start worrying Universal fleeced out of the price of a cinema ticket and you're getting more of the same that you got with the first three films but the saving grace here is just how nasty things get . My problem with the second JP is once the action switches to mainland America there's not much in the way of a high body count , This is certainly not a problem here and director Colin Trevorrow knows what the audience wants and gives it to them by the bucket load as numerous faceless red shirt types suffer all sorts of spectacular deaths . It might sound a little bit mean but I was surprised as to how enjoyable the action scenes were . Spectacular deaths and dinosaurs ? What more do you want from a blockbuster ?","45 out of 107 found this helpful.

The sheer terror of the Indominus Rex, the terrifying raptors, and relatable characters who all bring their own message, whether it be innocence and wonderment with Gray, the obsession with technology with Zach, the obsession with money with Claire, or just having a good time with Owen.The park is well and truly open. The sheer number of people in danger was fantastic to see how they each individually coped with the dinosaur rampage. Excellent coordination from Colin Trevorrow, every extra knew their job and did it well.You'll have goosebumps the first time you hear the theme tune.Colin Trevorrow took the might task of reviving Jurassic Park, and he completely blew it out of the water.

It seems like the ""Jurassic"" franchise worked its way onto this bus a while back and never stepped off. It's a shame to say that even by today's movie standards ""Jurassic World"" wasn't the end of the road for the series, even today's CGI couldn't save it (Might have even been what killed it?).This film is a stellar example as to why rehashing and rebooting movies doesn't work when you don't change anything... Now actually, that's not fair really, I mean this film did change things, for starts it removed nearly all the practical effects we cherished in the original, it also featured a lot more running (Because why not), it aimed to make dinosaurs more human and more relatable (Clearly because the first movie shamed them so much) and I almost forgot (Probably because it's so insignificant) the films called ""Jurassic World"" not ""Jurassic Park"".To be honest though I knew what to expect, I think most people knew this franchise had been going nowhere since they went to the pictures in 1997. So I can't rate it really badly because that would assume that I expected this film to be great and I didn't. It was actually a great average film, nothing more nothing less, well maybe a bit less.Conclusion: What you see is what you get, you don't like it, well...","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The premise of Jurassic World is that audiences are stupid","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3256743/?ref_=tt_urv","lukecypert","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60909564/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2015","I feel like the entire premise of Jurassic World was to say that audiences are stupid. Of course most audiences aren't literate enough to get that they are being dissed. That said, I enjoyed the movie lots a lots *smile emoticon*#JurassicWorld was loads of fun. I enjoyed basically every moment. As long as you can ignore the fact that animals don't really behave like that and that you know the ending and who will die from the moment you see each character (as the entire movie follows the well established formula of monster movies) then you should have a grand time! And I did! Probably since I expected a pretty straightforward action/thriller I was in the right mindset to accept a pretty straightforward action/thriller.Spoilers below:In the film, the reason the business people created the mega-ultra-super dinosaur was because audiences wouldn't come unless the dinosaurs were bigger and badder. Then the movie proceeds to tromp that bigger badder dinosaur around releasing mayhem on the island until the bigger badder battles the little bads, then the little bads team up with another big bad until the biggest baddest eats the bigger badder.The movie says directly, ""audiences aren't wowed by dinosaurs,"" we need a 3-way CG dino battle ended by an even bigger CG dino to make audiences happy. So when the movie audience hears that the on screen audiences aren't wowed by regular dinosaurs, we shake our heads and think ""those dumb people need to appreciate what they have and not always want things over the top!"" Then the movie says ""YOU WANT THINGS OVER THE TOP."" And when the real audience is given over the top, we nod along and say, ""yeah, that's what I wanted!"" But we're not smart enough to draw the connections and see what we're being dissedBut who knows, maybe that was unintentional?Either way, the movie is a great time. I loved the characters, I loved the way the story was told. I think everything was top shelf. Congrats to everyone who worked on the film!If you like Jurassic Park movies, then you'll love this sequel.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

My reoccurring question throughout this film was who told Chris Pratt he could act?? It's literally one of the most lazy, dreary performances I have yet to see in a Summer blockbuster. Bryce Dallas Howard, on the contrary, can act but she is fed dialogue from an uneven script with many awkward attempts at...well... humor?... I'm guessing? The one refreshing role in this film is the one played by Irrfan Khan, yet here again he suffers from a lame script and a one-trick pony of a running joke about him not flying a helicopter well. Despite watching these one-dimensional characters through 3-D glasses, ""Jurassic World"" is still a semi-fun flick to kick off the Summer. Hopefully it's far from the best of the 2015 Summer blockbusters, however.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Could they really create the same magic from the original? I would say YES! Okay, there's nobody (apart from Henry Wu-from Jurassic Park and who has a bigger role to play) in this movie from the original films but the director did state that it wasn't about throwing the same people into the same scenario over and over again. Nostalgia wise there's plenty for you to sink your teeth into and you will find yourself saying ""I remember that"" which is both thrilling and comforting. The new characters are great and add a new freshness to the franchise. The CGI is actually quite impressive. I couldn't really fault it. There are a few situations in this movie where you feel that edge of seat terror (Gyrosphere scene) and also a couple of genuine funny moments. The dinosaurs are a spectacle to see and the park itself looks totally lush. The story ticks along nicely as your straight in there from the start. You of course know things are going to go awry but that's the fun of it. It certainly brought me back to my youth and my 7 year old nephew loved it as much as I did. Definitely give it a go and maybe you will feel that rich sensation of something so familiar yet something exciting and new which both combined make a genuinely mega sci-fi spectacular !!!!

I had so much expectations regarding this movie, but unfortunately it turned out to be not so satisfactory as i expected.The plot is most stolen from the Jurassic Park. A lot of episodes resemble the first part, but without the same spirit of suspense, tension and soul. ""Jurassic Park"" is the movie of my childhood, i remember my feelings after first watching it. It was something inexplicable, i desired to become a paleontologist and to create something like Jurassic Park. While the new one is just a blockbuster, well-done for sure, but without the proper atmosphere. But, at the same time, i can't say that it is extremely bad. As a separate movie it is much fascinating, but without any meaning. I like they added a lot of funny situations, but it was needless to create the new individuum. T-rex is a perfect prehistoric murderer and to invent something between T-Rex and Raptors is the foolish thing ever. I understand they were trying to invent a bike, but it doesn't work. The scene with Chris Patt trains a Raptors is great and entertaining and maybe it would be possible to implement if the people had been lived with dinosaurs. Raptors are the most intelligent prehistoric dinosaurs, hypotetically it could be. The 3d effect, the scenery and the movie in general is well-done, but not in comparison with the first one. As an entertaining movie it is worth watching.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's main plot is a new open park full with man made dinosaurs and one day the company decides to make a genetic hybrid to boost the public's attention. But that of course goes horribly wrong and soon enough the hybrid is on the loose and killing people left and right. While all of this is going on, a raptor trainer Owen and the park's owner Clair must stop this monster before a monster mash goes down. First the good. Chris Pratt plays a good role and he is easily the best human character. The action is very entertaining and very pleasing to the eye. The dinosaurs are very cool as always, and the hybrid was awesome. The suspense is one of the strongest things this movie has to offer. But now time for the bad. There are a few people you do not really care about, for example there are two kids in the movie that were completely hollow and didn't have any real purpose except for escaping the dinosaurs. And sometimes this movie can come off as silly when it tries to be cool. So in the end Jurassic World is a fun, action packed, summer blockbuster that may not be as good as the original but has it memorable moments in the Jurassic Park universe. 7/10 Check it out.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Bought tickets for my family, soda, popcorn to the first screening of the night. $70 to be exact. Should have waited for the dollar theater! There is NOTHING new to the story in this film. It's the exact same plot as the first one with sprinkles of the other two films as well. AND, a great Indiana Jones impersonation by Chris Pratt. To be honest, I'm really sick of movie directors who create products that are essentially giant boners over the fact that they get to make something that far better filmmakers began long ago.Let's just say that if they make the next Star Wars the same way they made this, I am going to be looking for revenge.My suggestion is simply this... See the movie but wait until it's in the dollar theater. Spend that $70 at the water park or something.","116 out of 237 found this helpful.

I am a huge fan of the first two Jurassic Park movies (the third one was only okay) and their narratives on the relationship between man and nature so I was excited to see what this movie could add to that. There is a new narrative that I think actually adds quite a bit to the lore of Jurassic Park. The writing was quite good. There are quite a few scenes that focus on the creation of the dinosaurs in the park and humanities illusion of control over them. Unfortunately there are also a lot of small details that ignore major concepts from the first two movies, especially in the theme park ride designs. Not a single one of the rides shown in this film would last a day in the first two films, and some of the designs wouldn't even work in real life (like giving the customers control over the safari vehicles that allow them to move into the animals' territories instead of an automated path or tour guide). There are also many small plot points that were taken straight from the first film. Despite this, once everything begins to fall apart and the focus falls from the attractions, the film really picks up and keeps going till the end. This film is more of a disaster flick than a survival flick, but it manages to feel like a survival movie for most of the core scenes. Most of the characters are well done. They are simple, yet relatable. The only problem I have here is the two brothers. They had a small story arch that was way deeper than it needed to be and in the end went nowhere and did not resolve itself. The special effects were fantastic and while there were times where it was obvious that C.G.I. was involved, there were more times when I couldn't tell if I was watching an animatronic dinosaur or a C.G.I one. There were many great tense moments that really dragged me in and kept me there. If you were a fan of the first couple of films, you will probably enjoy this one. It isn't as good as the first two, but still excellent.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Fares much better than the other sequels but lacks the story and character depth of the original masterpiece as well as the its killer suspense. The performances are solid and the direction is decent but a little generic.It however makes up for it with great special effects, fantastic action sequences and an immense amount of bloody dino carnage. At times it can be a bit much but it holds together fairly well and culminates to a ferocious finale that left the audience screaming and clapping. A solid summer thrill ride that does a great job of reinvigorating the franchise but the best advice i can give the makers of the unavoidable follow up is too slow it down a bit. Anticipation makes the proceedings that much more effective.","22 out of 48 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, on the island resort, Claire (Bruce Dallas Howard), the boy's aunt and senior management figure, has to present the new, genetically created super-monster to some potential investors. To oversee it's behaviour, she selects old flame Owen (Chris Pratt), whose rough, renegade style will have it's ups and downs. But the new super dinosaur has a mind of it's own, and has plans to break free from captivity and wreak havoc on the island.Anyone over the age of thirty is likely to have the original Jurassic Park moulded in to their minds in some way. Even if they never saw the film, the sheer amount of publicity and merchandise it attracted would keep it engraved in their minds. As such, Jurassic World, the spin off film of the series, is serving much the same function as The Phantom Menace did in 1999, for those for whom Star Wars was the film from their youth (and who are over the age of forty!) It's not a heartless, soulless spin off, like many that fall from the Hollywood cookie cutter machine these days, and there is spark and potential in the script, but sadly, while this is evident, it just doesn't manage to really be the sum of it's parts.The idea of Jurassic Park having become a theme park for tourists, with tacky souvenir shops and franchise establishments everywhere, and having the dinosaurs as modern day animals in a modern day zoo ('kids get bored just staring at a stegosaurus these days...' as the Claire character comments at the beginning) is an interesting one, and has the potential to serve as a really good set up. But for some reason, the story moves away from this, and has some disjointed narratives serving as the plot, flitting from Pratt and Howard trying to bring the escaped animals down, to the two boys trying to stay out of harm's way, through to Irrfan Khan and BD Wong fighting for control as the situation worsens. Pratt is the new go to man for this kind of thing, and he is strong and solid in his role here, although Simpkins and Robinson are a pretty cardboard copy of the kids from the first film.Visually, of course, the film is far from a disappointment. The dinosaur designs and effects are even more astonishing than they were twenty years ago, and are a breath-taking spectacle as we watch them battle on the island. Director Colin Trevorrow has managed to stick true to this aspect of what made the original so memorable, but has just failed to serve it with a stronger script or coherent narrative. It basically serves it's purpose, and can't really be called a let down in any way, just something that could have been a little more. ***","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

When the mixed-bred gigantic dinosaur plays tricks and then escapes, the excitement never lets down, right to the end. I can't find (and didn't actually look for) a false note on entertainment. Exciting, engaging, grabbing, and visually breathtaking. Indeed another strong contender for Best Special Visual Effects on Oscar stage. However, the entertainment values of this film seem an alternate to, or as opposed to, those of education or edutainment. The story is made so lame, so dull, and so predictable in every inch of the way, as if filmmakers feared that the educational values would take away those of entertainment. I find this phenomenon very odd. It is given that a filmmaking of this scale should have no problem finding a good story or a good storyteller. There should be no reason for the un-imagination, except it is done on purpose, with quite a wrong notion that viewers can't take both entertainment and education altogether. Some experts on BBC already complain that this film has become a huge ""missed opportunity"". There is a period of 20 years from ""Jurassic Park"" (Part 1) to ""Jurassic World"" (Part 4). Enormous discoveries have been made in the field, and yet any of those new bodies of knowledge hardly find themselves into this film's ""new"" story. ""Jurassic World"" comes close of becoming a classic, only if human characters and social notions were explored and delicately exhibited. This is neither my call nor my wish to turn a money-making machine into a boring school. I simply say to Mr. and Ms. Hollywoods out there: it is not at all difficult, dear, to achieve both ends in one undertaking.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

The theater was sold out, I was by myself, and I viewed the movie in its entirety. As a fan of the Science Fiction Genre, Dinosaurs (both science and mystery of the extinct creatures), and the ""Jurassic Park"" Franchise, I was happy to see another addition to the series. I enjoy movies in 3D and Large Format screens too. I would like to have viewed the movie in an IMAX 3D setting; although, this is a review of ""Jurassic World"" I feel it is important to me to view highly anticipated, new release films in these type of formats. I have no doubt that it is worth the extra fee and part of the modern era movie experience as these films are intended to be viewed in these formats as well. ""Jurassic World"" is mostly awe inspiring but violent. It is not grotesque it is not sickening, if gore is a motive... I do not enjoy gore. There is a lot of blood, bloody meat, flesh eating and flesh tearing. Dinosaurs do have sharp claws and teeth, they also eat other creatures. If you would like to see dinosaurs but do not like to see violence of this nature, my mother still closes her eyes when she is scared or looks away if she feels the moment is too much for her. Most Americans are de-sensitized to violence, children were present and they didn't seem fazed. The plot worked, I'm not sure how much thought was put into it but I liked it. I felt like a tourist with VIP access into the events. The actors executed the script well, I liked the characters. The effects were flawless, CGI was flawless (dinosaurs were beautiful), set and environment... flawless. ""Jurassic World"" delivered. I am a fan, I do not pretend to be an expert reviewer. I enjoy action/adventure and Sci-Fi films. Some people don't enjoy movies in which they did not write, direct, or star. Some people have qualms with violence, main-stream media, Hollywood, capitalism, all things free and fun. I viewed ""Jurassic World"" for what it was, a large group effort to deliver an updated ""Jurassic Park"" Franchise experience for young, old, fans, and new viewers.

Continuing and/or reinventing an iconic franchise is no easy task, and many franchises have failed at this (even Disney/Marvel has just started to loose it's touch with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"").""Jurassic World"" is a film I was both extremely excited and nervous about. Since ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001) was such a disappointment (and possibly one of the worst sequels in movie history), I had some low expectations for this new film. I can happily say, however, that ""Jurassic World"" has brought the franchise back to what made it good in the first place.The film opens up to John Hammond's park being fully realized. It is already thrilling to see this park actually be opened to the public and full of people wanting to see the dinosaurs (almost like a SeaWorld replica). Of course as any Jurassic Park fan knows, this peaceful park won't last long.""Jurassic World"" excels at recapturing the nostalgia of the first film by having the iconic film score return, lots of suspense, violence, and action, fun humor, and great special effects. The cast is fun to watch as well and they give good performances all around. It makes it clear that this was a very fun film to make.The film does have it's share of problems, however. Like most summer blockbusters, some characters have little development and/or have very poor motives. This can take the viewer away from the experience, while also helping them quickly realize what Hollywood tropes are being used again and again.To sum up, while ""Jurassic World"" is very entertaining and engaging, it doesn't break any new ground. It takes all of the good from the franchise and puts it into one solid film. If you are looking for one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, you should go watch this film immediately. If you want a movie that challenges your thinking or has complex characters, I suggest holding off on this one.""Jurassic World"" 3 out of 4 stars Movie Recommendations (If you like it): Jurassic Park (1993), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Star Wars (1977), Jaws (1975) Movie Recommendations (If you don't like it): Alien (1979), X-men (2000), Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Interstellar (2014)","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

Now, history as proved that the Jurassic Park sequels are not that good, the second one is only half as good as the first one and the third one is plain bad. Jurassic World is the best sequel to Jurassic Park, but unfortunately, that isn't saying much.The action picks up 20 years later after the first one, and now the tourist attraction known as Jurassic Park is called Jurassic World. But dinosaurs have been around for so long that the audience starts to lose it's interest in the subject so the higher-ups come with a new attraction, Indominus Rex, a genetically modified dinosaur with elements from other animals. And of course, things go wrong. As one character quips in the movie: ""These people never learn"".This is not a bad movie, but it's also not very good. It misses the great characters, the stunning visuals, the breathtaking imagery of the first one. This becomes a generic CGI-driven monster movie. It's fun, but it has no heart. A big complaint for me is the overuse of CGI for the dinosaurs. There are a lot of scenes where it simply looks fake. And you know that is not a good thing when a movie released in 1993 has better looking dinosaurs than one in 2015.As far as the actors go, this movie is lead by Chris Pratt who plays Owen Grady, a former marine who now trains raptors. He does the best he can, but this tough guy, bad-ass type role doesn't really work for him in contrast with his more goofy roles from Guardians of the Galaxy or Parks and Recreation. But of course, he has some funny one-liners, and, for the most part, he delivers. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the park's manager, and I'm sorry to say, but she's not doing a very good job. Vincent D'Onofrio as the head of the security does a decent job, and the two kids, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are good also, especially Ty Simpkins, who comes from his nice role in Iron Man 3.All in all, this movie is a fun summer ride, with some nice action and suspense, but doesn't come any near the magic of the first one. I give this movie a 6 out of 10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was very excited for this movie as it looked like it would be fun to see and I really liked the first ""Jurassic Park"", the other two weren't the best. This movies CGI looked great and it just seemed like it was real entertainment. And I was right!! The movie was really enjoyable and it wasn't my favorite movie, mainly because it has already been done before, but it was a great time in the theater. The movie was a lot like the first mainly because you can't really do much with the story if you're making another movie with the same idea. This movie I couldn't really see being done better, because I don't really think that they should make too many more of these movies as they'll get old fast. I can relate it to the Transformers franchise, it started out fun and enjoyable, but as the years went on the more movies they were making the worse they got. The movie was everything I hoped it would be. I know it sounds like I'm really contradicting myself, because I said it was good not great, but that's what I thought it would be, and that's what it was. I think there are many movies that I've seen that are very good movies, but they aren't very enjoyable like ""Jurassic World"". ""Jurassic World"" was a movie that has a very high replay value as it is a movie that I would want to watch over and over unlike many movies that I've seen that I thought were very good. ""Jurassic World"" was a fun movie and really helped people understand why they say movies are entertainment. It's not a movie that just tries to teach you something for two hours, it's a movie that is purely for enjoyment and it did a good job in that aspect.","20 out of 44 found this helpful.

As an action movie, this movie is good. It helps you forget Jurassic Park III, but it's between Jurassic Park and The Lost World. The problem was that it tries to be sophisticated, but it fails to do so. It's a commentary on how corporations can be evil, and when mankind messes with nature, nature fights back. It's similar in themes with Jurassic Park (1993), but it feels artificial in its effort to capture Spielberg's vision in the land of the dinosaurs.The two brothers in the movie, Zach and Gray Mitchell, are a similar throwback to Timmy and Lex from the original movie. It tried to add heart to the movie with a conversation about parents who might be divorcing, but it was never brought up again. It was filler. Chris Pratt saved this movie for the most part. He was a little funny and sarcastic, but he was also a tough guy who knows how to survive and deal with the dinosaurs. However, his character was too strong, so there wasn't a lot of fear that he would fail to save the day.The cinematography of the movie was one of the better parts of the movie, since it showed majestic views of Hawaii and added CGI to parts of island. There was also blatant product placement of Mercedes Benz cars, since they looked too good and pronounced from the rest of the scenery.The movie is unevenly paced, and the first two acts are a drag to sit through. You don't care about the brothers because they don't blend in as well, since they stick out as plot devices and filler. The 3rd act is the best part of the movie because there's more action, Chris Pratt, and dinosaurs, instead of the brothers and dinosaurs. However, the Indominus Rex should be called PlotDeviceasaurus Rex. It's a genetically modified dinosaur that's the antagonist of the movie and there were mixed feelings about it. The ""natural and regular"" dinosaurs were more believable than that behemoth. The special effects of the dinosaurs blended in well with the environment and they were believable. The abilities of the Indominus Rex were inconsistent, and they didn't work that well at times to benefit the main characters. Pratt does action and comedy well, but this movie held him back. However, he was different from his Star-Lord character, since he was more serious.Jurassic World is a good and thrilling action movie, but don't expect the heart from the Jurassic Park (1993). It lacks the intelligence and sophistication of the original, but it makes it up with the action, dinosaurs, and Chris Pratt. It also tries to throwback to the original with blatant nods to it with its themes and certain scenes. In its attempt to be sophisticated, it avoids bar set by Jurassic Park III and The Lost World. It's a decent reboot, but the next installments better exceed this attempt.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

After 14 years of rewrites, recasts and director-swapping, the long-awaited fourth instalment arrives with anticipation and high-expectations, and the park is finally open to the public. Now sitting happily as the third highest grossing film of all time, it would seem that the world is still fascinated by dinosaurs, but Jurassic World knows its audience won't be content with the beasties that came before, and has gone for bigger and scarier. By creating its own dinosaur, the formidable (and ridiculously-named) Indominus rex, it certainly achieves this, and also serves as a commentary on corporate and consumer greed.20 years after Dr. Alan Grant gazed upon the sights of Isla Nublar for the first time, Jurassic World is the planet's biggest theme park. Brothers Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) head to the park to stay with their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is the operations manager. With audience demand on the increase, Claire has overlooked the development of the next big attraction, the lab- created Indominus Rex, which possesses high intelligence along with a collection of attack and defence abilities wound into its DNA from other animals. Navy veteran and velociraptor handler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) thinks its a bad idea, and upon his inspection of the indominus pen, he notices claw marks on the walls and the creature nowhere to be found.Jurassic World still very much follows the formula of what came before - characters arrive, think they're safe, and are soon fleeing and screaming from a variety of giant lizards - but at least director Colin Trevorrow has moved the story on. While throwing in a few new elements, it covers a lot of themes covered in the first movie, with a corporate bigwig (Vincent D'Onofrio) hoping to play God for his own - albeit less innocent - means, and ignoring the warnings of an expert with a better understanding of nature, while children who may just be wiser than their elders find themselves in mortal peril. Yet there is a certain charm to the film's nostalgic elements, and the set-pieces - which range from the exhilarating to the ridiculous - finally feel deserving of John Williams' iconic score.You could pull the film to pieces if you're looking for plot-holes (how would a dinosaur bred in captivity, regardless of its intelligence, know to rip a tracking device out of itself?), but the indominus, despite its McGuffin status, is a suitably nasty antagonist, casually committing genocide as it carves its bloody path towards the tourist centre. Anyone who loved Jurassic Park for its science may be disappointed, as all sense of reality goes out of the window - this is a movie where velociraptors team up with humans to fight a greater threat. But as a film of pure spectacle, it's massively entertaining. It's well aware that it is pandering to a young audience brought up on quick-fixes and everything at their fingertip, and makes a point of this by showing hordes of snot-nosed kids running around the park lacking any sense of wonder. Will humanity ever learn? Unless the plan is to set its recently- announced sequel in a world where man and dinosaur live together in harmony, I guess not.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The kids served no greater purpose to the film other than being the subject of rescue. The beginning where the movie introduced the kids and their family problems were all very pointless and boring. The movie only became better when Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard entered the scene and became the main focal point of the movie. (Why didn't the main characters start of the film is my question).The beginning of the movie lacked direction but it gathered itself once the crisis began. Chris Pratt's character Owen is so cool. I also really like how this film has a strong female character who is smart and is equally tough. References to Jurassic Park definitely made this installment nostalgic.As a side note, the unique part of the movie promotion is that Jurassic World and Masrani have their own website as if it exists in real life.

I think it first fools you into thinking it was going to be a horror flick and kind of disappoints in the lightness it goes into during the perilous scenes. After making a death defying jump you laugh it off and say ""We actually jumped"". The fear factor was so dumbed down to make the movie acceptable for kids that it became almost boring until the twist in the end. I wish it was more dark and menacing instead of light and serial like. Still, it was the sixth highest grossing films and this story worked. My justification for the nonchalant attitude was that these creatures were a part of that world for decades and everyone was used to a beast on the lose once in a while.

I think Bryce Dallas Howard is a talented actress, regardless what some critics say. The dinosaur scenes are pretty effective, really keep you on the edge of your seat.

Is it better than the second one? I'm going to have to say yes on that. What this movie is is a popcorn movie. You just have to go in and have a fun time and I did, I had a lot of fun with this movie.Yes it's more of a monster movie than an actual Jurassic Park movie, but that's all right. It did focus on the Jurassic theme overall. It was just that there was a dinosaur running around and a lot of people were running around.It may sound like the story isn't that interesting if you just read the last sentence. Overall it isn't a bad story. There was a subplot that involved the kids and it seemed pointless when the movie was trying to give us feelings for the kids but it didn't work. Other than that the story wasn't that bad. How was the acting? That's probably the weakest part of the movie.The only actor that really stood out was Chris Pratt. He's definitely got talent. He wasn't acting like Andy or Starlord in this movie. We got a new character who was serious most of the time, because of this, I'm okay with whatever Chris Pratt does in the future. Bryce Dallas Howard wasn't a bad actress in the movie, but her character wasn't that great. At first she was more of the exposition girl, telling all of the important things to the plot. Then she was just a girl who's uptight and really didn't add a whole lot to the movie. It's not her fault though, it's the writing. Jurassic World may be a ""monster movie"" but it still has elements of Jurassic Park, there are many times where it felt like a Jurassic Park movie. Especially the final act of the movie. Gosh that part of the movie was very fun, without spoiling anything.Jurassic World is a very fun movie that people will enjoy. Yes the subplot that involve the kids may not be the best part of the movie and the characters could have been better written except for Chris Pratt, but it's still better than the last two movies in my opinion. This movie has dinosaur action and well written comedic moments. I will probably go see this movie again in theater because I had so much fun with it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I think of this as a great shot in the arm for the series, not entirely different from how the most recent Star Trek movies have helped that franchise.For me, the best part of this Jurassic World is that you only really need to know anything about the first movie to have a grasp on this one. So if you haven't seen the second and third installments, you're not lost. In fact, in some ways, it may even help. Let's face it, Jurassic Park 3 wasn't a great addition to the franchise, so without it you may have a more appreciative view of the series.The highlights of the movie, for me, are the constant reminders of the original park, the first movie, and the spirit of what Hammond wanted to make for the world.I'm giving the movie a pretty high overall rating, and it wouldn't add up if I decided to rank different portions of the movie separately, so I'll just explain myself with the whole 9/10 thing; it really drives home the idea of the franchise, and it has everything you'd want in a summer blockbuster.Sure there are plenty of parts that are predictable, and yeah there are some things that make you want to laugh a little, but you aren't supposed to. For example (without spoiler) there's a scene that effectively calls back to every war movie ever where an integral character gets left behind somewhere and reappears later. You kind of forget about this character until that shining moment they come running back in triumphantly. This happens, but it was almost comical for me.Despite the predictive nature of the film, despite a few things I could poke holes through in certain scenes, Jurassic World delivers what you'd expect it to. It brings back a franchise that needed a shot in the arm without remaking it completely. There's plenty of options at the end for a sequel without making it required to tie up the loose ends. There's action, blood, carnage and mayhem of the dinosaur variety. This isn't a walk through the park ... but when have any of them been?","20 out of 45 found this helpful.

"","","One Heck of a Roaring Attraction","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3262314/?ref_=tt_urv","kgny309","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26664150/?ref_=tt_urv","21 June 2015","Seeing Jurassic World on the big screen is like taking a roller- coaster ride. In the beginning, it takes time to get ready for the action to rise up. Then in the middle, the excitement really arrives. By the end, we're totally amazed with leftover emotions of exhilaration and rapture. That what the long-awaited fourth installment of the Jurassic Park series delivers with a dose of a surefire thrill.Taking place twenty-two years after the events of the first film, the dinosaur park that couldn't open has finally did with attractions ranging from a dino petting zoo to an aquarium. Heading the park's operations is Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of director Ron). In a way to increase attendance in the park, Claire plans to open a new exhibit featuring a hybrid dinosaur created by scientists of the late John Hammond's company, InGen. Claire brings in a dino expert and former flame, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), to check the genetic- modified animal for safety reasons.But soon, all hell breaks loose when the hybrid dino breaks out of his cage and makes a rampage through the park killing many in sight and making a mess of the facilities. The rex even tries to mess with Claire's visiting nephews, Zach and Gray (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins). So, it's up to Owen and Claire to put a stop to this madness before it gets much worse.Taking over the director's seat from Steven Spielberg (one of the film's executive producers) is indie director Colin Trevorrow. Trevorrow isn't no Spielberg, but he adds a lot of new juice into the franchise. The script (which was credited as a four-person job) works well with the usual summer blockbuster mix of action, romance and a sense of humor. The dinosaur effects are simply astonishing. Plus, Michael Giacchino's score wisely incorporates John Williams' themes from the original and uses them with fine panache.As expected, the film is faithful to the 1993 picture from which it sprung. It recreates two of the film scenes when Owen and Claire pets an ailing dinosaur and in the dino-fight-to-the-finish climax, the two of them get trapped by two raptors (joined by a third this time). The filmmakers even recreated the now abandoned Jurassic Park Visitors Center, complete with old park Jeep Wranglers. The film also makes jabs at product placement such as Verizon Wireless sponsoring the latest dino exhibit, the ""Samsung Innovation Center"" and a Starbucks cafe located in the front of the park (not to mention Comcast- NBCUniversal employee Jimmy Fallon doing a instructions video for one of the attractions).Coming off his success in Guardians of the Galaxy, Pratt scores well with leading-man charisma as Owen. Let's hope his stock goes up after this. As Claire, Howard is wonderful, even after trying to go Sigourney Weaver-like on the predators. Together, Pratt and Howard scores with a touch of great chemistry that it's not hard to think if they'll both survive this ordeal. They're both supported by a fine supporting cast with Vincent D'Onofrio (of Law & Order:CI fame) as a power-mad security boss, Irrfan Khan as the new head of InGen and New Girl's Jake Johnson as the park's computer control guy (reminiscent of both Wayne Knight's Nedry and Samuel L.Jackson's Arnold from the first film).When you mix the elements altogether, you might end up with one great thing. With that, Jurassic World roars as a great summer movie. Somewhere in heaven, both Michael Crichton and Richard Attenborough must be proud.Rating:***1/2Parent Advisory: Jurassic World is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of science-fiction violence and peril. Good enough for ages 15 and over but some scenes may be too intense and violent for children under age 14 at best, so I advise that it's best to go supervised by a parent, sibling or an older chaperone.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The best yet since the original, this reboot 22 years after is a non-stop thrill ride with pleasantly surprising doses of good humor and warm nostalgia","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3255774/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2015","Let's cut to the chase – for those of you who just want to know if 'Jurassic World' is as good as 'Jurassic Park', the answer is no, but it does come pretty damn close. To be fair, it was going to be a tall order to top the Steven Spielberg original, a fact which the revamped park's own management, owner Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and his right-hand woman Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), readily acknowledge. It isn't enough that we are seeing dinosaurs come alive before us; in order to dazzle, the animals has got to be ""bigger, louder, and more teeth"". And so in their quest to create a new attraction for the park, its chief scientist Dr Henry Wu (B.D. Wong, the only cast member from 'Jurassic Park' to reprise his role) turns to genetic modification to create varieties that never existed 65 billion years ago. That research has yielded the Indominous Rex, a hybrid whose DNA is based off a T- Rex and is spliced with the genome of other species which we slowly learn (the hard way) of its predatory functions. Bred miles away from the actual visitors' areas, it sets a trap to bait its breeders into its paddock and, during the ensuing mêlée, breaks out of the enclosure to wreck havoc not just to the humans on the Isla Nubar but also the rest of its own kind living on the island.With the Indominous Rex on the loose, ex-Navy man Owen (Chris Pratt) springs into action to try to stop the beast before it reaches the 20 thousand over blissfully unaware visitors and at the same time rescue two kids (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson), who happen to be Claire's nephews, that are in imminent danger after veering off the beaten course. Save for a little spot of complication from the corporation's head of security, Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), whose idea to employ raptors against the Indominous Rex backfires in a jaw-dropping 'oh sh*t' moment, the narrative unfolds in as linear and straightforward a manner as you can imagine.Not that we're complaining – despite crediting four writers, 'Jurassic World' is supposed to be a movie built on thrill and spectacle more than anything else, a fact that isn't lost on its director Colin Trevorrow. Despite having only one other feature- length movie to his credit, Trevorrow proves more than able to construct riveting action set-pieces that are keystone to the franchise. Among the highlights – Masrani's attempt to take down the Indominous Rex from a helicopter that comes to a fiery end and sets free the winged predators held captive in an aviary, the birds' subsequent attack on the hordes of visitors in the main theme park, and the raptors' hunt for the Indominous Rex that takes a surprising turn.Just about the last hour and a half is packed wall-to-wall with non- stop action, as the characters run, duck, hide, chase, rinse and repeat in order to save their own and prevent a bigger calamity from shutting down the park forever. Trevorrow lacks Spielberg's gift for creating and sustaining tension, but in place of iconic moments like the ripples in the glass of water on the dashboard or the velociraptors opening a kitchen door, he simply keeps the action going and going, pausing only to a) let in a kicker and/or b) pay tribute to his predecessors. That said, it is to us also the reason why this entry pales in comparison to Spielberg's original, which was a quintessential masterpiece in choreographed suspense.Rightfully, Trevorrow shows the utmost respect for the establishing blocks of the franchise. Although the theme park has undergone a major makeover with snazzy new attractions like a dinosaur petting zoo, an amphitheater featuring a monosaurus feeding show and face- to-face safari-like dino excursions in a circular self-powered vehicle called a gyro-sphere, there are constant nods to the original movie. The original Jurassic Park Visitors Centre makes a pleasantly surprising appearance midway into the film, and for that matter so does its banner and T-shirts. Most significantly, the finale pays homage to the first movie in truly cheer-worthy rah-rah fashion – and while we will agree with the cynics that it is deus ex machina, there is no denying that it closes the film on a high note.Though this is the first chapter in the series to introduce a whole new set of characters, they are well written and well played enough to compensate for any nostalgia one may have of Dr Alan Grant or Dr Ian Malcolm. Pratt's good-natured charisma rubs off amply on his character, and Howard manages to go from unlikeable to someone we care about with surprising clarity. Most delightful however is the sibling dynamic between Simpkins and Robinson, which provides much of the film's emotional anchor; indeed, it is from their perspective that we are brought into the titular resort, and whose survival we come to fear the most for.Back in the day, the Steven Spielberg original was the very definition of blockbuster entertainment, especially in how it so seamlessly fused CGI with animatronics to create awe-inspiring renditions of the beasts that once walked our earth. Like we said at the beginning, it is probably too much to ask that 'Jurassic World' has that same effect on us, but it is also the only entry thus far to come close to replicating that experience. The effects are obviously leaps and bounds over the 1993 game-changer, such that what was real feels even more so now. It is also a non-stop edge-of-your- seat thrill ride, one that hits the high gear even before the halfway mark and never lets up. You bet you'll be humming that John Williams theme song as you step out of the theater, and if you ain't awe-struck, we guarantee that it will still leave you breathless.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Owen (Chris Pratt) likes motorbikes and educating Raptors. He once had a date with Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). That's about all we get to know for the hero's 'background story' before they start running from the dinosaurs. Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) is the opponent of the current boss of the park, Masrani (Irrfan Khan), but their past is hardly explained. They are just there to have a good boss and a bad boss who don't agree on how they run the Jurassic World. In the first 'Jurassic Park', the chaos theory of Dr Malcolm really had a philosophy behind it, and he tried to convince Hammond with reasons and logic, but this kind of depth was lost during the sequels. If we have Raptors, let them out and see what happens - that's the end of the line.There is a scene when one of the boys tells his brother he is afraid their parents are going to get divorced. And when they meet their parents later - no questions asked, happy family. It seems that some background story about the family was going to be developed here in one of the probably many screenplay versions (no less than 6 writers are credited), but then dropped and forgotten at some point. Did Mum and Dad really intend a divorce, but the fear for their kids' lives brought them back together? This is the kind of thing that breathes life into cardboard characters - alas, the introduction of the possible divorce was leading nowhere, it looks like something was cut from the script here. And this is a typical example that nobody cared about the human characters, they come from nowhere and go nowhere, also in the unlikely love story that begins in a laughable scene when Claire rolls up her sleeves to impress Owen. Only the dinosaurs matter, but by the time of part 4 of the saga, the ambition to show creatures as real as possible has also been dropped. Sometimes the creatures' size is doubled to make them more impressive (Mosasaurus), or they are explained as genetic experiments right away (Indominus Rex).JW is a great roller-coaster ride, but surely not satisfactory in the story telling department. It was easy to see why they need not hire brilliant actors anymore, but spend twice as much money on effects instead.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

How can it be, when even Spielberg himself couldn't make a worthwhile sequel? Colin Trevorrow, the director of 'Safety Not Guaranteed' had a Herculean task on his hand when he was slated to direct this sequel-reboot. Setting the criticizing aside, I think the guy had made some admirable effort. Jurassic World is a fairly-entertaining movie that passes as a watchable one.Sure, in no way this film could catch up with the original. The animatronics was replaced with some sloppy CGI, it lacked interesting characters, and the whole script was flawed with bad writing. But, Trevorrow treated it as a disaster movie rather than an innovation, and when we see it that way, the end product is satisfactory. Besides, he tried to bring out the nostalgia we all wanted with occasional nods to the original. From the evergreen soundtrack to the T-Rex, most of this movie proves the directors dedication to the subject. The sequences with the raptors were thrilling in the beginning. It's a shame he couldn't develop it more interestingly.As Jurassic World established itself as a box-office success, there is a certain possibility of having a string of sequels in the future. Whether Trevorrow's dedication can hold up the franchise is a question for the future.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

A suspense thriller like the Original and neither a survival story like the third film. Jurassic World is an out an out action movie.while there's little character development and lesser logic, It gains high points in milking the ""Nostalgia factor"" and sheer action.The Good bit...Its a fun action movie If you like non-stop action, you will love it! Then there's lots of stupid, illogical but COOL stuff for you to rest your brain. Then there's bits of situational humour here and there which is a nice comic relief.Wonderful musicTaking lots of cues from the Masterpiece of John Williams, Michael Giacchino puts out an exciting score that is different yet familiar and works just right for the film.HomagesThere are lots of little homages to the original which makes it click for the old fans.Disappointing bit...Flat charactersNo highly charismatic ""chao""tician, Cowardly Lawyer, Wise archaeologist or a curious botanist here. Just a one man Army of Chris Pratt and a Resident Evil's Jill Valentine rip-off heroine!! Irrfan Khan has done his part well...but in vein. The two boys didn't get much chance to display anything beyond fear.Unimpressive CGIFor a franchise that defined the CGI Industry, Jurassic World really fails to impress with it's dated CGI. The Dinosaurs actually look worse than they did in the older films. few of the scenes are impressive but others are equally awful.Poor use of animatronicsThere are scenes which could have worked a lot better had they used actual robots instead of just animation. The seam-less blend of CGI and animatronics is what made the dinos in Jurassic park look and act like real animals.Animals...yes. These are animals and they should behave like animals!! (Remember T-REX Biting the car's tyres/Signal post and Raptor going after the refection in the steel?) Well now the dinos have ""evolved"". Raptors are the new dogs! And T-REX doesn't go after the food.Final thoughts...If you're not a particular fan of the series, Or haven't seen the older films. You will love it. But if you're a fan of the series, going in with certain expectations then its a mixed-bag.Watch it in IMAX 3D.

The movie is worse than most B-movies I've ever seen, because not only what happens is stupid, but is also absolutely predictable (while in many B-movies some stupid things are at least surprising, some kind of improvisation) - so it was badly, without talent planned from the start and badly, without talent implemented.

Yes, I was expecting more ""wow"" in terms of dinosaur action but it did deliver enough for me to happily crunch my way through a giant tub of popcorn. The first 20 minutes or so is simply bad cinema. Cartoon level characters with no depth setting up the rest of the film. Then, somehow I grew to care for those characters by the end of the movie. I believe this has more to do with great casting and really nothing to do with story. Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt ooze charisma and charm. The call backs to the classic original certainly help. I wish we would have had better dinosaur fights and I really hated the horribly written bad-guy with alternative motives that have zero feasibility. Still, I went in expecting a monster movie popcorn flick and that's what they delivered for the most part.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

Now, the park is open again for Jurassic World – but does this long- awaited sequel recapture the same magic?Not quite, although Universal Pictures and director Colin Trevorrow certainly make a valiant attempt. Wisely ignoring the events of the second and third films in the franchise, Jurassic World takes place approximately twenty years after the original. Isla Nublar is now home to a sprawling resort that has been operating successfully for years – something like a combination of Disneyland and an animal safari park, but with the giraffes and elephants replaced by lumbering herbivores like triceratops and stegosaurus. There's even a Sea World-esque attraction where visitors can watch a mosasaurus burst out of the water to devour its dinner before splashing down and soaking the first few rows of spectators.Jurassic World follows many of the same beats as the original film, but manages to never seem as though it's trying to replicate its predecessor. There are numerous homages to some of the most iconic scenes from Jurassic Park – some are clever winks to the die-hard fans, and some are very blatant references – but the near-constant fan service is a very welcome detail.Regrettably, the movies falls a bit short in some places, not the least of which is the truly awful dialogue. We got a few glimpses of this in some of the film's trailers and TV spots, and viewers hoping that the most cringe-worthy moments were already revealed in the marketing will be in for some disappointment. Chris Pratt – so charismatic and charming in last year's Guardians of the Galaxy – is saddled with some of the worst bits, spending most of the film as a walking exposition machine. But co-star Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't fare much better, and most exchanges between their two characters will have eyes rolling toward the ceiling.Another truly puzzling aspect of Jurassic World involves a bizarre subplot with an InGen employee (Vincent D'Onofrio) hoping to turn a velociraptor research study into a military training program, wherein the raptors could be conditioned to follow commands and be sent into war zones in place of ground troops. It's a completely ludicrous notion, and everything associated with this idea could easily have been excised from the film without losing anything important.And while I understand the theme park is modeled after real-world locations with real-world business arrangements, there is an absurd amount of product placement in this film. At one point, after Claire (Howard) shows off the facility's research lab to a group of corporate representatives hoping to sponsor an upcoming attraction, she muses about having ""Verizon Wireless presents"" on the marquee. There's also the opulent Samsung Innovation Center, towering above the resort's hub area much like Cinderella's Castle at Disneyland, not to mention a slew of retailers and eateries that would be much more at home in a shopping mall than a theme park.Aside from those admittedly large stumbling blocks, Jurassic World delivers pretty much everything fans could ask for. The number and variety of the dinosaurs has increased vastly over the original film, and the creatures are once again created through a combination of animatronics and CGI for a stunningly lifelike experience. And of course, there's the Indominus Rex, the park's first genetically engineered hybrid, which serves up most of Jurassic World's thrills and chills through a number of white-knuckle action scenes.Audiences expecting Trevorrow and Universal to redefine the genre should probably temper their expectations before purchasing a ticket. The film is hampered by some major script issues that should have been addressed long before the cameras began to roll, but they're not enough to keep the experience from being enjoyable, and fans of the original film – and even its terrible sequels – should find plenty to love about Jurassic World.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

In development since the third left theaters and despite a barrage of criticisms and little hope after the various trailers and clips we were shown - ranging from sexism to inadequate CGI - Spielberg's juggernaut franchise still managed to slay the box office and take over the world. It's nearing the top 30 adjusted box office ever now. That's pretty much the most Jurassic World has got going for it. It's an event movie, and that's all it feels like. The best reaction the film has gotten is calling it the best Jurassic Park sequel, which while true, isn't saying much to its quality. At the very least, it pays off something we've been waiting for 20 years. We get to see the park in operation, including many inventive ride concepts. The resemblance to Universal Studios is uncanny and wholly deliberate I'm sure, but admission for the movie feels like a discount for the theme park. Its first act of nostalgic awe is pretty wonderful, if utterly superficial but I can't call it hollow.The film may only have cheap surprises up its sleeve, but it's not short on entertainment value. Yes, it has trappings of today's action sequences of impossible camera moves that hint at how green their screens are, but it's fun to watch. Characters are indeed one- dimensional and it gives us little reason to invest in them besides the fact that if they don't act now they'll be mangled and/or eaten. It does have many contrivances to get them in or out of danger, but they're facing dinosaurs, a contrivance is the only way in or out. I wish Chris Pratt could have more opportunity to put his goofy charm on that made Guardians of the Galaxy so endearing, but here's it's more stoic badass. Among the clichés, it does get to explore a few interesting things that the first didn't have time to touch on, such as the morality of using dinosaurs as weapons. Those few moments reveal that it does have more intentions than money. Otherwise, of course Jurassic World is a big dumb shiny movie. It could be worse.6/10","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

In this film it was cool to see the park open and flourishing. And then having the dinosaurs break out and threaten the park when it was full of thousands of tourists added to the stakes and intensity. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard had great chemistry.

It's very difficulty for movie makers these days to surprise - its not 'always' necessary but, every film should at least entertain and, or inform. Thankfully this sequel does entertain, more so than 2 of its 3 predecessors; Yes, I was pleasantly surprised too!! Thanks mainly to the underplayed acting ability of Mr Chris Pratt, the visual beauty, and acting of Ms Bryce Dallas Howard and the brilliant, still stunning, special effects. OK, so the impact isn't as awe inspiring as it was all those years ago, I would suggest the last 20 years of cinema magic has raised the bar a smidgen! As you'd expect plot-wise there isn't much to concern yourself with, the fear factor is minimal for a 'disaster/action' movie but it does have its moments. There is far less patronising dialogue than you may have been used to over the years, for this sort of film and the action scenes do come thick and fast, eventually, and none of it could be accused of being boring!

Bottom line it is still is better than II. So let's hope there is a V and they put more thought into it.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Yet despite all this success, unfortunately currents are brewing underneath and once again something will go wrong.And that's pretty much the biggest problem I have with this film. It's the exact same story we've seen three times already. Granted, it is the most logical story when you have dinosaurs bred for amusement parks. Something will go wrong, dinosaurs will run amuck, mass hysteria, yada, yada. But come one, there must be something else you can do with this setting. Shady executives selling dinosaurs for black market businessmen, dinosaur genes used to enhance modern day animals for blood sports, some dinosaurs appearing to be way more intelligent than science would have understand. Anything but this again.We even have the exact same kid characters in need of rescuing. Okay, their names and actors are different, but they're the Jurassic Park kid characters, no changes whatsoever. This is doubly annoying because this time the adult characters are actually pretty interesting and these two brats take away much needed time from them.That being said, the actual movie is okay. Sure the dinos are obviously CGI, but aside from that, they look impressive. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard more than convince as the main adult characters. Irrfan Khan is a lot of fun as the eccentric new owner of the park and the rest of the cast is equally talented. Aside from the kids, that is. And while the main story is painfully similar to the ones before it, there are some new, refreshing touches. Like the fact that the park is actually open this time. The first third of the film flies by with no problems because of this. The ending climax is also very, very cool and almost worth the price of admission by itself.But, in the end, that means that Jurassic World is simply a slightly above average film in general. It's still the second best film in the franchise, but that's not saying much, seeing that parts two and three are not even worth mentioning in polite conversation.","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

I had high hopes for this film and they were exceeded. I went to enjoy a movie with good action sequences and lots of dinosaurs and you get that in bunches.The thing that's lacking when comparing it to the original is the sense of awe, but how are you going to recapture that? In fact, that's part of the plot: people are already bored with dinosaurs. But the dinosaur action and the sense of terror and excitement are there.Is it Oscar worthy? Of course not. But I would assume most people know what to expect when they go see a summer action blockbuster movie and this movie delivers on that. Let your brain disengage, try not to over-think it, and have some fun.My biggest criticism is not the script (okay) or the acting (good), but that all of the ""background"" dinosaurs (not the stars) are the same dull grays and browns. Would have loved to have seen a little time taken in the CGI to make the supporting cast of dinosaurs (triceratops, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, parasaurolophus, ankylosaurus) more colorful.Hoping that this film does what the original did: create a whole new generation of dinosaur scientists.","23 out of 54 found this helpful.

Well you can see it from the movie and compare it to Jurassic Park, in the more positive way even though i'm not a big fan of all the character but i think they performance was not awful, not great too but they're all ok, the look of Jurassic World was great, the score was amazing, and the last battle scene was pretty darn cool, but still overall product i was unfortunately still have to say that for me Jurassic World is a dissapointing film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While the film may not be as SCARY and intensely thrilling as the original but it's guaranteed to entertain the hell out of you for its whole running time. What I really wish here is if this film was to be rated R, it will definitely be a bloodbath horror show that will surely satisfy horror fans but no doubt that this is a family film, so just saying. However, that doesn't mean the movie is tame at all, considering it as a hard PG-13 rating with a surprise amount of GORY scenes and deaths to bring more horror and thrill to the story and the 3D helps add those up as well.

I really like his Safety Not Guaranteed but to then give him a project of this size and history was quite surprising. I'm not going to bang on about the previous sequels that were nothing near the original Jurassic Park. I remember watching JP at the cinema, 22 years ago, and hearing those quaking footsteps and seeing the shaking glass of water was intense, as are the Velociraptors in the kitchen. Spielberg even let himself down with Lost World so to follow up with another film was rather brash. I wouldn't be surprised if the makers and studios watched the previous film listing all the elements that worked and stood out as there seems to be a lot of the same ingredients. Kids isolated, Velociraptors and of course a tyrannosaurs rex, but bigger and stronger. The same tension is there with looming dinosaurs and I think the only original cast member is BD Wong, playing the naughty scientist. It almost feels like a reboot as oppose to a continuation. Fans of Chris Pratt should like his character but non-fans will probably hate this, playing the sarcastic, over confident dino-trainer. Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning in this, and both play their characters very well adding the awkward romance. Vincent D'Onofrio and Jake Johnson join the cast, Vinny being the nasty guy with an angle and JJ providing some comedy relief as the tech guy. But it's Irrfan Khan that steals the show for me, being acclaimed as one of the greatest actors of our time, he hails from Bollywood and does a tremendous job playing billionaire dare-devil Masrani. Disney regular composer, Michael Giacchino takes on the Jurassic theme following John William's note steps. Not quite the same, but still very good and follows suite. The CGI is on point as expected but again mimics a lot of scene from the original, though the close ups are superb. There's some clever ideas and twists to the story that make it more silly than good cinema, especially the climatic end. But certain scenes are good and have captured the essence of its '93 father. The children in the snow globe mobile in particular was classic Park stuff. That same tension is there and the ghastly dino is ferociously scary. The aerial shots were a nice touch. Jurassic World is better than the sequels but still not the T-Rex of dinosaur movies, that crown still remains with Jurassic Park. Trevorrow did a great job, so faith restored, but I think it's time to close the park for good.

In fact i would say it looks worse. I was looking forward to watching Chris Pratt again after his brilliant performance in Guardians of the Galaxy but even he was dull in this. This movie was crying out for a Jeff Goldblum , Sam Neil or a Richard Attenborough but what we got was a ridiculously over the top Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio. I even wanted the Dinosaurs to eat the kids but we all knew that wasn't going to happen. The only thing i really like about this is who the actual hero in the end is. I thought that was quite clever.

The rest was all just: ""Well OK, I am sure I will forget this the second I exit the film"". The premise of the film isn't neither original or interesting nor grounded enough for it ever to be truly relevant. It's just another dinosaur and that would be OK if it wasn't inserted in this plot that a couple too many and convenient times strayed away from credibility. Moreover the themes it is trying to explore are frustratingly and repeatedly put aside. The CGI is just forgettable unfortunately. There are maybe a couple of shiny moments, but other than being somewhat underwhelming it really is just too poorly used for it to provoke any sense of wonder or amazement in 2015, I am really sorry, CGI has to be used as a gift not as a gadget and it is what this film did. And on the final negative note, you are given a group of way too generic characters, they seemed to have been pre-fabricated in the factory of generic blockbusters. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard, who really gives her character a beat and a presence on screen making her likable, all of the characters I really couldn't care that much and it made for repeatedly poor stakes.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The premise sees in 2015, Jurassic World has been opened on Isla Nubla, when a new genetically modified Dinoasur escapes it causes chaos.Main Character
Chris Pratt plays the lead in this film and he is good in the role. He is very charming and charismatic like you would expect from him but he actually has a pretty interesting character. You can see he feels about the dinosaurs in a different way to previous lead characters that he does care about them and doesn't just want to see them all destroyed.Supporting Characters
Bryce Dallas Howard plays a large role in the film and I thought she was fine. She has an arc here and does change throughout giving some decent emphasis here but it wasn't perfect by any means. Her chemistry with Pratt wasn't great and seeing her run through the park with high heels was laughable. Vincent D'onofrio plays a bad guy here and he is usually a great actor but I thought his character was silly here. He is very campy and over the top with an absolutley absolutley ridiculous plan that feels like a stupid part of the film. Like Jurassic Park there are two kids who need rescuing but it worked there and doesn't here, the two kids are annoying, the older one is a creep and the younger one spends most of the film crying and I didn't care about them at all during the film.Story
The best part of the story is easily seeing John Hammond's vision come to life by seeing a Jurassic theme park even though after the events of the other film it makes no sense for it to open but it is great to see. Seeing this new Dinosaur go through the park is fun to watch and enjoyable as it does feel like something new and fresh. But there are some absurd side plots mainly including D'onofrio's character's idea which is beyond believeable, plus this film does follow the trend of Jurassic Park 3 a bit with a very long chase scene taking up plenty of the plot but it doesn't go to those lengths.Script
The script has some decent dialogue, it actually has some cheesy moments that I think peppered in actually worked here. Some of the humour took away from the drama and I could have done with being a bit less, but it was nice to see a return to the nature vs nurture debate that was part of the original film.Style
The style for the film is great to be honest, yes the dinosaurs are all CGI here but they look great. In this modern era CGI is so good that it was the natural choice here and it makes the Dinosaurs feel larger and more scary then they have in previous films. As I said it is nice to see a Jurassic Park and I could have done with seeing even more of the park as it really is an interesting idea.Overall
Overall, this is a good film, it doesn't hit the iconic nature of the original film but it is a fun film that brings in a new audience and is a worthy addition to the Jurassic franchise.Rating - 7/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There was way too much CGI, they really missed some opportunities to use animatronics in places. Some of the CGI did look a bit off, especially with the raptors. There were some comedy moments that really didn't fit, and threw off the pace of the film.Bad points aside, Jurassic World is an incredible joy to watch, bringing out the inner 10-year-old in me, which is exactly what Colin Trevorrow set out to do. The film starts out slow, but soon builds up to some really thrilling and exciting moments that'll make any fan of the series squeal with delight. The film is very much a love letter to the original film, with a load of throwbacks to it. The icing on the cake is the score, which faithfully captures the feel of the original.Overall, Jurassic World does what it set out to do in spectacular style. It's not without its flaws, but it does a fantastic job at capturing some of the magic the original film had.","24 out of 57 found this helpful.

Starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Vincent D'Onofrio, Jurassic World revolves around an amusement park 22 years after the incidences of the first Jurassic Park. After sales start declining, the park decides to create a hybrid dinosaur to keep attendance soaring. But catastrophe strikes once they underestimate how intelligent it is. Chriss Pratt was a great pick for the lead but I felt as though I was watching an underdeveloped super hero as opposed to a more relatable character like Dr. Alan Grant. Whether the alpha little emotions sounds appealing or not, there's no doubt he's bad***.Even with the splendid cast, the main attraction, obviously, are the dinosaurs. As ironic but somewhat predictable as it may sound, I felt that the old animatronics looked better than the special effects seen in the newest rendition. However, the vast visual spectacles exceed the original in pretty much every other aspect.Jurassic World is marvelous but not phenomenal. It successfully satisfies the brain but not quite the heart. Nevertheless, this movie purposely aims for the chaos; not the emotion behind it. It is, in short, some seriously stupid mindless fun.","17 out of 38 found this helpful.

After 22 years of the opening of the original Jurassic Park, a new park opens with much more potential than the first and since technology is at a higher level than it used to be before 22 years, bigger, louder and more scary dinosaurs are going to be created. This will have as a result a creation of a dinosaur which is the strongest of them all and is genetically modified from the scientists of the park in order to be able to survive and kill everything.I liked this movie because it had been a lot of time since a dinosaur movie released and it was actually good. It had an interesting plot with some modifications or differences from the original movie of Jurassic Park but the main core of the plot remained the same. I believe that it was a good idea because the director kept the original plot to its core and he built on it his new ideas for this movie and that's why I think Colin Trevorrow did a good job in the direction of this movie. I have to admit that I also liked the interpretation of Chris Pratt who played as Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard who played as Claire. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Irrfan Khan's who played as Masrani and he was also very good because he gave a different touch in some scenes which I believe made the difference and BD Wong's who played as Dr. Henry Wu and he gave the speech of the movie.Finally, I have to say that ""Jurassic World"" is a nice movie, it has great interpretations and a well-written script that will draw your attention and I am sure that you are going to like it very much. I believe that everyone has to watch it and if you are a dinosaur fan let me say that is a must movie to watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I read it when I was eight, and it quickly turned me into a dinosaur nerd. I dreamed of becoming a paleontologist, I collected encyclopedias about dinosaurs and I could name even the rarest dinosaur species you would see on TV or film. For some reason I hadn't seen the book's adaptation before I was 18 and when I saw it, I was bitterly disappointed. It was just stupid. However, when I saw it for the second time, I kinda liked it. It wasn't the book, but it was a fine action/adventure movie. Of course, the visual effects were outstanding. I even liked its' sequel. I don't think I have seen 'Jurassic Park 3', and I will probably never waste my time with it.But I did see 'Jurassic World'. I expected it to be a funny movie with lots of dinosaurs... Well, it was definitely funny, although for all the wrong reasons. This has got to be the worst high budget summer movie I have ever seen. Nothing really works in it, not even the visual effects - they are just awful, sorry. Well, not exactly awful, the dinosaurs' moves are well done and the creatures blend nice with the scenery, but one can say the same thing about the dinosaurs in ""Terra Nova"" - and that is a TV show. The CGI in 'Jurassic World' lacks detail. It looks as if it was made in the 90s. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' came out ten years ago, and its' visual effects were much more detailed. Not to mention movies like 'Avatar' - when it comes to... everything, especially visuals, it blows 'Jurassic World' out of the water with ease - and it came out six years ago. There is no excuse for 'Jurassic World's poor CGI. Its' creators had the budget and the technology to make it better, but, alas, they chose to do a half-@$$ed job with it. And that is not the movie's biggest problem.This is just not a movie, it is a product, manufactured on an assembly line. There is not a single original idea in it - even its' title is made by combining the titles of the first two movies. The plot is almost identical to the plot of the first movie, but everything that made sense about it has been surgically removed. And this time the army is involved. The writing is incoherent, implausible and downright dumb. And, as I like to say, this is not an opinion, this is a fact. I won't spoil it, but parts of this product (as I said, I can't call it a movie anymore) are directly contradicting other parts. The acting is about as good as the writing. Yes, many good actors are involved here, but they aren't even trying. Chris Pratt is playing exactly the same character he played in 'Guardians of the Galaxy', but this time his character is written as if he is supposed to be an action hero like Indiana Jones. He doesn't have many comedic lines, and the dissonance between the way he is written and the way Pratt is playing him is just mind blowing - and not in a good way. Bryce Dallas Howard is a tiny bit better, but her character is just awful. Vincent D'Onofrio is an incredible actor, but he isn't given anything to work with here. I wouldn't even bother to mention the rest of them.As a whole, this thing works only as a comedy. You can laugh at its stupidity. I know I did. This is why I am so generous with the rating here. 'Jurassic World' is a 3/10 movie at best, but I am rating it higher, because it entertained me.","87 out of 176 found this helpful.

I just know that dinosaurs have scared me for awhile and that the original Jurassic Park movies were scary enough so I dare not see this one. But I was also reading up on the DNA with the mammoths too. Let's just hope no one's idea of an apocalypse include raising artificial dinosaurs and mammoths of the sort! I just had to comment because my fear of dinosaurs has been so weird to me over the years (because I knew they were extinct) but this last time I went to Water World (in Colorado) I knew my fear had escalated on the dinosaur ride they have there and weirdly enough, this theory of being able to see how if in the wrong hands, someone could technically do something along the lines of what I assume this movie is about.

"6","/10","This ""Jurassic World"" Has More Bite Then Expected, Despite Flaws","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4212171/?ref_=tt_urv","kevinthecritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62335722/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2018","3 out of 5 stars (average)I will never understand Hollywood's seemingly immortal fascination with unnecessary reboots and sequels. Since 2010, reboots of popular franchises have been spewing out the back end during the summer months hoping to rekindle the spark gained from the originals. 80's classics Robocop and A Nightmare on Elm Street were given this treatment to mediocre results, both critically and financially. However, some reboots (like Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are successful because they take the franchise into the 21st century, exploring themes and ideas that the original could not.And sometimes, reboots are just fun pieces of escapism that are not meant to be analyzed, just enjoyed.Jurassic World falls into that category. While it isn't as good as the original (come on, who was really expecting that?), this film stands on its own two feet as a fun summer popcorn flick that doesn't require you to think very hard. This seems to be what makes money nowadays, and this film is set to break box office records. Despite some questionable script decisions, Jurassic World is an enjoyable popcorn movie with a great lead performance and intense action.The film follows Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard of 50/50) the owner of ""Jurassic World"", a park where dinosaurs are on display for the general public. The park is a hugely popular tourist attraction made possible by Dr. Wu (BD Wong returning from the first film), a scientist who has been with the park since the beginning all those years ago.To increase tourism (because apparently LIVE DINOSAURS ALONE can't do that), the scientists have genetically engineered a dinosaur. This does not please park trainer and exhibit inspector Owen (Chris Pratt outshining everyone), who treats the dinos with the respect they deserve. It doesn't help that he has Hoskins (Vincent D'onofrio of Netflix's Daredevil) breathing down his neck about using the raptors as weapons of war, something that Owen would not allow. Unfortunately, the genetically-made dino escapes from its enclosure, sending Owen and Claire to find it. To make matters worse, Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) have come to the park to see their aunt and thus get involved on the action.This film is a lot better than I thought it would be. The action is very intense and most of the dinosaur effects are solid (most of them). Colin Trevorrow (the director of 2012's hit Safety Not Guaranteed) knows how to build tension surprisingly well given that this is his second theatrical release. I'm sad he will not be returning to direct a sequel to this film (and let's just face it, there will be one).Performance-wise, Chris Pratt proves once again why we love him: he has charm, likeability, and charisma unlike many new actors today. He uses his leading-man abilities very well here, outshining Bryce Dallas Howard and even the great D'onofrio (who was absolutely amazing on Daredevil). Howard is giving her second-best performance here, her first being 50/50. For whatever reason, Howard has yet to give a great leading performance in her career. She's not bad by any means, but I wish she would improve a bit. The child actors are surprisingly good (and not annoying), giving performances that seem realistic for the situation they are in (one is a teenager, the other a middle school aged kid). Finally, Irrfan Khan (seen briefly in the first Amazing Spider-Man) delivers a decent performance.The only problems I have with the film are minor ones. First, Claire is wearing heels throughout, running in them with unbelievable ease. I don't wear heels myself, but my sister said that it would be IMPOSSIBLE to run in them. I bring this up because there are several shots of the heels, almost as if the director wanted us to know that she was wearing them. They don't have a payoff, seeming a bit useless in the grand scheme. Also, it is briefly mentioned that the two kids' parents might get a divorce, but we don't see anything to support that. We see the mother (Judy Greer, who really needs to get larger parts) saying good bye in the first scene, and then again when she calls Claire asking about the boys. We never see her and the husband arguing, so it just seemed rushed in. Finally, I felt the opening act was a little slow, but it picks up after about 15 minutes. It's not boring, just character introductions and such.Jurassic World isn't as good as the original, but it does its job well, and that is entertaining the viewer. John Williams' great score is included here, and it's as hard to get out of your head now as it was back in 1993. There were some kids in my theater who weren't too scared by anything, but it depends on the kid. I actually jumped a couple times, but that's just me. Overall, Jurassic World is a fun action flick for the summer crowd.Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Sci-Fi Violence and Peril","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Seeing this in theaters when I was 11 and 12, I had one hell of a time. The film itself is super fun to watch, very entertaining, and the action scenes are done magnificently well. The special effects and dinos themselves are just stunning to look at on screen and I love the look of the set itself. Chris Pratt isn't anything great here, his character hardly has enough time to develop to be anything memorable- and really just serves his purpose to be the fearless leader type which is fine but hardly perfect. I enjoyed Bryce Dallas Howard a lot, and the kids were fine- none of the acting was anything memorable or great but it served its purpose enough to carry along the films story. There is a few childish moments here and there, and some stupid ones, but thankfully the film itself manages to rise above its flaws and make for a very interesting situation that anages to be thrilling and a total blast all at once. In the end, there isn't a whole lot to say about Jurassic World. It's your typical big budget blockbuster with high octane action and some subpar moments. It's not anything oscar worthy, but it's certainly worth a watch or two simply for the fun of it.My Rating: 8.3/10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

""You can't get anything good out of Jurassic Park"", I thought, ""Only the first one is worth it"", I thought again. The original 1993 film is such an independent, so perfect adventure, adventure, suspense and humor walking together, guided in a magnificent way by Steven Spielberg. A dignified sequence, it would be a challenge that Spielberg himself failed to match in ""Jurassic Park-The Lost World."" When the first trailer came out, everything changed. ""The park is going to open !!"" , I thought, and soon remembered that it never opened to the public. My expectation went up and then the fear of the expectation monster came to disrupt the experience. But, in a period where remakes, reboots and spin-offs reign in Hollywood, just like Mad Max: Fury Road, I can say that Jurassic World is a pleasant surprise. Situated on the same Nublar Island as the first film, these days, 'Jurassic World' is now a real dinosaur park in operation, as predicted by John Hammond in the first film. To continue to attract public attention, the team of geneticists led by Dr. Henry Wu (B. D. Wong) decides to create the first hybrid dinosaur that mixes the DNA of other dinosaurs: the female, Indominus Rex. The Indominus Rex story on the loose is certainly acceptable, although it does not have the same impact as the initial film. This new film works hard to connect with its parent, talking a lot about the visionary scientist Dr. John Hammond, bringing back the Velociraptors with more prominence, and also including a shirt with the old logo of the park (purchased at E- bay). A phrase said by Dr Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) at the beginning of the film, explaining that dinosaurs are not new (as before), that people go to the park as if they were going to the zoo and that they need something new, refers clearly to the studio's challenge of producing a new 'Jurassic Park'. But the film succeeds. Jurassic World is a modern blockbuster, with a much larger scale of events that brings the franchise into the 21st century with great emotions and a lot of fun. But in addition to exciting scenes and a lot of tension, the film is nostalgic when referring to the first. And we really see the island's sights in much more detail, something that is absolutely brilliant. A real walk through the ""Park"". Despite being a family film, the film does well in times of fright, with some really shocking scenes (even without much blood). Bryce Dallas Howard looks great as Dr. Claire, the park's operations manager. Chris Pratt is also doing well, with some comedic moments (mainly with Dr Claire) and action scenes. But he is not the big hero of the film, he is the guy who is there to help. One of the film's weak points are some bad characters, in fact shallow, unnecessary moments (like a couple's crisis, which adds nothing to the plot of the film), and some basic clichés, but nothing that gets in the way of the experience. But the big highlight is the outcome of the film. A simply spectacular ending (breathtaking) where the cinema went into delirium (with the right to applause). Overall ""Jurassic World"" is a fun movie, with a lot of action and suspense. It will please the new generation and fans of the Jurassic Park franchise will not be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The writers and director have taken the sequel formula quite literally, down to repeats of entire scenes and shots. The thing that is new is a new character, the menacing dino, and the performance of the dinosaurs - they definitely feel more natural and one can even feel their characters. Kudos to the FX crew for that. I also enjoyed the somewhat stylized approach to violence in film - there is enough action to keep one on the edge of their seat without gore. So kudos for that too.The story itself is essentially a repeat of the first film, with few twists and turns: things go wrong, then they go terribly wrong, lives are in danger, and our hero tries to save the day.What I disliked in the film were overly dumb dialogues and exposition. They go way beyond clichés and border on mentally retarded, with IQ of those scenes hovering around 50-60. A teen kid hates his younger but smarter brother - just like that. It supposedly makes for a more interesting story. A nice woman hates her first date but he is still trying; the forced and outright dumb banter between them makes me want to vomit and force the writers to watch some much more entertaining classics such as ""To Catch a Thief"". Kids are again directed to act like grown-ups which only makes it hard for the viewer to maintain the suspension of disbelief. And then, there are things such as our heroine running through mud in high heels and emerging out of it all with those shoes firmly on, and clean.Luckily, those cringe-worthy moments did not last long enough to make me lose interest, and the action and the rest of it was entertaining enough that I am willing to forgive the tendency to cater to the lowest common denominator. Actually, I am not even sure that Hollywood understands how to cater to the lowest common denominator... this film would have been just as successful if not much more so, with smarter dialogues and a story that does not leave a loose end here and there. If it had the same story but smarter characters/dialogues I, and many I know, would give it a higher rating.With all that being said, this is still a fine piece of entertainment. I especially like the fact that director opted for tension induced by our expectations and fears rather than outright gore. It also makes the film (relatively) safe for kids.So, if you go in to be entertained, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.ps. Watched it in 3D, and it was OK, but I still fail to see what the attraction is all about over 2D...","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Five-word Review: Wonderfully Nostalgic Fun, Entertaining Blockbuster","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3265234/?ref_=tt_urv","BillSims28","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50710357/?ref_=tt_urv","26 June 2015","1993's ground-breaking Jurassic Park is a film of might and magnificence, and is one of my favourite films of all time. The two sequels were, in a word, disappointing. The Lost World had some good moments (the long grass) but was just so stupid at times (I've attempted to burn the memory of 13-year-old gymnastics vs. velociraptor out of my brain.) Jurassic Park III had fewer good moments. So, after all the rumours throughout the late-2000s of a Jurassic Park IV finally resulted in the announcement of Jurassic World in 2015, I was pretty excited if a little tentative. Then came casting announcements and trailers and I, like the rest of the contacted peoples of the world, like Chris Pratt after Parks and Recreation, The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. In addition, more great actors were cast like Bryce Dallas Howard of The Help, Irrfan Khan (Slumdog Millionaire) and Vincent d'Onofrio, so fantastic recently in Daredevil.But how was the actual film? The answer is: pretty damn great. Having grown up watching and loving Jurassic Park, I was ready to appreciate every moment of nostalgia and call-back to the original film (emphasis on the lack of plural on original film.) And there are plenty of such moments, such as the way John Williams' incredible, timeless score is heard in Michael Giacchino's well-adapted new score (the first time those first four eerie, haunting brass notes of the original theme play in this film made me grin in delight.) The triumphant theme is first heard when panning over the real Jurassic World, a decision which was met with negativity by some but for me was wholly appropriate and nostalgic enough to warrant shivers when seeing the park, now fully open and (initially) functional. The visual effects are top-notch, rendering a terrifying Indominus Rex as the monstrous hybrid antagonist, a jaw-dropping Mosasaurus devouring a whole shark like a fish finger and a pteranodon attack which is far superior to how they were utilised in Jurassic Park III. Bryce Dallas Howard is a good surprise in this film. Though the bankable, popular Pratt was at the forefront of the marketing campaign (and with good reason! http://tinyurl.com/q4e84hl) it is actually Dallas Howard who is the main character of Jurassic World, in my opinion. She holds up well, despite an insistence on wearing high heels for the film's duration. The only returning actor is BD Wong, reprising his role as Dr Henry Wu from Jurassic Park in a good role. The child actors are decent and luckily not irritating, rounding off a cast that is good, even if talented actors like Omar Sy and D'Onofrio don't have sufficient character development. The main problem with Jurassic World is probably the flat script, with dialogue lacking in any inspiration or quotability. Luckily the actors portraying the characters are likable enough and their characters generally sufficiently interesting to tie over scenes without prehistorically-induced destruction. Pratt doesn't appear until quite a while in, but it's a supremely cool introduction. The raptors are great in this film due to their relationship with Pratt's character Owen, who has developed their relationship to the point of mutual respect, but it does end up (without spoiling anything) that raptor attacks occur and the way they are done is fantastic - even better than the long grass sequence from the Lost World but not quite as spine-chilling as the kitchen scene from Jurassic Park. Overall Jurassic World is highly entertaining and will make for 2 hours of great fun which doubles as brilliant nostalgia for anyone who grew up watching Jurassic Park and its sequels. If you don't expect a cinematic masterpiece on the level of Jurassic Park and you can get over some poorly-written dialogue and character decisions, you'll have a great time. 8.1/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The CGI looked incredible and the story included lots of different aspects of this new park along with some old references to the ones before which are nice touches for big fans of the franchise (because even I noticed them). The only problem I had was that very little was left to surprise because, as well as the trailer did at making people want to go see it, you might as well walk in in the last 20 minutes and then you'll have all the new clips you haven't seen before ! The whole hybrid creating of dinosaurs was a nice aspect revealing a whole new level of terror in the creatures of the film as you don't know what they have used to create the Idominous Rex (and are eager to find out as you see it use more and more abilities you didn't know it had) This film is a definite watch for old or new fans of the series, and definitely wasn't a let down.

We got that serious side of Chris Pratt that I was hoping for, and a movie where i was on the edge of my seat at quite a few moments.

I found that the Lost World was overstuffed plot wise and that JP3 lacked any tension and did not have an interesting story to tell.Now Jurassic World brought one of the main points I loved about the original film, it really is about a theme park gone wrong just like the original but in a much larger scale. The plot resolve around teenager Zach and his little brother Gray who are sent to Jurassic World by their parents who are going through a rough patch in their relationship.Here they are supposed to spend time with their Aunt Claire who manage the park but she his too busy overseeing the park newest attraction, a genetically created new type of Dinosaur.This new breed his faster, smarter and deadlier this is why she his getting assistance from Dino expert/Ex boyfriend Owen to evaluate this new creation.Of course this being a Jurassic Park film the Pooh soon enough hit the fan, the kids get lost, the new Dino go on a rampage and well all hell break loose. Acting wise you have the main four actors that are very likable and you do end up caring for them.Chris Prat is bringing the same charisma he delivered in Gardians of Galaxy.Howard his perfect has the stuck up workaholic who gets a severe wake up call and the two kids are not annoying (No gymnastic routine thank goodness) But the Dino is really what people want to see and Dinosaurs are here at plenty.You have returning favorites and I was happy that they gave some flying Dino some time to shine. Well I had a great time and I would advise people to experience this film in Imax 3d for full immersion, you won't regret it. Overall, it is not better then the first film (Considering the first one is a cult classic that has a footprint in film history that would be impossible) but it is much,much better then both the Lost World and the horrid JP3, it feels like a true Sequel with plenty of wink to the original film throughout.I give this Franchise return to form a solid 8 out of 10.","16 out of 36 found this helpful.

This movie seems to be a fusion of a monster disaster movie, typical of King Kong (2005) that has the beautiful, helpless lady sprawled on the ground with her skirt hiked up. The creation of the new dinosaur and the questions it raises might the singular most intellectually intriguing for this mostly predictable, mind-numbing and questionable logically flawed movie. There are so many scenes that just seem to be connected with so many coincidences as simply a lazy script device to keep the pacing and excitement going regardless. The visuals are decent for now and will eventually be improved upon in the future. The sound effects effective. There are number of relational and character moments of merit but mostly underdeveloped or never fully developed. Irrfan Khan's character had the most stimulating and interesting character (the new tycoon owner) that was never truly met the exciting character that he would have been developed into. I was waiting for the older boy's interest in attractive girls to be developed into more balance gender movie.I was more impressed by the subtle but stimulating mental themes of the Disney-like contrast of a thrilling futurist community of Tomorrowland (2015) or the gene splicing creation of Splice (2009) or the action thrills of Aliens (1986) or Predator (1987). In a number of ways the animated sci fi movie Wall*e (2008) possessed more mental and artistic impact than Jurassic World using silence for much of the instead of exciting, explosive action, a much more difficult directorial feat. Even classic sci fi movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) had a much more captivating and magically engrossing visual and mysterious them without all the overly graphic bombardment for the testosterone deprived audience. Without the dry wit of Jeff Goldblum's contributions in the original movies, the overall Jurassic World looses a lot of its charm in the face of so much violence and perhaps unnecessary devastation.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I believe I would have been living on my own in Parma that first time I saw it. There was a second watch when I picked it up on DVD. I've now given it a third watch thanks to my wife, Jaime, when she randomly put it on. This isn't a horror film. I do pull it in as I look at these as almost kaiju films. We also have dinosaur mayhem as they attack people as well.Synopsis: a new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, creates a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.We start at the house of a family. The mother is Karen (Judy Greer) and the father is Scott (Andy Buckley). They have two sons. The younger one loves dinosaurs and is a genius, Gray (Ty Simpkins). His older brother is Zach (Nick Robinson). He has a girlfriend that he is not too distraught to leave behind. They are going to stay with their aunt for a week as she runs the newer park from the synopsis, Jurassic World.Their aunt is Clarie Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). She is emotionless and all about the numbers. She meets with her boss, Masrani (Irrfan Khan). He is a billionaire that took the park over from Dr. Hammond. He cares about the public having a great time, but also wants the dinosaurs to be happy. This is an interesting concept. Claire takes him to see the new dinosaur they have created for the park. It is white and scary. It is a hybrid that was genetically created, named Indominus Rex. An easy part of it is the Tyrannosaur Rex. It also has a horrible attitude from being raised in captivity. It is also aggressive as it killed its sibling.We then get introduced to our star. Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) has trained a pack of Velociraptors to listen to him. We also see that they are still wild animals when a new member of the staff is almost killed. Owen jumped in and saved him, in the nick of time. Owen speaks with Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) who sees a military application to having beasts like this. Pratt also works alongside Barry (Omar Sy) in their training.Gray and Zach arrive at the park. They met with an assistant to their aunt. She is Zara (Katie McGrath). She isn't great and much like her boss, is on her phone a lot. They do end up running into Claire, who tells them that she is too busy to spend time with them. They feel it and it bothers them. The two slip away from Zara and decide to have fun.Things take a turn when Owen is brought to the Indominus Rex pen. He asks questions and Claire shares what information she can. They can't find it inside of the pen though. When they go inside, they learn a terrible secret about it. It is inside with them. This new creature gets out and wreaks havoc on the park. Claire needs to find her nephews before it is too late. It also takes everything to get everyone off the island. It doesn't help when this dinosaur has lived in captivity and is now free. It doesn't seem to be killing for food but trying to find its place in the food chain.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is to say that I love this series and I felt this film was a solid 'requel'. I love that the first since it is epic to see the dinosaurs, but I love that a mere 22 years later, it is now old news. This keeps in line with how the world has moved on and this new version of the park needs bigger and scarier things to keep getting customers. That leads them to genetically modifying them to do this.I am going to stick to this idea. I'll also bring back up that this isn't a horror movie. Since I include things like Godzilla films or other kaiju stuff, that is why I'm doing this review. There are elements here though. There is a mad scientist element where we have Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) who created Indominus Rex. I like that he was a minor character in the original and has turned bad to make money. Even a commentary there on capitalism. There is a darker plot with him that I thought fit. Now we also have this new dinosaur wreaking havoc across the park. It is releasing other dinosaurs in its wake, which also attack the human guests. With the scope of the attacks and them even being quite brutal, I thought there was enough there for me cover it as horror adjacent.Next, I want to explore the 'requel' aspects. There are going to stretches here. Gray and Zach would be the two teens that come to the park. Originally, they were the grandchildren of Dr. Hammond. Here they are Claire's nephews. Masrani would be the modern Dr. Hammond. Claire almost comes off as the insurance guy. She does get a character arch though that is generic. Owen would be a variation on Dr. Grant. Moving away from these characters, the T-Rex and the Raptors were the villains originally. We need something bigger as this is a sequel. I do like that the T-Rex maintains that anti-hero status. Raptors also slide in there, as they are recognizable dinosaurs. We also get others here to ramp everything up.Sticking with elements here, I think I'll go to filmmaking. This isn't as impressive due to the original's existence. This goes CGI with the dinosaurs and it is fine. They threw a lot of money at it. You must know coming in that this is going to be a CGI-fest. The cinematography is good. There are similar shots and sequences that are homage to a requel. They also use elements of the original soundtrack while doing their own thing. This is made well enough so I won't harp too much.Other than that, let's finish out with acting. Pratt is good here. He has that look and charisma to be the hero. This isn't too far out of the realm of his role in Guardians of the Galaxy. I like Howard in his soulless role. She is given a redemption though that is fitting for a movie like this. I can appreciate how she plays this. Simpkins and Robinson are good as her nephews. I like the smaller roles from Greer and Buckley. Khan does well as this rich guy that we are supposed to like. I have my issues there. I'll also credit Jake Johnson, Sy, Lauren Lapkus and McGrath in their roles. D'Onofrio plays a great villain and I also like Wong here. The acting is fine across the board with no issues.In conclusion, this is a solid requel in my opinion. This is taking what the original did and building on. We are ramping up the tension by having the park open. We also introduce other real dinosaurs and even a genetic hybrid that is scarier than the villains of the first. The acting is solid. Their characters work in the framework of the story. I'd say this is made well enough. This is a CGI-fest, but it looks good. The rest of the filmmaking was solid as well. I think if you like the series, this one is fine. It doesn't stand out but they do similar things here, just a bit different.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The culmination of a dream that began with the ill fated Jurassic Park. Technology has allowed scientists to extract DNA and clone the once extinct thunder lizards. Where Jurassic Park was an old school safari, Jurassic world is the highly commercialised Disneyland with Dinosaurs, where paying customers could kayak down a river of feeding Brontosaurs, ride a gyro-sphere among the Triceratops, pay a fortune for a cola, and just bask in the awe of these great creatures. But test audience did not want raptors the size of a turkey or T-rex with feathers so in cam frog DNA to make them look like how they do in the books and minds of people. People did not just want to ""bask in awe"" so the dinosaurs were turned into sideshow freaks and made to entertain with their babies being molested in petting zoos, their basic mealtimes making the Facebook page of a hundred gawking audience members. Heck, some even tried training them to do tricks but even that is not enough. Enter the Indominus Rex, a genetically spliced mutant dinosaur.What we have here is something that would split the audience. Some would call it an abomination, others would call it awesome. It is bigger, louder, fiercer, faster, yet it feels hollow and incomplete; all style and less substance. It's got teeth, its got a ferocious roar, but it lacks bite. A creature whose traits were dictated by focus groups and market research instead of a respect for the originals. A creature made of borrowed elements from the originals yet the guys who made it forgot what it was that made the originals so great and memorable.I am talking about the movie here. The very movie which the Indominus Rex acts like a parody of. No one are impressed with old school animatronic effects the same way people in the movie are not too impressed with the old school Tyrannosaurus Rex. So in came modern technology, in the movie's case in came 3D CGI, and the creators went wild with it. Some say they went overboard with it the same way scientists went overboard with the predatory trails of the Indominus Rex.Someone is making a point here it seems. Very clever. Whether it was intended or not, Jurassic World is exactly the kind of blockbuster movie that the indominus Rex was meant to parody. It is bigger in scale, with CGI special effects used to portray the fully functioning theme park and creatures within. It is fiercer, with more on screen deaths, there is more gore to push the PG13 rating and we finally get to see what would happen when soldiers fight dinosaurs. It is definitely faster; though clocking in at 124 minutes, I felt that the movie just flew by like Pterodactyl.Somewhere in there there is this kid and his teenage brother. Their aunt runs Jurassic World and starts off as an obnoxious ""corporate adult too busy for the kids"" type. There's is this funny Indian billionaire who loves flying helicopters, and then there is Star-Lord! Look it's Peter ""StarLord"" Quill and he's training Velociraptors instead of hanging out with a talking racoon and his alien tree. Wait.......he's not Star Lord? Owen Grady, you say? But he is the exact same Star Lord character, right down to the mannerisms, the body language, except that instead of a laser gun, ""Owen"" here has a hunting rifle. You're not fooling anyone Star- Lord.Simple statement: If I can't even remember your characters names, then those characters are not at all interesting. Sadly the rest of what made Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park great gets lost in messy frantic CGI action. Spielberg allowed the camera to linger on the dinosaurs, keeping things out of frame to ramp up the tension then delivering full on, clear and steady dino fighting action. Colin Trevorrow, on the other hand, seems to have taken reference from Michael Bay and JJ Abrams. Frantic camera shots neuter the dinosaur action, wide shots are so wide that you can't make out much detail, and keeping the dinos out of frame just feel like those old low budget cheats to save on the special effects budget. You even have wholly unnecessary lens flare on jeep headlights.Not that the CGI was perfect, it is not. Industral Lights and Magic (ILM) does great effects for technology (see Star Wars, Transformers, Iron Man etc) but when it comes to creatures, they fall short from the standards set by studios like WETA or MPC. It shows in the overly saturated shots of dinosaurs in the daytime. For example, the initial appearance of the velociraptors seemed a tad unfinished with the raptors looking a little out of focus from the rest of the scene.I give this thumbs up for the music, the acting and jab at the state of modern blockbusters. The family theme was good though underdeveloped and that CGI could use some work. Re-watching Jurassic Park immediately after this only brought a sense of disappointment to my heart. Even judged by modern standards, Jurassic Park stands the test of time. While Jurassic World may never achieve that timeless classic standard, it entertains it jolts, and it gives the modern blockbuster audience exactly what they want. Sadly.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you are capable of forgetting the last two Jurassic Park films, then this is the sequel the original deserved. The plot is plausible(for a film about dinosaurs)and I think too many people are trying to focus on the alleged social commentary instead of simply enjoying an entertaining movie. Yes, there are a couple of plot holes, but none that detracts from the caliber of the film, and the lack of believable chemistry between the two protagonists was the only real negative I can find.

However, the comedic ties back to some comedy of our time and a few cheesy romance scenes could have been left out in my opinion. In the original three movies, there are no ties to the year the movies were produced, besides the technology used, which makes them timeless. This movie, although incredibly fantastic, was lacking in the timeless factor. The other three movies (especially the first one) are my favorite movies and I watch them whenever they're on TV and I own all three. Despite my dislike of the timeless factor, it was a great movie and a definite must-see! Especially the ending, that was INCREDIBLE.

This film. It's interesting to find a franchise that's willing to recognize the past material and build upon it, while also adding slightly new elements to it. The idea of training dinosaurs just like pets was undoubtedly the strongest element of this movie, even if the result was the same as it's ever been. Part of the problem with this reboot, however, is that the characters don't seem to click, even to the point of the relationships feeling forced.While there were plentiful nods to the first film that started off the franchise, the plot seemed almost identical to the 1993 classic, but with plenty of cliches and hokey lines to go around. I think sequels like this recognize the elements that made the original great, but almost spend too much time overanalyzing to try and recreate the magic. These films ultimately fall short, mostly due to the synergy and sheer luck that made all the elements of the first movie work in the first place.All that being said, it was an exciting thrill ride with a bunch of ridiculous dinosaur battles: essentially what you paid for anyway. I mean, the first film in this franchise worked because of the terror that goes with being trapped on an island full of dangerous dinosaurs. This film dispenses these scary moments, but in a way that just seems like a Hollywood action blockbuster (which if we're honest, it is). It was nice to see the franchise try to return to its roots, but I also think we should have let this franchise go extinct with only the original as its hallmark achievement.A reboot sequel that is nothing if entertaining, I give Jurassic World 3.5 stars out of 5.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film, a resurrection of a franchise long thought extinct, stomps onto the screen with the might of the titans it resurrects. It's a cinematic creature that is as wondrous as it is flawed, a patchwork of the primal and the pioneering.The park, now open and brimming with visitors, is a testament to humanity's insatiable desire to push boundaries. It's a world where children gaze with wide-eyed wonder at creatures they've only seen fossilized, and where adults can indulge in the fantasy of a world untamed by human hands. The film captures this sense of wonder magnificently, with scenes that make us feel like we are stepping through the gates of Jurassic World ourselves.The narrative, however, often feels like an afterthought, a vehicle for the next thrilling dinosaur chase. Characters are drawn with broad strokes; the ambitious park manager, the rugged raptor trainer, the wide-eyed youths lost in the jungle. They serve their purpose, but like the park's lab-created attractions, they lack the depth of their natural counterparts.The true stars of ""Jurassic World"" are, undoubtedly, the dinosaurs themselves. The film's creators have spared no expense in bringing these ancient beasts to life. The CGI is a marvel, rendering each scale and feather with such detail that one can almost feel the heat of the dinosaurs' breath. The Indominus Rex, a genetic chimera, is a terrifying antagonist, embodying the film's central theme of the dangers of playing god.Yet, the film's reliance on this central monster feels like a misstep. In its quest to outdo its predecessors, ""Jurassic World"" sometimes loses the heart of what made the original so captivating. The quiet moments of terror, the philosophical musings on the nature of creation and control, are drowned out by the roar of the latest attraction.The action sequences, however, are where the film truly shines. They are meticulously crafted, with a clarity of vision that harkens back to the series' roots. The pterodactyl attack, a frenzied ballet of wings and screams, is a standout moment, a masterclass in suspense and horror.""Jurassic World"" is at its best when it embraces its identity as a thrill ride. It's a film that knows its audience and delivers on the promise of its premise. It's a summer blockbuster that wants nothing more than to entertain, and at that, it succeeds admirably.""Jurassic World"" is an echo of the past, a film that conjures nostalgia for the days of the original ""Jurassic Park"" while forging its own path. It's a reminder of the power of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination, even if those worlds sometimes feel as engineered as the creatures that inhabit them.As the credits roll, viewers are left with a sense of exhilaration and a twinge of longing. Longing for a film that might have delved deeper into its characters, into the ethical quagmires of its premise. But also, a sense of gratitude for the journey it took us on, for the moments of pure, unadulterated spectacle that remind us why we go to the movies in the first place.""Jurassic World"" is not a perfect film, but it is a perfect reminder of why we love dinosaurs, and why, after all these years, we still flock to see them roar on the silver screen. It's a film that, despite its flaws, captures the imagination and doesn't let go until the very end. And perhaps, in the end, that's all we can ask for.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When the unthinkable happens and the beast escapes it goes on a killing spree and it seems that raptor wrangler Owen Grady may be the team's only hope in bringing the rex's reign of terror to an end...After the rather bad JP3 Jurassic World was the breath of fresh air that was required in order to breathe new life into this franchise. I actually quite liked the story in this one; the idea of a team using genetics in order to create the perfect dinosaur. If I'm to be critical then I would have liked the science behind this to have been explored a little further, but this is only a minor criticism.Of course where the film starts to come good is when the I-Rex goes on its rampage. It contains many tense and heart-stopping moments reminiscent of the first film. Director Colin Trevorrow's tight-direction lends the film an almost claustrophobic feel at times which serves the film well. The chemistry between Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt was great as well (there was deffo a love/hate thing going on which was great to watch). Simpkins gives an OK performance, but Robinson as the older brother was annoying and arrogant. Veteran Vincent D'Onoforio was very good (he rarely disappoints).Whilst the science side of things and the genetic engineering was interesting I couldn't help but feel that things went too far at times; the I-Rex can camouflage? What benefit does that serve when it is to simply be held in captivity? Yes it serves a purpose when the I-Rex escapes, but this is more of a narrative contrivance than anything else. It is able to communicate with the raptors? How is a dinosaur whom has been isolated from all other dinosaurs its entire life able to communicate with other dinosaurs? The I-Rex is highly intelligent, but unless speech and communication was a part of its genetic makeup I can't really see how this is possible?Like I say though Jurassic World is still entertaining fun and contains plenty of tense moments and despite some minor issues, for me, it's the best offering since the original.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, the follies of human beings still loom upon introducing the first hybrid dinosaur that may as well outrank the park's once signature T-Rex.'Guardians of the Galaxy' star, Chris Pratt plays rational Velociraptor tamer Owen Grady as he must deal with the goings-on behind the scenes of the now vast expansion of the park. It's like his character basically borrows the Dino-savvy traits of Sam Neill's Dr. Alan Grant and the survival instincts of Bob Peck's Game Warden Robert Muldoon. Whereas, Bryce Dallas Howard as park operations manager Claire Dearing is a typical portrayal of a hard-working individual who hardly has a life outside of her work (like watching her own nephews venturing in the park). As both characters must work together, they must also stop corrupt individuals who secretly plot to use the dinosaurs for their own personal gain, which I found obvious the moment they spoke about these creatures' capabilities. Claire's nephews Zach and Gray - played by Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins respectively - loosely mirror the original siblings Lex and Tim Murphy, who are inadvertently thrown into this perilous adventure when attacked by the hybrid dinosaur.The entire plot and theme does feel very similar to its 1993 predecessor - thus tending to make some pivotal scenes predictable - in terms of the consequences in corporate greed and how our most greatest creations can also meet our darkest fears. But I'd say it works out fine by introducing this to an entirely new generation who were too young or weren't even born to witness what the film series had done years prior. With enough action, suspense, and Pratt's occasional humor, it does not distract from the movie's pacing.I was disappointed none of the human characters from the past movies ever returned to reprise their roles (save for B.D. Wong's reprisal of Dr. Henry Wu), but I understand what new director Colin Trevorrow meant by ""shoehorning them into the exact same predicament"" over and over again without a proper reason. For the casual film-goer, it's a delight to see how much has been offered whether you're nostalgic or a newcomer. I felt relieved that this movie sequel didn't stray into B-Movie territory as 2001's Jurassic Park III and instead greatly one-ups it with a better plot and depth. The visual effects certainly have advanced these days since I noticed some usage of motion-capture in a few scenes. It's impressive the film crew didn't rely too heavily on often-used CGI effects, but the subtle use of animatronics and 'suitmation' as well. Although not really groundbreaking at all as the first movie, it nevertheless had a vibrant new cast and I loved that some scenes in the movie paid tribute or an homage to Steven Spielberg's 1993 original with flying colors. I'm glad these filmmakers never forgot those roots and kept them intact to acknowledge its presence. With the accompanying music score of Michael Giacchino (standing in for original composer John Williams), it gives a nice touch to what Jurassic Park's opening theme was known well for. My thoughts, it's a sequel that stands proudly as the majestic T-Rex once did in its prehistorical era.","18 out of 42 found this helpful.

But after covid, how it affected the common people vs the rich people; how many rich people acted on this time, especially some delusional man-baby billionaires, I am realizing that the park re-opening is the most realistic thing that happened in the whole franchise.So, since I was not entering the movie with a preconceived notion of it not making any sense like the first time, I enjoyed it a lot this time.

I left the theater on a high not experienced since watching Avatar. The makers of Jurassic World have done something truly inspiring by balancing the new with the old. They show us a theme park not much different than Universal Studios or Harry Potter; with this they show what the world has come to expect and give a sense of realism to the movie. They put in real life characters that show how 20 years have changed society. Smart phones, 2 second attention spans, big corporations after money and others looking to exploit science to build weapons. For the die hard fans, there's plenty of easter eggs and nods to the classic Jurassic Park. Those moments, when the theme song plays and a familiar tid bit appears on screen will make you fall in love all over again with the Jurassic Park universe. In my opinion, this is what really grounds Jurassic Park World (JPW). The plot is interesting and littered with humorous moments for the entire family to enjoy. I'm not exaggerating when I say there is not a single boring moment in JPW!A strong cast with good actors chosen for even type-cast roles made JPW's script believable and enjoyable. I felt each character was invested in his/her role. Standout performances from Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Pratt and the young and energetic Ty Simpkins add so much energy and realism to the movie. Not to mention, Jake Johnson with his trademark wit and sense of humor delivers arguably the best lines in the movie which are nods to the classic JP and jibes at some of the evils in today's world.The ending was beautiful, chaotic and ever so enchanting. Jurassic Park World deserves to take the mantle from the original JP as THE dinosaur movie for the 21st century! I hope it inspires the same feelings of joy, humanity and humbleness in today's kids the way it did in me 20 years ago.","18 out of 42 found this helpful.

First of all, the main attraction is based on a dinosaure that has never existed. This kind of movie should bring to the audiance some knowledge in science and not creating hybrid monster to make the movie scarier.Secondly I can't support when they try to put some emotions in the eyes of a T- Rex or a velociraptor. Those are lizards...they remain reptils, not mammals. The emotion should be brought by the actors which didn't make a good job. A super hero navy seal and a bimbo are not appropriate to be the main character of this movie. Laura Dern and Sam Neil were more authentic and didn't try to be funny when it wasn't necessary.Finally slow motion in a dinosaur fight is completely useless and make the scene less intense.

Before letting the reviews guide you through the decision whether your going to watch the movie or not, give it a try. It's way better then you might think but of course there could be some disappointment. After all, no movie is perfect. I'll go with the bright side first. The acting was really good and in no way overdramatized like many are saying. The script was well written but maybe a little predictable here end there. And the dinosaurs were just phenomenal. Now what disappointed me was sorta the development of the movie. The romance between Owen and Claire just didn't really make sense. They first tell us they once went on a date, and expect us out of the blues to understand like there was another movie before this. And if they want to add romance, they should expand it. Make it more obvious there's stuff going on between them. They spend half the movie like they don't know each other and then they kiss, seriously ?! I'll make a reference from the second Jurassic world, were the same thing happens. The other thing I didn't like was its very predictable and typical ending. There's a dinosaur chasing them and they have to kill it, and once they do everyone is happy. I hope they change that in the JW 3, cause its getting a little old.

First of, the plot is just Jurassic Park 1 all over again. A lot of nostalgia bait movies that came out around this time did this thing where they just retold the same story as the original movie, just with better effects. Jurassic World falls victim to this as well, but it's honestly not as bad as in other examples, and just copying the original is way better than doing whatever Jurassic Park 2 or 3 did.Characters 2/10:
This movie introduces like 5 different insufferable characters in the first 10min of runtime, most of these are even the main cast. Some of these redeem themself a bit by the end, but most of them stay insufferable for way too long, and some are just made insufferable to be killed off.Writing 2/10:
Another thing that plagues the writing and characters is that everybody acts like a complete moron on top of being insufferable to listen to. The 2 kid characters and Chris Pratt are the only ones making decisions that are somewhat understandable, and the complete ineptitude of all others leads to hundreds dead by the end.The dinosaurs 9/10:
With all this being said, I as well as many others really come to the Jurassic Park series for the dinosaurs, and they're better than ever before put to screen. It's so great to finally see another big budget dinosaur movie. There's ofc a few off-putting things like how some dinosaurs are just blown completely out of scale (looking at you mosasaurus) and how they turned all of them into mindless killing machines, with even small fish hunters just lusting for human blood 24/7.Overall 7/10:
A bit of a lackluster movie writing wise, but if you're just in it for the dinosaur action then it's a refreshing watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

With some great moments made as an homage to the original, it has its light moments, its comedic moments, and its action, balanced well enough to carry an overused and predictable plot. Howard does a beautiful job as the powerful lead actress trying to control chaos and the consequent adaption required. And D'onofrio, as talented of an actor as he is, was a complete miss in character. His comically painted villainy is cheesy, cliché, and crosses the border into hilarity. It becomes so bad, it feels ironic and intentional. Jurrasic World is an enjoyable feat that does far better than its predecessors but unfortunately, it is not as magical as the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But in my distant childhood, of course, I saw Spielberg's first film, and he really impressed me, giving me unforgettable emotions from traveling to a park with prehistoric animals. Indeed, 22 years ago, we had enough of a sense of delight and awe before the wonders of modern technologies capable of showing real dinosaurs. Alas, but it's 2015, and highly detailed CGI models of ancient lizards can no longer surprise anyone, so you'll have to surprise others.It quickly turns out that ""Jurassic World"" is just a new name for a rebuilt park, and the fourth film, in fact, is something like a free remake of the very first part, ignoring the existence of sequels.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Maybe this is because I've only watched one trailer and avoid all other promotional material (I always do this because I find these days just too much is given away). To me this is had the same awe and spectacle as seeing the original when I was 12, yes it's hard to live up to a classic film 20 years later, you can't instantly pin down a classic, but I believe this was a really good sequel, much better than all the other Jurassic Park sequels and many other 2nd films in franchises.It's hard to wow an audience these days but I believe that this film managed to bring back that summer blockbuster feel of the 90s. It was easy to gloss over some of the more negative elements for me, the product placement at the beginning was excessive and obvious, especially as the film was taking about the commercialisation of everything. It almost felt like a commercial for Mercedes at one point. But to get into the details without spoiling, basically Chris Pratt was great as Peter Quill Dinosaur hunter, we can gloss over that too, because he came across as totally bad-ass and believable, and Bryce Dallas Howard who had the most in the way of character development didn't feel stereotyped or forced, quite identifiable actually, and her chemistry with Pratt was superb. Yes the plot was quite obvious, but they did say this was a mix of remake and sequel, so some elements are going to be reused. For one I didn't actually find the kids irritating, even less so than the whiny brats in the original film. They actually had a point being there and were even able to show resilience, being able to look after themselves, they were not just there to be saved. The deaths seemed to hit home more, although we instantly knew who was going to get eaten, this didn't distract from the fun of watching it happen. There was enough twisting and turning of the plot to keep us on our toes and plenty of scares, I don't think I've jumped so much for years! There were loads of geeky nods to the original film which make us very happy and the supporting cast were all good and believable without being stereotyped, (which happens so often in sci-fi movies,) especially BD Wong, now that's a villain for the 21st century.I wont go further into the plot, I just think you need to go see this film. It's action packed, CGI madness, but deserves a lot higher praise, especially after the disappointment this year of Avengers 2. I can easily see this spurring on more films and with this level of quality I can't wait to see what comes next as it was a brilliant addition to the Jurassic Park world!","19 out of 45 found this helpful.

Now this one has lots of nods to the original so if your a fan of the first your gonna love those.However is the movie perfect...no that's because there are characters that felt a little too cartoonish to be real and the movie does have a slow introduction to Chris Pratt's character but once he comes in the movie gets quite interesting.The movie also feels as though it is remaking the first two films with some scenes that were clearly put in the movie because it worked great in the first two.All in all you come to this movie expecting dinosaurs wreaking havoc amongst the island and that's exactly what you get and it pays off as a great entry into the franchise and leaves you wanting more (sequel maybe).","19 out of 45 found this helpful.

The sense of novelty back then was near magical, so expectation was high for this new installment. Jurassic World is basically reincarnation of the first two titles. Utilizing grand spectacle and cheeky nostalgia factor it succeeds in capturing the essence of the franchise. It may be predictable and frankly not as awe-inspiring as the first, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable film for both old and new audiences.The plot remains the same, they put dinosaurs on display and wait until human hubris ruins everything. We all know what will happen, and there's not much cerebral twist or groundbreaking narrative. Safe to say it plays to its strength without revolutionizing the genre, which is all right. It has great production value to deliver what had already worked on capturing audience's imagination.Visual takes a very familiar approach, not only on subtle details or atmosphere, you can literally see intentional throwbacks to past glory. Wardrobes such as Chris Pratt's shirt and vest or Bryce Howard's blouse and tanktop, which admittedly look good on her, are incredibly similar to previous characters' features. Nifty tidbits are reinvented with more futuristic design, in some scenes the film almost channels Jurassic Park's spirit.Acting is pretty upfront for blockbuster movie. Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard deliver the leading roles as expected. They are capable and their chemistry is adequately presentable, thanks to a few timely humors. Supporting characters like Irrfan Khan's billionaire persona and the two new kids are decent as well. The kids in particular are not exact carbon copy of Hammond's grandkids, I admit I had assumed them as such, they perform enough with material at hand to differentiate themselves.Vincent D'Onofrio, on the other hand, is not really fully utilized. After his brilliant performance in Daredevil, or his entire career for that matter, it's a bit underwhelming to see him as typical corporate role. The movie also has several questionable parts, these feel a bit forced to move things along. They consist of on-screen poor decisions and anomalies, though they are not major enough to derail the movie.Second half presents everything audience would want from a film with Jurassic in its title. The scenes are incredible, full with continuous shots of the creatures in spectacular view. It capitalizes on the momentum towards the latter half with rapid crazy sequences. If you like something from previous titles, chances are you'll find it here.Jurassic World is not the next step of cinematic evolution, it is the epitome of spiritual successor.

While Jurassic World is not as good as the original, not even close, it is a good movie in it's own right. As to be expected the plot wasn't very original, but take that with the grain of salt that going in you don't expect too much originality. That being said while not very original, the stakes in this film are higher than in the original, as the first film dealt with 15 or so people on the island, this movie deals with thousands. In the end I found the plot to have enough twists to keep me interested, the movie had a surprising amount of humor (including a hilarious Jimmy Fallon cameo), and an awesome climax.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

Jurassic Park fans finally got their wish in a very big way. Yes, there's been some odd-bag remarks, but ultimately you have to decide whether it's a worthy sequel or not. Set 22 years since the incident in the original film, Jurassic World takes a slightly different turn from the other two sequels. There's enough grounded material to remind the viewer that this is a Jurassic Park film, yet takes a few new turns. Steven Spielberg may not be directing this one, but he's got his signature all over it, everything from the visual concepts to the tid-bits. Yes, it's not Jurassic Park, but it's what Jurassic Park should have been if the attraction ever got off the ground. It's a well packed action movie that hardly lets down once it starts. There are plenty of Easter Eggs to be found with references to the first three films, relying heavily on the original Jurassic Park. This is scarier and more up-front in your face, but if your kids can handle a movie like Jurassic Park to begin with, I wouldn't worry too much.

"7","/10","A worthy sequel to Jurassic Park.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3259804/?ref_=tt_urv","hennyxu","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38817808/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2015","""Jurassic Park: An adventure 65 Million Years in the Making"" and after two less than stellar sequels and 22 years they've finally managed to make a fun and worthy sequel to the first movie. So what is this film about? In short, they've officially opened the park under the name Jurassic World and the park is doing well enough. However, to increase profit/ratings etc. they've decided to create something big and scary. This monster escapes from captivity and starts causing problems for the entire park. Resulting in our protagonists, played by Chriss Pratt (from: Guardians of the Galaxy) and Bryce Howard (from: The Village), to find a way to stop it and save the island.After watching this film I have to admit that it was more enjoyable than I had expected, while it was far from perfect it was most certainly better than movie 2 and 3. Sure there were moments that really pushed my suspense of disbelieve and it even jumped the shark 1 time, however this didn't take away the fact that it was an enjoyable film to watch. The most important thing for me is that they brought back the sense of wonder and discovery something that was just glanced over in the previous sequels and totally neglected in other movies (yeah I'm talking about you ""Jupiter Ascending""). This sense of wonder is achieved by the use of practical effects and GOOD use of CGI (this is something I would love to write about in the future). However, the most contributing thing about the movie is John Williams's score. He brought back the old theme to create a sense of nostalgia for old viewers (like me  ) and truly expanded the music creating an, for the lack of a better word, Jurassic atmosphere. Three act structure: The beginning of the movie is truly the gem. This is the part that introduces/reintroduces us to the Jurassic and from a child's perspective we are shown how wonderful dinosaurs are (at least it shows us how pretty they are to look at). The movie uses references to Jurassic Park and ups the wow factor with its music and grandness that is Jurassic World with wide camera shots and overviews of the park. We are also introduced to the protagonists and antagonists and this is all done in a likable way. I do have to admit that the introduction of the movie's plot (the monster) was regrettable since this felt like something from another movie. The middle: In my personal opinion I thought this was the weakest part of the film. Maybe with a little more build up or tension it would have been better. I would call this part the CHASE or the HUNT (depending on the perspective). The good thing is that we see our protagonists handle with real props and practical effects, which contributes to the feel of the movie. However, I think they should have used this part to better develop the antagonists since they weren't well developed at the end (IMHO).The End The movie picks up the pace and combines the best of everything that happens in the movie. Sure this is the part that you'll have to suspend your sense of disbelieve to truly enjoy it, but the pace and action well make up for it. It is a great ride to the finish. The Good: - Great Music Score by John Williams - A lot of Easter eggs for movie enthusiasts - Good beginning - Likable characters - Sense of wonder and excitement - T-RexThe Bad - 3D is not worth it. I'm sick and tired of this stupid gimmick. Yes there are movies made for 3D and they do look amazing, but most movies are just 3D filtered using computer software. If possible do not watch this in 3D. - Antagonists needs to be better developed - Movie length. I think it needs at least 10 min cut to improve the pacing a little. - Pushed the suspense of disbelief to the limit and it jumped the shark 1 time. - Some movie quibblesThe dinosaurs are back looking better than ever. It's not a perfect movie but it is a good sequel to a great movie. It is a bit long with 124min but it is a ride worth taking. Plus it has baby triceratops that has to be a plus right? I liked this movie and I'm very curious about the sequel(s).","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's boring and it's not actually about the main thing. At least it's not what I would want to watch. The relationship problems between people make me bored. Characters are too boring but movies focus too much on the personal life of others. Clearly they are story-wise amateurish and therefore they are not worthy to be watched. Each movie is pretty much about the same stuff.But in this movie we finally watch a real deal Jurassic Park and dinosaur stuff without boring people with idiocy, too much personal life and politics. It's not so good but at least it's not so amateurish. The movie satisfying enough.Sometimes the movie killed the mood when the main guy and the woman was literally having fight around the dinosaurs about their former love life while they try to escape from dinosaurs but at least they didn't focus too much about it.I got bored while watching old Jurassic Park movies when I was a kid and before I watched this movie I could barely endure watching the old movies and I can say it was waste of time.

How can we turn any natural facet to our own advantage–for war, for food, for simple amusement? The latest entry in the series, Jurassic World, has finally arrived after fourteen years of dinosaur-less cinema, and I'm proud to say that it's distinct enough from its predecessors. It chooses to go even deeper into the idea of not only genetically creating dinosaurs, but also genetically modifying them to the point where we begin to see hybrids of two different species.Following the severe mishap that was Jurassic Park because of–again– man's delusions (in that case, good-intentioned but seriously mistaken John Hammond), a new theme park has been built on the same island of Isla Nublar that seems to be working just fine and accepting thousands and thousands of visitors. It's Disney World except with dinosaurs–my god, how cool would that be? Aquariums, vast dinosaur-populated plains for touring, and other fun rides make up the majority of what this magical place has to offer. Of course, with such an ambitious idea, something terrible is always bound to transpire at one point or another. Suddenly, the boundaries we thought could easily keep humans safe from those spine-chilling carnivores are somehow demolished, and in comes chaos.This time around, instead of series favorites like Sam Neill as Dr. Grant or Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, we have 2014-born-movie-star Chris Pratt in the lead role as a muscular Velociraptor expert/trainer with the return of Bryce Dallas Howard as well (seriously, what happened to her? I thought The Help and Spider-Man 3 were financially successful). The two charismatic actors are surrounded by astounding production design and dazzling visual effects. You can whine about the pervasiveness of CGI all you want, but I've revisited the first film– Jurassic Park–a few days ago. Aside from the T-Rex, let's just say that those dinosaurs haven't been exactly aging well. In this film, I thought all of them looked completely believable and impressively- conceived; so I'm not complaining for the next few years (we'll see how it looks two decades down the road), especially when you get some amazing dino-versus-dino sequences. I won't spoil anything, but I'm sure you've always dreamed of seeing your favorite dinosaur species fiercely fighting it out and ripping each other to shreds with one's strength and the other's speed and calculation.Unlike The Lost World where the first half honestly bored me to a point where I was crazily yearning for some dinosaurs to finally pop up on- screen, Jurassic World presents you with such an immaculately-designed amusement park, using its two adolescent characters {13-year-old Gray (Ty Simpkins) and 20-year-old Zach (Nick Robinson)} to navigate through the various spellbinding museums and park tours while intercutting with the scientific/corporate storyline that shows us what's really going on behind all that awe and wonder. You're entertained from the get-go, and the long build-up to the appearance of the first killer dinosaur only excites you that much more.Now, the highest points of the series have always come in those times of real suspense and fright. That's precisely why I enjoyed Jurassic Park III a lot more than everyone else; almost everything in that forest was incredibly menacing and every step the characters took in whatever direction might've been their very last. I loved that dark, horror element. Unfortunately, save for one very particular end to a character, the deaths here are hardly creative and impactful. Very little blood and gore is shown in comparison to the last two movies (which were rated PG-13 too), and there's nothing that can show the sheer danger of an approaching carnivore more than the amount of damage it inflicts on human flesh. No, the villains are killed off rather quickly, and most of the major characters with a given name make it through alive. In sum, Jurassic World is definitely one of the lightest and most humorous entries in the franchise for better or worse. It's undoubtedly a lot of fun even when the situations turn to obvious implausibility.For future reference though, please, filmmakers–just please–stop this trend of self-awareness. Your movie isn't magically better and cooler just because you make some subtle remark about how you're a sequel/remake in today's heavily corporate Hollywood. ""Get it, guys? We're on the same page!"" No, just stop Jurassic World does as much as it can to get all of those original fans back with pleasure; every moment seems to be carefully guiding itself along without upsetting and offending the viewers with unexpected, outlandish dinosaur segments like the ""Alan!"" dream in Jurassic Park III or the T-Rex's King Kong-style rampage across San Diego in The Lost World. Of course, I just know that as I say this, some hardcore nitpickers, who have no sense of what lightening up and purely enjoying blockbuster entertainment means, will be ripping this film apart as well. I guess some people will have to get used to the fact that future sequels will never capture the magic in seeing dinosaurs on the big screen for the first time like the original did. That can only be accomplished once. Duh! Anyway, I fully commend the series for constantly reinventing and keeping each entry unique from the others.","18 out of 43 found this helpful.

Let me start off by giving some perspective, Jurassic Park was the film that made me go ""I want to make movies"" that film took me to a place I never thought could be witnessed by anyone. Dinosaurs were real, flesh and blood. Tooth and jaw. It was glorious and that film is the sole reason I want to be a film maker. Skip to Jurassic Park 3, I'm sitting in the cinema not expecting much but being hopeful nonetheless because this franchise is close to my heart. The opening of that film set the tone for the film and that tone was....Excrement. Anyways lets get to Jurassic World, this film I went in with even lower expectations in fact I was almost certain I was going to hate this film because each sequel after the first film never justified themselves for being a sequel. But my opinion slowly changed. For one the film was sold out. I have never been to a sold out film ever. Not only that but the line wrapped around the inside of the Cinema towards the ticket booth. I was flabbergasted. Once me and my friends got our seats we just were completely taken away with the whole situation. I couldn't believe this many people were here wanting to see this film. Once it began all my reservations were gone. I became 6 years old again and I lost my composure.This film is the first film I can say that is worthy of being called a sequel. It goes places that are familiar but new at the same time and it respects its heritage, whereas JP3 shat on the heritage completely. I don't want to give away anything at all but I will say this. If you loved the ending sequence of Jurassic Park you're gonna love this one even more. It blows that scene out of the water...literally. Anyways go see it.","18 out of 43 found this helpful.

Jurassic World boasts a great cast with visuals and is directed by Colin Trevorrow, the director of the critically acclaimed movie, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"". This movie acts out the extremely predictable creation of magnum opus Jurassic World envisioned by John Hammond and the genetic splice of two dinosaurs named ""Indominous Rex"". The lack of emotion, drama, and care for characters are made up with spectacular visuals. This movie may not have the best plot or characterization, but it surely has enough teeth and fun to satisfy moviegoers. The outcome? The outcome is a perfect summer blockbuster movie that is ready to tear up the box office.Twenty-two years later, after the severe events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar is finally a fully functional theme park that attracts tons of visitors each day. But since the revival of T-Rex's and Pterenadon's are very old, the Director,(Bryce Dallas Howard) and the park's engineers decide to spice things up by making a genetically modified hybrid dino.Not having learnt anything at all from the last three Jurassic movies, the main characters still end up being part of the poorly written and pictured cat and mouse chase which is basically showcased in every Jurassic movie except the first one. As Bryce Dallas Howard struggles to get control of her truant nephews, Velociraptor trainer Chris Pratt, prevents his notorious security chief,(Vincent D' Onforio), from using the trained dinosaurs as weapons in case of emergency.Exiting the pre-development hell after 10 years, this beast of a film knits together the various pieces cooked up by Steven Spielberg himself, and many others. This disaster of a plot has a big enough hole for all the Avengers to jump right into another universe. This much troubled plot is also written by Colin Trevorrow's long lasting partners Derek Conelly and Rick Jaffa the writer of the amazing ""Planet Of the Apes"". One of the biggest holes is the concept itself. After the severe aftermath of Jurassic Park, how can Jurassic World even be made? Adding up to the weak plot, the TWO lost children, giant killing dinosaur, and the zero parent material concept has been repeated multitudinous times right from the Michael Crichton time. Even though Chris Pratt keeps the movie light at some points with his uneven comedy, the plot still struggles. Unlike every Steven Spielberg movie, this movie is just unable to make you care for the characters. Even though there is a some drama and emotion during the two hour run-time, there isn't enough chemistry between the characters. By the climax of the movie, you still wouldn't care about the welfare of any of the other characters. This movie wants to do a lot, but ends up doing very well in only a few things. The characterization part of the story is actually the weakest point of the film. Even though Jurassic World comes short in it's storytelling and characterization, watching it in theaters on an IMAX screen with a bag of popcorn isn't such a bad idea. The dinosaur menagerie definitely gives you enough popcorn thrills for you to be seated on the edge. But this movie lacks to some extent the nail-biting experience you probably had when you watched the original Jurassic Park. Colin is able to bring his whole dinosaur crew into action, despite it attempt for love is soulless. It's ambitious but ultimately lacks soul. Is it any good? Yes, it can be watched as extremely fun roller-coaster dinosaur ride. The Visuals, the IMAX, and the popcorn should be enough to sell yourself.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

While flawed, JW is ultimately a strong, nostalgic and well made blockbuster that avoids the flaws of the other sequels. The Lost World descends into mediocrity and lacks an interesting plot, while Jurassic Park III is devoid of a compelling story, although it has some cool set pieces later on. This one actually has a good plot, although it's a bit mystifying as to why they went ahead and opened the park. A genetically modified dinosaur goes on the rampage, giving the plot a tight, suspenseful focus and once again having the thought provoking themes of hubris the original had. It's tense, exciting and there's actually a sense of fear as this time many members of the public are involved. The trailers looked generic but thankfully this is a pleasant surprise, and most likely soon to join the Billion Dollar Club. The biggest surprise of all is that the kids are actually semi bearable.With a good story, decent CGI and plenty of tension, this is a good blockbuster, but flaws are aplenty. The action doesn't reach the heights of prior instalments and the finale has a bit too much CGI. The characters aren't done well. Although he gets through the film with one expression mostly, Chris Pratt does a fine job as the hero, but the other characters are side-lined, while Bryce Dallas Howard, despite her best efforts, is stuck with a boring, tedious and irritating character. Somewhat unremarkable and occasionally reeking of sexism, JW lacks true punch and opts for more generic CGI set pieces. More effective are the nostalgic nods to the original film. After the 22 year wait for another good Jurassic Park film, fans of the original will undoubtedly appreciate this. Colin Trevorrow isn't Steven Spielberg, but he directs the film well and more often than not borrows intelligently from Spielberg and uses genuine suspense. There are illogical plot points here and there but you're unlikely to notice them. Good stuff overall.7/10","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I usually tend to just wait for things to come out on disc if it appeals to me at all. However, with the recent come back of Godzilla in 2014, and now Jurassic World, I've had two reasons to come to the theaters two years in a row.These kind of movies are without a doubt, the reason you go see films in an actual theater. Big dinosaurs on a big screen, loud roars and thudding footsteps from a booming sound system, action packed, thrilling scenes along with something in it for the whole family to enjoy. You literally almost can't go wrong with a movie as long as you have some ferocious dinosaurs on the screen. Specifically Jurassic World itself, along with the rest of the older installments, have always made their dinos look amazing. Scientific evidence aside, these dinos look believable and very life like. The plot for this movie is solid, and goes back to Jurassic Parks original roots. A dinosaur theme park gone wrong. A dinosaur theme park, realistically, if it were to ever happen, would be INCREDIBLE. That in itself, is a reason why this is such a great movie to bring that to life. For this installment of the series though, the theme park looked phenomenal. It really makes you want to be right down there with everyone else inside of the park, exploring all the neat new things all about dinosaurs. Simply seeing the new park they have built for this movie in itself is ALSO another great reason to watch this. (and some cool throwbacks to the older JP as well)Jurassic World is a solid entry into the Jurassic Park collection, exceeding all of it's prequels and is on par, if not better than the original Jurassic Park. The movie is not perfect, however. It has some minor flaws and cheese moments with corny attempts at humor throughout. It's almost as if they were trying to ruin the intensity of the action/thriller scenes. I didn't want any of that thrill to be watered down or be broken up with humor attempts, I wanted to be at the edge of my seat the whole time. I know Jurassic Park movies have always thrown in a few jokes here and there before the action started to go down. However, I feel the original movies placed humor into the films a bit better without breaking the intensity. I literally almost cringed when Jimmy Fallon appeared in the movie, and as soon as he was on screen, everyone in the theater laughed. He didn't even do anything yet. He simply showed on screen, and everyone instantly laughed... why? But that was more of an audience of my own experience thing, and not the films fault. I couldn't laugh at the material anyway, because I was too focused on what was going to happen.Overall though, if you liked any of the Jurassic Park movies, go see it. If you want a good movie to go see with the family, go see it! If you just like movies with great action sequences and dinosaurs running rampant with some spectacular sequences and set pieces, I highly recommend this to go see in theaters. I know I personally will be anticipating the blu-ray release, as well as more Jurassic movies!","38 out of 103 found this helpful.

This consistency makes it enjoyable for the wider audience, and I enjoyed it myself as a spectacle. There isn't any real depth to the film - the story line is comfortingly predictable and it has the cheesy one liners to accompany it. The cheesy one liners are a bit tongue in cheek - they are are geared to have fun with the audience and it works. The cast works. Chris Pratt plays the hero effortlessly. The one person who stood out for me and gave depth to a role was Vincent D'Onofrio. He was intense and quietly sinister. The visual and special effects make the movie a real spectacle. Some of the sequences are great to watch and give it a real blockbuster quality. It doesn't offer anything deeper than that and doesn't try to. It lacks the tension and genuine quality of the original but it's still enjoyable viewing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There's nothing new here, nothing remotely interesting, unless you just paid to see dinosaurs eating people and wrecking stuff, in which case you'll get your money's worth. It's like Spielberg is just ripping off himself now, same big brass music, same stock characters (Chris Pratt only needs a whip and a hat to make the transformation to Indiana Jones complete), the bratty yet super smart and noble kids, the driven mother figures, the megalomaniac billionaire and the usual Spielberg villain: The Military Industrial Complex. The writing team (which includes Michael Crichton, who's been dead for years) seems to have spent around 5 minutes on the script. It's a rehash of bad jokes and cornball clichés. I guess they figured their target audience (11 year olds?) could care less. Even Chris Pratt can't save this movie from itself--he barely cracks a smile. He looks as miserable I felt watching it. Nowhere is it explained that, with three previous attempts at a dinosaur theme park being unmitigated disasters, who was it who actually wanted another one with even bigger, deadlier monsters and ""more teeth?"" Are we consumers really that masochistic? If Disney World had such a high death toll, would they be building MORE parks just like it?Save your money. Stay home and watch the original. Still the best and most thrilling. Back when Spielberg thought the story was as important as the special effects.","77 out of 160 found this helpful.

Again, I had to fell asleep... It's impossible to watch it without! When I woke up, I find I didn't miss nothing...oh! wrong! I missed one or two dino-kills. I have to say that i liked the other jurassic movies. This is the worse of them all and one of the worse movies i saw this year.","60 out of 122 found this helpful.

Still located on a Costa Rican island, Isla Nubla the original Jurassic Park is now a fully functioning theme park resort with 20000 customers being entertained by various dinosaur related attractions. Jurassic World however is losing its edge and in the corporate world that makes entrepreneurs pushy.Jurassic World is owned by an entrepreneur called Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and managed by a jobsworth Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Claire seems more preoccupied with running the theme park than giving her teenage nephews her full attention when they come to visit. Dark forces see the potential for the dinasours to have military uses. Generic engineering is at the fore to design ever more scary dinasours including the latest creation an Indominus Rex.Could chaos ensue? Could a Pratt come to the rescue? That would be telling. A thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster movie that doesn't rely on its cast (I've not heard of anyone except a certain Executive Producer called Steven Spielberg). The acting is secondary to the excellent special effects that has to be used in a film like this. Is it really thirty years since Jurassic Park!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes I realized that he was the lead in Guardians of the Galaxy, but he was kind of goofy in that, and I still know him mostly from Parks and Rec. and I just didn't see Andy as the leader of a pack of Velociraptors. (We saw that in the Trailers so most would agree that it is not a spoiler)Anyway my concerns aside, I was a big fan of the original Jurassic movies, and I couldn't wait to see this one.Boy am I glad I did. The movie was great. I'm not sure how those not familiar with the original will feel about this one, but how many people of movie going age are not? It's been available on Video for like 15 years, so if you are old enough to get into this one, the chances are you at least saw it at a friends house.The movie was beautiful, generally well acted, and most importantly gave us the chance to have the question of ""what might have happened if they had been able to actually open the park?""The answer of course was given to us in Lost World in the form of a quote from Ian Malcolm. ""Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and um, screaming.""Andy, I mean Starlord, I mean Chris Pratt did just fine. They left the door wide open for the sequel, and I'm sure that I will see that one on opening weekend as well.","17 out of 41 found this helpful.

JP2 wasn't a great movie and 3 was a train wreck. Admittedly the scene in the trailer with the raptors running alongside Chris Pratt on a bike made me very sceptical, but all of that was immediately demolished.Assuming that we are prepared to believe a movie where dinosaurs are brought back from extinction and become theme park attractions, any other logical failings in the film are permissable.For me, the movie recaptured all the charm and the oomph of the first film. Yes we know the format by now, and this film had its fair share of predictable moments, but somehow this film still had an edge to it. It was like being 8 again and seeing this concept for the first time.The fact that it's set in a working theme park, which for me really reminded me of both Universal Studios and Disneyland in California, made this a more tangible concept.What I especially appreciated were the homages and nods to the original movie. I'm also pleased that they honoured Stan Winston and Richard Attenborough in the set design.I also enjoyed that the film had a more gritty edge to it than the first - still not very graphic but the gore wasn't simply implied this time round as it had been earlier.Great stuff. I hope that if there's to be a sequel it will be as good as this.","18 out of 44 found this helpful.

Second thing is that the rest of the cast are not good. You would think that with such a great cast that the acting would be good but its not. Third there is almost no character development at all, its like they don't even care that any of what happened.

So, we want more thrill, more variety and more adventures than the previous movies. And this movie surely offers thrills, varieties and adventures in 3D format. If you loved Jurassic Park, or not, you just have to watch this at any cost, because it's worth it. Irrfan Khan is the owner of Jurassic World. His role is bigger than I thought it would be! He is superb as usual. The main hero, Chris Pratt is also acts well and handsome hunk, too. Ty and Nick, two kids, are also good in their respective roles. Their bonding as brothers described well. Heroine is Bryce Dallas Howard and she is pretty and also acts good. Supporting cast is good. Locations and camera-work is undoubtedly too good. In this type of movies, the director's work depends on the camera-work and visual effects. Both are equally good. We can't imagine that the creatures which we are seeing, are fake! Kudos to the team. Some scenes can make you surprise. You can't control yourself for saying Oh, my God! Jumping of the kids in the river is one of those scenes. If you want to be stress-free, tension-free, and want to enjoy your weekend with your family, than this is a delight watch for you.

This sequel to the beloved original stomps onto the scene with a roar, promising bigger, badder beasties and enough thrills to make even the bravest palaeontologist sweat.Let's start with the good stuff: The animation is top-notch, bringing these prehistoric giants to life with stunning detail and terrifying presence. From the iconic T-Rex to the razor-sharp Indominus Rex, each creature feels like a living, breathing marvel, ready to tear through the screen and into your nightmares (in the best way possible, of course).The story, while not exactly groundbreaking, is a fast-paced thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a charming animal behaviorist with a knack for taming velociraptors, finds himself facing a Jurassic-sized problem when a genetically modified dinosaur escapes its enclosure. Cue the chaos!Pratt delivers a solid performance as the reluctant hero, balancing humor and action with a surprising amount of heart. Bryce Dallas Howard is equally compelling as Claire Dearing, the park's corporate manager who must navigate both the ethical and practical implications of the dino-disaster. The supporting cast, including Jeff Goldblum reprising his iconic role as Dr. Ian Malcolm, adds some welcome humor and wisdom to the mix.But like any good Jurassic Park film, it's not all sunshine and prehistoric smiles. Some might argue that the plot leans a bit too heavily on familiar tropes, with echoes of the original film's themes and even some recycled jump scares. And while the dinosaurs are undeniably impressive, some might feel their awe overshadowed by the film's focus on action and spectacle.So, is ""Jurassic World"" a roaring success or a dino-mite dud? It depends on what you're looking for. If you crave edge-of-your-seat thrills, stunning visuals, and a healthy dose of action, then this film is sure to leave you satisfied. But if you're expecting a groundbreaking story or a deep exploration of the ethical implications of genetic engineering, you might leave feeling a bit peckish for more.Ultimately, ""Jurassic World"" is a fun, action-packed summer blockbuster that brings new life to the Jurassic Park franchise. It's not perfect, but it's a good time for audiences who are ready to scream, cheer, and maybe even shed a tear (or two) as they revisit Isla Nublar. Just remember, when the T-Rex is chasing you, don't outrun it - outrun your friends! Now, grab your popcorn, fasten your seatbelts, and prepare for a wild ride through Jurassic World!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Old Fashioned Creature Scares instead of Uber-CGI","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3256962/?ref_=tt_urv","kgprophet","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1158617/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2015","After the seemingly unneeded critics review embargo lifted, I started reading through the reviews to get an idea of what was in store for JP4 (or JW4?). One reviewer hit upon the appeal of the original movie, was that it created a world where you could actually believe they made dinosaurs. None of the technology depicted looked like fantasy, and none of the activities of the dinosaurs defied the laws of gravity. Fast-forward 22 years, and filmmakers seem to be obliged to give us over-the-top, causing realism to get tossed out the window. The other thing lost on modern CGI spectacle films is the sense of tension. Here, after years of tinkering, Spielberg carefully crafts new set pieces that can still get you jumpy. Also credit the careful effects work, the CGI contains enough animal characteristics to feel realistic. One of the new conventions that I don't disagree with these days is not even bothering to create characters that you are going to care for. Another recent blockbuster ""San Andreas"" disposed of the formalities and went straight into havoc mode. Here we don't get preachy or run through the obligatory checklist of all cliché characters and their cliché hangups. We still get stuck with a strange subplot about weaponizing the technology in regards to breeding Dino-Soldiers. Believe me it was supposed to be worse.So I congratulate the filmmakers for being more concerned about creating a film that holds some good scares than trying to make it about bigger CGI. Nevertheless, all the wide shots of the theme park, and stuff like the monorail, looked like CG models. It was also interesting to see effects shots that were in the trailer many months ago looking very different in the final film after they were all 'cleaned up'. One thing you wish could be improved upon is the intelligence quotient of the cast. It's OK if some of your expendable cast does some illogical things, but you should expect your main characters to act intelligently to keep the audience with you. It's these intelligent moments that are missing that makes you appreciate the original creation by Spielberg and how infrequent such a well crafted film comes about (I saw JP four times in the theatre when it first came out).The scary moments in JW are borrowed directly from the film Aliens, which is not such a bad thing. I remember enjoying some good scares in that monster film. There are many borrowed moments from the first Jurassic Park, including the tear-jerking animatronic dying dinosaur breathing it's last breath. But why throw in the holograms? Most things they showed in this film I could buy as present day technology. But in the main pavilion they show 3D holograms of dinosaurs walking around. Of course 3D holograms that you can walk around and see a complete 360 degrees does not exist. It was too bad they decided to toss this in, it made the film more about CGI eye candy than realism.All the acting was competent, it was just too bad that they had such flimsy setups to work with. Problems with jumps in time and many events happening off screen created a choppy attempt at creating empathy between relatives. Still, the scary sequences still work because the filmmakers know how to make you squirm. Fans of Chris Pratt will be glad to hear he somehow can eke out some charisma despite so little to go on. Less so for Bryce Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio, who are trapped in their cliché roles. And poor Judy Greer, looking to show some acting range, has to literally phone it in. Ty Simpkins, the kid from Ironman 3, is allowed to respond intelligently and had the best chance at keeping the audience grounded. Less said for the third act, where Chris Pratt needs to take charge and be the connecting thread for all the final showstoppers.This film ultimately gets a thumbs up, and could be possibly one of the best of the summer films in terms of getting the most thrills for your buck. Perhaps Hollywood is finally hearing our complaints about Summer Films getting over-bloated and testing our patience by going over the 2 hour mark. Jurassic World benefits from this. Good pacing on the one hand means large chunks of story go missing, but it means you get out of the theatre before your attention span wanes.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I myself had read Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park and seen The Lost World but not the other two movies in the series. I thought most of the action sequences were awesome. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard certainly had some chemistry with their back-and-forth dialogue. The fact that Ms. Howard got to save Chris in one scene was also cool to see. The boy teen and his younger brother were also fine when they were dealing with the chaos around them. Reading the notes on this site, I was pleasantly surprised that this was partly shot in New Orleans, where I live a two-hour drive from, in the abandoned Six Flags park there and some other buildings there. Oh, and knowing Jimmy Buffett makes a cameo was something I knew beforehand but my friend didn't so he was surprised when I told him. In summary, Jurassic World was a worthy sequel to watch.","22 out of 56 found this helpful.

Set years after the original Jurassic Park, the film introduces a fully functional dinosaur theme park, complete with awe-inspiring attractions and cutting-edge technology. However, the quest for bigger and more thrilling attractions leads to the creation of the genetically-engineered Indominus Rex, a dinosaur that quickly becomes a catastrophic threat.Chris Pratt shines as Owen Grady, a charismatic raptor trainer with a deep understanding of the park's creatures. His chemistry with Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager, adds a human element to the dinosaur chaos. The young actors, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, also deliver engaging performances as Claire's nephews caught in the adventure.The visual effects are spectacular, bringing dinosaurs to life in a way that is both thrilling and terrifying.

Right from the beginning, this movie isn't afraid to be somewhat different than what came before. Unlike every previous installment in the franchise, ""Jurassic World"" doesn't open with somebody getting hurt or killed by dinosaurs. That is fresh.The kids arrive and begin enjoying the park. Only this part of the movie isn't long. The movie cannot do without yet another story of dinosaurs breaking free and wreaking havoc. Those two kids could be the basis for the whole picture. One of them is clearly not enthusiastic about the park itself, he's basically there to watch over his little brother. The plot could have focused on them and how they go from one attraction to another, exploring their relationship as brothers. The young actors weren't bad at all, and the movie could have done more with them. But it does not.Dinosaurs, apparently, are no longer interesting for crowds of people, even though the park is clearly packed with visitors. But the movie states that the popularity isn't big enough. What you see and what you are told are incompatible, they contradict each other. Regardless, the scientific division has come up with a solution. They have genetically engineered a new species of dinosaur. It is bigger than the T Rex and it has several superpowers. First, it can hide its thermal signature from the tech designed to monitor it. But the creature only uses it once. Second, it can camouflage. But the creature only uses it once throughout the whole film. Regardless, the new dinosaur breaks free and trouble is imminent.Owen, an ex-military and now an animal handler, and his ex-girlfriend Claire, who is now running the park, must find a solution to this crisis. Also, the two kids from the beginning are her nephews. Also, there are people that want to use dinosaurs in wars. The third movie had a very simple plot, too simple, perhaps. The fourth one is the other way around. It has too many elements to deal with. They do not have enough time to shine. All of this material feels like it could be two movies instead of one.So, the plot does deserve criticism. What also deserves it is how the movie handles death scenes, which is worse than ""The Lost World"". The new super carnivore is interesting. And it isn't the only addition to the carnivore arena. Herbivores are also there, and they have more screen time than in the third film. The cast and the performances were good. What was bad about them is, again, how they were handled. They simply needed more space to breathe. The movie is packed. Visual effects were good, definitely better than the last time.And finally, the franchise chooses to have most of the action take place at daytime, and totally avoid rain. The visuals, in general, were very pleasant, by the way. Only the plot is highly problematic. It wants too much and it does not avoid serious mistakes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When the new ""Jurassic World"" theme park is opened, it builds on the promise of it's doomed predecessor but this time, they have state of the art safety facilities to protect the visiting lunch box brigade. Or do they? Unfortunately for them, ""Indominus Rex"", wasn't at the read-through and has a mind to eat just about anything he can wrap his jaws around. What he can't devour, his eager - recently released - friends from elsewhere in the park are plenty keen on too - so we quickly find ourselves with a ""containment anomaly"" that leads to a distinct carnage scenario for our hero to avert. As ever, Pratt brings oodles of personality to his role as the velociraptor's pal, but the rest of the cast - to an human - are poor. The kids grate and ought to have been eaten very early on, and gazillionaire Irrfan Khan (""Masrani"") is way to dapper and refined to be a convincing baddie. Vincent D'Onofio tries to help out, at least his part has some meat to it, but otherwise this is just a cracking victory for Pratt and some outstanding visual effects without even a rousing score from John Williams to rely upon and some storylines that are contrived to maximise the menace and minimise the plausibility. If you can find it showing on a big screen anywhere, then it is still worth watching on a wet afternoon, but it loses much of any potency it ever had on the small screen and I'm not sure I'd bother again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thus 22 years ago did Spielberg thrill and excite us with Jurassic Park, a film that made you believe that dinosaurs had been resurrected and taught you, besides anything else, that toilet cubicles are not good hiding places.Now here comes Jurassic World. The plot may be vaguely familiar, but the environment is stepped up several notches. The relaunched Isla Nublar is open for business with 20,000 excitable visitors flocking this way (and that). Bryce Dallas Howard (""The Help"", ""Spiderman 3"") plays park manager Clare, an ice queen businesswoman who can't even be bothered to accompany her two visiting nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) during their first visit. Clare understands that American visitors are fickle things, and dinosaurs are no longer ""Wow"" enough: genetic engineering and cross-breeding are being used to create new variants: bigger; fiercer; less predictable. Chris Pratt (""Guardians of the Galaxy"") plays Owen, a velociraptor trainer yes, I didn't make that up. When things go awry in a big (a VERY big) way, Owen steps in to try to save the day.In any other year, this would probably be THE movie event of the year. As it is, Mr Abrams' Xmas feature bags that expectation slot, but JW has certainly set the bar high. The film has done phenomenal opening business – creating a new US opening weekend record at $208.8M dollars! Think about that for a minute: given the budget was only $150M, that's a return on investment for the studio within 3 days of release! But is it any good? The answer is a qualified yes. In my personal ranking, this would come second, behind the original Jurassic Park but ahead of the disappointing JP2 and JP3.Sure, its a 'park your brain at the door' sort of film, but director Colin Trevorrow, with only his second feature, delivers shock and awe at a sufficient pace to keep audiences entertained and is likely to delight kids (at least those impervious to a little light gore). The sheer spectacle of the Disneyesque visitor areas and a Shamu-like marine show are very engaging, but the film works best when it wallows in the misty-eyed nostalgia of the original classic. No spoilers, but there are a few moments of sheer nostalgic delight to be had.The leads are all effective enough, with Chris Pratt solidifying his matinée idol status ahead of a rumoured reboot of Indiana Jones. The two young leads also shine, with Nick Robinson in particular being very watchable. Great also to see BD Wong reprising his role from the original JP film.Where the film falters is with a stuttering storyline. A forced and superficial romance between the two leads is unnecessary, distracting and drives to a finale that drips with more cheese than the Brontoburgers sold in McDinos. The military involvement in the story is also strangely superficial – whilst it sets something up for an interesting sequel (""JW2: ISIS and the Revenge of the Raptors"" anyone? (Title © RJ Mann)) the film could have been much tighter had it disposed of this thread and focused on the primary storyline.In terms of the special effects, the CGI is OK but at times just tries too hard: a sequence with darting and diving velociraptors in the jungle alongside Owen's bike looks particularly ropy. Dodgy brachiosaurs aside, I still think the 22 year old combination of models and restricted CGI-usage in JP1 was more convincing and much scarier.Those concerns aside, this is a film I would gladly see again and so is recommended for an entertaining night out at the flicks.(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future reviews).","13 out of 30 found this helpful.

But after 2001, the movies disappeared, leaving me left to wonder: was Jurassic Park III really the end of an era? Ever since I was a child, watching these movies made dinosaurs one of my biggest fears. When I found that this movie was announced, I knew 2 things. One, Jurassic Park would live on, even as children who have watched this became adults. And two, which was the more important thing, if I was going to watch this movie, I would have to get to work and face my fears.Right from the get-go, the movie does not hesitate to get itself right to the action and location as we see 2 of Claire's (Bryce Dallas Howard) nephews come to Isla Nublar, where Jurassic World has become a full-fledged theme park. Being that Isla Nublar is the location of the first movie, this movie also is not afraid to remember where it all came from. You can only guess that being a Jurassic Park movie, shït will go down for the worse at some point.Meet the Indominus Rex, a hybrid created to attract visitors. That it would be in parent's nightmares is about how I would put it. When the Indominus Rex wreaks havoc, it is a really scary sight to watch. This is a great thing because it means that it accomplished its purpose: to be terrifying. But not only that, the intelligence of the Indominus is a really astonishing aspect that makes this terrible creature a unique and worthy villain.Then you have Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), an expert at understanding animals. This makes him able to communicate with velociraptors. It also makes him into a hardened protagonist, and a very likable one at that, with his no- nonsense attitude, a brave demeanor, a calm, smart mind, alongside an easygoing personality that makes him outgoing and willing to work with anything and anyone willing to work with him.Special effects were spectacular, from the night skies to the dinosaurs. Attention to detail is well-done with the dinosaurs, which one could see just by going to a Dairy Queen while the Jurassic Smash Blizzard is still available and looking at the scales of the Indominus Rex when deciding what you want from the menu.Meanwhile, the plot does what it sets out to do: be an edge of your seat thrill ride, and believe me, I WAS on the edge of my seat with this film. I'll even go as far as to say that this may just be one of the scariest movies I have seen in a long time. Like said, the Indominus was terrifying, there were gruesome deaths. However, what I also love is that it doesn't just make itself terrifying, but you get to see how dinosaurs talk to each other and even get to feel for some of the dinosaurs, from the gentle giant apatosaurus to the trained raptors to even the T- Rex!It is not for the faint of heart. But it is well worth the price of an admission ticket and does not disappoint at all. If you feel you can sit through without cowering in fear, then this is a must see.","35 out of 97 found this helpful.

The formula is practically summer audience fool-proof: show us a fully-functioning dinosaur theme park John Hammond envisioned in the original film, throw in a dangerous new hybrid created to be the new star attraction, set star attraction loose on unsuspecting park, and let the fun begin. Simple setup, great execution.What made the original so great to me was the sense of awe we felt at seeing dinosaurs depicted so realistically on screen coupled with the film's fantastic action set pieces. This is 2015, so clearly the park's native attractions are CGI and seeing a photo-realistic dinosaur on screen lost its ""wow"" factor some time ago, but what this film does recreate well are the fantastic set pieces reminiscent of classic scenes from the original such as the Jeep attack. You'll be whooping with delight during a certain sequence involving a gyrosphere ride, and let's just say the park's other patrons will NOT be having a good day. It all sets the scene for massive panic on a grand scale, which is something the original could never accomplish with its characters fighting for survival in a non-functioning theme park. Yes, this time around, we see many a tourist in danger (a certain scene involving pterodactyls ranks as a highlight of the movie), and there is no shortage of action once things get rolling.Those worried they'll stepping into a Michael Bay-esque action-a-thon need not fret: there's plenty of establishment of the primary characters and a slow (for this day and age) buildup to the action which really kicks in once the new hybrid decides she wants to finally see what's outside of her paddock...The characters are all likable and we have the requisite human villains to even it out some (let's just say you'll be rooting for the dinosaurs in some scenes) and the new hybrid is an imposing and credible new dinosaur villain that is worthy of taking the reigns from the T-Rex and the Raptors from previous films.What's more, the final 15 minutes are the best of any film in the franchise thus far--I was thoroughly impressed with the scope and scale of the finale and easily consider it the highlight of the movie, by far. You will be in action/adventure heaven just witnessing it.Dinosaurs attacking tourists, great action set pieces like the original, humor, characters just likable enough to root for, and a terrific finale: what more could you want from a summer blockbuster? Go see Jurassic World and enjoy yourself. Yes, it's not the answer to life as we know it, and there might not be much beneath the surface, but the movie is pure spectacle and sometimes that's all we need.","15 out of 36 found this helpful.

It's wise to do its own thing for the most part, though nudge-grin-wink references to the first film appear shamelessly (and, often, charmingly) around every corner. And while it's fun to point and smile at the familiar scraps of a 22-year-old film, at some point it feels like the new effort is too frightened of its own merits to cast them aside. At root, it's a simple mindless summer disaster movie with the spice of CGI dinosaurs thrown in where the earthquakes/volcanoes/tidal waves would usually go. Measured against that standard, it's still an awfully dumb bucket of over-familiar plot churn, but it feels more understandable and appropriate. Long gone are the delicate ruminations on nature, humanity and our impending role as technological gods, tossed in favor of more sizzle and fresh dino gimmicks. For all the trailer's promises that the new big bad is meaner, faster and - most importantly - smarter, it really doesn't seem to do all that much beyond stomping around the park and killing anything in sight. The new cast, helmed by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard (who, impressively, manages to dash through jungle and mountain in a pair of stylish heels), doesn't seem much brighter. A fair enough way to kill a couple hours at the cinema, but be prepared for a healthy dose of eyeball-rolls and manufactured drama.","43 out of 86 found this helpful.

This movie already has such an added pressure of living up to those classics, that its almost an impossible task to do so from the get go. The last time i watched the old Jurassic's where when they were released so you definitely don't have to remember or have watched those before seeing this movie. I almost didn't go see this movie after reading the reviews it got on here but i'm glad i did.

After all these years and no worthy Jurassic Park film to talk about, this little or should I say HUGE gem comes along. Do not listen to any of the reviews stating that acting is awful, it's predictable, clichéd and what have you, because it most definitely is NOT and is the best possible sequel to the first Jurassic Park to date. Now I am a HUGE Jurassic Park fan and (what could have been to my detriment) went in having massive expectations for this movie. And was I disappointed with the overall movie? Absolutely not!After Jurassic Park 3, all Jurassic Park fans were crying out for a worthy succession to Spielberg's masterpieces and this is definitely a worthy addition. The CGI looks amazing and the ""Jurassic World"", looks spectacular. The acting by both Pratt and Howard is superb and is well backed up by the supporting cast. The only gripe I have is a minor hole in the storyline, however I will not let that detract from what is definitely a fantastic, well rounded movie.All in all, it is both fun and exhilarating and if you are a returning Jurassic Park fan or just a regular moviegoer it is well worth a watch and is sure to not disappoint.","33 out of 91 found this helpful.

I mean we needed something to restore it back to its glory of the first 2 and make us completely forget the 3rd one ever happened right? Given the time frame between Jurassic world and the 3rd installment you would figure this would be the summers huge block buster master piece that would have everyone talking. Coming into this movie being a 90's kid who grew up loving everything related to Jurassic park I had very high expectations. Give me that bit of nostalgia and make me feel like a kid again is all I really wanted. The only thing I feared coming into this movie was the cast, and probably the extreme over use of CGI effects. The Movie itself delivered with a great story picking up 22years after the incident that happened at Jurassic Park. We saw the bad guys of Ingen return and even got a glimpse at some 1990's Jurassic park references to tie everything together, but damn this poorly picked cast. At no point to you get emotionally attached to anyone, and Chris Pratt, for the love of God why Chris Pratt! His character just seemed so forced and all I could think of was Star Lord with his cheesy one liners. I know they wanted to separate this a little from the first 3, but I would have much rather seen some old cast and crew, or at least a cast that fit the part. The only other thing that bothered me was the over use of CGI. This is Jurassic park we are talking about where they had animatronics in the 90's that looked more real than some of the special effects. Don't get me wrong the experience was great, especially in IMAX 3D, but I would have loved some old school movie magic scattered in there a little more than what they actually had. Overall I was not let down, and by the end of the movie I was fully captivated, and clapping with everyone as the end credits rolled. A must see if you are a fan of Jurassic Park.","17 out of 42 found this helpful.

Successful indie filmmaker Colin Trevorrow (who also directed the 2012 quirky time traveling comedy flick 'SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED') directed and co- wrote the movie (Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Derek Connolly also worked on the screenplay). It stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Nick Robinson, Ty Simpkins, Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan, Omar Sy, Jake Johnson (who also co-starred in 'SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED') and BD Wong (the only returning cast member from the original film). The story is set 22 years after the original movie, on the same island, where a new Jurassic park has been successfully operating for ten years. When scientists decide to create a new breed of dinosaur, in order to boost declining sales, things once again go disastrously wrong. The film had the biggest opening weekend of all time, making over $500 million worldwide (which is an industry first). It may not be the greatest film of all time, but it is a fun movie!Jurassic World has been a successful theme park for 10 years, but sales are starting to decline. It's up to operations manager, Claire Dearing (Howard), to boost profits again. The company's owner, and CEO, Simon Masrani (Khan), has asked the genetic scientists, working for him, to create a new breed of dinosaur; to attract more tourists. The new monster they've created isn't really a dinosaur though, and it quickly figures out a way to escape it's confinements, and wreak havoc on the park (and it's guests). Claire enlists the help of an expert Velociraptor trainer, named Owen Grady (that she once dated), to help stop the 'indominus' creature.The film is full of a lot of great monster fights and violent attacks on tourists; it's got all of the thrills, and gore, that fans are looking for. Once again the human characters aren't as interesting. Bryce Dallas Howard is really good in the lead though, which is by far the most developed character, and she actually gives one of her best performances. Chris Pratt is really funny, and very likable, as the action hero lead (and I definitely agree with all the Harrison Ford comparisons). I also really like his relationship with the Velciraptors (which is my favorite part of the movie). I think any animal lover, like myself, will definitely love this film. It's not as good as Spielberg's classic original, of course, but it is the best of the sequels and a really entertaining movie!Watch our movie review show at: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=zfYb1KqmKxo","17 out of 42 found this helpful.

Having screenwriters from Rise of the Planet of the Apes' franchise, the engineering field of genetic modification works efficiently on the historic extincted animals and at the same time allows the plot to stress on the greediness of human nature, the ethical and morality behind as well as the dire consequences. Scores from Michael Giacchino mostly remain the original theme composed by John Williams, creating a sense of revisiting the old park while performance of Chris Pratt sparks with his serious characteristic throughout the entire film. The story is further well balanced with intense action sequences, fury battle between the dinosaurs and splendid visual effects although there's a few scenes of obvious CGI flaws. Overall, director Colin Trevorrow has transformed this mid- range Spielberg efforts into a satisfying adventure much better than the previous two sequels - The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III.","17 out of 42 found this helpful.

My expectations weren't high but they weren't low either. The movie opens in true JP style with an egg that's hatching. Right away I was back in that same 7 year old mindset back when I first watched Jurassic Park. Jurassic World is the park that John Hammond wished he got to see but never saw realized. It looks amazing, like Disney World but with dino's. Though I wasn't too happy to see little Triceratops being piggy back rided like pony's. The main characters are two brothers, one horny teenager, one 10 or 11 year old. They are pretty dull and boring. Especially the older one. He's so preoccupied with women he doesn't even pay attention to the damn dinosaurs! Pretty stupid! They get themselves into trouble by leaving the tourist route. All this while the Indominus Rex is rampaging through the park. Chris Pratt is called away from the Raptors he's been training to save the children and hunt down the Indominus. The story isn't all that but the visuals are amazing! The park looks great, the dino's are so awesome! Especially the raptors and the Indominus which fits the JP world well. The visuals are in great contrast with the characters. The kids have this stupid family issue that should never be in my JP movie! It's so dull and you won't give a damn about it! Chris Pratt is awesome in this flick but he isn't all that different from Starlord in GotG, which isn't a bad thing by any means. It would be a shame though if he were to be typecast as this kind of character from now on. Musically the flick disappoints a bit. The infamous JP theme is back but underused and when it's used, it isn't even for a big dino moment. But you can't help but get goosebumps because after all these years, the Jurassic Park theme just sounds amazing! However, sometimes when the music gets ominous and a big orchestral theme is playing, the volume is turned down so much you really notice it! Very weird...The Indominus Rex is scary! I never thought the first three JP's were scary because I loved dinosaurs so much I was just too excited to see them in action to be really scared! The Indominus however, is a dinosaur you've never seen before! It's big, scary and oh so smart! He's built up so well too! Every scene he's in, the suspense is real! He truly feels like this unstoppable force. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the worst part of JP3 has been redeemed here! The ending is just so epic! It's perfect! I was just buzzing in my seat and people around me were just shouting in excitement! This movie has just so much fan service with references to the original, little details you can just geek out about and perhaps the best introduction to the hero of the franchise since JP1! People were applauding during the end credits, something Avengers: Age of Ultron didn't manage to do...In conclusion: though I have many gripes with this movie, the fan service, action, visuals and Chris Pratt make this entry in the series so worth it! I saw it yesterday and I'm going to see it again tonight! Hope to see you there!","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

I wasn't, I was surprised. They introduced a new Dinosaur much better than the third film, while DBH was good I actually found Chris Pratt better in this film than GOTG. The security lead character was a tad shallow in character, not enough explained about his role and I was confused when InGen came back into the picture as i though Masrani was heading this theme park? Couldn't follow the intro of Ingen really.im sure it was in one of the books a camouflage dinosaur and think this was a great addition to the story.I hope they find a way to carry it on, although the only exit they left to open another film limited a potential future films synopsis/storyline.What I liked- CGI getting much better, clearly some things are obvious. New characters Park was visually amazing New dinosaur was great Made me think i was 11 again seeing the first film at the cinema Music was awesome and never any Dark bits you couldn't see or struggled with.What I didn't like- needs a bit more scary- but i understand was more targeted at kids needed to chain the previous films together to establish itself- while not a continuation and being a separate film to stand on its own- should have established this more? Maybe a trilogy or spent more time on story. The fact that a multi million dollar company like Masarani didn't have adequate response teams for ""assents out of containment"" was a bit of a weak point.(but it is Hollywood) repeat of the kids (nephews) being involved- kind of mirrored the first film storyline a bit and juts swapped the T rex for I-Rex???? Final Battle was epic- communication thing seemed to come from the 3rd film which established the Raptors had a keen sense of communication- i think it went a bit over the top but i did like how the splice of the I rex came into play with this so it had its good points and bad.","33 out of 92 found this helpful.

That movie is still great to watch 22-years later. Sometimes, I'll put it on when I want to have a movie night. I'm sure a lot of us who have seen the first Jurassic Park have seen it more than once. Jeff Goldblum even talks about kids who watch Jurassic Park everyday on the bonus features. So, it is definitely an entertainer for younger audiences. Also, the computers in that movie don't seem that old. I mean, yeah we have flat screen computers and we don't use floppy disks anymore. Some of the icons in the first movie look a little old, but the way the computers work seem impressive even by todays standards and probably work better than we'd think a 1992 computer would work.Since the first one came out, they have made 3 more Jurassic Park movies. Since the 3rd one came out, I have long since heard of a 4th one coming out, even on IMDb and have heard different plots and Jurassic Park 4. They finally came up with a plot for the fourth film and rather than call it Jurassic Park 4, they changed it to Jurassic World. I feel like that this movie sequel, came up with the best plot for the franchise especially one that hasn't been used. Because, If you've seen the first two Jurassic Park films, you'll know they recreated the dinosaurs for tourism. They intended to have dinosaurs on display at a park, mostly for kids. This was John Hammond's idea. As you've seen on the trailers and the website. You'll know that Jurassic World is a fully functioning park that has been opened to the public for 10 years, so at this point people still enjoy touring the park, but it is no longer such a big deal having dinosaurs around.This movie will definitely keep you entertained and on your seat at the movie theater. It also seemed like everybody I talked to in the movie theater liked this movie. Though, everybody seemed to prefer the first two over this. But, they can all agree it was better than the 3rd as I don't care for that movie. I noticed a lot of things that if they thought more of, they could have made a much better movie and here are the reasons:1. My Title: Which is what I thought, despite this coming out 22-years later, the dinosaurs seemed more realistic, sounded more realistic, and even looked and acted more realistic in the first film. The dinosaurs would have been more entertaining if they kept them like the first. 2. At times it was cheesy: The characters and dinosaurs seemed a little cheesy some of the time. 3. The Characters Don't Entertain The Same As The Original Cast: I felt like Zach and Gray held up to Lex and Tim. But, the other characters from this movie, while entertaining they do not keep up with the characters we know from the original films: Allen Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, John Hammond, Mr. Arnold, Robert Muldoon, and Dennis Nedry. You'll prefer those characters over these ones. 4. We Coud Have Gotten To Know The Park Better: It's cool thinking dinosaurs are on display at a park for tourism. I feel like they should have taken more minutes showing us more what's at Jurassic World, along with showing us more of the dinosaurs.5. Less Sneaky/Scary: I still think of the first one as scary, but I didn't really think of this one as scary, though definitely entertaining. I feel like part of the reason, is because the dinosaurs seemed less sneaky as they do a good job in showing sneaky dinosaurs in the first film which makes it more scary. They seemed to take us more to the action. 6. The Island Looking Different: I felt like in this movie, Isla Nublar looked different and seemed less realistic than it did in the first film. The size also seems inconsistent, and while the park would change, the size of the island wouldn't. So, it didn't feel like we were on the Isla Nublar we knew in the first and I like the paddocks better in the first film. 7. The Music Not Quite As Good: We hear the main theme in the movie, but I think it would have been better if they played the music from the first film, or better background music. It would have been cool if they played the song from the first where Dennis Nedry shuts down the security systems. 8. Unanswered Questions: While these Jurassic Park movies seem canon and it has references to the first one, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. The only character that's the same is Dr. Wu. I feel like it would have been better if they did more references to the park, like explaining more the history of the park. They didn't seem to mention anything from the 2nd and 3rd films. But, they definitely should have answered how they were able to get Isla Nublar running after the incidents in the first 3 films. They also talked about engineering in this movie and referred to the dinosaurs as she, but were they intended to be all female like in the first movie, or did they realize they couldn't do it? 9. More Action: I feel like there could have been more action, especially with all the tourists at the park. So while this movie is a great film, there are so many things that should have been more thought out of, which would have made this a much better film holding up to the first. For entertainment purposes, I give it an 8. But, I'm subtracting a 2 for the things I mentioned above.","26 out of 70 found this helpful.

It was the sequel to Jurassic Park that we deserved, and after all this time we finally got it with this film. This film did somehow managed to capture all of the tones that were set by the first film, the thriller aspects were there, the horror, the fun, and the comedy were all present, making it a thrilling ride the whole way through. Chris Pratt was the one mainly bringing the comedic elements that the first film had and he was such a great character. As well as Pratt, the performances across the board were all great from Ty Simpkins to Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio they were all very convincing and you could see the fear in their faces the whole time. That fear of course was of the dinosaurs, and they come out in full force and are terrifying, giving you goosebumps every time they show up, from the velociraptors to the brand new guy they were all amazing. The CGI and light touch of practical effects were incredible and really made you seem like you were looking at the real thing.In terms of the plot i was really impressed, it didn't go all dumb like in Jurassic Park 3 and was very interesting and suspenseful. It manages to keep you thoroughly entertained for the entire duration offering enough new elements to be fresh while also keeping what made the original so great. There was a subplot involving Vincent D'Onofrio's character that is constantly hinted at throughout the entire film, and for most of the film it felt very out of place. The homages to the first film made me enjoy it a lot more and gave me goosebumps whenever something is referenced. From the very familiar soundtrack to some............ other things it really made this feel like a true Jurassic Park sequel. In the end this was a fantastic film and if you loved the first one you will also love this one, it doesn't quite reach the level the first one did but it blew 2 and 3 out of the water making this the real sequel. - 8.8","35 out of 99 found this helpful.

I mean you can do what you want but at least I won't have to listen to screaming in the middle of the night when the kids wake up from a nightmare. Take care guys!","53 out of 110 found this helpful.

But what else do you need? Flying saucers and Cowboys? No. Chris Pratt made an excellent raptor trainer dude and I'm excited to see him in more of the Jurassic World series. Jurassic world brought back a nostalgia factor that I wasn't expecting and it was such a great experience.Sit back, have some popcorn and stop being so picky about movies. They're here for entertainment purposes and nothing else. If you weren't entertained by this movie then i think you should go take a chill pill. I 10/10 recommend seeing this movie if you enjoyed the previous Jurassic park movies and if you like dinosaurs in general...oh and obviously watching people get eaten by dinosaurs is also fun am I right?","16 out of 40 found this helpful.

Jurassic World is the best thing for this series since it's original opening back in 1993. The way they bring digital dinosaurs to big screen with true actors is simply amazing. Script may not be the smartest it it has depth enough. Chris Pratt is great choice to be a hero and Bryce Dallas Howard is brilliant as cold business woman. Even the child actors are no embarrassed this time. Even the story is quite similar with original Jurassic Park it is clearly sequel than reboot because it's hints to previous movies. The script may be quite light but it has few well written depths in the story that it keeps it entertaining and even touching. Final battle scene is quite effect rumble with all the dinosaur fighting, but end scene of the movie is almost too sweet. At once 3D works well at the movie and camera ride feels like wild roller coaster ride. Steven Spielberg has made a good choice to stay as a producer and Colin Trevorrow do good job as a director. Fine and entertaining summer block buster which leaves you to wait more to come. First weekend box office is so persuasive that it would be a miracle if this would be the last visit in park. I'm looking forward to see more visits to Jurassic World. It almost make me to hope it would be real theme park somewhere south pacific. Very good return to Jurassic Park.","15 out of 37 found this helpful.

No one tells the evacuating pedestrians to seek shelter until the pterodactyls arrive? People are dying left and right and the main characters are smiling and giggling...?

"9","/10","FINALLY! An extremely worthy successor to the amazing original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3257668/?ref_=tt_urv","EvilDedHed","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5264968/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2015","I went into this movie after reading the the reviews on this site (that at the time of reading this mostly seemed to be 4-6 star reviews). The movie's overall rating currently stands at a 7.8/10 which seemed a little on the low side to me. I don't tend to write movie reviews, but it seemed like this movies reviews were all from people that thought that this movie was okay, and probably half appeared to have been written weeks before the movie came out. Let me just say that this movie was an extremely pleasant surprise! I grew up being a huge fan of both of Michael Crichton's genius books, Jurassic Park, and The Lost World. The first movie stuck to the first book pretty well, and like all movies based on the book, the movie was excellent, however did not quite live up to the book. However, for a 2 hour movie, it did do a fantastic job of keeping the tone of the first book. I can not even come close to saying that about the first 2 sequels to Jurassic Park. Both sequels included several elements from the second book, (the third movie included the most subject matter of the second book) it was just a terrible (understatement) execution. I am saddened that Michael Crichton passed before having had a chance to view this movie, because it took a few of the elements from the second book, and created it's very own very different story line. It succeeded in taking some elements of Michael Crichton's genius ideas, and expanded on that creating their very own story line, and they did that WELL. It was an excellent attempt at retaining the tone of the first movie, and successfully paid homage to that movie several times. Without giving away any spoilers, I am seriously happy that they used cool elements from the Lost World book and incorporated them into the main dinosaur in this movie. The CGI was beyond awesome, the story was way better than any movie Michael Bay has ever written, the pacing was excellent, the music was great, the setting/atmosphere was extremely beautiful, and I loved the fact that the dinosaurs were in 3D! The only thing that they possibly could have done a little bit better was character development. As for the actors, I thought the stand out performances were delivered by first and foremost, Chris Pratt as he was amazing (did not expect anything less), Vincent D'Onofrio played a believable antagonist, and Bryce Dallas Howard did well with her role, and was extremely pleasing to look at also. The fact that there was even a bit of comic relief made this movie all the better, as the laughs had were not belly laughs by any stretch, but they also were not cheap or forced. I will say that there was a bit of unexpected on screen chemistry that took place between two of the actors (nothing too substantial) and it did not detract from my enjoyment of the movie. And, if this had been a 3 or 4 hour long movie with uneven pacing, I do believe that they may have been able to do better with character development, however I believe that this would have been at the expense of making a significantly less exciting movie. I will say, especially for a summer blockbuster, I thought that this was an absolutely amazing sequel. I would go and see it again if the opportunity presented itself! All in all, this movie had a little bit of something for everyone, and of course if you have a 7-12 year old child that loves dinosaurs, they will absolutely adore this movie. There is a bit if blood that is shown, and people do get eaten, but the director does a fine job of hiding the super gory stuff by placing objects in the scenes that shielded most of the gore from being shown. To sum up: Storyline/Plot: 8/10 Acting: 8/10 Special Effects: 10/10 Soundtrack: 8/10 Photography/Location: 9/10 Overall Rating: 8.6/10 Highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the original Jurassic Park movie.","15 out of 37 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Spielberg's vision brought full circle","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3262808/?ref_=tt_urv","Tyson14","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54260857/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2015","As someone like many, who holds Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece quite dearly to my heart, you can definitely say I walked into this new installment/hopeful franchise restarter with equal excitement and nervousness. There's always a need to be cautious when a series returns to the big screen for the first time in over 10 years, but at the same time I love dinosaurs so the fact that I'd get to see them again roaring on the big screen was the real excitement. So does this revisit to this franchise live up to the hype? For the most part, I think honestly yes.I'll get this out of the way: Jurassic World is flawed. Like flawed as hell, there's absolutely no denying that. There are numerous sub- plots that could've easily thrown out of the movie and leave more room for the awesome dinosaurs, character development is mostly thrown out the window, when the humor misses oh it really misses with some flat dialogue to say the least, and there are plenty of story and script issues I had throughout. But, the most important thing I can tell you is that, I had a blast and smile on my face throughout which is what I wanted from this movie more than anything really.With every script issue this movie suffers from, Collin Trevorrow makes up for it behind the camera. ""Jurassic World"" is shot beautifully with some really impressive cinematography work from John Schwartzman, and while the CGI will not go down as groundbreaking for the blockbuster genre like the 1993 film, there are some remarkable effects here. But, mostly particularly to me this movie definitely manages to capture the tone, feel and spirit of a Jurassic Park film. Yes, it doesn't come anywhere close to capturing that sense of wonder or creativity that made the first film the special treat that it is, but Trevorrow does manage to capture some of the special essence I had when beholding that special classic, while also crafting some impressive world building. There's lots of callbacks made and nostalgia felt throughout, but Trevorrow never uses this as a pointless plot point to move the story along. Most importantly though, Trevorrow definitely proves himself to be capable of handling the action scale. The dinosaur sequences are of course the primary reason why you'd go to one of these movies, and the film delivers them in exhilarating, exciting, and pulse pounding ways. There's enough solid tension throughout, and the finale 20 minutes might honestly be my favorite climax of the year. Some seriously awesome stuff that I will not give away (who actually hasn't seen this movie yet? I felt like I was the last one to).Alright, let's talk about this pretty big cast. They're all pretty solid, especially given the weak character work they're given. Chris Pratt has been a rising star as of late, and for good reasons, because he proves here he wasn't a one trick pony with Guardians. He brings such a likability, charisma, and coolness to the character of Owen Grady that makes him such an engaging lead to watch. There's not really much depth given to this character, but Pratt knows how to be charming and bad-ass so he helps makes us become attach to him as a lead. Now, I've seen some complain about Jessica Chastain.... err I mean Bryce Dallas Howard here and I don't know why. Her character did annoy me a little at first with her uptight bitch persona (which we all know Bryce has proved to play those type of women so well), and again not much depth here, but she plays the character as well as anyone could (who else would run in those high heels like that?), and I did grow an attachment to her as a character. Maybe, it's because I thought she looked so stunning in this movie, but eh whatever. Her and Pratt, I thought made a believable team, but the romance angle could've been completely thrown out. Jake Johnson is actually quite amusing as the cliché tech guy, I really enjoyed his character, I just really wish there was a lot more of him. It was nice to see BD Wong again, and though their characters occasionally got on my nerves, with the whole emo teenager, I had no issues with Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson performances themselves. To my surprise and sadness, one of weak link of the cast was Vincent D'Oonofrio as the main human antagonist. This is really no problem with D'Onofrio, he plays the role as well as anyone could, he knows how to play an asshole well, but this was not just a well written villain at all. Right when he appears on screen, you know exactly where this character is going, and his whole motivations of wanting to weaponize these dinosaurs for military purpose made literally no sense. It's a shame, with such a underrated talent like D'Onofrio coming off such a incredible villain performance in Daredevil, they really could've made this a not so clear cut antagonist with reasonable motivations, but no his character is simply a pointless prick to just be a prick.All, in all, I'd be a fool if I told you ""Jurassic World"" was perfect masterpiece to behold. It's definitely not, there's tons of issues I can write about that I've already have, but I'd also be a fool if I told you I didn't find myself having a pretty damn great time throughout its brisk running time. For everything it does wrong, it does something else so right. It's big, loud, dumb, but still insanely fun summer blockbuster that Trevorrow manages to treat with plenty of charm and heart that definitely kind of help make me feel like a kid again.","34 out of 97 found this helpful.

Not only he has placed ""more teeth"" in the most aesthetic way, he has also kept the pace at an optimum level not to turn this into a chaos cinema, that has been ruling the screens for some time. You can't deny the influence of Steven Spielberg throughout, and there are references to ""Jaws"" and ""Indiana Jones"" as well, and of course to Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" post the aviary destruction sequence. There's nothing that can compare to ""Jurassic Park,"" but ""Jurassic World"" at least tries to match the heart and soul of the original. A lot of ""Jurassic World"" is just fine as there is some great dinosaur action (Velociraptors, T-Rex, Mosasaurus and Indominus Rex), and a spotlight on Bryce Dallas Howard's role as a strong feminine protagonist who spends most of the movie kicking ass without relying on men for help. Chris Pratt also does a great job of pulling the Sam Neill role, playing a bold new hero for the new direction the series takes. Jurassic World is as meticulously crafted as the strange, clean, efficient theme park that is the real central character of the movie, with a great 3D experience for the audience. And it is great to see our own Irrfan Khan performing like in such a sharp manner with all the powerful co-actors. Special mention is B.D Wong, the only actor retained from the original film. It is not easy to match up to the work of a team which consisted of Spielberg, Michael Crichton, Janusz Kaminski, Michael Kahn, Stan Winston, John Williams, David Koepp and others but the contemporary production team has done their best and Trevorrow delivers a great thrill ride.","17 out of 44 found this helpful.

After 10 years of operation and visitor rates declining, in order to fulfil a corporate mandate, a new attraction is created to re-spark visitor's interest, which backfires horribly.""Welcome to Jurassic Park"" those words disclaimed and the music will be graved into my memory forever. When I saw the first Jurassic Park I had my mind blown, it was like cinema has been reinvented decades before and coming to life right in front of me. It made generations want to be directors, actors, writers: story tellers. It was a breakthrough movie with the use of technology and new cgi. Jurassic World depicts (at first) everything John Hammond wanted this place to be and it's fully operational. Here, the film renews the experience and transports us where Jurassic Park took us 22 years ago; capturing only a fraction of the original film's overflowing awe and wonder though. I didn't go to this movie hoping it to be better because lets be honest: it won't, ever; but just hoping it it would be good. The 14 years-layoffs since the last one may have helped to ease the mind of antiseptics. In fact, Universal's big summer action release is sufficiently ""toothsome"" to make audiences everywhere happy for a return visit to a once-wild world that looks as safe as a Disney ride. The first wise move was to pretend that The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Jurassic Park III (2001) never existed and that the world depicted here descends directly from Spielberg's 1993 adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel. This line of reasoning takes us to the current star attraction of the park, in the form of a gigantic sea creature that zooms straight up out of its pool to swallow in one bite a big white shark: a spectacle which inclined to interpret as a ingenious admission by Steven Spielberg as to how far the world has moved on since Jaws. This film is as its core a caution about the dangers of trying to keep up by doing always bigger, better and faster. From the beginning, fuelled by Michael Crichton's big brain, Jurassic Park has always been a debate about the boundaries of science and here that explored further. It's an example of scientist's being so preoccupied with whether they could that they stopped thinking if they should. It's at once a sharp comment on our been-there-done-that generation which so quickly gets bored with the new and a genuinely menacing monster movie. The same thing could be said for our cinema industry and the global corporates that dictate the films we get every year. This movie lays out a really clever and thinly veiled critique nowadays blockbuster mentality. Jurassic world features a story about humankind's fallibility and inclination to bring destruction upon itself. Plus, there's something about director Colin Trevorrow's approach that marks him as a humanist rather than a director determined to hammer you into submission. Characters wise, Bryce Dallas Howard appears as the third generation of damsel in distress with a light touch of feminism, quite like Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). They set up a stereotype of the uptight and over controlling girl, to knock it down afterwards; while nodding to our contemporary views, as we get a heroine who can take out a dinosaur with a stun gun and also run very fast away from them in heels. It's not hard to see why Joss Whedon tweeted, that early footage of her made him think of ""70's era sexism"". It doesn't help that, rather foolishly, she spends the entire film in high heels; even sprinting in them, in one slow-mo sequence. More importantly, Chris Pratt is a sort of velociraptors whisperer, appealingly playing a watered-down Indiana Jones type of guy. With his charisma on screen he cements his reputation as movie's new leading man, giving a tremendously likable performance as Owen: easy going and relaxed, somewhere between Harrison Ford and Tom Hanks. If Guardians of the Galaxy Peter Quill was Pratt's Han Solo, then Owen is his Indiana Jones. He completely blew me away.Treverrow opted for a Spielbergian slow build as we don't see any dinosaur until roughly 20 minutes in the film. Moreover, he needed something new: enters the genetically engineered Indominus Rex. If a character noted early on in the movie that ""no one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" let me tell you that you should have seen my face as I enjoyed every bit of them on screen. The problem is not that much that dinosaurs have ceased to impress but that dinosaurs and few good characters alone are not enough to sustain us in a sophisticated blockbuster culture that has the emotional landscape of Inside Out, the fugitive craziness of Fury Road and the all too human ape leader Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Those movies are as bold in their storytelling and as rich in their emotional stakes as they are in their visual aspects. There are lots of characters and lots of subplots that doesn't really belong in the film which create storytelling flaws, where the story goes back to less important characters such as the two brothers and their family problems, then you're like ""Can we focus on our core here?!"" Besides the self aware old fashion thrill and heroism, the romance when it flares is swift, unexpected and makes the heart leap. Furthermore the dinosaurs themselves have rarely looked better than they do under the direction of VFX supervisor Tim Alexander and it's what makes Jurassic World such a breathless summer entertainment.Check out the rest of the review here > http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/2015/06/jurassic-world.html","16 out of 41 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, the newly created dinosaur has an agenda of it's own and breaks out of captivity in order to prove once again that man should not mess with nature. The movie is OK, with some decent jump moments and great set pieces, unfortunately we have seen all of this before with the first two films of the series (The first Jurassic Park and The Lost World) and those  were done much better and much scarier as well.  Not to mention the fact that the characters of those films were much more compelling and more fleshed out and had better original stories to work with. Chris Pratt tries his best with a flat headed character and brings some gravitas to the movie but he's lacks a compelling cast of characters to work with and the script is riddled with one cliché after another.   Bruce Dallas Howard is stuck with a cliché of a women's role and agree with the opinion that it's sexist and very badly written. The rest of the cast of characters are really not worth mentioning because they really did not add much to the film at all other than canon fodder for the rampaging dinosaurs at the park. The movie is a good afternoon movie to sit through and thank heavens better than the weak and disposable Jurassic Park 3 but it pales considerably against the first two Steven Spielberg directed films, The Original Jurassic Park and Spielberg's own sequel The Lost World. If there shall be another film, let's hope it at least finds some Interesting characters and a better premise that at least tries to be original and not a pale remake of what came before.","46 out of 95 found this helpful.

When I watched Jurassic Park I was amazed seeing for the first time dinosaurs in the screen. The way some scenes of it were built to show the radiance of the characters with dinosaurs was perfect. I'm saying this, because in Jurassic World has these kind of scenes, but are not in a similar way. I wasn't with my teeth shaking and having goosebumps as I wanted to be.Please don't think I hated the movie, on the contrary I liked the movie, I had fun watching it, some scenes were awesome, in some I felt like I was in Jurassic Park. It is always cool to see dinosaurs in a well-made movie. About the dinosaurs specifically, the CGI and animatronics used to create them were very good, even if in some moments you can notice the use of special effects. One thing which you can definitely expect to have is some nostalgia if you watched the first movie. It's great to notice maybe just small details but which are related to the first film while watching Jurassic WorldThe characters were played very well, the performances gave the audience interesting characters, some that you hope are not eaten by the dinosaurs, some not. Chris Pratt was great and his relationship with the velociraptors, despite the fear of not working, imaging how can a person has a bond with these kind of creatures, but how it was developed during history, made this fear not happen.","21 out of 57 found this helpful.

To keep the public interest and raise the visitor rates, the corporation engineer a new breed of dinosaur, Indominus Rex (I-Rex). Meddling with genetic research once again puts the park and people in danger when the I-Rex breaks loose. Jurassic World while not living up to the Spielberg's classic, stands strong on its own merits. The new I-Rex is a great new addition to the roster of scary dinosaurs and the CGI is very well done. There are some sub- plots that don't fit well, but the overall story is a thrill ride with both horror and action. Jurassic World is a great summer- blockbuster monster fun.Full Review:While I was looking forward to Jurassic World, the trailers left me only cautiously optimistic. I had quite a few doubts about the movie: genetic splicing of different dinosaur species, trained raptors, over-reliance on CGI. It all seemed too different from Jurassic Park. After watching the movie all my apprehensions were thrown out the window because different is exactly what Jurassic World needed.Let's start with the star/villain of the movie, I-Rex. The perfect word to describe her is terrifying. The sheer size of her in every aspect, jaw, feet, claws, if you saw her running towards you, to quote the movie ""The kids? This will give their parents nightmares."" Which is perfect! Because that's an essential part of what Jurassic Park was, a horror. It's not just the physicality of the dinosaur but the way she moves, thinks, and takes advantage of her spliced nature that added a lot to her being an insurmountable threat. A lot of the dinosaurs were CGI even for close-ups but it never pulled me out of the movie. The computer visual effects were very well polished, and I am saying that as a huge fan of practical effects where possible. In fact, the dinosaur designs were so well done I'd say they had more personality than most human characters in other movies.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were also very good in the movie. As much I loved Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy as Star- Lord, I didn't want him to play the same character again. Luckily he doesn't and still is a badass. He showed that with the way he interacted with the raptors and the way he'd improvise to get out of a difficult situation. I'd like to reassure you that the way the raptors are trained makes complete sense in the context of the movie. They are still dangerous animals, not completely tamed, so their scenes with Pratt hold a lot of tension. Pratt and the rest of the cast including the kids Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are not completely humourless. There are some good jokes here and there that keep the movie from becoming completely dreary.There are few small issues I do have with the movie but the subplots in particular is what bothered me the most. This is the second time in two weeks there is a movie with a divorce subplot. But the way it is handled in Jurassic World is even worse because it never really affects the story or the characters significantly. There are also other story arcs that are not executed well and so feel out of place. I can't say much else without spoiling the movie but if these subplots were trimmed off, Jurassic World may have been a more well- rounded film.I have to say I really enjoyed my time with Jurassic World. Like for many others Jurassic Park means a lot to me, it's the first Hollywood movie I remember from my childhood. Director Colin Trevorrow did an excellent job in honouring the classic while introducing us to something new. When you watch the movie, you can tell this was a movie made by a fan (a very talented one too) for the fans. By the end of the movie I was applauding it. So if you have your doubts like I did, go watch it, because I'm sure it'll surprise you.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

They tried and they tried and they tried and they ended up flat on their face. On second thought... I'm not actually sure how much they tried. This looked like a money-sucking film that lacks story depth and originality. I felt zero emotion towards the characters because of how shallow they were created. Even when something funny happened, it was forced and not funny... at all. Sometimes I would see a bad movie twice, not in this case.

Jurassic World is a total new movie and not to be compared with the Jurassic Park trilogy. All in all it was a nice movie and not so predictable as some people claim. Knowing the Jurassic Park trilogy you might have guessed but since its a new movie it can't be connected to the trilogy. In an interview it is being said that they created this in the first place for the new generation but involved props of the old trilogy to let us remember specific moments. Like the car, the night vision devise etc.In fairness there were some scenes where the animation wasn't as good as one might expect it, but still, the storyline was nice. And added to that, the music is really enchanting. The music must be a tribute to the old trilogy as well. If you watched it the ""regular"" version you might not be totally caught in the storyline, but watching in 3D, IMAX version it could give you jump-up moments you might not have. And the subliminal message is also nice. For people who just watch the characters jump and run without considering the all-in-all it might be a fail.","16 out of 42 found this helpful.

I just thought it needed to stop, but I as read more information about it and the more I began to show some interest. I've read that the filmmakers wanted this film to honor on what made the first one really good, and it just felt like a good sign there. So I stay away as much of any new footage being shown on the internet like trailers; TV spots; etc. I just want to be as surprise as I can be. Was I surprise? Heck yeah! I really love this movie. Before I can go any further, this review will not contain spoilers because you have to see it for yourself. I thought ""Jurassic World"" really did capture the spirit as what the first one did. Is it better than the sequels? Well, as much as I like the second one, I do say that yes it is better than the sequels and it is the second best film of the series. Yes, second best because I don't think its quite as good as the first one, but it is as close as you are going to get. I thought Colin Trevorrow has done a fantastic job on making this movie, and making us feel like kids again. The story is very well told, and I do love the look of the theme park as it makes you want to go there and have lots of fun. As long as you don't get eaten by dinosaurs. The cast all did great. Chris Pratt does an awesome job for playing such likable lead, and I thought Bryce Dallas Howard did good as well. The movie is, thankfully, a two hour ride as what the first two movies were because I wasn't a fan of the run time on the third one. The movie does have its wondrous moments and it has a lot more excitements, and really filled with dinosaur action. The music by Michael Giacchino is pretty darn good, and he was the right choice to do score for reminded us of John Williams' music like what he did with his other film ""Super 8."" The design of the new dinosaur looks really good, but nothing more I can say about it. I do find it interesting where the Raptors are working with Pratt's character. The ending I won't give away is beautiful, because I was laughing happily and tears were pouring down from my eyes as I was now crying that it just shows how much I love the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie. So what is wrong with the movie? While I do say the special effects are really good, and I am glad that they are sticking with the tradition for using practical and CGI effects. However, I do wish if the filmmakers can use a bit more on practical effects. Also, there are some characters that I like while they are others that kind of annoyed me. Vincent D'Onofrio may have done a fine job, but he is just there to play a bad guy. That is about it. So, yeah the movie does have its flaws, but it doesn't take away the experience that I had with this movie. I am glad Steven Spielberg gave it a stamp approval because he thought it felt like seeing ""Jurassic Park"" again. I pretty much cannot denied it. ""Jurassic World"" is a must see, and I am giving it a 9 out of 10.","16 out of 42 found this helpful.

Has all been forgiven and forgiven, or will Universal's biggest franchise crumble? Thankfully the first route's taken, with a movie that's bold, clever and fresh. Jurassic World pays tribute to the original, sending waves of sentimentality and nostalgia down our spines. It also manages to be widely entertaining, accommodating new concepts that will satisfy fans old and new. Jurassic World smashes our way of thinking into the dust. A theme park is (actually) open. Park goers have declined in the last 10 years (believe it or not) and velociraptors are being trained to obey by an ex-navy marine. There are two main protagonists; one crunches numbers, relying on excellent statistics to keep the park up and running (Dallas Bryce Howard), the other believes in the natural order of things (Chris Pratt). Both portray contradictory feelings towards the park's new creation, the Indominus-Rex. Howard believes genetic mutation is the step forward to success, whilst Pratt sees this creature as an undefined project. A political stance is at the foreground of this movie, as well as a dino-disaster, a subtle romance, an all-out actioner and a rescue mission to boot. All sub-plots file in nicely with the bigger picture, and flow in nicely with what else is in store for the franchise. This is a big blockbuster movie. Expect even bigger things to come.","13 out of 33 found this helpful.

October 28th, 65,000,000 years B.C. (approx.) – dinosaurs become extinct, probably because of a massive comet or meteor striking the earth. 1990 A.D. – publishing company Alfred A. Knopf releases Michael Crichton's book ""Jurassic Park"", probably because of a desire to make money. 1993 – filmmaker Steven Spielberg directed, and motion picture studio Universal Pictures, released a film based on Crichton's book, probably for the same reason that Crichton's book was published. In the film, a venture capitalist named John Hammond is preparing to open an island theme park populated by creatures created from extinct dinosaur DNA. The project is abandoned when Hammond and his guests discover that the dinosaurs are too dangerous and unpredictable to be a theme park attraction. 1997 – all the key players behind the original ""Jurassic Park"" phenomenon are responsible for another book and film sequel called ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" in which it is discovered that there is a second island where surviving dinosaurs roam free. Results are similar to the original – dinosaurs eat people and lots of moviegoers pay money to see dinosaurs eat people. 2001 – A third film takes audiences back to the island from the second film. This film is not based on a Michael Crichton book or directed by Steven Spielberg. Moviegoers spend more money, but not as much as in the past. Then, no more people are eaten by dinosaurs for the next 14 years. 2015 – a fourth film in the series is released. Michael Crichton has since died and Steven Spielberg is only involved with the film as executive producer. Also in 2015 – the Movie Fan Community Facebook page publishes a review of the film. The review begins with a very long opening paragraph and then finally gets around to discussing the movie in question.""Jurassic World"" shows us that the late John Hammond's dream has become a reality. Built on the island of the original Jurassic Park, this new park is a combination of Disneyworld, Sea World, a safari park and a Jurassic Period ""Island of Dr. Moreau"". The coolly efficient park administrator is Claire Dearing (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, looking strangely like Jessica Chastain). Claire may run the place, but like everyone, she has a boss (Irrfan Khan) who wants to make money. Like a traditional amusement park building wilder roller coasters, or maybe a film franchise trying to manufacture bigger thrills, this park needs to periodically add new attractions to keep up consumer interest. Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) and his team of scientists are more than happy to fulfill that need by coming up with larger and meaner genetically-engineered dinosaurs. Meanwhile, a shady character named Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) has more than ticket sales in mind as he intently watches the park's head trainer, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), act as a kind-of dinosaur whisperer with some velociraptors.Soon, the new ""Indominus Rex"" (part T. Rex and part other stuff the lab rats aren't at liberty to discuss), the park's latest coming attraction, breaks free and starts coming to the other side of the island where the main park is located (along with its over 20,000 guests). This ""containment breach"" is very bad for business and occupies the efforts of all the main characters, including control room technicians played amusingly by Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus. Even as the park is starting to lose employees, the attentions of some of the key players are divided. Claire is supposed to be hosting her two visiting nephews (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins), but has simply given them V.I.P. passes and left them in the care of her assistant (Katie McGrath). The boys run off on their own, just as the park's ""assets"" are starting to run amok. As much as Owen cares for the dinosaurs he's training, he also seems to care for Claire as more than a park administrator. And as dangerous as loose, hungry dinosaurs can be, Hoskins views the growing mayhem with a combination of interest and greed as he tells someone on a cell phone call, ""we may have an opportunity here."" It looks like it's going to fall to Owen to save Claire's nephews from her neglect, save the park visitors from the marauding dinosaurs and save the park's power brokers from themselves. It's not exactly guarding a galaxy, but Pratt's character still has his hands full.""Jurassic World"" is everything a fan of the previous films would likely be hoping to see, and maybe more. The dinosaurs are bigger and badder and they look great (especially in 3-D)! The movie makes good use of the ""Jurassic Park"" story from the previous films, but branches out in some new directions. Except for a few random and slightly awkward moments, the script is smart – especially when it comes to the plot. It contains several different story lines that are woven together seamlessly. There's danger around every corner, but some subtle and well-placed humor relieves some of the tension and when the dinosaurs have a snack, the audience is spared an unnecessary amount of blood and gore. Some of the acting is less than stellar, but the leads do a very good job – especially Pratt who is perfect as the hero. This movie brings the franchise nicely into the 21st century and even elicited applause from some of my fellow moviegoers.

I had to go to a later showing than I normally would because earlier times were sold out. There's a lot of great word-of-mouth. I think it deserves it! For me, it's the best since the original JP film. It is an excellent addition to the series. As things have evolved in the movie world, CGI makes just about anything that can be dreamt of visually possible. The only barrier left is the imagination of the filmmakers. So there's not much of anything new that can be added (I also saw it in 3-D. What's left to improve the movie going experience are the human creations: acting, story, sets, costumes, etc. I like what they did here. I especially liked the acting. Chris Pratt is the best actor yet to appear in these films - completely believable as an action star. He'd be a terrific Indiana Jones (as has been rumored) or even Han Solo; not to mention any number of new movie heroes yet invented. I like everything about him. I'd even go so far as to say he made the film.His co-star; Bryce Dallas Howard, was excellent opposite him. Although there was little chance to show it in this type of film, they had great chemistry. I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it for anyone; but the physical side of their relationship would have made a great film on its own (and considerably easier to make!). I loved her look in the film; almost China-doll-like at the beginning, although more of her natural freckles would have been wonderful. She is a stunning beauty and a great actress in the bargain. The rest of the cast did a standout job as well. Vincent D'Onofrio made a great guy to dislike. I also liked Jake Johnson, Irrfan Khan, BD Wong (the only cast member from the original Jurassic Park I think) and Judy Greer. Bravo to all!Onthe final analysis, very worth seeing.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Imagine a hero who goes to fight a fearsome rogue dinosaur much worse than a T-Rex with a shotgun. Imagine kids who were almost killed several times by raptors and the same huge dinosaur but who not only don't get scared but give each other high fives and ""wait till I tell mom"". Imagine when in the heat of the tragedy that dinos are killing people and are all set loose the main actors decide to give each other a kiss. Imagine a woman who calls a T-rex and runs slowly (again in high heels)from a T-rex that seems to now have emotions. Let me mention she then hangs around just watching as two dinos fight. Literally below them.....No don;t assume these above mentioned scenes will get your heart pumping....actually almost NO excitement at all.....cliché actually...

I honestly thought that Jurassic World was the best movie of 2015 so far. Even better than Avengers: Age of Ultron! I think most people are getting too caught up in comparing this movie to the original Jurassic Park. It is not Jurassic Park and that is not a slice on the film but credit that they actually went to something different and it worked. Jurassic World is almost more of a reboot than a sequel. There is much more action and the pace is much faster than the original. Even though I would still say that Jurassic Park had a better story and characters than Jurassic World by a little, Jurassic World was far and away better with action. But I do know story is the most important part of a film so in the end I am rating this movie a 9 out of 10. The same rating I have for Jurassic Park. And to compare with the middle 2 films, The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3, I rated these a 7 and a 6 out of 10 respectfully. I thought Jurassic World was a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend watching it if your a dinosaur lover or just a movie fan in general.","15 out of 40 found this helpful.

This is definitely the only movie that belongs in the series with the original. With how disappointing both 2 and 3 were, I was worried going into this one but there was really nothing to complain about. Not once did I have the thought, ""why would you do that?"" That happens so often in the other two sequels and slightly in the original. The action sequences are fantastic and very clear. The acting is done well and so is the directing. My really only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. A little was cut out of the middle. But if the only complaint about a movie is that a little over 2 hours isn't long enough then you probably have a darn good movie. I also don't watch very movies in 3 but did with this and it was definitely worth it. It's a very pretty movie.

That situation is a sad imitation of the car scene in Jurassic Park. It basically fails to entertain much, then there is no action for the majority of the run time of the movie. There are a few scenes where the silhouette of the ridiculous dinosaur kills people, but they are so insignificant you might forget they were there. The plot is such a mess you may also forget it was there. Something about ingen wanting to use raptors in the army...really. The last action scenes is literally a every dinosaur you would care to see fighting one another and then it ends in a way that had me laughing for several minutes. The CGI in the movie also seems to be worse than the first movie, and the actors SUCK.

The attention to detail is much cooler than Jurassic Park admittedly, however, the charm of Jurassic Park is that we get so immersed in the story line that we forget the slightly poorer animations. The movie was epic and managed to play on several ideas like taming the raptors and using dinosaurs as part of the military. The higher tech also widens the imagination on the possibilities of the future.Now here comes the bad part. There was lesser enthusiasm felt and the people less fear-stricken. Was it just me or were the dinosaurs smaller than in Jurassic Park? For the sake of young or old audiences, perhaps the sound was toned down. However, the deafening roar of the t-rex was what made the movie seem so much more realistic.Some after movie thought, it is likely that the t-rex, Mosasaurus, and raptors might go extinct as there were only one of each left behind after the end of the show. Hopefully they do not create a sequel like Jurassic Park did.This movie is definitely better in cinemas so I highly recommend people to view it in Imax 3d. The 3d wasn't much but the imax sounds was fantastic!","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

Same format, same formula, no real new ideas. Can't blame the writers for this. What else could be done with the story? One other issue I have with the film is that it doesn't really build up as much tension as the previous.

It was almost like a parody of the original, but without any of the charm or intelligence.

But so many are detracting due to the ability of the raptor / human relationship let's examine that a little further. It is unfair to say that raptors are dumb or smart, how do we truly know. All Jurassic film's have all capitalized on the notion that they can coordinate their attacks, like pack animals, life wolves. Raptors lean more towards being Edison in the films; they ain't exactly Dan Quayle. Back to reality, raptors would have acted mainly through ""instinct"". Whether or not in reality if raptors could be perceptive of their environment, I don't think science or paleontology will ever know. To parlay into today's world, not Jurassic World, a lot of snakekeepers say when they go to their rattlesnakes, the snakes act calm and normal. But when other people try to approach them, they rattle vigorously and take defensive poses. Although it's nice to think that snakes have emotions (like joy, anger, and affection), scientific studies show that snakes just don't have the cerebral capacity for them. However, snakes do have ""primitive"" feelings like aggression, fear, and pleasure. Snakes are able to learn simple things such as tolerating handling, eating an unnatural food item, and of course, adapting to captivity. But to teach a snake to learn things like to ""fetch"" (like a dog can), or ""sit-stay"" is not relevant to snakes. So the jump in disbelief is when just that proffered with raptors in Jurassic World. Get beyond that and the movie is a rip roaring affair. Lining up the 4 Jurassic film this one stands heads above the others as far as wow factor from a pure dinosaur perspective. Not to discount the first three films. This one had humor, solid acting and a Mosasaur. That Mosasaur almost steals the show and plays a few key scenes in the film and is satisfying in a sort of mixed feeling way. Same mixed feeling for the raptors and T-Rex. Do you root for Godzilla when a common foe appears? Enjoy the film for what it brings, unapologizing freaky experience with the largest creatures known to have walked this planet. You could say, could happen, could happen, could happen, probably couldn't happen, could happen and walk away laughing at some poignant human interaction that makes fun of clichés and a rousing, blood pumping reptilian romp through Isla Nublar, this scary and wondrous tropical island isolated somewhere in a Central American locale.","13 out of 35 found this helpful.

We return to Isla Nublar, home to the new and improved Jurassic World. I admit that the first act of the film kind of had me board, as it was mostly people talking. Despite my boredom, it does serve the purpose of introducing us to new characters. One of these new characters is the ""Raptor Whisperer"" Owen Grady (played by the ever-so-awesome Chris Pratt). We are also introduced to a new dinosaur, the Indigenous Rex, a genetic hybrid who hunts purely for sport. I do not want to give too much away, but I will say that despite some subpar CGI on the dinos, the action scenes are thrilling, and the final battle alone is worth the price of admission. While I do not believe that ""Jurassic World"" is nearly as good as the original film, it is a tad better that ""The Lost World"" and ""Jurassic Park 3"". Like many, I was disappointed by the lack of familiar characters (i.e. Grant, Malcolm, Satler) but the new characters are welcome additions to the franchise, and if a sequel does happen, it would be pretty cool to see Owen team up with the likes of Grant and Malcolm.

The first one stayed with me dearly ever since I first saw it as a child and the two first sequels, although inferior, still brought some terrific fun moments and that delectable hint of nostalgia. The biggest issue with this new instalment comes from the fact it overdoes everything (especially the nostalgia factor) and ends up lacking the heart, the excitement and wonder of the original despite throwing everything ten times bigger at our faces.Jurassic World has its clever moments (the pigeon on the opening scene comes to mind and the great ""The Bird"" reference as the pterodactyls tear everything and everyone apart) and good sentimental sequences (the kid seeing the park for the first time even brought tears to my eyes - as did the dying apatosaurus), however the overall feeling of the whole experience is too shiny, glossy and, well, fake. What specially shocked me was how inferior the special effects were when compared to Jurassic Park, almost 25 years ago. The thing is: Spielberg did use a lot of special effects, but they served as tools to tell a story, to create an atmosphere, they were wisely and carefully placed, that's not the case here.The director, Colin Trevorrow, is no Spielberg when it comes to building tension either (the action happens in grand scale but it doesn't evolve or really thrill) and the climax is overdone and cheap looking, it reminded me of a video game. The lack of animatronics was felt, the dinosaurs didn't feel palpable like they did in the previous films (something about their design and movement was off too). The third act felt specially silly (and almost disrespectful to the franchise) as it turned the animals into human-like characters and somewhat heroes to the point one of them almost talks.In Jurassic Park we felt the dinosaurs were real animals. Even if the whole idea was absurd, Spielberg never made the audience feel that, he did the opposite and made everything as intense and wonderful as possible without stepping into the ridiculous. Jurassic World doesn't have any worries in that sense, it carries its predictableness and abrasiveness in full force and it starts becoming a bit tedious after a while. Despite having a good premise, everything about it feels artificial - the scenarios, the dinosaurs, the dialogue, the situations...and that creates a distance between the audience and the film, while in the first one you could almost feel the T-Rex breath.The main characters in Jurassic World (even though played by usually likable actors) were cartoonish in a way you didn't care for them (and a rehash of every other JP series character). The relationship established between them was so obviously contrived you can't help but dismiss it. Remember when Tim and Lex, in the first film, have finally a break from being chased and start eating jello and just look at each other smiling (before the scary raptors appear)? Well, that scene alone says much more about their feelings and relationship than I got from all the corny dialogue in Jurassic World. Spielberg knew the power of subtlety, both in the grand action scenes as in the smaller human parts. Remember the raptors in the kitchen or the T-Rex first appearance? These scenes are examples of a craft being mastered, they made me happy and terrified in equal measures, you just wanted to watch them again and again. The much hated Jurassic Park 3 actually felt more faithful to the original's atmosphere than Jurassic World despite the nonstop references.The bottom line is: Jurassic World just didn't feel part of the franchise to me (even if it revers it to the point of exhaustion), it felt weird (as if it wasn't its own film) and sometimes too silly, cheesy and absurd in all of its CGI extravaganza, all things Spielberg skillfully avoided in the first film.","37 out of 77 found this helpful.

One movie that brought a lot of attention was the Jurassic World. 14 year after the Jurassic Park III, we got something worth of remembering.First of all, I would like to point out the visual effects. Back in 1993, group of people set a homework for every future movie visual effect. It was incredible to see dinosaurs walking and eating on the big screen, but they did it. And they amazed me again. One thing I was worried about was the original soundtrack, it was there. Acting was nice, Star Lord really did a great job. One thing that I liked the most was the sense of time. I loved how they managed to show a little bit of the original Jurassic Park and the time that passed since then. Henry Wu was there too. I can really feel the spirit of the original movie, but still get something new. For me, that's all that matters. I hope this is the end of the series. The end with the message that no life can be and shouldn't be controlled. 8/10 - Really great movie. Passing on the soul of the original Jurassic Park, one of the best films ever made.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Solid action movie; not so good in the ""adventure"" aspect","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3257793/?ref_=tt_urv","kulharishirish","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60940761/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2015","Hopefully this review will be useful to non-fans and those new to the franchise as well.What made the first Jurassic Park so great was mostly the sense of wonder it evoked in children and adults alike, and also the initial slow buildup of tension that led to great fast-paced action sequences in the later part. In other words, it wasn't just an action movie, but a proper ""adventure/action"" movie, with a perfect balance of both elements. I watched JP1 as a kid and can safely say that it was one of the most awe-inspiring experiences of my childhood.How does Jurassic World measure up in these areas? It does try to evoke that sense of wonder with the tried and tested scenes of huge herbivores in huge fields, shots of helicopters flying past waterfalls, etc. However, it's not effective because we've all seen it before, plus after two decades we're used to jaw-dropping graphics, so it's rare for us to be impressed by CGI-rendered scenes. It also tries to build up tension, but unfortunately, this buildup doesn't last long (I won't say more than this so as not to spoil the plot). Therefore the ""adventure"" aspect of Jurassic World is much weaker than that of JP1.As for the acting, Pratt does a reasonably good job, while the others are kind of meh. The kid actors were horrible, in my opinion. Their ""terrified"" expressions on seeing a super-predator trying to kill them were laughably bad. Their acting is the weakest aspect of the entire movie (again, in my opinion), not even close to the kid actors in Jurassic Park 1.In spite of all this, the second half of the movie is -really- good. Some of the action sequences are incredibly nice, and the ending scenes are some of the best in the entire JP franchise. Sure, these scenes may be predictable, but they're done well and I'm sure most of the audience won't mind. As far as I'm concerned, the second half made up for all the above-mentioned problems. (And the absolute last scene is really awe-inspiring!) So all in all, Jurassic World is a great action movie that IMO is comparable to The Lost World (although many people will be divided on this), but still does not hold a candle to the first Jurassic Park. Even so, I'd say both fans and non-fans alike should give this a try.==========================================================I'd also like to address some reviews panning the film because of the characters' stupidity. What did you expect? The premise of the movie was bound to involve some people doing stupid stuff involving dinosaurs, that's why there would be consequences, and that's what would lead to all the dinosaur-related action. How else do you make a movie that's story-wise a sequel to disastrous events 20 years ago? I don't even know why those reviewers went ahead and saw the movie knowing fully well that it would inevitably have these stupid characters/actions.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

The original was ten times better, Chris Pratt could learn how to act if he watched the original and took notes on how good actors like Sam Neill and Geoff Goldblum perform. Not once in the film did I feel any tension or excitement, in fact I felt like falling asleep it was that boring. Please save your money and just watch the original again if you want to watch a dinosaur movie.

The movie's screenplay is co-written by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Derek Connolly, and Trevorrow himself. Jurassic World stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Irrfan Khan, Vincent D'Onofrio, B. D. Wong, Ty Simpkins, and Nick Robinson in major roles. The fourth installment in the Jurassic Park film series, Jurassic World is a direct sequel to the Steven Spielberg directed Hollywood blockbuster Jurassic Park(1993). The film is set twenty-two years after the disturbing turn of events at Isla Nublar--an island off the coast of Costa Rica--which had forced John Hammond (played by the great English thespian and filmmaker Richard Attenborough), the founder and CEO of bioengineering company InGen, to abandon the theme park he had so painstakingly populated with ingeniously cloned dinosaurs. It's been ten years since Hammond's vision of a dinosaur theme park finally became a reality. The new park is named as Jurassic World and is owned by the Indian business magnate and dinosaur enthusiast Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) who has not only nurtured Hammond's dream but has also taken it to a whole new level.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing Masrani's team of bioengineers, led by none other than the genius scientist Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong reprises his role), have made tremendous progress in their research and are now able to genetically splice the dinosaur DNA at will with that of various other species, giving rise to a hybrid breed of dinosaurs. Masrani sees it as good business as these new varieties of dinosaurs tremendously add to the attraction of the park and keep the visitor rates from declining. So far, so good, but, for how long can one continue to bend the rules of nature? Sooner or later, we must all pay the price for our greed! It's an eventuality that Masrani and men must be well prepared for. For, according to Murphy's law, ""anything that can go wrong, will go wrong"". Things finally go out of control when Dr. Wu and team come up with a T. Rex hybrid in a bid to fulfill a corporate mandate. Voila! We are transported back to the Spielbergian world of chaos and carnage as the theme park slowly takes the form of a ticking time bomb, ready to go kablooey at any given moment. In a race against time, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a Velociraptor expert and trainer, and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the operations manager of Jurassic World must set aside their past differences and join hands to stop the impending doom that awaits them all.Indian actor Irrfan Khan as Jurassic World owner Simon Masrani Jurassic World is everything it is supposed to be and more. Needless to say, there is action, adventure, fun and frolic, and loads of creepy dinosaur mayhem. As one would expect, Jurassic World employs cutting edge CGI and VFX and the excellent 3D effects make it an experience of a kind. There's no denying that these technical factors make it quite unique in comparison to its predecessors. While the movie fails to match the cinematic brilliance of Spielberg's epic dinosaur extravaganza, Jurassic World nonetheless manages to fulfill its promise of being a perfect Hollywood summer blockbuster. Late American film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Jurassic Park: ""The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. But consider what could have been. There is a scene very early in the film where Neill and Dern, who have studied dinosaurs all of their lives, see living ones for the first time. The creatures they see are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. And that is the sense lacking in the rest of the film, which quickly turns into a standard monster movie, with screaming victims fleeing from roaring dinosaurs."" Ebert was perhaps more interested in the possibility of a constructive interaction between the humans and the dinosaurs. It's good to see Jurassic World finally take a few steps in that directionâ""as evident from the scenes wherein Chris Pratt's character tries to train the Velociraptors.Owen Grady trains the Raptors in Jurassic World Overall, Jurassic World can best be described as a visual feast for action-adventure enthusiasts. But, the movie does offer some nice and punchy one- liners. Perhaps, the best ones get delivered by Simon Masrani, the most impactful being: ""The key to a happy life is to accept that one is never in control."" Then there is one delivered by Dr. Henry Wu: ""Monster is a relative word; to a canary, a cat is a monster... so far we humans were used to being cats."" Jurassic World in addition to being a high octane summer extravaganza also serves to be a relevant critique on growing consumerism and corporate excess and mocks the human desire for profit. While the theme part is a manifestation of the human desire, the T. Rex hybrid certainly represents its worst side. The acting performances in the movie range from average to good. While Irrfan Khan makes his presence felt in the limited screen time he gets, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard add a spark to the movie with their solid performances. The rest of the cast does a decent job of supporting them. Jurassic World is a highly entertaining piece of cinema that takes us on an adventurous journey to the long forgotten Spielbergian avenues of madness and confusion, thereby allowing us to relive our childhood memories. Highly recommended! (This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

This movie counts with new species of dinosaurs and a majority of species we already know well from it's prequels. Colin Trevorrow might not have had the same attention to small details like our beloved Steven Spielberg had in the caption of all the magic there is in this amazing dinosaur park...but he did a fine job by bringing up a little of the past story in short cuts of pure nostalgic. Chris Pratt also did a great job as the main character in this movie, as a Jurassic Park fan, he knew how to pass this adventurer's aspect which reminded me a lot of what Sam Neill brought to us as Dr. Alan Grant, 22 years ago. In overall this movie deserves to be in your list of must see's before death. It contains drama, adventure, action, comedy and of course...dinosaurs, a lot of them! So what are you waiting for? Unite your family, and take them as well your friends, and take them into a magical ride over the Jurassic Park, even though it's name changed, it's still as magical as before.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

Chris Pratt has so much charisma and the guy is so likable, that he reminds me some Erroll Flynn attributes. In San Andreas, the British kids did a terrific job, so as Ty Simpkins did it in Jurassic World, you buy every emotion that he delivers, the kid is a great actor. Howard, Pratt and Simpkins performances enhance the movie. The film is very well paced and entertaining.

I followed its news since its first announcement. Thats because I grew up as a 90's boy who watch Jurassic Park as one of reference to pop culture. I watched this movie on its premiere with big hype. No doubt. The purpose of this movie is to make something bigger, louder, and more 'teeth' than its predecessors. They decide to make 'super soldier' dinosaur due to its hybrid genetics to make more money from the park. Goosebumps that I had in every scene that shown nostalgic reference from Jurassic Park is a real fairytale ride. Lot of new dinosaurs appeared, but in some scenes the CGI is not 'that' good. I would still prise the realism of Jurassic Park with its level of graphic even if it has 22 years of margin. The actors did their best for their roles. its not their fault if the depth of the characters is a bit shallow. Chris Pratt did pretty good job as raptor's alpha Owen Grady to be 'something tougher' than Sam Neill's Alan Grant or Jeff Goldblum's Malcolm. And for the red- headed- Bryce Dallas Howard, somehow the writers made something excellent for her to beautify the whole show. And for the rest of the casts, like I told you before, they made their point.But, again, some holes in the movie will make you raise your eyebrows. First, if the authority already know what's the consequences to organize one hell of a dinosaur park (they should know what the hell happened to the first park, don't they?), why wouldn't they put armed security around the dino's containments? A super- genetically hybrid- Indominus Rex is out of her cage and you're not even that 'alert'? You put this fat, slow and sleepy worker to watch her? Second, ehm, the raptor cage. How tall is it? It is reported that an adult raptor can jump approx. 12 ft. high. But that cage doesn't look like it is that high. if its true, With only one or two jumps, Owen and the rest of the crew would be a perfect lunch for the raptor boyband because they comfortably stand on the top of it. Seems with no electrical fence or something safe to be the additional security on the top of it. They are g***amn raptors, folks! You wouldn't want to mess with them. Third, again, they didn't learn the mistakes Jurassic Park made. Howard's character is shown made a phone call to her 'puberty hit' teenager nephew and couldn't make it thru due to bad signal. Why didn't they even put a single communication device on the ball- vehicle thing? a 300 dollar satellite phone on it wouldn't hurt anybody.In my opinion, this movie generally still wouldn't surpass the original Jurassic Park, but its definitely better then the second and the third one.Overall, still, as a summer movie, Jurassic World put it together. But not just a summer movie. We're talking about a movie that already started the hype 22 years ago. A nostalgic hell of a ride with bigger, louder and more 'teeth'. Indeed.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

Once the two young brothers are trapped out in the park with the killing- machine monster, the rest of the plot (actually all of the plot) is very predictable - Claire and Owen rescuing the kids from a series of perils. Nevertheless, the sheer pace of the movie largely obliterates any sense of over-familiarity.

But, we were extremely enthusiastic to watch Jurassic World, as we had admired the Theatrical Trailer released on YouTube, a year ago.Being a huge fan of Dinosaurs / Pterosaurs / Plesiosaurs and Steven Spielberg's concepts, this movie was an antibiotic for a long time sick person like me. I am absolutely sure that team at Amblin Entertainment have researched well on the future of Amusement Parks and the entertainment that it may provide to masses. This movie takes us to a new World ruled by creatures which were never a part of this planet as the base of the movie is fiction. But who cares about the facts, we come to theatres to get entertained and that's what the movie did.The story is awesomely sequenced. The casts are perfectly selected. Hats off! Animation and Graphic team. And i think this is, by far, the biggest assignment for Colin Trevorrow. Under his direction we have the biggest Dinosaur movie of all time and it is garnished with excellent amusement adventure of two kids (one teenager).Surprisingly, the Oscar man of India, Irrfan Khan had a long camera time, but it was actually worth it. I think that Colin purposely killed him, in the movie, as he was performing lead throughout.For overall satisfying our expectation, I will give it 8/10 at IMDb. I have not given the rest two marks as we believe the movie could have been lengthier.Thanking entire crew for an excellent adventure. Looking forward for more doses like this in near future.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Another great great summer blockbuster that's pure popcorn enjoyment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3281617/?ref_=tt_urv","apstylianou","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57261018/?ref_=tt_urv","21 July 2015","I finally got a chance to see Jurassic World and I feel like the last man on Earth to watch this movie. This movie had a few plot conveniences that come whenever the director decides they should be added in and the side characters were quite underdeveloped and I take down a star for that alone. Nevertheless, this movie had everything I wanted in a action summer blockbuster movie, tension, excitement, laughter and enjoyment, and I loved it.Chris Pratt stole the show, to me, he was one of my favourite performances of the year, Bryce Dallas Howard was great too. She was a fantastic female lead in a movie. We've had so many female leads in movies this year. We've had Emilia Clarke in Terminator: Genisys, Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road, Elizabeth Olsen and Scarlett Johanson in Avengers: Age of Ultron and so many more.The side characters were a great support in the film. The Indominus Rex is by far one of the most scariest antagonists ever in movie history. What makes the Indominus Rex so scary is that you can't predict it's every move and its a highly intelligent animal that breaks free of human control and decides to kill everything in sight that it sees. Seems a bit familiar with Ultron, don't you think? No strings attached to the I- Rex either, it seems.I will say, not every movie is without a flaw, and so here are some things in the movie that made me give it a bit of a thumbs down (and I don't like being a negative nazi, but I can't help but point it out at times.I thought that the side characters, I'm talking about the two boys, Gray and his older brother, Zach. I mean, they are good supporting characters but I kinda forgot about them halfway through the movie, and they were a big part of the film and it's story, but I felt like they were very underdeveloped and not once did I fear for their lives because of that. I mean, I wanted to, but I just didn't.I also felt like there were a few plot twists in the movie that were too convenient for me to be surprised by.SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW SO BE AWARELike for instance, the Indominus Rex is suddenly half-raptor.Dinos can suddenly communicate to each other.The lab is cooking up other dinosaurs that are highly intelligent.Hoskins decides to become the bad guy for no apparent reason and he too was so underdeveloped.Even these plot twists arrive without any proper development. Its like a deus ex-machina that comes out of nowhere at the last second and there's no set-up to any of it. It just comes when the director declares it should come.Still, despite all that, I loved this movie, it was a great cinema experience for me, I had a really great time with it. I'm pretty sure I was the only one in that screen that wasn't with anyone sitting next to me. I felt lonely :(Still, I would definitely recommend this film if you like dinosaurs, exhilarating action, amazing visuals, brilliant acting, Chris Pratt and his awesome raptor friends and stunning cinematography, then this will be your ticket. And for that alone, I'm giving this film a rightfully- deserved 9/10.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

First off, Jurassic world is a lot better than 2 and 3 but no way near the first one. While it has some elements of the first one, some of the parts, are very weak. For example some of the dialogue is very cheesy. The action is very done well. The acting is good and once again Chris Pratt shows he can lead a movie and do it in a funny and great way. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are two brothers but the story focuses too much on them at times, that you just don't care about and want more of the Owen(Chris Pratt) and Claire's storyline more. While Chris Pratt has lots of funny moments, Jake Johnson is the comedy relief and he's great. The story is not very original but it's just fun to watch. The CGI is good but at sometimes, you could see that they could of easily should animatronics and it could of looked a lot more real. Overall Jurassic world is a fun movie with great action, fans of the Jurassic park series won't be disappointed with this movie. It also has lots of Easter eggs to watch out for.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

'Jurassic World' starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard is everything I hoped it would be and then some. As a massive fan of the original 'Jurassic Park' directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, I was hoping that 'Jurassic World' would pay great homage to the original while still being it's own type of movie, and it did. Director Colin Trevorrow managed to make an awesome monster movie that isn't as great as the original but an awesome monster movie that is sure to be one of this summer's best offers. 'Jurassic World' is full of awesome moments, lots of violence, a surprising amount of blood spilled, loads of intense action and thrills, a terrifying monster that imposes a huge threat, and a badass dinosaur fight that we've been waiting YEARS to see. Although this film has a ton of positives, there are a few minor flaws and problems I had early on in the film that grew on me throughout. Bryce Dallas Howard's performance as Aunt Claire early on bored me to tears, she was lifeless and I felt NO attachment to her character early on, BUT things change. The first 30 minutes of this film do a great job of setting up future events but it all kind of bores me, BUT things change. During the beginning stages of 'Jurassic World' I started preparing myself for a let down, but right at that half hour mark, I was sucked in and I couldn't leave. Howard got better, the movie got better, the dialogue got better, the movie got intense and scary, and 'Jurassic World' kept me on the edge of my seat for an entire hour and a half, not a single dull moment from then on. Basically, the film starts shaky but it revs up quick and then it's all great from then on. One major complaint I keep seeing is that Pratt never feels like the lead, but does he need to? When you re-watch 'Jurassic Park' is Alan Grant really the lead? I don't think so. It's the ensemble that brought JP together and it's the ensemble in JW that reminded me that much of the original. No one needs to be a lead in this type of movie, it doesn't require one and frankly if it did have one MAJOR lead I'd have to say that the film would fall flat right on it's face. Because then you get one main focus and we only see small portions of a ginormous park. Having an ensemble allows us to see the park almost in an entirety without following the same character we've been with for the past half hour. *semi-rant over*Let's talk the Indominus Rex real quick. Terrifying, scary, badass, smart, and threatening to thousands. The I-Rex BLEW ME AWAY! Every scene that includes the I-Rex had me clenching my fists until my knuckles turned white. What has made the I-Rex standout from any other typical monster or dino, is that it is smart and it knows what it's doing and how it's going to do it. The elements included in the I-Rex and how it came to be was genius storytelling and it makes sense. The thing is a beast, and a worthy ""villain"". I kind of wish the reveal of the dino would've been on the T-Rex level from JP, but that's a nitpick, the first sequence with the I- Rex was VERY well done. In conclusion, 'Jurassic World' is everything that I was hoping it would be and then some. The movie is exciting, badass, action packed, hilarious, fun, blood spattering, dinosaur roaring, tension filled, and a damn good time at the movies this summer. If you're expecting this movie to be better than the original, please don't, it'll ruin your experience. If you're expecting this move to be Oscar-worthy, please don't, it'll ruin your experience. Have fun with it, enjoy dinosaurs, enjoy the tension, and enjoy the visit to the park that was once envisioned by Dr. Hammond.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

There's a reason why it is about to devour movie records.Jurassic Park will always be Jurassic Park but hey lighten up this is better than the sequels, right?

The pattern persisted through two more movies, and now it persists through another. This time, in the fourth film of the series, the park is finally open. Tourists flock to Isla Nublar to see living, breathing dinosaurs on exhibit. Something's bound to go wrong...True to the formula of the series, the film starts off slow, establishing a few key characters (including kids for the narrative to anchor onto, again) before things start to go wrong. From the halfway point onwards, the film unleashes all kinds of hell when the dinosaurs inevitably break free and start wreaking havoc across the park. There are plenty of spectacular scenes in which dinosaurs stomp their way through entire crowds of hapless humans. It eventually builds up to a huge showdown between the classic dinosaurs we all know and love, and the menacing Indominous Rex.Other things that make the film interesting will be its revamped setting - a fully working amusement park - and a few cool ideas, including the possibility of using Velociraptors in combat. You know what you're getting with the plot; it follows in the same pattern as the first film, complete with the recurring theme of chaos theory and humanity's inability to control nature. It reaches a pretty bizarre climax where the films seems to emphasize the dinosaurs in a heroic light, and it becomes a bit cheesy. What makes the film lovable will be its characters, who aren't terribly deep, but are often colorful and charming most of the time. Some of them make some pretty dumb moves, but for this series, it's to be expected. There are a couple of kids in the mix, to give us the familiar family-esque dynamic. Watching the leads comes together proves to be charming and enjoyable, thanks to their personalities.This film is made with good photography and editing. The cast is a pretty colorful bunch: I enjoyed watching Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and the kid characters. Other players are not bad. Writing is pretty lightweight, but it gets the job done. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects offer plenty of incredible sequences, and are fun to watch. The music score brings back some of the classic themes, and is pretty good.Of the Jurassic Park movies, I value Jurassic World for finally pushing the series into interesting new territory, rather than rehashing territory already explored in the other two sequels. It doesn't quite surpass the first film by any measure, but I find its characters and action more likable than the other sequels, and the film is worthwhile for any series fan.4/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)","10 out of 26 found this helpful.

But the worst part of Jurassic World is the painfully bad and cliché acting. You will like this movie if enjoy wooden performances, kids struggling to cry about their parent's divorce, and forced Summer Blockbuster love interests. You will also like this movie if you enjoy watching whiny kids roll around in a glass ball complaining about their parents' divorce. At a time when Max Max: Fury Road is showing us what is still possible for Action movies, Jurassic World is truly a trip back in time, giving us a glimpse of the worst aspects of Hollywood Blockbusters. Skip it.","39 out of 84 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Jurassic World is probably the best sequel were going to get from Jurassic Park. Nothing could have topped the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3256411/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2015","The nineties was a big era for anything prehistoric related. Encino Man, Super Mario Bros., Dino City, Theodore Rex, We're Back: a Dinosaur Story, and even The Dinosaurs TV series all have marked that anything dino related was the trend, and they all have one movie to thank; Jurassic Park. If you ask over a thousand people to name the best dinosaur movie is, I promise that they will all say Jurassic Park. Michael Crichton penned the original novel that brilliantly conveyed the subtext on what happens when science tries to tinker into nature and gave the cinematic feeling of reading about people trying to survive a real life dinosaur.In 1993, Steven Spielberg released the movie adaptation. Not only was the film a blockbuster; it became a landmark. It become the highest grossing box office movie for a while and recaptured the majesty of dinosaurs. The story was fun, the characters were likable, and computer technology was finally showing off with what it could do. Nobody had seen movie creatures to this extent. From that point on, every blockbuster would see what new fields computer effects can accomplish and use them as much as possible. Over twenty years later, we can finally go back to the park in Jurassic World.Sometime after the events of the first movie, the InGen corporation went back to the ruins on the island of Isa Bublar and built a fully realized theme park that John Hammond would have been proud about, Jurassic World. The movie opens with a pair of brothers, the younger dino-obsessed Gray, and his older smart phone-obsessed Zach, who are going on a free trip to Jurassic World as their aunt Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is the parks operations manager. The boys arrive and seem to have fun with the high tech exhibits and creatures, even though Claire seems to have too much work to spend time with them.Her focus is on the parks first genetically modified creature, the Indominus Rex, which is like a T-rex, only bigger and more intelligent. She calls upon dino-expert Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt) to look into the creature's enclosure to make sure it can't get out. As a Jurassic Park movie does, it gets out. Owen and Claire mix trying to find the dinosaur and trying to get the park evacuated while the boys try to survive in a land 65 million years in the making. I went into the theater figuring that no matter what this movie did, it would never be able to top Jurassic Park. Jurassic World is certainly not as good, but it is also the best sequel we're probably going to get with this franchise. The other sequels tried to steer the dinos into another direction that didn't seem to go anywhere, so it made sense to go back to where it all started. The result is that Jurassic World may have a different look, it's story is a lot like the first movie; it has children in danger, a dino-expert clashing heads with business suits that would rather exploit it and plenty of dinosaur action. The focus is still on the characters, and the film takes plenty of time to establish them. Owen and Claire are a pair that I would love to see get into other situations and the boys manage to use their smarts to out wit the creatures. Speaking of which, CGI technology allows the creatures to look better, though I wish they still would have mixed it in with a few animatronics. It certainly doesn't get in the way too much as the animals are appealing to look at and the fights are good old fashioned blockbuster fun.I'll give this eight velociraptors out of ten. On it's own, Jurassic World makes for a good blockbuster. It's no Jurassic Park, but it would have never had a chance. It took what it had and made it good. And that seems to be enough to satisfy me. It should hopefully satisfy those that have been waiting a while for that one sequel. As long as you know the original can't be topped, then buy your ticket and go back to the park.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

I can understand why it blew so many minds back in the day since it was one of the first movies to feature photo-realistic CGI. But since I didn't see that film until a bit later in my childhood and after already seeing a bunch of other films with modern CGI, I never got that since of awe so many other people got when they saw that film back in the early 90's. After Jurassic Park came two sequels which were both given a lot more mixed reception when compared to the original. Now comes a fourth film, Jurassic World, which aims to reboot the series but still acknowledge the first three film's existence. Was Jurassic World a worthy revival to series, or does it also have that ""been there, done that"" feeling that the second and third film had? Here's my thoughts on the new film.First off, I'm happy to say that this film does do a great job of giving us impressive dinosaur action, especially in the second half of this film. As you've seen from the trailers, There is this new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex and it is definitely a fierce dinosaur that you wouldn't want to mess around with. This dinosaur is strong, smart and even a bit scary at times, I was impressed. Even though this film is trying to keep its distance from the original JP, there is also plenty of nods to the original sprinkled throughout the film so keep your eyes pealed when you go see this film. As for the human characters, I really liked Chris Pratt's character, Owen Grady. He may have had a few cheesy one-liners but I still thought he had a good role in the film. I liked that he had his own ""army"" of Raptors by his side. Also, I got to commend Michael Giacchino for his score in the film. It was great to not only hear the iconic Jurassic Park theme make a return, but there was also a new short theme he composed that I'll admit sent some chills down my spine because it was that epic.Now this film still has a few problems, however. For while I did like Chris Pratt's character I found most of the other characters to be not so great. Like the two kids in this film are really not that interesting, the filmmakers try to add some family issue elements to the film and they were not at all necessary! There was also Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, who was luckily more interesting in the second half of this film, but was a bit underwhelming during the first half. Overall, the first act is not quite as entertaining as the second half.Overall, Jurassic World is an entertaining film with good dinosaur action but a bit of an underwhelming beginning to it. If you like dinosaur action and Chris Pratt, then you will probably enjoy this film. It still doesn't quite capture that amazing feeling the original had, but it's definitely better than JP2 and JP3. Just be warned that this film may not be for every Jurassic Park fan out there.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

I remember being moved by the original. I was left with a sense of wonder, and left the theater checking over my shoulder for dinosaurs. All the things that made Jurassic Park great are missing from this. What we are left with is a rehashed plot, awful writing, poor acting, and bad CGI (how is it possible this movie looks worse than the 20 year old original?) Summer popcorn movies may not be meant to be Oscar-worthy, but we should expect more of them than this. While I understand, I am genuinely depressed that this movie is making the money it is. I wanted to see Jurassic Park reopened bigger and better. In the end, I find myself thinking how right Jeff Goldblum's character was in the original. The filmmakers got so caught up in whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think whether or not they should. I hope that someone reads this and saves themselves $15 and two hours of endless product placement.","26 out of 53 found this helpful.

The 3D looked good (even better if I could focus) and the film was also good but more of a monster feature than a true ""jurassic park"" sequel. Like the character of Ian Malcom said in ""the lost world"";You're making all new mistakesI think that this sums up the movie somewhat as it is more or less the same ""tried and tested"" story of the prequels but don't be fooled into thinking that it is a bad movie...quite the opposite actually. It is a good watch and the excellent CGI effects do not distract from the movie. There are no return appearances of the original cast members (with the exception of BD Wong who appears for brief moments) which is a shame as I was expecting surprise appearances. Although this is a very predictable film it is a great deal better than the third film in the series. All in all as a standard creature feature this movie works really well but as a ""jurassic"" sequel...not so good. It will however give you your money's worth if you are looking for dinosaurs, collateral damage and the occasional person being killed for good measure. If you enjoyed the previous films in the trilogy then this is a no brainer for you but my advise is that go see it as a creature feature and you might enjoy it that much more.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

It was probably in some parts due to my lack of high hopes from this one, but nonetheless, it was worth my time. Its very far from being great movie, but something that brought out that memory of the first Jurassic movie 22 years ago. Add to that the fact that the makers tipped their hat to the first movie in so many ways, the theme, the climax sequel, etc. The movie has a predictable storyline, but its intended to be enjoyed for its 3D effects and the whole saving mankind (on the island) plot. The actors have done a satisfactory job. Chris Pratt is making a lot of waves on big studio movies and I enjoyed him once again after Guardians of the Galaxy.

In almost every scene, director Colin Trevorrow's sincere attempt at visualizing things in Spielberg's manner is conspicuous. With a massive budget compared to his debut Indie film, Trevorrow pushes the benchmark of special effects to give us more realistic thrills and creatures that are quite terrifying. John Hammond's dream of creating a theme park has been fulfilled without incident for 10 years now but corporate greed and people's desire for extreme entertainment leads to yet another disaster on Isla Nublar. As inhuman as it may sound, the fictional threat to human lives has seldom been so entertaining. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the Manager at Jurassic World where customer sentiment analysis, feedback scores and revenue growth demand more of her attention than her 2 nephews who are visiting the park for a week. Zach (Nick Robinson) attempts to flirt by just staring at girls while his younger, nerdier brother Gray (Ty Simpkins) is obsessed with the park and its creatures. For Claire however, the problem with the park now, is its need to evolve. Existing Dinosaurs aren't impressive anymore according to her research reports and the visitors seek more thrills with bigger, louder and scarier creatures bearing more teeth. Thus, within the confines of a solid walled enclosure, wanders a creature in solitude with the DNA of a T-Rex, Cuttlefish, tree fog and another secret animal. This hybrid monster is the highly evolved, intelligent and aggressive Indominus Rex. Claire calls upon Owen (Chris Pratt), who has been busy training Velociraptors to follow his orders, to evaluate the safety of the I-Rex enclosure before they open it as an attraction. Before they could even realize it, Indominus has displayed his superior intelligence and is now posing a threat to the park's other creatures and about 20,000 visitors. Owen and his bad-ass heroics will have to rescue Claire's nephews from their adventurous ride in the impressive gyroscope that went awry and then attempt to track Indominus before things get worse. The aerial attack by pteranodons and killing rampage by Indominus wreak havoc and panic in the park whereas any sentimental affinity towards baby triceratopses and the dying Brontosaurus will only result in horrid disbelief. The creatures are truly terrifying in their own way. Much like we witnessed in last year's 'Godzilla', fleeting views of Indominus and a trail of his destruction provide the terror rather than his full-sized presence on screen. The Velociraptors are vicious, as expected and they possess enough intelligence to make them unpredictable. They are also a part of the film's iconic chase sequence with Pratt racing with them on his motorcycle in the hunt for Indominus. The showdown is between a hybrid and its predecessor, once again reminding us of 'Godzilla's' climax. There are several scenes that pay tribute to 'Jurassic Park' with the human-dinosaur interaction, re-visiting original buildings that now lay in ruin and several easter eggs that John Hammond would be proud of. These tributes are of course Trevorrow's salute to Spielberg himself, who is also the executive producer of this record-shattering blockbuster. Even though the creatures dominate this thrilling ride into a lost world, the human characters attempt to peek through the chaos, reflecting the tension, uncertainty, emotions and just a hint of levity. Jurassic World is merely a fun summer movie that has matured after the 2 sequels, often to the extent that it could give kids nightmares. But the consumer wanted bigger, badder, scarier creatures with more teeth. Trevorrow delivered all that and more. His direction kept the flow of action steady with enough build up initially to set up all the thrills. Its flaws can be overlooked for the sheer excitement that a visit to the park provides and several of the sequences containing the remarkable special effects are awe inspiring. Needless to say, it is a must-watch for an entire generation that grew up fascinated by Michael Crichton's imaginative world, realized by a master film-maker. Trevorrow's World is a ride worth taking into that lost world. Buckle up.","11 out of 30 found this helpful.

To boost attendance, the park has created a hybrid dinosaur as their new attraction. However, the creation yielded unintended and horrific consequences.The movie starts off a little slow, with scenes of brothers Zach and Gray's trip to the dinosaur theme park cutting back and forth to scenes of the scientists and park owners jabbering about corporate sponsors. But, the movie picks up steam when the Velociraptors were introduced, being trained by researcher Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). This leads to scenes of the various dinosaurs at the park through the brothers' point of view, with John Williams' original theme soundtrack playing in the background, which instantly brings back memories and nostalgia of the first movie. This was a very touching and clever touch that lets the viewers see a panorama of the entire park while connecting the story to the events of the first film.The introduction of the hybrid dinosaur leads to the film's highlighted excitement and suspense, creating tension and thrills when it escapes and threatens to wreck havoc on the park with its thousands of visitors ambiguous to the threat. What results is one adrenaline-pumping scene after the other from start to finish.The film may not be as good as the first one and the story could have focused more on the initial success and operation of the park and connect John Hammond's vision from the first movie more. However, I thought it's good that, in addition to the dinosaur mayhem, the movie also focuses more on the character development such as the on and off relationship between Owen and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) and the bond between brothers Zach and Ty. It also gives a little more attention to the dinosaurs, as we are asked to sympathize with the injured Brontosaurus and to understand the Velociraptors' connection with their trainer. The acting was decent for the most part, with Pratt and Howard delivering some spot-on performances in their roles. There is also some humor in the movie, though I thought some were forced and were pretty cheesy. The special effects were also decent - not as sophisticated as in the first movie, but it's good that the filmmakers used some animatronics rather than relying solely on CGI. The music score was catchy and am glad John William's theme was incorporated, and the direction was well-paced.Overall, it's a fun and entertaining sci-fi adventure that does well as a Jurassic sequel.Grade B+","11 out of 30 found this helpful.

Everything is going well until the park's newest attraction, a genetically modified giant stealth killing machine, escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.I may have been one of few people who didn't want to see this movie but I'm glad I changed my mind! Just like the original film, Jurassic World is a fun ride and it has some great one liners but it's predictable.The cast is amazing; Chris Pratt is a cool bad ass in this film but in a way he plays this role like a Indiana Jones style character. He steals the show to the point where you don't care about anyone else. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire who from the start of the film you know is going to be the damsel in distress, which is a sad thing because I'd like to see a strong female character. She also is kind of a 2D character with no real personality which isn't Bryce Dallas Howard's fault. One person I would have liked to see more of was Jake Johnson, he is the comic relief but we don't see enough of him.One thing that made the original Jurassic Park groundbreaking was the practical effects. Jurassic World is over the top C.G. and uses very few practical effects which I would have liked to see more of. One more thing I loved about this film was all the homage and nods to the original film.All together Jurassic World takes after the original; it's exciting, fun, and a great time for the whole family but I found it to be forgettable.

Jurassic Park is a classic with sequels that really do not hold up, the trailers for this one were released and they didn't really set my mind at ease, so for a while i just sort of thought ""at least Chris Pratt is in it"". I hoped it would go down the Mad Max: Fury Road road ( that sounded weird) and for the most part it did. The film does a good job at setting you up for a nice nostalgia trip and when it started i felt like all my worries would be invalid.The plot is hard to explain and keep spoiler free but don't worry i wont give anything away. 22 years after Jurassic Park, a new theme park Jurassic World has opened. A new breed of dinosaur has been created from splicing two existing breeds together and manages to escape from its facility, Owen Brady (Chris Pratt) and the somewhat uptight Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) take it upon themselves to stop the terror from destroying Isla Nublar and everyone in it. The way i have described it makes the film seem very basic and to be honest, yeah it is pretty basic, but there are things in the film which need to be seen as a fan of the original. What i like about Jurassic World is that you can see the film without any knowledge of the others, yet seeing the original film is definitely a bonus. There are a ton of throwbacks to the events of Jurassic Park, some are hilarious and others feel a little shoehorned in and don't always work, but just know that they are very much there. From the moment that the doors open and we pan around Jurassic World with the iconic theme blasting out around us.. that is when we know that this film is more of a passion project than anything and it does a good job at being nostalgic. In this sense i will say Jurassic World is definitely the best sequel of the franchise.Chris Pratt as always is an absolute delight to watch. He takes this role like all of his others and makes it his very own. His character was very much an Indiana Jones type which makes the rumours of him playing Indy all the more exiting. I also never realised how hot Bryce Dallas Howard is until i saw this, as well as this she too does a great job and is a badass towards the end which made her so much more than the critics calling her a cliché uptight business type woman. After Daredevil it is awesome to see Vincent D'onofrio in anything but in this he felt kind of out of place and his character felt a bit wasted in my opinion, and ramping up the nostalgia again BD Wong returns as the only original Jurassic Park cast member and i found myself welcoming him back with open arms.The most important thing is arguably the dinosaurs here. When i saw the trailer they looked like they were a CGI mess and found that the animatronics from the original held up much better. I still feel the original dinosaurs did look better but the velociraptors really do look and feel like a real part of the cast and the new dinosaur introduce (Indominous Rex) was honestly a thing of nightmares. It was scary as hell and looked so cool, the design of it alone was nothing short of spectacular and every scene featuring it (there are a lot) was intense and had me on the edge of my seat because like the original, you never know who will survive this beast and posed more of a threat than most monsters in movies today.I will wrap this review up by saying that if you go into this film expecting a fun monster movie with some cheesy one liners and some brilliant action sequences then this film will please you. If you're a Jurassic park fan this will please you also. No it is definitely not as good and does have its fair share of flaws, but the climax sets the series in a new direction and it was a welcome one. Now having the biggest opening weekend of all time and a set up like that scream sequel. You know what? Im okay with that and with the return of the current box office king Chris Pratt i can see a whole new trilogy on the horizon. Mad max did it, Jurassic World did it.. don't let us down Terminator Genysis. You may have a ridiculous title but give us the nostalgia we crave!","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

In fact, I was expecting to see Jeff Goldblum appear sooner or later, I suspect that he was too professional to even consider an appearance. And as for Jimmy Falon, oh dear, the ludicrous swept smartly into the ridiculous.It is a shame that what was really pretty good acting performances, and by the way I am a fan of Vincent D'Onofrio, was marred by the senseless repetitive story. Sorry I keep going on about how dreadful the story was, did I mention that the story gave the impression that two buddies spent a Saturday getting hammered and decided to steal something from here and there and see how it worked?I will give credit for the special effects, they were pretty good but again, sadly in this day and age it wasn't anything spectacular, if you want that then watch the Matrix.So, all in all; been there, seen it, done it and ironically (if you watch the movie you will see what I mean) - got the t-shirt, is the best way I can describe this. What really saddens me is that IMDb has probably been paid a small fortune by this movies makers to have not only the dedicated page, but also keep the 'less than praising' reviews away from the users.

Although still not as good as the first one, it's definitely better than the latter films. First of all, the characters in this film. Chris Pratt stars as Owen who trains rap tors, Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and the two children namely Zach and Grey. For Owen and Claire, they had great chemistry and they were entertaining to watch for the most part in the film. The subplot of the two children which kind of parallels the two children subplot in the first film was more or less okay, it's understandable as in the first film it was stated that Jurassic Park's ""target audience"" were the children, and sure they were relatable to the children audience. But that was just about it as they were then overshadowed by the much more thrilling occurrences in Claire and Owen's storyline, although I'm not saying they didn't have thrilling or intense sequences, they sure had a ton of them. Then you have Chris Pratt as Owen along with Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire. Chris Pratt's character was the bad ass and ""alpha"" rap tor trainer and Claire was kind of like the person in charge of the park who happens to be nephews with the two children. Owen and Claire were entertaining, but it felt that something was missing. In the first film, the way Spielberg introduced each and every character in Jurassic Park was so excellent that we immediately liked and connected to them. You had the wisecracking and funny Dr. Ian Malcolm when he was first introduced and you had Dr. Alan Grant who when he was introduced, he was shown irritated with a child and then proceeded to burn him (not literally). So it was then fun to watch when Dr. Grant now had to cope with two children in Jurassic Park. It was just simple things that made us love the characters in the first film which in this one, did not really quite have that except for the chemistry between Owen and Claire and how the children in this film were very much relatable for it's target audience. The main thing people usually ""complain"" about is how it isn't ""scary"" like the first film. The reason why the first film was so intense and scary was because the tension and scare was only revolving around a few number of people. The issue with many films nowadays is that they'd rather have a larger scope of what's happening, but then the audience wouldn't know what would be happening if there are too much things happening. The great thing about Jurassic Park was because of this small amount of people that everyone can relate to and can provide much more suspense which gave way to intense sequences because the audience now has a clear state of mind as to what is happening and who are the characters that are in an intense situation. As for Jurassic World, the scope of disaster in this film is huge and it was intense at some points, but you gotta admit that the most suspenseful moments in the film was when there weren't a lot of people and it was only just Chris Pratt standing still while the dinosaur comes up close or when the two children are escaping the dinosaur. Speaking of dinosaurs, let's talk about Indominus Rex and just dinosaurs in general in this film. Firstly, the CGI in this film for the dinosaurs was great. Close up shots looked great and more or less there were no problems, practical effects thankfully used and the human interaction with the dinosaurs looked excellent. Now moving on to the Indominus Rex, she was indeed a menacing antagonist. She was an intelligent hybrid capable of tricking humans and killing for sport as introduced in the first few minutes of the film, yet as the film progressed, it kinda felt inconsistent and her skills and intelligence were undermined a little bit, but maybe it was just because she had quite a short to moderate screen time.The action and thrilling sequences in this film. As mentioned, the most thrilling and intense scenes are when there aren't a lot of people and you actually know what is happening. Now this parallels as well to the action sequences in this film, because the action was amazing and awesome for children granted, but when analyzing and actually watching it as a whole....it kind of felt dull. Watching the action sequences it kind of reminded me of Transformers and that's usually a bad thing, especially at the boss or final battle (no spoilers), that battle felt too convoluted and it cuts back and forth to the humans and back to the dinosaurs fighting and back to the humans again and back to the dinosaurs fighting. If you have an epic battle, you must emphasize on it or the battle sequence will feel convoluted and confusing as to what is happening. Now let's talk about the wonder and awe that this film contained that is crucial to Jurassic Park films (well except for the latter films), it sure had A LOT of call backs, references and parallels to the first film, and the John Williams score comes back which provides with a lot of goosebumps and memories back. We've seem dozens of other innovative CGI films in the past few years but this film will still give you a smile if not drop your jaw if you're a kid or kid at heart. Verdict: 8.0/10","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

I'll get to that later) to Jurassic Park, my favorite film from childhood. As a dinosaur obsessed six year old, I begged and begged my parents to take me to see that movie, until, despite media reports that the film was perhaps too frightening for its target audience (i.e., me) my parents relented and took me to see it shortly before it's VHS release.Oh what wonders! My parents fears turned out to be unfounded, because I had come as close as I ever would to seeing what my six year old self wanted to see: dinosaurs in the flesh. How could I be frightened when I was this close to seeing my hearts desire? Admittedly, it is not that difficult to impress a six year old boy.I probably watched Jurassic Park 300,000 times between the ages of six and thirteen. It was undoubtedly my favorite film from childhood. I absolutely loved that film.In 2011, many years after I had last seen Jurassic Park, a local theater had a ""classic movie night"". This is also several years before Jurassic Park was converted into 3D for an official rerelease. Rewatching it, I was shocked at how well it held up, particularly the visual effects. Although my dinosaur obsession died before I reached adulthood (you could say went extinct, har har) my love of movies carried on, and Jurassic Park is truly a great movie. It has astonishing visual effects, tense and terrifying action sequences, likable and interesting characters, great performances from the cast, a far fetched but imaginative and intriguing plot, and has (almost inarguably) not been matched in terms of quality by any ""summer blockbuster"" made by Steven Spielberg since then.But I'm supposed to be writing a review of Jurassic World, which has none of those things. A not-quite-remake, not-quite-sequel to Jurassic Park, Jurassic World (as of my writing this) quickly became the third highest grossing film of all time (and quickly dropped to fourth after the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens). Obviously, I wasn't the only person anticipating this one. Despite eye rolling trailers and a general sense of ""been there, ate that"", I was going to see this movie no matter what.I am going to keep this review spoiler free, although I must say that the movie's plot makes very little sense in the context of the first two sequels to Jurassic Park. Indeed, while the first movie is referenced frequently both directly and indirectly, the sequels are treated as if they never happened. Whether this means that this is a ""selective sequel"" (striking The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 from continuity), or simply that Jurassic World is lazy with its continuity, is almost besides the point. 2&3: hate em. Let's forget about them.I'd be more okay with this tact if what was made was better. Jurassic World seems to have two somewhat contradictory goals: remaking Jurassic Park, and making a sequel to it. And in the sequel department, the writers have come up with a plot that seems to throw sh!t at the wall and see what sticks.Problem is, a lot of it doesn't. The plot is loose and all over the place. The tone is wobbly. The characters wooden, the performances uneven, and the visual effects no more spectacular than anything else released in 2015. Action scenes tend to carry little emotional weight.Which isn't to say that the movie is terrible, or even outright bad. It's not. Individual scenes, moments, and plot threads work just fine. They just don't congeal into a satisfying whole.Unlike Jurassic Park, which I made the mistake of rewatching immediately after this movie, for the first time since 2011. I was amazed at how well it held up, and how much better it is than this film is. This is an unnecessary remake. It is an unnecessary sequel.But we all wanted to see it. Hence: 4th highest grossing film of all time.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Like honestly, when was the last time any of you saw a movie you were satisfied with? Moving on to the review, Jurassic World delivers every bit of action, suspense, and awe- inspiring dino moments as the original Jurassic Park, but with a more modern twist. The CGI is done well but not overdone, and the story is written well, and the acting is brilliant by Pratt and Howard. Overall, the film has a lot of rewatchability, and is a worthy sequel to Spielberg's 1993 phenomenon. A brilliant movie, I recommend every to go watch it.","12 out of 34 found this helpful.

Steven Spielberg made a film that was like no other in 1993 and still like no other now in 2015. Being that it was, you would have expected a sequel or a series prior to this. Being that it was Steven Spielberg, I would had high hopes for a series back then because we trusted him in a series before. He put together three excellent adventure films in Indiana Jones series. Still though, Lost World: Jurassic Park, the first sequel was OK but some issues were found. Even more, the third sequel was even worse and didn't have a very good story. Luckily, these sequels were forgotten and the original Jurassic Park from 1993 will always have the biggest impact. Now with a fourth sequel out, this is exactly the sequel we always wanted and this one will not be forgotten.Let's forgot that we've been hoping for this sequel for awhile. A fourth film was originally scheduled for a 2005 summer release and it eventuality took ten years to get through the cracks. The plot now has a dinosaur park opening and operating with living dinosaurs called Jurassic World. After her nephews Gary (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) come visit the island and her on Christmas break, Clare Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park manger must save it from dinosaur attacks along with Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) a raptor trainer.In all honesty, the film premise is illogical. A dinosaur park is created where twenty years before one couldn't be opened because deaths happened and you couldn't control the dinosaurs. A multi-million dollar lawsuit should have happened and ended this forever. That said, the homage to the other park through this film is still clever even though again unlikely. Jurassic World though is one cool park even if admission is probably above anybody's price range but it is the coolest amusement park in the film world. From the effects that support the rides at Jurassic World to product placement, this film makes you want go to the park and that's what an amusement park in a film should do to you.Even more, so many theories are now out regarding these new characters and the Jurassic World universe. However you look at it, these are pretty neat characters. Claire has never been around to really care about her nephews and it's her time to impresses her sister. Owen is a blue-collar guy that has some really nice chemistry with Howard and really proves that Pratt can really play these roles after a handful of comedies from him. To think child actors would be leading this film is unsettling but Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson have no acting issues with a relationship between them that is exactly like my younger brother and I. Even Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as security operations guy and he's given more to do surprisingly. As much as I like Jurassic Park from 1993, I had issues with the action scenes. They look great and they were very simple which I like but they were unrealistic. Jurassic World action scenes are more in depth and you can sense the big budget that is somewhere in the $150-180 million market as reported. Still though, it uses nice ideas involving raptors that is original and uses the amusement park setting nicely. For the little ones, there is violent action but it's not like the other Jurassic Park movies weren't violent either.As I sat in the theater with a bunch of my brother's junior high friends who all finished the 7th grade literally an hour before the matinée, this is exactly a very good way to start the summer. A summer blockbuster that everyone could enjoy and it gets us set for the next blockbusters coming up in the upcoming months. More importantly, we now have a film that is at least acceptable compared to the original 1993 film and it is a long time coming. A good time indeed I had with this film.Note: The 3D version to the film which I saw should be avoided at all cost.","11 out of 31 found this helpful.

There was a general overall loss of color in the film with a washed out palette of color that I found very disturbing. Nor was the camera-work particularly good with scenes with objects obstructing the view. There was little originality in the film making, the director using a very hackneyed visual sense.Nor was the acting up to par of the earlier films. There was a general feeling of the actors not having rehearsed their parts sufficiently or the director not getting the best from them. Considering the film budget, I don't know why he didn't get better actors who knew their trade better.On the positive side, the character development made the story. Never mind the special effects of the reptiles killing, but the changes in personality were always the overlooked strong points of the Jurassic series. From the very first film in which the loquacious youngster matures into a more thoughtful, quiet person to this one in which the corporate hussy becomes a real person and the youngster changes from an impressionable tyke we see a steady progression of character change.As for the very last shot, the director's tribute to the T-Rex's return to lord of the jungle is a fitting commentary to the world they once ruled.","15 out of 46 found this helpful.

Chris Pratt was phenomenal as usual, but after him the acting quality takes a massive nosedive. The only way I can possibly justify how this is possible is that Pratt had to be given some looser boundaries with how he was able to
Perform his lines vs the other actors in the movie and thank heavens the director allowed this. There is no other way you can explain how Pratt seemed so much more authentic and genuine than any of the actors in the film. Without Pratt's personality and improvisations which brought this movie to life it may have been just another generic robotic movie!

Just avoid watching ""Jurassic World 2"" (2018) as it is significantly worse than any of the previous 4 Jurassic Park movies... Fortunately I hear that Colin Trevorrow is making a return to direct the next Jurassic Park 6 film so that is some good news... they fortunately realised their massive error in letting that other guy direct Jurassic Park 5.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie tries to recapture the magic of the original, but it's really difficult. The biggest problem is that there's a lot of suspension of disbelief. After the numerous deaths and a freaking T-Rex slaughtering people in a city, it's hard to imagine anyone would touch the ""Jurassic Park"" concept with a ten foot pole. Not only that, it would be impossible to get insurance on such a theme park/zoo. The T-Rex attack on a city in ""Lost World"" would be the disastrous equivalent of September 11th or Pearl Harbor in the Jurassic Park universe.

The scene with the injured Triceratops in the original is now an injured Brachiosaurus. It's great that this is a remake and a sequel at the same time. The nostalgia factor is there for those who saw the original when it first came out, while at the same time keeping it fresh for a new generation. Chris Pratt doesn't disappoint with his special brand of sarcastic humor. His performance as dinosaur wrangler Owen is great. I said in my Iron Man 3 review that I hope the kid who played Harley does more acting in the future. He is in this, and he is as funny in this as he was in Iron Man 3. Some critics have complained that the story focused too much on the humans and not enough on the dinosaurs. I disagree. There was just enough teasing the dinosaurs to keep me interested even when they weren't on screen. A footprint here, a claw there, but never actually a full dinosaur until much later. And I won't spoil the finale, but its easily the best thing this franchise has ever done.

Steven Spielberg introduces a new Jurassic park trilogy with new dinosaurs in a new
Jurassic park on the same old Island. The film contains a lot of new characters like Chris
Patt as Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing and Vincent D'Onfrio as Vik
Hoskins. Some characters from the original Jurassic park trilogy are present too like the
chief geneticist Dr. Henry Wu who is played again by B.D.Wong.Jurassic World is about Zach Mitchell, played by Nick Robinson, and Gray Mitchell, played
by Ty Simpkins, visiting their aunt Claire, who is a senior executive in the amusement park
Jurassic World. The dangerous genetically modified Indominus Rex breaks out and the
two children are lost in the forests on the island. Claire and the raptor trainer Owen Grady
go on search for the two and for the dinosaur while Vik Hoskins tries to turn some dinosaurs
into dangerous weapons, including Owen's raptors.The film has an interesting plot that underlines the Jurassic park theme with many new aspects
like the huge number of visitors who are in the park during this time. The plot forms in my opinion
a good basis for the two sequels of the Jurassic World-trilogy. With a new soundtrack that is very
similar to the original one by John Williams, the Jurassic-park-feeling is given back to me. The special
effects deserve a recognition because the dinosaurs look and move very natural to me.All in all, Jurassic World is an excellent film with great special effects and an interesting plot that combines old and new and is recommended for a wide audience.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Despite the hype and anticipation, after just half an hour of this drivel, I wanted to leave. I wonder which studio official decided this disgraceful insult to the term 'Jurassic' should be distributed in its present form. It seems the first draft of the script outline, with all its plot holes, lack of dramatic tension and predictability was enough to convince them it would be a money spinner and further development was unnecessary before filming started. Conceptually, this is proof, if proof were needed, that the US film-making fraternity are convinced that a movie not full of guns, rockets and helicopters can't be exciting. We have an improbable hunky hero who remains unsweaty, groomed and clean after several days battling dinos in a steamy jungle, a woman (supposed to be a good actress but in this film it is hard to believe) whose idea of jungle attire is designer corporate wear with her sleeves rolled up and high heels. And then there are the kids; both of them have minimal screen presence and their main role contribution is to whimper and be even more stupid than you'd expect. What a polar difference to the pair in Jurassic Park. Spielberg has an expert eye for top notch child acting talent and should at least have been consulted on these two.Apparently there was no upper limit on the budget for special effects and they are superb but the plot is dire in the extreme and so full of holes it can make a true fan cry. Cloying and shameful references to its prequels abounded but they seem inappropriate in a movie that has moved so far from a great concept and cinematography to low-grade video game garbage.Probably the most disappointing movie I have seen in decades.","16 out of 31 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Despite following the same formula as the original, it manages to be a sequence with several elements of a reboot, bringing new aspects to the franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5840447/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2020","Many years after the release of the third part of the initial trilogy, Universal Studios revitalizes the franchise based on the work of Michale Crichton, trying to expand it and explore new aspects related to the original plot. The emulation of situations, character characteristics and narrative with the original 1993 film is notorious, in the script originally written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver and which was later rewritten by Derek Connolly and director Colin Trevorrow himself. The great merit of this fourth film is that, despite following the same formula as the original, it manages to be a sequence with several elements of a reboot, bringing new aspects, charismatic characters and still paying tribute and referencing the classic directed by Spielberg.Colin Trevorrow's production lives up to the franchise and adopts a light tone, almost of a juvenile adventure, to snatch families around the world. The synopsis of the film is interesting. Show the park already open, under the attack of a genetically modified dinosaur. In fact, the premise is very similar to the 1993 production, only in a megalomaniacal way. Although everything has become so grand and somewhat artificial, it is possible to be moved by the first scenes showing the place and the attractions. However, certain exaggerations are notable. The aquatic dinosaur is a strong example. There is a lack of subtlety in the direction of the inexperienced Colin Trevorrow. A product of this magnitude should have been delivered to someone with more luggage. The excess of characters, mostly clichés, hinder the progress and weaken the script.
And it is in one of the many possible parallels to be drawn between one work and another that Jurassic World finds its potential: the scene of the sick dinosaur, being taken care of by the protagonists of the original film, returns, adapted to a scenario in which a threat kills animals for pure sport, something more human than bestial. In this resumption, similar to the iconic moment of the classic, one of the few uses of animatronics here, Jurassic World extracts as much as it can from the viewer on an emotional level, since the rest is very superficial. In the other cases, we opted for creations made entirely on the computer, which work well, but have an expiration date. The intimacy of the relationship between man and creature is savored by the script, especially in the connection of the character Owen (Chris Pratt) with the velociraptors, something much better resolved than the other communication made with this species of dinosaur, in the third adventure of the franchise.We also have the figure of the new owner of the park, Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who somehow inherits the park from John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), a former magnate and owner of Nublar Island. Khan's character is a new investor who decided to reopen and continue the genetic research initiated by Hammond. Right away the motivation of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) to reopen the complex is not clear, because the result is so impressive that the audience is moved by the Park's variability and news. The writers also do not bother to answer some pertinent questions: how was the dinosaur containment problem solved in Islas Nublar and Sorna? Why reopen the park in the same place?
We still see an old character appear again. Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), who was also one of the scientists of the original park, here being responsible for a turn at the end of the plot, reminding another scientist of yore. The villain Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), who has a peculiar interest in velociraptors, has an outstanding intelligence when respecting their tamer Owen Grady. But the peace of the thousands of tourists in the Park ends when a hybrid dinosaur manages to escape its confinement and becomes the target of InGen Security administrators, who intend to use the new genetics of the most evolved dinosaurs as lethal weapons in the field. The big problem is that the villain is very poorly developed and stereotyped, not posing any real threat.For fans of the franchise, the script still reserves moments of pure nostalgia, whether through the shirt of the original Jurassic Park, or through the tracks and even a car from the same park. Obviously, one of the ingredients that should be well presented in any film in the franchise is dinosaurs. This time, the T-Rex are lagging behind the new threat of this film. With a certain suspense to fully reveal the look of the Indominus Rex - the invincible dinosaur, the special effects contribute to the fantastic tone of the tape and make good use of the beautiful landscapes of Hawaii (chosen to represent the fictional Isla Nubar in Costa Rica). The psychological dimension that Indominus gains thanks to Owen Grady's constant explanations - in fact, the writers use it to explain the film in different scenes. With that, the best character is the hybrid dinosaur. The mosasaur is incredible and the classic scenes with the apatosaurs and triceratops are honored with mastery by the director Colin Trevorrow. The pteranodon and dimorphodon flyers carry the scenes of tension in the film. The villain, Indominus Rex (hybrid) swallows and devours some humans in times of great hunger and anger, while Chris Pratt and his team of Velociraptors prepare for the final hunt. Adventurer Owen Grady's relationship with one of the tamed velociraptors is satisfactorily developed, so much so that you can empathize with Owen and Blue. The proposal to transform one of the villains of the first film into allies is something intelligent and unprecedented.Not everything works plausibly in this eight-handed script. This usually results in a fragmented, contradictory, sometimes stupid, pamphleteering film that has sudden changes in the atmosphere or that has missing characters. Because that's exactly what happens here. Because of a more demanding audience, unable to settle for just dinosaurs (or, presumably, Jurassic Park), the opening of the park comes together with the interest of scientists in the creation of a genetically created creature modified, because that's probably a good idea. For a change, it is not, creating a work with a very predictable character, a statement that suffers a small break in the final third of the work, full of twists, some intelligent, some extremely forced, but none sufficient, justifiable.
Undoubtedly, there is an excess of narrative nuclei thanks to the infinity of characters - which hinders the progress of the story. The first act is lost among the attractions of the park, the pamphlet didacticism, the construction of a bad romance and the growing threat of Indominus. Several times the dialogues deal with criticisms about animal rights, notion of ownership, feelings of dinosaurs and capitalist brands - something completely bizarre since during the film there are countless merchandisings which shows the hypocrisy of the text.The director of the classic feature, Steven Spielberg, acting here as executive producer, wanted to lead the viewer to the idea that animatronics is inferior to images generated by computer graphics. One of the biggest curiosities I had about Jurassic World was about the special effects. Twenty-two years later, a lot has changed in the business. Nowadays it is much easier to create computerized dinosaurs. Fortunately, they did not abandon animatronics for the proximity scenes, and they still work very well on stage. This time, they used much more CGI, making it possible to show more dinosaurs. You gain in quantity, but you lose in reality. The artificial content of animals was not uncommon. A very plausible justification is that they have a lot more screen time than before. In the first three films, most of the tension was created by the performances, the script and the soundtrack. Even with good production design, the intense use of computer graphics to bring animals to life is inexcusable. All the other Jurassic Park - films made on smaller budgets - used the incredible animatronics designed and made by Stan Winston in different ways. Here, they use the realistic technique only on the head of an apatosaurus in a simple scene that can only thrill thanks to the use of ancient technology.The park itself is also magnificently discovered by the viewer, far from the rusticity of the original work, close to the futuristic technological and, in short, unlike the idea brought with the primitive dinosaurs - an interesting antithesis. However, realize that, while in the original film the classic theme found its peak in the first magnificent appearance of the dinosaurs, here, when we open the windows of a room, comfortable and comfortable, the ""world of dinosaurs"" is introduced to the viewer, observing more constructions that creatures in fact. The park is the real spectacle. Technology faces nature.Finally, it is worth highlighting the fact that ""Jurassic World"" does not update itself even in the criticism that makes human attempts to ""turn God"" and to create new animals in the laboratory irresponsibly, or to ""objectify"" animals and turn them into sources of income. In fact, there is always the feeling of hypocrisy when the film criticizes the endless search for profit and news to ""continue to enchant the public"", since Universal itself has a theme park in Orlando, and it certainly does the same. Still, ""Jurassic World"" is entertaining. From the immersive epic soundtrack of Michael Giacchino (Oscar winner for ""Up"") to the childlike wonder of the boy Gray (although he is not the protagonist), it is possible to notice Spielberg's finger (hand, arm, claws) on new park. With a tone of adventure and unpretentiousness that comes closest to Jurassic Park III, director Colin Trevorrow tries his best to present an above average film and does not disappoint.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Why anyone would open or invest in it after the events is another story altogether and never really mentioned! Owen (Pratt) is the Sam Neil replacement and is charming and solid throughout and Claire (Dallas Howard) is the Laura Dern replacement and becomes less stuck-up and annoying as the film progresses. Jake Johnson (Nick off 'New Girl') is great as the computer tech in the control room and gets a few funny moments - a more than admirable job as the Jeff Goldblum replacement!The film keeps a similar formula to 'Jurassic Park' - two kids, a concerned parent-figure (but not the actual parents - why are they never with their kids?), a dinosaur escaping and everyone running for their lives! There's some nice throwbacks to the original too - the score motifs, the kids stumble into the foyer of the memorable final scene, the original/distinctive jeeps are seen, Dr Wu - the geneticist - is played by the same actor, Hammond is mentioned a few times and there's a heard of Gallimimus at one point. I was glad to see more Stegosaurs and also to see Ankylosaurs for the first time in the series.My main issue was the similarity to some aspects of 'Jurassic Park III' - there's a dinosaur bigger than Tyrannosaurus Rex that kills everything; there's Pteranodons that get loose and their consequences never properly dealt with; and the Velociraptors aren't really treated as vicious killing machines until it's needed in the story. However, it doesn't really need to make much sense when there's so many great moments of tension, then action, then surprise throughout - and some genuine wonder with the Deinosuchus in the Sea World part. A well done final scene(s) cap off an enjoyable experience.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now, I'm not a huge fan of the first three films, but, in all honesty, Jurassic World kicks butt; it sports all the necessary elements for a very re-watchable piece of entertainment: it's bigger, faster and louder and contains some powerful cheering moments.
This could have suffered the same fate as Jurassic Park: The Lost World but thanks to the heady approach of sequel/reboot, Jurassic World feels fresh and stands its own, you don't have to have seen the previous installments and you won't have to watch the next.
This is what I called the perfect pop-corn film: wholly enjoyable, re-watchable and leaves wanting you more.

Fell in love! And really have enjoyed the 2 sequels for what they're worth. Then, came out with Jurassic World, used our favorite Starkilled... and we have an amazing movie. I'm still riding a high from seeing it last night. It was just so good. I spoiled a few moments for myself, but overall was still surprised at the ending, despite it's Mortal Kombat predicted finish. The CGI was top notch and had us really believing these creatures were real. A worthy movie to see over and over again. I really do not want to spoil a THING. I would not say this movie is sexist in anyway... not sure where people picked up on that, but will say it is heavy on the testosterone(did I spell that correctly?). Which isn't a bad thing. Jurassic World has a wonderful build up, some good personalities, and a few main 'side characters' are killed off! We see some personalities actually change through the movie. Claire, Zach, and even Gray and Owen to some extent. I'll say this: Claire learns some humility and heart. Zach learns real love over shallowness to some extent, Gray learns true courage, and Owen (with already enough faith and trust) gains even more (and a fan club). Though the one character who comes back... I wonder if they grew his character more from a twisted version from the original novel. (Real the original novel!)Don't let the trailers anger you, you will root for the raptors, and you will LIKE IT! The raptors aren't exactly 'tamed', barely. Think Dug from Up. This is the true sequel to the original movie Michael refused to give Spielberg years ago... instead Creighton wrote about irregular students outside of the norm, attached to a character akin to Spielberg's personality, and gave us a more boring version of Malcolm (that sung Dixie no less), and Harding, who was a woman who to was hard to understand and not very likable. And the end of the second book was... lackluster to say the least. Not want Spielberg wanted. Still a good novel and fun read.The island is back, the locations, the look, and we see some of its 'history' (wish we saw more of the attractions). This is the true sequel and it the summer smash for 2015. If you like the original Jurassic Park movie, you can not miss out on this movie. It fits so well, and open enough for a few questions and a sequel. Which makes one think... they could... no wait, can't say it. It might spoil the ending! Ha ha! They do mourn a character that dies. A plot twist here or there... the final fight is simply amazing. Cool tributes to the original movie (and Stan Winston - there's a building named after him, look for it, I saw it!) This was an excellent movie and a definite 10 in my book. Easily rewatchable.Please note, it seemed a little more gory than the previous movies with a little more blood. The cursing was actually minimal. I wouldn't take anyone under 7 or 8 to see it. The gore was kind of cool though. More detail than we had in the originals other than ""I think this was Gennaro..."" Great movie, plenty of dino on dino fighting action. Don't listen to the naysayers. No contrived endless conversations about dinosaur behavior here.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Some of the most successful movies do both, but having only one element does not mean the movie is poor. Jurassic World is the perfect example of this.With Chris Pratt as the lead, Jurassic World is one of the most entertaining and visually stunning movies that I've seen in theaters in a long time. No, the plot is not overly complicated with twists and turns that leave you thinking. No, character development is not the primary focus for this movie (I actually only enjoyed Chris Pratt and Vincent D'Onofrio's characters, could care less about everyone else). Simply put, what you get is exactly what you think, an entertaining movie about dinosaurs recking havoc, eating people, and destroying stuff. This movie definitely sets the standard for the summer movie season.P.S - The velociraptor scene in the trailer where they are set loose, and Chris Pratt is riding with them, is even more bad ass in the movie.","11 out of 32 found this helpful.

A 10 should be a masterpiece wich this is not, It is watchable at best, with great CGI and Chris Pratt who brings the movie up. The music score is still good (even if its from The first movie).However, it lacks in story and has no originality, and Bruce Dallas Howard might be one of the worst actors Ive seen. The child actors are not believeble in either acting or characters. The build up and characters are very stereotype.If you are gonna see one Dinosauriemovie I recommend rewatching Jurassic Park instead.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved it, really loved it. I wasn't expecting something as good as the first because that would be just unreasonable. I Know that everyone hates the sequels, but i am a true fan of the entire franchise not just the first, and i love Lost World, and i will never understand all the hate it has, but everyone has their opinion. So i was expecting something that had the action and thrills of the sequel and the wonder and magic of the original and... The film has a very cool opening, but it's not the usual opening sequence, and it's a very nice change, it has a very good first hour, where we meet the new characters, the park, and establish the story. Its very exciting, and i love the new...Characters: Chris Pratt doesn't shine as he could but he's a very good character, has that something that makes him very likable. But i think the real star of the show is Bryce Dallas Howard, she is great, and has a good development, the only one by the way, since only she and Nick Robinson evolve as characters. So him and Ty Simpkins are great too, i love that they are much more independent than the original kids. Vincent D'Onofrio, is a good character but nothing special, the same with Irrfan Khan. Now Jake Johnson is great, but as with almost every character i wanted to see a lot more, i would develop this characters a lot more, and make them appear more. (BD Wong of course makes a good if nothing special cameo). The Story: It has a very good premisse, since i always wanted to see the park finally open and how would that actually be. I have to say that its just magic, they created the perfect park, seeing John Hammond's dream come true is just magic, full of wonder and excitement. They were very creative and created a park that is very unique in its structures, attractions and transports. But they only show us tiny bits of a lot of things, and i think they should have explored the park a lot more, we should have seen the attractions through the visitors perspective. This would have made the film better, because if the premisse is the park being finally open, this should be much more explored. The indominus Rex is just perfect, its scary as hell, and the plot is pretty much all about her. Which gives some great thrills and chills and overall it is a great story. The raptors plot is just awesome, and i loved everything about it. It was very original and surprising. The Nods: There's tons of nods to the original film, and its just great seeing them through the entire film, i think this was what i loved more, they just paid a huge homage to the original film, but in such a great way that it feels natural and exciting. The action: Well its very good, and once the mayhem starts it never stops. But i really would love to see a lot more of the mayhem, because another great thing about the park being open is that it can have a lot more ways to create mayhem. There's many awe moments, and it is very intense. A lot of people die in such magnific ways, it's incredible. The climax is just awesome, epic. The visuals: Just awesome, i loved the cinematography, the production design, everything. The camera-work is also great, while sometimes i would make some wider shots, its very distinctive, and this just looks awesome on IMAX 3D, feels so epic. There's a lot of great scenery. As for the visual effects, they are breathtaking, but i don't think they are better than the originals, but either way, they are terrific and the raptors are the better visual effects in the film. the way they move is epic. Other technical aspects: The score is just great, and while its very much Michael G. it could very well pass as a john Williams score. It incorporates the original themes very well. The sound it's just terrific, very very good.Overall: This is a very unique, original film, that has everything to be a huge success, especially the fact that it feels so much different than everything else this summer, or the whole year, it feels fresh and distinctive. It has great visuals, some great thrills, great action, great story, great characters, a sense of wonder, but somehow i think i left the theater feeling it was missing something, i cant quite say what, but i do know that it should have something more. And the things i would change, would be to explore the characters and the park a lot more. Personally i put this sequel next to Lost world, but this is me, as to everybody i think it will be their favorite sequel. And is more that guaranteed a new sequel, and i hope many more. Also i think this is the only the second film of the year until now, that i think it deserves a second viewing in theaters. And if you can, watch it on the biggest screen possible, because it feels epic.","10 out of 30 found this helpful.

I must say that the second and third film wasn't that good compared to the first one, so this works out as a fine sequel to the first.Jurassic World have been running successfully in 10 years after the incidents at Jurassic Park, but guest count is declining, so they decide to create a new dinosaur, since they have run out of species to clone, this one is designed and is what they call a genetically modified hybrid, what can go wrong by creating your own bigger, stronger and with more teeth edition of a dinosaur.There are lot of good things to say about this film, but also a few things that doesn't work for it, luckily the good trumps the not so good, so all-in-all it becomes a very decent film with high entertainment value. The best part is actually that they continue the series as a new second film and that opens up for a lot of possibilities, but it is also the way that this is a big theme park and you really run along side Gray (Ty Simpkins) and want to see all the attractions and investigate all you can and see all there is to see. As a theme park this is really a cool place, with interesting rides, and great attractions, I especially like the hamster bubble for people, it is just something you really want to try yourself. Once again we are unfortunately stuck in the dilemma, that if you have this big facility and know that these are powerful and strong animals, why then create a bigger one and not account for the security precautions that are needed is a rookie mistake. So it worked for the first film because it was new and nobody had done it before, but this second time around, and since the park have been running for 10 successful years, they should know more about the game they are in and not make security mistakes, they should have calculations and preventive measure to make sure it can't happen.It is an entertaining film, there are a lot of fun moments and a lot of great fights between dinosaurs and in general a really great experience that takes you back to the age when you saw the first film in many ways. It can be enjoyed by old and new fans of dinosaurs and in my opinion you don't have to have seen the first film to know what it is all about.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

This was still a super fun filled, exciting ride from start to finish. If you are going to watch this movie, I highly recommend you check it out in 4D. The story interwoven with the action scenes is done pretty well and the bickering between characters wasn't all that annoying either. It compacted a lot of cool elements in this movie, it's like they threw everything they got for this production. It even has an Asian Stever Jobs in this film. Just when you think it couldn't get anymore cooler, they throw in something ridiculous but exciting surprise at the audiences. The special effects are top notch in this, and it really shows how much innovation when it came to the CGI it has come compared to the first film in this franchise. Yeah, this seems more like a monster movie than a dinosaur crisis movie, but it has enough exciting and tension like sequences to the point it really doesn't matter all that much. Maybe it's because I saw this film in 4D, but I enjoyed this film way more than I thought I would.8/10","9 out of 27 found this helpful.

This wouldn't normally be a deal breaker, but since the story isn't anything special, it would be nice to have some eye candy (besides Bryce Dallas Howard)The experience isn't wholly terrible though - the action is perfectly fine (if a little silly - the T-rex fight is the highlight) and Chris Pratt is a charismatic leading man.5/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The female-male have a sexual tension mixed with strong personalities which create a spicy relationship. The children characters were believable and did not run hurt Jurassic by running around screaming. There is a story about socialization, how male and female interact, how groups interact and animals with nature . One see how nature survives and a social balance is created. Jurassic worlds warnings about modified genetics with the modified Dino. The special effects where great and made for a breath taking rollercoster ride. What did not work.

And spectacle is what it delivers, with both barrels, all cylinders, and every flag flying. A worthy sequel to Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic Jurassic Park, this summer blockbuster likewise envisions a 22-year time gap, during which time the theme park on Isla Nublar has grown huge, attracting over 20,000 people at a time, deserving the new ""world"" label.There are plenty of resonances with the earlier film. Spielberg himself is executive producer, tho the directing has been turned over to Colin Trevorrow. Michael Giacchino, in charge of the music, has the eminent good sense to use a full-throated reprise of John Williams's magnificent theme at appropriate moments. We still get platoons of lightning- fast velociraptors, now rendered even more realistically. And B. D. Wong is back as ace geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. My only disappointment in the nostalgia department was the absence of a scene in corporate HQ with a large portrait of visionary John Hammond (the late Richard Attenborough) hanging at the front of the board room.But, for all its harkbacks to Park, this World truly achieves its goal of being ""bigger, louder, with more teeth"". There's nothing at all wrong with the action, adventure, or pacing.The one thing that prevents it from achieving 9-hood on my 9-point rating scale was that the human interactions were slightly off. Unlike Mad Max, here we are given 4 characters we can readily relate to: Chris Pratt as Owen Grady, ex-Navy, trainer of and surrogate father to 4 velociraptors; Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire, buttoned-up, all-business director of operations for the park; and Ty Simpkins as Gray and Nick Robinson as Zach, her 2 nephews, whom her sister naively expects will be getting the personal touch from their Aunt Claire. Unfortunately, these 4 relate to each other just a little too stiffly, with supposedly humanizing quirks more glued on than integral to their characters. Claire's slavish adherence to her stiletto heels, for example, just comes across as stupid, and their improbable cleanliness distracting. And the brothers' brief foray into the subject of their parents' possible divorce comes out of left field, lingers awkwardly like an unwashed guest, and then vanishes as pointlessly as it came. These aren't fatal flows, tho; the dialog isn't blatantly bad, just could've used more polishing.The example they should have aspired to is the cinema's all-time greatest sight gag, the exquisitely timed glimpse of the phrase ""Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear"" from the original. There's no equivalent here.The plot trigger is the escape from containment of the one and only specimen of a new species of dinosaur, the Indominus rex, created from a variety of predecessor species by means of genetic engineering, since the money guys behind the park evidently didn't think that regular dinosaurs were cool enuf all by themselves. (Totally wrong there; they are way cool!) Every time a new attraction has been introduced, we are informed, attendance has spiked. And they're overdue for another spike.An unexpected side effect is that Indominus (Latin for ""untamable"") isn't just big, hungry, and ferocious, it's also smart, cunning, ruthless, and equipped with a cuttlefish's camouflage genes. When Owen discovers that it's loose, he doesn't hesitate for a second: He advises hitting it with every lethal weapon available. Claire and her staff, of course, are reluctant to just blow away a scientific wonder, a unique creature that they've invested heavily in and are counting on for the park's future income. But, despite these differences, all concerned agree that they've got to work together to keep the monster away from the paying customers.About that word ""monster"". In one of the few reflective, philosophical moments of the film, one of the characters muses about whether it's appropriate to apply it to the big guy. ""To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat."" Um, yeah. Yeah, you may be right. But check out all the former canaries around here. Now let's hit that monster with everything we've got.In pursuit and attainment of a PG-13 rating, there's no gratuitous gore and violence here. People are obviously being slautered left and right, but very little of it occurs on screen, and only the occasional splash of blood on a wall or off-screen crunching sound gives any hint of the extent of the carnage.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

There's quite a few interesting surprises and callbacks that had me giddy. At 28 yrs old I don't often have reason to be giddy, but this movie had me from beginning to end.

It felt like some bad fan-fiction. Meh.","24 out of 51 found this helpful.

Viewers are bound to draw comparisons to the original and make it hard for them to be critiqued in their own right. First entries cast a shadow that a sequel can never escape. Especially when it comes to summer blockbusters.Jurassic Park was one of the most groundbreaking films to ever hit the big screen. From the breathtaking visual effects, to the memorable characters, to the iconic score, it was an instant classic that made a fortune. But with every smash hit movie, a sequel will surely follow. Although the next two installments of the series had their moments, we were relatively underwhelmed by a lack of inventiveness. The main reason the first movie was such a success was due to how new and exciting it all was. Without likable characters or an interesting script, all we're left with is dazzling visuals. Which work, but quickly get repetitive. So where does Jurassic World fit in? Well, if you ask me, Jurassic World is the sequel that Jurassic Park always deserved. Although it stumbles a bit along the way with a few plot holes and character issues, the film is simple and satisfying. Essentially what this movie does is resurrect the setting and a few themes of the first. Hammond's vision for the park has been scaled up and finally built, allowing us to get closer to the dinosaurs than ever before. If stellar visuals and comforting simplicity aren't enough, there is something else this film has to offer that none of the sequels ever gave us: heart. The attachment we feel to the dinosaurs themselves reaches a whole new level that even the first film can't match. Seeing Pratt interact with the raptors was spectacular and wasn't like anything we've seen before. The other sequels felt redundant as they often attempted to recapture the magic of the original. But Jurassic World gives us a well-rounded perspective of what these creatures are. It's refreshing, and brings new life to these movies. Viewers can actually look into the eyes of the animals and begin to feel emotionally attached. Whether they be breathing their last breathe, or simply staring intently at potential human prey, there's a charming personal touch. I think it worked splendidly.While I was very fond of the movie as a whole and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good summer fun, I can't overlook a few problems it has. Unfortunately some of the acting felt wooden at times, particularly from Irrfan Khan who seemed really out of place throughout the entire movie. There are also the plot holes such as cell phone usage to call for help, potential pterodactyl migration, and the lack of an evacuation plan to get visitors off the island safely. The kid characters were also a problem.The kids in the movie really didn't add much to the story. They seemed to be there mainly for dramatic effect. Not only were they unnecessary in my eyes (the best moments are with Pratt and Howard), but also pretty flat and uninteresting. They have story arcs that don't connect to the plot and I didn't feel very invested in them. While they did make for some great sequences, I think those moments could've been written without them. All in all, Jurassic World is a very good movie and a breath of fresh air for the series. The last half hour alone makes seeing it well beyond the value of a ticket. I had a blast, and even if it doesn't live up to the spectacle of Jurassic Park, I got a true taste of 90s nostalgia. With tons of mesmerizing visuals, heartfelt moments, and pulse- pounding action, fans and general audience members have a lot to enjoy. Kids will love it, and adults will too. Go see it!","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Fourth Time Out With The Dinosaurs...And So Much More","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3261632/?ref_=tt_urv","virek213","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1249454/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2015","Michael Crichton, who passed away in the fall of 2008, may not have realized the kind of goldmine he struck when he published his dinosaur novel ""Jurassic Park"" in 1990; but with director Steven Spielberg's help, that goldmine was open for business with the original 1993 film version, and then with its 1997 sequel THE LOST WORLD. Due to Spielberg being heavily involved in making A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE in 2001, the third ""Jurassic Park"" film was left in the hands of director Joe Johnston, with Spielberg staying on as executive producer. Incredibly enough, another fourteen years would pass until the move-going public got the fourth in the series, JURASSIC WORLD.Twenty-two years after John Hammond's experiment at producing an innovative theme part with genetically-created dinosaurs on an island some 200 miles off of Costa Rica came crashing down with the dinosaurs consuming several people, now that same island, Isla Nublar, is now home to Jurassic World, a highly innovative theme park with bigger and better dinosaurs, and, hopefully, with greater controls. One of the workers, an ex-Navy seaman (Chris Pratt), has become especially attuned to a number of the raptors in the park, and has managed to earn their trust. At the same time, the park's principal supervisor (Bryce Dallas Howard) has been overseeing the creation of a super-dinosaur, made up of the DNA of the previous species of dinosaurs, including velociraptors, and tyrannosaurus rexes, that has guaranteed an up tick in revenue and park attendance. But as with anything involving the technology used in creating creatures that have been extinct from the Earth's surface for sixty-five million years, soon everything turns upside down. This doesn't stop the park's main security chief (Vincent D'Onofrio) from seeing a way to use these dinosaurs as a weapon of war, over the vehement objections of both Pratt and Howard, as well as one of the original scientists (B.D. Wong) from the original Jurassic Park. Upping the ante still further are the fact that Howard's two nephews (Nick Robinson; Ty Simpkins) have come to the island to be with their aunt; instead, they find themselves having to behave like responsible adults in the most horrible way possible when the mayhem created by the ""super-dinosaur"" allows all the other species out of their enclosures. When D'Onofrio's megalomaniacal ambitions result in his death, it is up to Pratt and Howard to destroy the super dinosaur with all the weapons at their disposal.As with JURASSIC PARK III, Spielberg's involvement in directing another film (in this case the World War II spy thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES) led him to taking the role of executive producer, allowing Colin Treverrow, whose only feature film credit before this was the romantic comedy drama SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED in 2012, to direct it. With help from co-writers Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Derek Connally, however, Treverrow managed to cobble together elements of the first three films into a coherent, if not necessarily letter-perfect, science fiction/suspense thriller that, in some interesting twists, pays homage not only two its three predecessors, but also to Spielberg's 1975 classic JAWS (as the super-dinosaur eats a Great White shark to the amazement of the 20,000+ people in attendance), and to Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic THE BIRDS (as the avian dinosaurs attack the park visitors from the air with sometimes bloody results).It is not a mark against either the film or Treverrow to say that the film misses the verve and panache of the first two movies that were directed by Spielberg in masterful fashion, though one sometimes wishes he had concentrated as much on characters as he did on the mayhem. Nevertheless, Pratt (ZERO DARK THIRTY; GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) and Howard (LADY IN THE WATER) do really good turns as a pair, despite the rather clichéd bickering they do at the start; and Robinson and Simpkins make for as appealing a pair of kids as Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards did in Spielberg's original. Giacchino's score is impressive as well, and he wisely interpolates John Williams' themes from Spielberg's first two films while also incorporating some of his own ideas.The final verdict when it comes to JURASSIC WORLD is that, despite its tendency to fall into predictability in terms of the dinosaur attacks and some cardboard characters, it is far better than most summer CGI film fare, with enough Spielberg influence to keep it from being just another blockbuster, resulting in my giving it an '8' rating.","9 out of 29 found this helpful.

One of the most sad part is either the cast is bad as they don't know how to act or have no scope. For example Bryse Howard was awful with blank face, no expression even in a most crisis situation. Really Ron' daughter? Not sure why the star cast like Irfan Khan with absolutely no scope of acting was cast in this movie. Please don't do this again. Leave us to enjoy Spielberg's original magic.

Watching it you cannot help but smile from hearing John Williams original score, and then with new good stuff from Michael Giacchino! Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt are the two leads of the movie and fit into it well! But the thing that separates this from the other films is how action packed it is. Now is this a bad thing....hard to say, for this movie in particular not at all, but I'm curious on the direction of the future...no spoilers....but back to other points, the Indominous Rex is used cleverly as the monster of the movie, and the climax at the end is worth the watch in theaters! overall I hope everyone enjoys the ride that is Jurassic World!

So bad, that they put the genetically engineered dinosaurs on the endangered species list. This return saves the franchise, although there are some blemishes in scripting that are too noticeable to ignore.First of all, when you go to see a Jurassic Park movie, you're there to see dinosaurs hunting people and smashing stuff to bits, right? It's hardly any mystery that something will go horribly wrong sooner or later either. It was a good device to show the park operating in the manner it's supposed to, and the Sea World/Disneyland touristy feel was the right approach. Still, you can't help but think, ""OK, when do the dinosaurs break out and start chasing everybody?"" The movie does not disappoint where dinosaur violence is concerned. There are plenty of dino-duels and chase scenes. The pterodactyl sequence is executed well. Are there problems? Yes, several. One character has the word ""Dino- meal stamped on his head from the first time you see him. Then there are the clichés that have shown up in every single JP movie now: kids in danger who are in danger because they're dumb and encounter the most dangerous dinosaur, references to a divorce that nobody cares about, an obnoxious corporate twit with a big mouth, a guy plotting to exploit the dinosaurs for his own agenda, and so on. There are some plot holes, especially in the inconsistent behavior of some of the animals. The story gives some character development to the dinosaurs, which usually works except for a couple of glaring and weird exceptions. Human characters really aren't developed too well, and one lead character was horribly miscast. And, whoever cranked out the tired ""cell phones fail just when you need them"" cliché needs to placed under arrest. The story line has a clear destination, and moves well from chapter to chapter. The climactic melee at the end is exactly what the audience is hoping to see, complete with some great pay-offs of well done plot development set-ups. Not perfect, but a great ride. Bring your popcorn and enjoy watching the dinosaurs go berserk.","13 out of 48 found this helpful.

I was worried it would have too many cheesy one-liners and one-dimensional, helpless, annoying characters but it does a good job of avoiding those weaknesses : the few jokes are well timed and actually funny and I found myself caring for most of the main protagonists. It's true that it is not particularly innovative compared to the previous trilogy : there are a lot of similarities between this film and 1993's Jurassic Park; some of them are clearly intentional and meant as a homage, which was kind of a nice touch I thought. If I had to complain, I would say that the director overused the famous close-up shot of a carnivore's head approaching and sniffing its human prey. And I would have preferred an R rating : there is remarkably very few blood for a movie about giants beasts tearing humans into pieces ! 8/10","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

The genre is kind of fantasy, but there are also horror elements in this movie. At first, Jurassic world give people dreams and fun. But one accident happened and situation changes from peace to dangerous dramatically. A lot of people are killed, and those scene is hard to watch for me, but I like the reality of this movie. Human dreams to control dinosaurs and get the technology to do it. However, in the last everyone realize that human and dinosaurs cannot live together. While the story is going there are friendship between human and dinosaurs, but everything is changed at the last of the movie. I think that is so real. This movie tells us the story with reality, but also tells us friendship and love, so I like this movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Legendary director Steven Spielberg returned as executive director of Jurassic World so, it's an awesomeness.Movie starts with a family scene and their two children going a trip to Jurassic World on Isla Nublar where their aunty in charge. After that Claire Dearing says ""Welcome To Jurassic World"" as John Hammond said ""Welcome To Jurassic Park"" in 1993 but Claire's one not even close to that Park's majestic scene. Owen Grady who's the badass character of Jurassic world had lot of time stunning & running.Overall the movie has fantastic CGI and story line. There are lot of thrilling scenes with Indominus Rex which is a hybrid monstrous Dinosaur actually it's the first time world saw a hybrid Dino. Some people don't like they introduced hybrids to Jurassic franchise but I think it's good.I love how they made a fight between our Jurassic Park Rexy and Indominus Rex it worked out very well. Also wanna mention that fan favourite Blue the Velociraptor helped Rexy to fight. But at last mossosaurus came and took IRex into the lagoon it was totally unexpected. So, don't care what others say, Jurassic World 2015 is a masterpiece!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

At the time this movie came out, I'd been waiting for it for fourteen years. These films were an obsession for me growing up, and the moment this film was announced, that obsession returned full force. My excitement was not dissimilar to the excitement that you'd see in your average four year old over- well, whatever it is that four year olds get wildly excited about. I've read the books, I own all the movies, I have an embarrassing number of Jurassic Park toys for a 22 year old. I bought my midnight premiere ticket the moment they were available. I asked off from work to see this months and months in advance; indeed, the moment I was hired for that job.Seeing this movie was wildly important to me.I have no problem seeing that a lot of how people feel about their favorite movies rests distinctly in the arms of nostalgia. I know this is often the case for me, and I can see it most clearly when I rewatch films I love and they don't quite make me feel the way they used to. I still love Jurassic Park. I love The Lost World, and, unlike many, I love Jurassic Park 3. They still, in many ways, make me feel the way I did when I was a child. In other ways, they've lost some of the magic. I think I've just gotten to know them too well to still feel small when watching.Enter Jurassic World.I know that its been some time since the film was released, but its taken me some time to work out my feelings. The very first trailer that was released, I was so excited that I cried, honest to God tears. When the first real clips of the Indominus Rex came to light, I cried again.Because it excited me. Because it made me feel so very small, the way the originals did.The night of the movie, I went with two friends who had never seen any of the Jurassic Park films. All they knew about the movie, they knew from me.I never had any doubts about how good this movie would be, and it lived up to all of my expectations, and more.There were many things I didn't like. I can't say I was wildly fond of the older brother. I can't say that I liked that Claire ended up with Owen by the end of the film. I don't like that the majority of the cast/characters are straight and white. There could have been more female characters. My complaints end there. While the CGI on the velociraptors is subpar, the Indominus is just as well done as the raptors are lacking, and there were very few moments where I was put off by the CGI. Practical is better, yes, but just not always do- able. The originals are a miracle in and of themselves, and this movie shouldn't be wholly judged to their standards.My feelings about this movie can best be summed up with a quote from the film itself, and a quote I felt very strongly about the moment I heard it, because it so aptly described the feeling I'd had about this franchise for years. ""Jurassic World exists to remind us how very small we are."" Watching this movie, I felt like a kid again, overwhelmed and afraid and loving every single second of it. Yes, some of the plot elements are absolutely wild, one hundred percent out there, ""how did they get the okay for this"" madness, but I love it. It's part of what makes it so fun. Within the film itself, it works. Whatever failings the characters have, this movie did, for me, the thing that was most important. It made me feel like a kid again. It made me feel wildly, incredibly small. I realized, from things I knew and from scenes in the trailers, just what was going to happen in the finale moments before it did, and I knew it was going to be absolutely absurd, and I started squealing in my seat and honestly crying because I was so excited. That finale alone was worth the entire film, and Claire is still one of my favorite characters. Her character progression and growth was a pleasant surprise, and my love for her increased tremendously in the buildup to the finale.I went back again the very next day to see this again, and it was just as much fun the second time around.This is not a perfect film. There's no such thing as a perfect film. But it did what a good Jurassic Park entry SHOULD do, and I don't think it was as lesson-less and shallow as many have made it out to be. I knew, going in, almost the entire plot just from guessing, and I'm almost certain that I have the next two films guessed, too, but it's a good movie. If you've still been holding off on seeing this, give it a chance. Let yourself be a kid again. Let Jurassic World remind you just how small we all are.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Is the fourth installment worth the wait? Yes, it is. It doesn't deliver a wonderful installment like ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" did earlier this summer, but it successfully revives the franchise and nearly returns it to the glories of the first film. The film is set on the theme park after 22 years of success. With attendance at a low point, frontrunner Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) introduces Indominus Rex: a genetically- engineered dinosaur hybrid containing the DNA of a number of difference species. Obviously, things go wrong, Rex escapes, and it's up to Claire and our hero Owen (Chris Pratt) to save Claire's two nephews and the rest of the visitors of the park while trying to contain the rogue dinosaur.The film succeeds mostly because it knows that it is a big-budget summer blockbuster. It has the common clichés: the dramatic kiss amongst the violence, the lackluster script, etc. These are mostly forgivable because of the dazzling special effects and the well-done action sequences. The more unforgivable problem is with the characters. It seems as though each is constructed to follow a recognizable trope. There's the unbeatable hero, the villain who wants the dinosaurs for military weapons, the teenager who appears dopey and completely against all adults, and the manager who is overly organized and focuses too heavily on her work. This causes issues because it makes our hero the only real lovable character. This is largely because of the always-great Chris Pratt. He gives the performance the film needs and does what he can with the script he is given. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his co-star, Howard. Despite Pratt's performance, the real stars of the film are the dinosaurs, especially the Indominus Rex. They are intricately designed and beautiful to see on screen. This is why the good outweighs the bad. The focus is on the dinosaurs, as it should be. That's where the spectacle lies. ""Jurassic World"" is not a better film than ""Jurassic Park,"" but it is definitely more fun, thrilling, and even terrifying. It encapsulates what an action-themed summer blockbuster should deliver. It's the type of film where you can turn your brain off for a bit, and enjoy the exciting ride. This franchise is back, and this installment does not disappoint.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

Considering it was a movie about jurassic beasts thirsty for blood, they did an excellent job making the dead people...well, dead. In other words, It was very graphic. I remember in the 2nd movie, a man gets ripped apart between two T-Rex's and you do see intestines. So for the realism of those movie, I give it two thumbs up!Moving on to Jurassic World, I watched this movie expecting a lot of people to die in gruesome ways because of the realistic theme the last two movies carried on. If you're a fan of realism, bloodshed and dismemberment, I'm sorry to say you don't get that in this movie. The Pros: Great acting, interesting story twist of a new hybrid dinosaur, danger, dinosaur fights, chaos, breath-holding suspense. excellent effects and CGI.The Cons: Scary scenes not fit for young ones (duh), not as graphic/bloody (personal preference).In conclusion, it's a great watch, but I don't believe it fits into the scary, suspenseful theme the past Jurassic Park movies created.","21 out of 45 found this helpful.

While it was good, it really was not anything new...to me it was pretty much chock full of things we had already seen before with the exception of a cool working park that I kind of wish we got to see more of before the chaos ensued. Do not get me wrong the chaos was awesome and I guess that in the end is why it is doing so well. A kid is going to absolutely love a flick like this...I know I would have as a child. I just wish they had some more interesting human characters. Basically, I say bravo to the dinosaurs they did what they needed to. I just felt the human characters were a bit underwhelming, the poor dinosaurs had to take up to much slack.The story has us arriving at a fully functional dinosaur park. A couple of boys are going there to meet their aunt who is quite high up on the ladder in the park. She is so busy she pretty much pawns them off on a poor woman who really got a bit more done to her than she really deserved (I would have liked to see what happened to her, happen to D'Onofrio's character). Meanwhile, the aunt is pitching a new dinosaur as they want to wow the people so why not make a bigger more ferocious dinosaur. While this is going on, a man is attempting to train Raptors. He is asked to inspect this new dinosaur and it isn't too long before things get out of control and the new attraction is running rampant in the park! The dinosaurs are awesome and it was totally cool to see the one in the water. Not sure why they felt the need to make anything else as I would love to go to the park just to see that one in the water. The problem is other than Bryce Dallas Howard's character, no one else was really that good. Pratt was awesome in Guardians of the Galaxy did his best Mark Walhberg impersonation in this one. D'Onofrio was over the top annoying, the two kids weren't bad, but I thought the whole divorce subplot pointless. Only a very small number of the human's jokes worked for me, most felt flat. The human element just did not even compare to the dinosaur one. It was not terrible, just not great at all.Overall, the movie was good. The dinosaurs were awesome, the mayhem was awesome and the dinosaur fights were cool. I also applaud them for the amount of deaths they showed on screen. One of the things I hated about Lost World was that nearly every death was off screen while here we get to see em chomped! The movie could have been better if say Pratt was more like Guardians and less like a rock and some of the other characters were given more to work with, but the dinosaurs take up the slack and make this a very fun film.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

I think in this movie they didn't even try to make any proper plot. It is mainly based on special effects which in some parts look like screen behind the actor (like in old movies). These productions are underestimating the audience and recently there has been coming only garbage from Hollywood. Have they really run out of ideas or are they just lazy to do proper movies anymore?

It's about a new theme park that finally realized John Hammond's dream of a dinosaur zoo; but because its now been open a while people are starting to get bored and so they create a new dinosaur mixing various DNA.Now let's start off with the good stuff. The world building is amazing, you go round this theme park and you believe this could be a real attraction, the way they show off buildings and exhibits its like a Disneyland promotional video so I really liked that. The whole look of Jurassic World was just really nice visually. Another thing I enjoyed was the new dinosaur itself, called Indominus Rex; it looked powerful, creepy and threatening every time you saw it; its abilities were also interesting and so it was great addition to the franchise and it contributes to my most favourite part of the film which was the third act - a real gem of a sequence in there. Of course, Jurassic World is a sequel and it knows it; although there were only a few references to the first film in the dialogue, and something special which I won't spoil, most of it's callbacks were through the music which sounded awesome. The soundtrack fits so well in the franchise its amazing, some of the beats, some of the instruments definitely were inspired to not only Jurassic Park but I think I heard The Lost World in there also which was fun. But the callbacks didn't stop there, which brings me to the negatives...Jurassic Park had a lot of iconic scenes and in Jurassic World it recreated one or two which gave you some nostalgia and you smiled at the obvious reference, but then it did it again, and then some more and it started to teeter on the edge of ripping-off; thankfully I don't think it did but I did have quite few moments where I noticed and was like ""Wait, that looks just like..."". So if you haven't seen the first film or not seen it in a long time, you might feel out of the loop when the shot builds to something you know should be important. Another thing that I wasn't a fan of was that there was too many characters; this film is flooded with various characters who all have their own back-story and B plot that it sometimes drags away from the main thing; the two kids for instance were given a line of back-story which was never touched upon again and the human antagonists were basically there to leave strands for a sequel. There was just a lot of unnecessary story.In the end, Jurassic World is a fun film. It's entertaining to watch but it just doesn't have the charm and wit of Jurassic Park, it tends to fall more into monster-movie somewhat which is fine, but just so long as you expect a cliché or two and some very cheesy scenes (such as catching a fly in mid air with your hand).

Maybe I'm just a boring sceptic or maybe I just expect more from Hollywood and wish it would get back it's golden days (the 90s in my opinion) sooner rather than later. But last night, I thought I'd give this one a shot (mainly because I had a nostalgic craving for man eating dinosaurs feasting on stupid people) and I have to say it was worth it because I left the cinema feeling pleasantly surprised which to be honest, is all I really wanted from this movie.As the movie began with the introduction of the clichéd, vomit inducing suburban family, I feared the worst but after the first ten minutes when that awe inspiring theme tune started up as the camera pans over this all new ultra modern but inevitably doomed park, I couldn't help myself but feel like a little kid again watching the scene from the first movie when you first see the island in all it's mysterious glory. For the next two hours, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The dinosaurs look fantastic, the clichéd characters grew on me, (even the kids, but I mean, what's a Jurassic Park movie without annoying children?) the plot was predictable yet satisfactory even if some scenes did make me roll my eyes and left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth (is it just me or did anyone else almost expect the T-Rex and the raptor to shake hands after tag teaming the Indominus Rex?) and most of all, the battles between the dinosaurs were incredibly well choreographed and were definitely the highlight for me mainly because they returned everyone's favourite man eating monster to it's former glory after it was disgracefully humiliated in that god awful JP3.So all in all, aside from the forced romances, cheesy scenes, too many one liners, half assed character development and lack of Jeff Goldblum, I think it was a great way to spend two hours, particularly if you watch it without comparing it too much to the first two movies. I give it a solid 7/10.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

An spectacular specie of remake/tribute/sequel of the original JP.You can tell the vision of the director and also how much of a fun time he must have had while filming the movie. It has also a pretty 90s feeling to it (a la Mad Max Fury Road), a lot clichés and exaggerated situations that seems to go back a few decades ago but done in such self-aware way and in such a cool one also that the final product ends up being top notch. The movie is also full of all kind of references to the first movie.Bryce Dallas Howard is a goddess and Chris Pratt a really charismatic guy. Also Michael Giacchino makes epical use of the old classical themes of the saga as well as introducing a new one that even though is not as good as the old ones it fits really well (but it is strangely pretty similar to one of the main musical pieces of the Italian movie ""Life is Beautiful"").In any case the movie is not free from some problems with it script but luckily those problems are not strong enough to be able to make the return of the park an entertaining as hell ride in its entire dimension.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The movie may not be as thrilling as the Jurassic Park, but it does fill excitement and joy among the viewers through its dark humor. The primary difference between the original movie and this sequel is that this time the park has been named Jurassic World. The visitors of the park come across in the first scene a 56-foot-long dinosaur who comes out of water and eats a giant shark. The movie features special effects that are utterly breathtaking. The action scenes in the movie are also very engaging and remind a person about movie 'Jaws'. For the whole time, the movie kept me at the edge of my seat. Although movies on such subject have been released before too, but this is some fresh content after so many years. This cannot be considered as another stupid summer movie, even though it features dinosaurs fighting. On the brighter side, the movie has swiftly shown the relationship of people with the animals. There are also some clever jabs showing how the people will do anything in order to get fame. Although like before some parts of Jurassic World are also predictable and even silly, yet this movie is so far rated as the best, exciting and thrilling summer movie. The movie will not let its viewers leap out of their seats and will let them enjoy 2 hours of extreme action and entertainment.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

This is an exciting, awe inspiring and most of all a FUN film. I thought it was the closest film to the first in terms of exhilaration. It actually reminded me of the original a few times, which is a great honour. Finally, if there was one thing that annoyed me it was the product placement. I saw so many obvious plants that it started to be an overt ad for coke, mercedes, verizon, samsung and others. But then it made me think about what was going on in the park in the film. They too were having trouble with corporate sponsors. So maybe the product placement was a cute way of implying that all art or science is inevitably valued only by its monetary worth.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Spielberg's classic Jurassic Park instilled in us a sense of wonder, excitement, and for some of us nightmares as the monsters devoured our cast. Following that, the series hit some rough patches that while visually impressive, lacked the quality the first one did. After a fourteen year hiatus, a fourth installment has finally emerged from the primordial soup to bring us back into the adventure. Tonight I review Jurassic World, so let's jump into the excitement and see if it lives up to hype. Jurassic World reintroduces the park, which has been upgraded with the latest toys of the modern era. This installment brings us back into the excitement of the park, as you become part of the crowd and experiencing the exhibits first hand. Stunning CGI visuals have once more brought the prehistoric monsters to life, animated beautifully to parade about the park. While not as realistic in terms of textures as the animatronic cousins from the 90's, this reviewer was impressed at the detail they put into making Jurassic World pop off the screen. You've seen most of the magic unfold already on the trailers, but trust me that there is still plenty of sights to behold on the big screen. Seeing the Mosasaur leap out of the water, or watching the terrifying Indominus Rex storm across the fields, the terror you felt back in the day returns with it. When combined with the special effects and sound editing, the scenes are even more thrilling and immersive, so much that you forget you are even watching a movie. The visuals aren't the only thing that will have you reminiscing back to the original trilogy though. No my friends there are plenty of tributes paid in Jurassic World that had me smiling in delight. It's obvious the design team went back to the roots to craft this adventure, (finally), and managed to pull some of the best qualities from World's predecessors, such as locations, kills, and plot elements, and put a new twist on them. Most of the twists often have are involve action, exciting moments where the orchestra's melodies booming over speakers as our heroes strive to survive. Yes, you read right, Jurassic World is certainly not boring or slow, with almost the entire two hours thrilling in some aspect. And believe it or not the filming and editing itself is on target as well. Camera work is stable, all details captured to maximize the carnage and chaos of the digital images while also capturing the emotions of our group. While most of the movie is action, don't think that is the only thing you will get in this movie. Amidst the excitement are plenty of touching, emotionally heavy moments that are sure to move you in some way. Some of the scenes involving the dinosaurs and Chris Pratt's character had me almost tearing up, while other times I rolled my eyes at the preachy messages they painstakingly made. Fortunately there is humor thrown into the mix that had me laughing more times than not. Most of the comedy was intentional, some of the dialog timed at just the right moment to break the tension. Some of the jokes were a little pushed on me, but I must say that overall it works, especially with Pratt leading the group in his dynamic ways. The emotional spectrum is well done in this film, and goes back to all the aspects of the first one you love. Like always though there are some pieces to this movie that aren't all there. First off the build up in the park wasn't there for me in the film. Normally there is an epic buildup to the inevitable dinosaur busting out to hunt, but this film didn't have quite that much thrill that I was looking for. Things progressed too fast before the crap hit the fan, it did leave me a little disappointed. That minor point aside there are times where the ridiculousness of Jurassic World gets stretched a bit much, and no I don't mean the raptor training bit that actually worked. Sure this is a movie where dinosaurs are no longer extinct, but there are a few moments that are a little too stretched or hard to swallow, but again this is a minor moment. The major weakness to this movie is how predictable it is. World's plot writing team really laid out the plot of this movie in the first half hour such as: who would die, how they would die, and how the problem would resolve itself. Thus you can guess I wasn't too terrified or surprised by most of the moments in this movie, though there were some nice surprises. I don't think this will be a problem for most, but this reviewer has to dock some points for this weakness. Jurassic Word is on point as my friend would say, and is a great reintroduction into Crichton's world. That excitement you felt visiting the park returns once more, and despite the lack of suspense build up, the tale has a much better story than I expected. It certainly is one of the Action/Adventure movies I've seen in a while, and the visual effects are certainly worthy of a big screen visit. Do you see it in 3-D? I can't answer what it did for the movie, but the 2-D movie was certainly great. So my recommendation is go see it soon. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Stupid and delusional characters (all of them) 2. Worried Parents 3. Parents getting divorced and kid is emotional about it. 4. Family member (Aunt) is to busy at work to look after kids5. Incompetent Baby sitter 6. Kids runs away from Baby sitter, and baby sitter doesn't notify anyone. (yeah they will be alright on an island with Dinosaurs) 7.Military guy wants Dinosaurs to be used as weapons 8. Scientist create a new specie, knowing what it is capable of doing, and doesn't tell any one. 9. The hero and the Aunt had a bad date 10. Worst time calling. 11. All super smart scientist in the base with ability to ""Track"" a dinosaur in LIVE TIME!!! just assume that it escaped its containment. Allowing the Super Smart to Dinosaur to escape its containment on their mistake. 12. We are prepared for this situation. No need to alarm the visitors. 13. Instead of killing and taking this issue seriously lets try and capture it with TASERS!!! A dinosaur that can camouflage, THINK, take out its own tracker! decrease its Thermal heat as to avoid any tracking. YES!!! A Dinosaur that set up its own escape!! SHOULD EASILY BE CAUGHT USING TASERS AND 6 MEN. 14. Raptors are dogs?!! NO!! They are extremely dangerous Hunting Dinosaurs. CAN NOT BE TRAINED! 15. 2 kids manage to bring a 22 year old abandoned jeep back to life! Yep, the Battery didn't die and we all know that fuel can last 22 years. 16. There was only 1 helicopter pilot in the whole Island! Luckily the owner of the park (Simone Masrani) is just about to get his pilot license17. The owner of the park, who doesn't care for profits and is doing it purely for the mankind employees Claire, who is complete opposite and sees this as only a profit making business and doesn't care for the dinosaurs. WHY??!! They have two very clearly different Ideologies 18. Lets free the Raptors to search for this killing dinosaur. Why the rap-tors straight away just don't jump the other humans is simply stupid. Only Owen is their ""Alpha"" When he has hands in the air, and they some what familiar with Berry, But all of the rest of the humans are Mercenaries that just arrived on the island, there is no connection between them and the Raptors. 19. Indominus Rex is also part Raptor so he talks to the Raptors gang and their go after the humans. 20... Lets Skip a few the Raptor gang instead of killing Owen and the human, remember him and show emotion and so try and defend him. 21. With over 20,000 people on the island, Lets release T-REX as well, after all Dinosaurs can sense when some one is in danger and so can. help humans instead of simply just eating them. 22. T-REX and Raptor ""BLUE' actually the most likable character aside from Chris's Owen, join forces to take down this bad boy. 23. Parents are holding hands (not getting a divorce) 24. The Hero gets the girl.This list can be endless, but i feel like you get the picture.","20 out of 43 found this helpful.

It introduces some new dinosaur hybrids which are cool as well as it features some of the classic dinosaurs that we are familiar with.The characters are likable and entertaining. I like the protagonists Owen and Claire and Claire's two nephews Zach and Gray. Our four main characters had good chemistry and you care for them when they are in dangerous situations.I think Colin Trevorrow did a good job directing. It is visually impressive and the special effects are quite well done. It has some intense moments and I absolutely loved the final scene. I like the references and connections that it had with the first film.However, I had a few problems with the film. One of them is the storyline. The story is a bit thin and too much of a repeat of the first film. Another problem that I had is the acting. While the acting is not bad, it was a bit uneven at times. Also, I think the comedic moments, while clever, could have been funnier.Overall, I enjoyed Jurassic World and would pick it any day over ""Jurassic Park III"". I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Jurassic Park and/or dinosaur in general.In the end, ""Jurassic World"" may not be the perfect follow-up to Jurassic Park and it may have needed more work in the story department, but it is a fun (and albeit nostalgic) thrill ride that should satisfy blockbuster goers.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

For a start the story completely ignores Lost World and Jurassic Park 3, which is good, every film deserves a change in ideas, but in my opinion it would of been great to stick to the third and Lost World, but that being said in my opinion Jurassic World is a big improvement and is a lot better than any other Jurassic Park movie. So here is one downside in the movie, they kept forcing family issues and romance that is not needed whatsoever in a Jurassic type film, it's all about the dinosaurs, that's what people came to see. That being said the film was very cleverly done, with big improvements in special effects and the personalities of the characters as well compared to Jurassic Park 3, at least. The acting was very well done as well, and most characters had good stories behind them and their emotions in the film was perfect. One last thing to add is Chris Pratt did an amazing job in the film, and probably one of the main reasons to see the movie in the first place.Overall: The Film was good, and I believe it's worth seeing, enjoy the film :)","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

All things considered for a 4th installment, it was highly entertaining and it held true to the original franchise. I wasn't sure what to expect going in but I came out so satisfied! First off, they did pay homage to the original animatronics in some scenes. The original animatronic artist didn't return, but some new guy did a pretty good job. When it comes to movie making I believe in traditional means-- having REAL THINGS ON CAMERA. It allows the actors to actually react to something instead of pretending in front of a green screen. It also lets the audience buy into the story. Although, I was disappointed because I know they could have used it more, so shame on them. They didn't totally sellout into CG like Peter Jackson, but they could have done better. After watching the 4th, I went back and watched the original Jurassic Park and the animatronics still look SO GOOD. I just wish the Jurassic World crew would have taken advantage of the opportunity. Next, the raptors. Always man, always with the raptors haha. This movie kept the original respect for the raptors in good taste (because they were allegedly so smart, even though we really have no scientific idea haha). Anyhow, the raptors were more of actual characters than just monsters in this one. I admired the twist. The raptor movement has improved substantially since the original, it was less jerky and awkward looking. But that is also because they were using CG.Now, Chris Pratt was a swell fit for the comedic relief; there is one character in every movie for that. I did miss Dr. Malcolm though. But they were able to take the idea of a Jurassic Park a step further and ACTUALLY HAVE A FUNCTIONAL PARK haha. So it allows you to see a side of the plot that never existed in the first three.As far as the plot goes, obviously its just a bunch of people running from dinosaurs, but they still captured the original terror of it all, ya know? I mean Jurassic Park was frightening as a kid, and this movie kinda threw me back into my childhood of imaginative horror. I used to be afraid that freaking T-Rex was gonna tear threw my wall and eat my family. If you are, or ever were a fan of Jurassic Park, this is a must see. If not, it is still worth the sheer entertainment of Man vs Beast. Nature finds a way...PS I can't wait for a Jurassic movie in 4D, where they let people onto Isla Nubar and see if they can survive for 2 hours. :)","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

The aboriginal Jurassic Park certainly came with its own unique thrills. The Jurassic World not only revives the franchise, but also packs some punches on its own.The most enjoyable part for me, and a lot of others I talked to, was the 3D rendition. It jerked us off our seats more than a couple of times. The dinos were impeccably animated, and all in all, it was worth the trip to the cinema! However, the movie certainly had us arching our brows a few times as well. Fair warning, this movie build up on the previous installments, so do your revision before hitting the cinemas. I was highly skeptic of the lead cast, but they did not disappoint as much as the erotic plot. Come to think it it, it felt more of a dinosaur chase in a video game than a movie.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

The only weak point I find in this area would be the set of the I.Rex holding pen. No electrified fences on top, no extra security, no armed guards, no observation cameras, just a single (very low) and clearly rather weak concrete wall. The movie leaves you with a total feeling of emptiness at its conclusion. Even J.W's epic ""There it is"" arrival to the island theme is clumsily thrown in at a point where it makes no sense. No tension, no build up, just a pretty facade of a movie with random action sequences thrown in. More thought was put into creating the fake park website then the script and on conceiving an at least borderline believable plot.","18 out of 38 found this helpful.

I hope this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the dinosaurs are attacking aliens.

The script and screenplay give way to ever more impressive special effects; but as much as the effects are important, all they should be are the roof to an otherwise sturdy house.

The characters couldn't be more stereotyped if they tried.I got the feeling that Mr Pratt twigged to the fact that this was based on a poor screenplay and therefore did an amazing job at underplaying his role (as much as the director did try and set him up with such clichéd scenes); my hat goes off to him (genuinely).

It was supposed to be new, improved, and most importantly safe. That all went south when the staff tried to do God's work and genetically mix one of the two most vicious dinosaurs out there, the t-rex and velociraptor. Many people drift away from remakes of original movies claiming,"" It won't be the same"" and never giving it a chance. This movie may surprise you and make you rethink your assumptions on future remakes. Throughout the movie there are loads of adventures, love interests, and relationships. Your attention will not be lost.The movie presents the audience with many connections, grasping their attention. The film can intrigue anyone who is into romance, comedy, or action having diverse viewers. Relationships such as the two brothers, Owen and Claire, and primarily with Owen and a velociraptor named Blue. They have a bond like no other and it proves that it is possible to have that trust with a dinosaur. Their ""relationship"" is put to the test multiple times throughout the film and even ends with Blue saving Owen and his friends. They are very protective of each other and it shows the love created between man and dinosaur. In one part of the film the velociraptors are being ordered by the genetically modified dinosaur to attack the soldiers who got in their way. Owen happened to be there and Blue was almost going to follow his instincts and attack, but she realized who it was. She runs away, saving Owen. The audience will create an attachment to these characters and follow their relationship throughout the film.People that see the original series of movies, shows, etc tend to steer away from remakes or add-ons thinking they won't be as enjoyable, but if you gave them a chance it could surprise you. For example, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, etc came out continuing the series from 1977-2005. Many die-hard fans were reluctant about seeing the new releases, but after watching, they were proven wrong. This was because there were many reviews liking the film such as Rotten tomatoes, IMDB, and Common Sense Media, showing that Jurassic World did a good job of proving that remakes and spin-offs can be just as good as the ""classics"". The movie even included a snippet talking about Jurassic park and the tragedy it reflected, creating a sort of reminiscing moment for the fans of the original trilogy. This film can help rethink your choice on trying out spin off films because you may like them just as much or even more! The audience of all ages would enjoy this action packed, love/hate relationship filled movie.Jurassic World is an adventure-lover's dream come true. It is action packed and will keep you on your toes of what's going to happen next. It is unpredictable what anyone will do, especially pertaining to the dinosaurs. Even if someone hasn't seen the originals, they will truly understand what's going on and thoroughly enjoy it.Works CitedJurassic World.

I love it!!!Of course I will always prefer the first movie of this series to any other, but this is a very worthy successor. Despite being similar to Jurassic Park to the point of nostalgia, the movie has its very own feel, yet we all recognise that same ""jurassic"" feeling that runs through all of the films of this amazing series :DAt first I wasn't too sure about the characters, because only one of them was actually the ""adventurer"" type, however we must recall that in the first film there were also a couple of very non-adventure-type characters, and that was what made the mix on the social scene so very interesting. Jurassic World possibly even increases this effect, with me as a viewer beginning to wonder when all the ""jurassic action"" is going to start taking place, it just all seems so secure, the way people are living their lives and worrying about the most trivial of things, thinking themselves so important and in control... and then of course all hell breaks loose, as it always does when the dinosaurs get out of their cages ;) Illusionary bubble of control and superiority gets thrown right out the window!I like how they've also shown a glimpse of the future of theme parks, with very futuristic-style scenery that make for a very nice contrast with the wildness of the actual island :) It also involves the theme of genetic manipulation, which notably was already present in Jurassic Park but got pushed to the sidelines in the other 2 sequels, but this film just takes up that concept again and does something entirely new and even more frightening with it!I very much like how this film actually uses the velociraptors, whose intelligence actually played a much bigger part in the original novel than it did in the original film, to their full potential! Cause what's truly scary is not just anything that's big and has sharp teeth, but the intelligence of the beast is also a very important factor... That's why you've always felt a raptor is scarier than a T-rex ;)I was expecting a bit of a rip-off, but I got an original reinterpretation of the first film, using the same old stuff we loved in that first film yet doing something new and interesting with it at the same time!!! Anyone who loved Jurassic Park should definitely see this!:D And anyone who thinks dinosaur films are old fashioned, should watch this first and then reconsider ;)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I just seen the movie Jurassic's world.In my opinion the movie was kind of sad but at the same time it was funny.The movie was a little sad because people got hurt.The movie was also funny because at one point the older brother was looking at the girls and the little brother was like just talk to them.This took place at Jurassic's world in 2015.the main characters were Owen,Claire,Zach and Gray.In my opinion Chris Pratt did an outstanding job when it comes to playing his character Owen .Bryce Dallas Howard did a good job at playing her role Claire as well as the two boys Nick Robinson who played Zach and Ty Simpkins who played Gray. I give them all A+.My favorite part of the whole movie was when the two dinosaurs fought. My least favorite part is when some of the dinosaurs were found dead.I think the theme of the whole was to be yourself and don't change for nobody else and follow directions.I think some mature kids would like this movie.I would recommend this movie to people who like sy-fy stuff and non-fictional movies.I would not recommend to kids/people who are not mature.and people who don't like Syfy . The rating is PG-13.I think the movie was really good and I would watch it again. I give the movie a B- or 3 out of 5 stars.

Thanks to -------------- and the likes of Jurassic Park and world this idea has been brought to light and somewhat normalized. In this ""sequel"" to ""Jurassic World"" we are introduced to a new theme park built 22 years after the original ""Jurassic Park"" failed and introduces us to a new dinosaur that backfires horribly.Set 20 years after the original ""Jurassic Park"" a new theme park opens on the original site of the old park. When the parks visitors starts declining, the scientist think of a new genetically modified dinosaur to showcase but everything starts to backfire horribly. We focus on the storyline of Claire, Owen, and her two nephews Zach and Gray as they fight for survival,battle against dinosaurs and deal with the evil Hoskins The movie was absolutely amazing in my opinion. It had a bit of comedy, some thrill, action, and mainly(of course) scifi! I'm pretty sure for anyone that grew up on watching the original ""Jurassic Parks"" was hit with a wave of nostalgia watching ""Jurassic World"" and were probably even hit with more nostalgia with the little easter eggs from the movie.If you're a thrill seeker, into sci fi, enjoy action, or really love dinosaurs then I highly suggest going to see ""Jurassic World"". The pg-13 rating might be a bummer for some parents that were excited to go take their little ones to go see it but I think you should still go take kids to see it, there's only a tad bit of profanity and some gore every now and then. Overall, I give this movie a 8/10 rating and would highly recommend it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Of course, they remembered it as a really good movie that for a lot of people showed dinosaurs in a very realistic way, but nothing else. But now, in the times we are living, where everything is capable of turning itself into a franchise, Jurassic World arrived. When I was first going to see the movie with my family, we where expecting a bad movie which only attractive was to show dinosaurs in a more realistic way than 22 years ago. But it was a pleasant surprise to see that it wasn't that, it was actually a movie made by people who cared and putted all their effort into making it. The story is surprisingly good and the message the first one was telling, of men wanting to play god, is actually brought back and managed in an even stronger way. Some people could argue that it is even more entertaining than the first one, and it could be based on your preferences and what you want to see, because the first one has a more slow pace, while this one is quicker and has more things going on, on a much greater level. The dinosaurs still look amazing, the actors are really good and the kids aren't annoying. Overall, a great experience and a great movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's the first and only movie I'd ever seen in theaters twice, because it filled my childhood needs. The dinosaurs are outstanding, reviving the original velociraptors with a newer pattern, making up for the Jurassic Park III atrocity. All the characters are fun and serve their purpose, and every actor fit their role perfectly. The comedy even lands when it's included.

The fact that there were over 20,000 people (mainly tourists) on the island, there was no real 'owner/CEO' of the park, no clear protagonist worthy of this title, the hunky male lead, well who is he? He is generic looking, all I could think of was they plucked him from a Vegas strippers show for the role. His training antics! Please! There was no Business Contingency Plan when the park had dinosaur issues, the fact that no scientist monitored the clones dinosaurs they created! Finally... don't get me started on that White suit and high heals... with the addition of Red hair, the whole movie it made me think of that crazy witch Julia Gillard, the worst Australian Prime Minister ever, and how she stuffed up Australian Politics. Strange but true.","19 out of 41 found this helpful.

Hollywood's flood of reboots and remakes rarely capture the heart and quality of the original source, but Jurassic World stands out as one of the best. Chris Pratt's tough and lovable rogue, Owen Grady, brings the action. At the same time, Bryce Dallas Howard's high-stung and successful business executive, Claire Dearing, grows and develops from selfish career focus to respecting nature and valuing family. Every scene feels grandiose and epic, with a bigger park, bigger attractions, and bigger dinosaurs. The childlike wonder still shines through, with kids giddy at a dino petting zoo and crowds cheering as the Mosasaurus feeds on a great white shark. The scares are back, too, with deadlier predators and plenty of hapless park employees to hunt. While the Jurassic series has its ups and downs, Jurassic World is at its peak!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I would recommend this to somebody who likes Dinosaurs,Chris Pratt, Colin Trevorrow(Star Wars),Action, Adventure,Sci-Fi and is a big fan of Jurassic Park.The special effects were stunning.This movie was definitely Action- Packed.Jurassic World is the 4th highest-grossing film of all time and Jurassic Park 24th highest-grossing film of all time. Brothers Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gary (Ty Simpkins) go to this island to go see their aunt Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard),who happens to be the park's manager,Since Claire is a busy woman she assigns her assistant Zara (Katie McGrath)to escort them through the island but eventually ditch her. While exploring the island by themselves they get on a ride and enter a restricted area.The Indominus Rex comes and destroys their sphere but, their manage to escape.They go to this shack what use to be the Jurassic Park visitor center and repair this old jeep. While the boys are driving the car Claire and Owen ( Chris Pratt), a trainer and raptor expert helps Claire find the boys. Hoskins(Vincent D'Onofrio)( enemy of Jurassic World) wants to use Owen's dinosaurs and the Indominus Rex as military weapons. All the Actors and Actresses did a really good job.When my mom watched the movie she said that Claire doesn't get dirty with her dress but, I don't know what she means she gets messy.I just don't know how she survive that with heels the whole time?!I noticed something that I bet a lot of people didn't notice wouldn't notice. Claire calls Grey, Ty (the actor's real name)when they get off the truck. I also noticed that when Claire and Owen hide from the I. Rex Owen leaves his rifle by the truck , the dinosaur shakes the truck and his rifle is there unmoved. Claire picks up Zach's broken phone before that Zach put his phone in his pocket. Why is Claire's hair color always changing? This movie taught me not to mess with Mother Nature and don't control nature. Animals shouldn't be used as military weapons. Teamwork and bravery are also used.I would recommend this to somebody who likes Dinosaurs,Chris Pratt, Colin Trevorrow(Star Wars),Action, Adventure,Sci-Fi and a big fan of Jurassic Park. I would not recommend this to people who like horror, Western(although i don't know if thats still a thing) romance,comedy or princessy girls. The movie is rated PG-13 because the violence and language,but I think mature kids can watch it. I give it a 4 out of 5 .Overall the movie AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ugh! Not surprisingly, the second half just kept disappointing, although there was a good special effect here and there.Overall, it was just plain dumb and utterly ridiculous. Bad, really bad, like one of those low budget dinosaur ripoff movies but even worse because it dishonored the amazing original coming from the same family. It was like if Robert Deniro spawned Charles Manson as a son.The acting was horrible. The actors were not likable at all. The storyline and how it moved along was not realistic or believable. Horrible stuff.There were just so much wrong with this movie. I could list about a thousand problems but I would be giving too much away. Honestly, Spielberg is so done.

"9","/10","A MUST WATCH !! (preferably, in IMAX 3D, if you can !!)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5217118/?ref_=tt_urv","postsenthil","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37448787/?ref_=tt_urv","27 October 2019","Jurassic World directed by Colin Trevorrow is officially the fourth installment of the famous dino franchise that started in 1993 by the master auteur Steven Spielberg who had, in turn, adopted it from the best selling novel of sci-fi author Michael Chrichton. When Spielberg presented his pioneering movie, as an adventure 65 million years in the making, it proved to be a defining moment in movie history - an early triumph of movie magic concocted from CGI and animatronics wizardry - which redefined the possibilities and consequently, the paradigm of popular cinema. It left a firm imprint (a la T-Rex's footprint) on the minds of its viewers like me with its vivid imagery - be it the tiny ripples in the water accompanied by the thuds of the approaching creature, the chilling chase sequence of T Rex hounding a speeding jeep, the nail biter of a pantry sequence involving the two kids and a bunch of raptors as well as the sequence where kids trapped in the car are confronted by the mighty T Rex in a rampaging mode.However, as with most such mega movies, the franchise soon became a victim of its own momentous success. Dino movies, just like their dinosaurs, soon got relegated to a prehistoric era in the minds of the movie goers as subsequent summer blockbusters have continued to grow and hone their CGI wizardry to create bigger, meaner and scarier monsters which pile up the scale of mayhem with each passing year. However, the enduring value of the original movie was reinforced when Universal Studios released the reworked 3D version of Jurassic Park in 2013 to mark the twentieth anniversary of its release which proved successful across the globe.The present movie is set in Isla Nublar after 22 years from the timeline of the the first movie and ignores the story arcs of its sub-par sequels (1994 by Spielberg and 2001 by Joe Johnston). John Hammond's dream is finally a reality with his successor Mesrani (Irrfan Khan) having set up a hugely popular, luxury dino theme park called Jurassic World spanning the entire island of Isla Nublar. The park is headed by a control seeking, very formal - ""I am all business"" - park manager, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is an ex-navy officer-cum-animal expert, working in the park and is involved in a study on training velociraptors. As the movie opens, Claire is forced to play host to her school going nephews, Zach and Gray, who are sent by their parents for a fun weekend while they consider an impending divorce.The park itself has been a successful venture for several years now with steady growth of visitors from across the world. The influx of the visitors is spiked periodically by introducing a new species every few years to sustain the waning interests. The tourists' fatigue of older attractions is succinctly captured in a sequence where Zach, in his observatory, prefers to remain glued to his smart phone and ignores a T-Rex (no less), quite literally, devouring a scapegoat (a key element in the first movie). So, when mother nature is incapable of dishing out attractions that could sustain such volatile attention spans, the corporation running Jurassic World decides to take matters in its own hands to bolster the sagging growth curve of footfalls in the park. They cook up a new dino attraction - read bigger, louder, smarter dinosaur with more teeth - called Indominus rex, by concocting a genetic cocktail of DNA sourced from multiple dinosaurs and other species. Predictably, as dictated by the template of such genre movies, the dino escapes its confinement to go on a killing frenzy, unleashing mayhem on the unsuspecting tourists as well as other dinosaurs.
Off the cast, Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) continues to charm with his performance and one gets a feeling that he might well be the right guy for an Indiana Jones reboot. He shares an interesting chemistry with Howard who is competent and brings in the necessary intensity in the second half. The rest of the cast including Irrfan and the two kids are merely for functional aspects - to stage an action sequence, mouth something vaguely philosophical or become feast for the predators - with limited scope to perform as is the norm in such monster movies.Director Colin Trevorrow who had impressed with his indie time travel comedy, Safety Not Guaranteed, on his debut, is filling some VERY BIG shoes for his second feature and has managed to ace his first try at the summer blockbuster genre. Trevorrow's execution manifests his brilliance in marshaling the resources at hand to craft a sure-fire winner that packs in the right dose of spectacle to shock and awe the viewers. He stages the action sequences with commendable clarity and fluid camera work which herald him as a maker who is confident of his craft and can leave his mark despite several imprints of Spielberg (Executive Producer here) that permeate the movie. Trevorrow also doffs his hat at Spielberg's original as well as earlier works more than once as in the case of using Mr. DNA animation, statue of Hammond, using the dilapidated site of the earlier park to stage an action sequence or even in the spectacular sequence of feeding a great white shark to an aquatic dinosaur (Mosasaurus).Besides being the big bang blockbuster, Trevorrow and his co-writers supplement the regular fare of faulting human hubris in playing God to include multiple elements of self-referencing all through the movie by flagging the never-ending saga of our times - the interplay of consumerism and capitalism wherein we, the consumers (even as audiences) are constantly seeking the next BIGGER, BETTER experience and the capitalists seeking to continuously stoke this innate, insatiable instincts of the consumer and milk the same for more and more moolah.On the flip side, the movie could be definitely held guilty for doing such self referencing a tad too much as well as for playing up the ancient gender archetypes, multitude of conspicuous product placements and some pretty hollow characterisations. Yet, it redeems itself by delivering solidly on its promise of bringing the scares through BIGGER, LOUDER & MORE TEETH which translates into popcorn munching fun, fear and wonderment. While clearly not surpassing Spielberg's original, Trevorrow's energetic movie is mighty successful in replicating much of the awe and is clearly a worthy successor that ups the benchmark of spectacle value for future movies which could well make it the biggest winner of this summer.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But the public's waning interest sees the park's scientists (still headed up by BD Wong!) go to questionable lengths to keep them entertained - a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur bigger and more deadly than anything the park has handled before.It's hard to believe this is the director's second only feature length film and you can see why Steven Spielberg selected him personally. It's as though you're on a theme park ride for the full two hours, which goes by in a flash of teeth, technology and rain soaked forages through the undergrowth.Chris Pratt is intensely likeable as the rebooted Sam Neill of the piece, connecting audiences to the new story's backbone, the struggle to help the paying public (and the park's investors) understand that these once mythological creatures, now relegated to ordinary zoo attractions, are real animals in need of proper care and capable of heinous acts if they don't receive that care.Jurassic World is a 21st century big budget family action film to rival the best.
The new generation will be just as thrilled and enraptured as original fans were more than 20 years ago and us originals will appreciate the return of John Williams' theme and the raptors as the stars of the show.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Rather than go a route where they could've been progressive by including a black or woman hero, they choose to perpetuate the idea that white men are saviors, while women are useless damsels.On top of that, it's obvious that the filmmakers love watching females suffer. Why else would they include the graphic death of a shrewd woman getting her ""comeuppance""? And not only that, why is it played for laughs? It's because the sexist filmmakers seem to have it in their heads that shrewd woman deserve to die.Truly just a disgusting, sexist propaganda piece.","22 out of 49 found this helpful.

The visuals are great and the cast is brilliant. Chris Pratt continues to outdo himself. The plot focuses on a new hybrid dinosaur revealed at Jurassic World. Disaster strikes when it escapes and Chris Pratt is forced to capture him. It sounds like any old movie of hunt and kill but it weirdly grows on you.

The makers of this movie have applied the formula competently; the actors all do their jobs; and the CGI is suitably real looking -- so the movie works reasonably well. It was particularly interesting to jump ahead a generation to see how the ""park"" developed into a ""world"". Forgive me...but isn't this idea of ""Jurassic World"" really sad? The disneyfication of a natural wonder: yuck to that. I suppose this reflects what's really happening though. Art copies life copies art. We flock to the movie just like the crowds flock to the dinosaur island. I suppose the hope is that the money-generating theme parks in Florida will get another generation of eager visitors.The wonder of this franchise is definitely gone for me. Whatever happened to the genuine wonder we all felt about dinosaurs? Is it right for these people to capitalise on that? And then exploit it in film after bloated film?There just wasn't anything that new and exciting about this movie. OK, except for Chris Pratt. Stroke of genius casting him and developing the character to suit his personality. He singlehandedly raises this movie from a 7 to an 8. He is the new Harrison Ford, except even easier on the eyes.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

""Jurassic World"" is a constant roller coaster of action. There are several that I particularly enjoyed about this film. First of all, the world itself! What I really liked about this movie is that it actually shows you the whole amazing Jurassic World. It shows you all of the major attractions of this incredible looking park along with even more incredible various creatures inhabiting it. The dinosaurs look insane! I don't think they could get any more realistic and terrifying. Secondly, the cinematography. The film is beautifully shot; each scene is like a vibrant, dynamic and a lot of times terrifying painting. I certainly did not except this movie to be so brutal and sometimes legitimately scary, but I loved that about it. The way the shot is used to build up the suspense is very well done. Acting is fine, nothing too special. Chris Pratt is cool, but he is basically playing Star Lord from ""GOG"". Humor in the film was pretty good, sometimes a little silly, but still funny. The parts with Jake Johnson (Nick from ""New Girl"") were really funny.

"8","/10","My review of ""Jurassic World"" (2015), with Bryce Dallas HowAreYaDarling","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3258591/?ref_=tt_urv","ericrnolan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52622160/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2015","""Jurassic World"" (2015) was raptortastic and T-Rexific. It was also fun in another way, but I can't think of a pun for ""Indominus Rex."" I'd give it an 8 out of 10.Seriously — this was a fun monster movie. (I, for one, maintain that these are horror-sci-fi movies at heart, and not the family adventure films that others seem to take them for. Even the theme music for this entire franchise seems to insist that a zippity good time was had by all, after dinosaurs devour adults and traumatize lost children.)The kid in me thrilled to this movie's great outstanding special effects and abundance of monsters. Those raptors are the coolest movie monsters since Aliens and Predators.The action sequences were wonderful. Did anyone else think the initial attack/ambush was an homage to the initial attack/ambush in ""Aliens"" (1986)? They have the heart rate monitors and helmet-cams and everything. I kept waiting for Corporal Hicks to yell, ""DRAKE, WE ARE LEAVING!!!""The aerial attack by the winged dinosaurs was outstanding. (I don't know the difference between pterodactyls and pteranodons. Besides, one of them looked like it had a T-Rex head, and I'm not sure that was even was a thing.) The plight of one plucked victim was pretty damn creative and horrifying — I think that entire sequence was an example of some pretty inspired horror filmmaking.And all of those things are good, because I honestly don't think this film has much going for it without them. This really is  pretty much the same story as ""Jurassic Park"" (1993).Smart people do stupid things. I got a ""C"" in biology freshman year, but even a guy like me immediately doubts the wisdom of the Raptor Recruiting Plan. I also have no military experience, but I know what ""cover"" is, and I know what a ""kill zone"" is, and I wouldn't rush from the former to stand stationary in the latter.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas HowAboutADrinkLater are both very good actors; this movie's script has them rattling off humorous lines that are typical of a mediocre sitcom. The character concept for Pratt's hunky-extreme-sportsman-naturalist raptor-whisperer is kind of silly. Bryce Dallas HowDoYouJustKeepGettingPrettier plays another stock character — the two-dimensional uptight corporate princess who needs to be taken down a notch. Their banter is like the dialogue of a lackluster episode of ""Friends,"" and it insults the viewers' intelligence.The movie's two most interesting characters are the two young brothers. Their dialogue was actually touching — this movie would be far better it had focused almost entirely on them. (And, yes, that is young Ty Simpkins from ""Insidious."")I keep seeing articles on the Internet alleging that the technology depicted by these movies will soon be possible, but I pretty much don't believe anything I read on the net anymore. Because I totally bought into that Mars One fiasco, and now I feel like an idjit.","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

Following the almost perfect Jurassic Park(1993), the good ­ The lost World: Jurassic park(1997) and the alright but worst of the series Jurassic Park III(2001). Right off the bat, this movie is great! This is the definition of summer fun. I think that if you view this movie as a monster movie, you will have an immense fun with it. All from the world building of this movie to the great performance given by Chris Pratt I think that hands down the best sequel we have gotten since the original Jurassic Park. It's also a great family movie that everyone will enjoy. Definitely check this movie out, you will not regret it! The park is finally opened!

When I first saw the beginning of the movie interesting because I love action movies some scenes had romantic,funny,and kind of scary parts. I like the movie a lot I would watch it over and over again. Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where a theme park populated with cloned dinosaurs has operated for ten years. The main characters in this movie are Chris Pratt:Owen,Bryce Dallas Howard:Claire,Ty Simpkins:Gray,Nick Robinson:Zach,and Jake Johnson:Lowery. The story is about how dinosaurs act in real life like the Raptors hunt and kill things. The Indominus T-Rex eats a lot of thing like other dinosaurs,plants,buildings,and people. I think that Chris Pratt:Owen did a good job in the movie because he did a good job with the dinosaurs and working with the people. I think that Katie McGrath:Zara didn't do a good job because the had her talking on the phone and she never payed attention to things. I liked the part where they were Owen and the raptors were fitting the Indominus T-Rex and the raptors were protecting Owen,Clare,Gray,and Zach. The lesson I learned is to be careful of what i do because then everything will go wrong.To be careful of what the do or say because something will go bad.I would tell people that like romance,action,and dinosaurs to watch the movies. I would recommend this to people that are into science and dinosaurs. I would not recommended this to people that dislike action.

This cannot be your aim to shoot such a bad movie without any wit or humor. Twenty years I have been waiting for something in the spirit of Sam Neill's humor. In this movie no humor whatsoever can be found. There is no story. There is no plot. Everything is incredible. Please give me one reason, why I should like this movie.

"8","/10","As far as sequels are concerned, this one is great.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3533094/?ref_=tt_urv","foxhound-37781","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68357960/?ref_=tt_urv","27 August 2016","First thing I want to say, I've been a Jurassic Park fan since I was 4 years old. So naturally I wanted to know all the details about a fourth Jurassic movie. Fans of the series will go into this knowing what to expect straight away. Dinosaurs break loose. Cause a ten ton of havoc. Main protagonists help save the day. The classic formula is there, and a lot of people will definitely have that sense of ""seen it all before"" while they're watching it, but I found Jurassic World to be a very refreshing, and enjoyable monster flick.So the plot is as follows: Set about twenty-two years after the events of the first film, The original Island (Isla Nublar) now has a fully functioning, well organized theme park that is reeling in millions of people every year, profits are up, visitor morale is up and everything that billionaire John Hammond ever dreamed of has become a reality. The only problem is, the general public don't find the existing dinosaurs that enthralling anymore and want to see something new, so the scientists create a genetically modified hybrid, naming it the Indominous Rex. We quickly learn that this new ""rex"" is significantly more dangerous than any other animal in the park, and has in fact caused numerous accidents already to the staff and handlers. It isn't long before this New addition breaks free of its captivity and starts causing all the chaos under the sun (this may come off as a spoiler but it's a Jurassic Park movie so what the hell else were you expecting?).Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are our two main protagonists who play the odd couple who had a fling together previously, They're forced to band together after Claire's nephews go missing in the park and to help try to bring the situation under control. Both of these actors play their roles surprisingly well but I just can't help but feel they weren't really suitable for the main protagonists, and same with the two kids. Ty Simpkins wasn't as impressive in this as he was in the Insidious films which I was mildly disappointed about, but seeing Vincent Donifiro and BD Wong (the only returning character from the first film) was great and they made really worthy additions to the cast. There's a lot of people expressing their disappointment about there being no Alan Grant, or no Ian Malcolm (believe me I love Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum dearly) but you really can't keep having the same characters thrown into the same situation over and over and over again. The thing I love most about Jurassic World is easily the CGI. The Dino's look as cool as ever, especially the raptors, and the couple of new animals we see do their bit to help to keep the setting fresh. One thing that bugged me throughout the film was I couldn't help but find the whole gyro-sphere ride a bit far-fetched, especially when there's other scenes in the film where tourists are being carted around on just an ordinary bus. There's also quite a few predictable moments that took a little bit of fun out of some of the action sequences, but the film is visually stunning and anyone who goes to movies like this for the special effects will have no problem enjoying it. The music is also noteworthy; the new score is awesome and does justice from start to finish.There's also a few Easter eggs to keep an eye out for that fans of the series will recognize. There's a few elements from the original that make appearances, from the old visitor center, to Tim Murphy's night vision goggles, the Jeep Wranglers and even the quirky, animated DNA character shows himself again. I believe there is even a store in the main visitor hub called ""Winston's"" which the producers threw in as a tribute to the late Stan Winston.Overall, Jurassic World is a visually stunning, highly enjoyable monster flick. It does everything it can to build on what made the first movie so fantastic. The pacing is solid enough to keep you entertained from start to finish, but just don't make the mistake of taking it too seriously. At the end of the day It's just fiction! Just sit back, chill out with some popcorn and enjoy one of the coolest and most visually impressive monster flicks the film industry has on offer.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But who could imagine that it would be in the form of a nonsensical, predictable and poorly structured TV movie for the big screen worth of the worst Syfy spoofs. Yes, you see dinosaurs. Yes, the special effects are good. But the acting is so bad (a completely expressionless Bryce Dallas Howard walks though the events in an immaculate white dress and in high heels) and the story so utterly absurd and obvious (a genetically modified and seemingly very smart breed of tyrannosaur to accommodate the corporate requirements to keep up attendance at a theme park) that halfway through it one begins to wonder if it is actually all made on purpose. Perhaps I got it completely wrong, and this WAS meant to be a cinematic equivalent to Sharknado (which I enjoyed much more, by the way). Some moments are absolutely unforgettable (such as when, after re-emerging from swimming in a river, one of the two brothers starts a fire using the matches he had in his pocket and drive a jeep abandoned for more than twenty years) and they would probably make sense in a John Landis movie, but from a Steven Spielberg franchise one would expect more than just (already seen) special effects to justify bringing back such a powerful franchise. I wish I could give this less than one star.","19 out of 42 found this helpful.

They rebuilt a huge technological theme park and they named it Jurassic World. The main characters were Owen played by Chris Pratt; Aunt Claire played by Dallas Howard; Gray played by Ty Simpkins, and Zach played by Nick Robinson. It was a luxury theme park that provided a habitat of array of genetically engineered dinosaurs. Until the intelligent Indominus Rex escapes and sets off a chain reaction that causes other dinosaurs to go amok.What I liked was the story line, and how the scientific genetic dinosaurs were put together. There was really nothing I learned about this movie but their was nothing I disliked about the movie. I feel scientist should not try to bring back animals from the prehistoric time set.I think people who like action movies would enjoy and watch this movie.

You've probably seen a billion dinosaur movies and probably tired of them. Maybe one movie based on dinosaurs got your attention. The movie that caught your attention was probably ""Jurassic World"". I mean let's face it this movie has everything from action to romance! ""Jurassic World"" is an action romance movie with a science twist. Hello and welcome to the somewhat tragic yet exciting movie review!Let's start off with the basic things about this movie. After seeing this movie i'm thinking where is this place it's beautiful! Jurassic World is located at a fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, and takes place 22 years after Jurassic Park. Claire, Owen, and Hoskins are 3 of the main characters. Zach and Gray are what I call secondary main characters. Their role in the movie is what causes a chain event that affects the story line of the movie. In the movie a ginormous man- made dinosaur gets loose and terrorizes the whole place. The ""Indominus Rex"" is a man eating dinosaur that the main characters try to stop. I thought all actors/ actresses did a great job showing fear and concern. Next we will be talking about the good and bad parts of the movie. My favorite scene from the movie was when they thought the dinosaur escaped. When Owen noticed claw marks on the wall he went with 2 other people to investigate only to find the dinosaur was in the cage with them! Owen escapes but the other 2 workers were not so lucky. As Owen escapes the Indominus Rex escapes with him leading on to the next scene. My least favorite scene was when Hoskins uses the raptors to try to defeat the Indominus Rex. As he takes over the company, he lets out the raptors resulting to many people dead. One lesson I learned from this movie is to always have a backup plan. When the first plan of containing the dinosaur didn't work they somehow always had another plan. A moral somebody might take from this movie might be to be optimistic because if no one was optimistic enough the dinosaur might've done much more than injure people.This movie overall would be great for anyone to watch. Although if you think dinosaurs, science, romance, and action is a waste of time then this movie isn't really for you, is it? I would recommend this movie to people that are into a little bit of some genres. Romance, action, nature, and science will perfectly describe what genres this movie is. If you into that I totally recommend ""Jurassic World"" to you! Of course every movie has an age rating, ""Jurassic World"" is rated PG- 13.

Not even Spielberg knew what to do with the sequels for Jurassic Park! And this movie nailed it! The park looks just amazing! The dinosaurs are the biggest problem in my opinion. You can tell they are CGI, and the new dinosaur, the I-Rex looks bland and boring. What this movie did good is making it a direct sequel to Jurassic Park and ignoring The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. The highlight of the film is easily the fight between the T-Rex and I-Rex, and the mosasaurus and raptors jumping in the fight.9/10. Jurassic World isn't perfect, the dinosaurs look bad, but the acting is great and concept is great. This movie is amazing and I cannot wait for the sequels to come out.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Tree-hugging animal lovers talk about animals, while evil corporate types talk about assets. As a bonus, we've also got an oily Vince D'Onofrio muttering about using the beasts for military purposes. I think we know who's going to make it and who's going to end up as dino-snax.But I forgive it that, for the spectacle and the verve of the piece. I even forgive it for wasting Irrfan Khan, my favourite Bollywood actor.What's harder to stomach is the not-so-subtle message that women who don't take care of kids aren't proper women. Dudes can get away with this sort of behaviour but Bryce Dallas Howard's character (and her assistant) clearly have something wrong with them for not going all dewey and matronly when kids show up. Even the mother (Judy Greer, who seems to be making a career as put-upon mom in films lately) is shown as letting down the side by working. Hey, where's dad in all this? Funnily enough, no-one mentions how he neglects his kids by daring to have a job.It's a bit mid-1970's in terms of attitude is what I'm saying. But - sigh - I'll overlook that too. You can think too much about these things. Howard is actually pretty good in the movie, Chris Pratt is great and the raptors are just adorable. The kids aren't too annoying. I'm not fond of kids in films. I suspect if I was in a Jurassic Park film I'd get eaten in the first 10 minutes for admitting that.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unfortunately the two sequels it produced wasn't on par.But I can proudily say Jurassic Park has finally got a good worthy sequel titled 'Jurassic World.' This is Jurassic Park for the 21st Century. This film goes the extra mile! Chris Pratt is very cool and charming as the raptor trainer 'Owen' who in my opinion is Hollywood's next action star. The original Jurassic Park characters' absence is felt in this new installment but this film does very touching tributes to the original. Also this film has top dino action! This is truly the perfect summer flick! Jurassic World is just as good as the original! The Jurassic Park franchise makes a solid comeback!","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

It actually is a pretty enjoyable film that delivers on the thrills and chills. The film itself (like it's star predator) is a terrifying chimera of various elements from previous Jurassic Park films, books, games, and media that packs a powerful punch. The movie DEFINITELY knew it's audience and delivers on mostly all the right notes. That's not to say there were some things that were either missed opportunities or made me roll my eyes, with the biggest cringe-factor being Jimmy Fallon's annoying and unnecessary cameos. I just really wished they used more practical effects and animatitronics like the past films, one factor that even Jurassic Park 3 had a leg up over this film. The pacing also seemed a little too rushed and fast in many areas, and John Williams' scores are heavily missed as well as Stan Winston's hyper-realistic creations. It is too bad this film couldn't of been made back in the 90's or early 2000's back when such things were still appreciated by film makers and studios. Other then that, this film is pretty good in it's own right, though it shouldn't be at fault for not fully living up to the monumental epicness and mountain of nostalsia of the original classic.","18 out of 40 found this helpful.

I felt the old magic, not as a repeat of the old movie, but as nostalgic bliss. But then it sort of faded away as the plot began. The movie was surprisingly good. I thought it would just be CGI hell, with wooden acting and sloppy pacing, but the movie succeeded in pulling me in over and over. I felt excited and on edge all the time.To be true, the plot is rather lame, and very predictable, but I was able to tune all the inconsistencies out and let myself be carried along.

Once again the lesson of 22 years ago is forgotten, man shouldn't tamper with nature. I have been a huge fan of this series since I saw the first one in theaters. They are movies that are exciting to watch over and over. This one is no exception. The story of this one is almost secondary to the action, but it works. The movie is tense and exciting the entire time. Nothing is more exciting than seeing dinosaurs interacting with people and it really makes me want to visit a park like thisas long as the events that take place are different. If I had to knock the movie for anything it would be the same problem I had with the Star Wars prequels and Maleficent. When you watch the original movies Darth Vader and Maleficent are evil and scary but the new ones humanize them and make you look at them in a different light, this takes away from the originals for me. The same thing occurs in this movie in regards to some dinosaurs. That however is a very minor complaint and isn't worth skipping this over.

Not so with the humans who come across as stereotyped and annoying. I didn't know some of the human characters' names until the end credits. The human cast probably exceeds a thousand. Then there are at least a billion extras, nameless human chumps eager to tell their grandchildren they were once in a Spielberg movie.And though not directed by him, this is, after all, a Steven Spielberg movie. That's all you really need to know, as in: action is more important than characters, plot, dialogue, casting, or acting. But, hey, the production design is good. And visual effects are really spectacular. Mostly, the film aims to please a 12 to 24 year old, easily wowed, viewer demographic.Of all the irritations here, which include a predictable Disney-style plot, none is more annoying than the loud background music. It's a manipulative and insulting device, to remind us that the film aims to be epic in scope and costly in budget. Which is made worse by the film's run-time. At least 15 to 20 minutes could have been shaved off, mostly in the second half repetitive action.But the dinos are still lovable. Of course, that's cinematic manipulation, too, to get us to care for and relate to these nonexistent creatures. Ever since I watched ""Walking With Dinosaurs"", I have enjoyed researching these prehistoric beings. ""Jurassic World"", with all its Steven Spielberg cinematic faults, gives us plenty of them, and for me that makes this blockbuster at least tolerable.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

As you can guess, that turns out to be a bad idea.Chris Pratt's acting makes the movie fresh, as does the storyline.

Pratt and Howard (a fetching Gwen from Spiderman 3) did very well as the two people most involved in handling the mayhem that results when things at your favorite dinosaur park don't go well. Unlike many recent movies, this one did have a soul and didn't just feel like plug-in formula garbage. I like Pratt, I didn't know him before, he gets my vote as a good one for any new upcoming Marvel superhero. Also nice to see geneticist BD Wong back from the original, although apparently learning nothing from his first time around.

The technology definitely has improved over the years but the story remains the same (close to the first 2 movies). There are a few references to the first 2 movies but you don't really have to see any of the other movies to know what's going on. This movie feels more like a remake of the first film instead of an actual sequel.The movie starts off with a pair of brothers go on a trip to the rebuilt Jurassic Park (now World) to spend time with their aunt who happens to run the park. The story in the film is told from the perspective of the two brothers, the aunt just trying to hold everything together (which I will get to later), and the hunk dinosaur trainer guy. It's been 22 years since the first film and now that infamous island has a new park on it. The first glimpse of the new park involves a bright and vibrant opening that reminds the viewer of the first time they saw the original Jurassic Park, with a voice over by the late Richard Attenborough in introducing the park visitors and the audience of the wonders of the first dinosaur amusement park. Sort of a tribute to what the first movie was about and the realization of it coming true.Problems soon arise when, due to dwindling park attendance numbers, the park begins to start splicing the DNA of their animals in order to create a new attraction. Surprisingly enough, they manage to create a bigger, more aggressive, smarter dinosaur, the Indominus Rex. Being the type of film it is, this dinosaur finds a way to reap havoc within the park and cause problems for the film's protagonists. The film tries to act as a social commentary about the ethics and morality involved with cloning animals and whether or not they should be considered property or to be treated as living objects. The movie does not beat us over the head with this as most of the movie plays out as a creature movie where the stars of the film must merely try to survive the Indomnus Rex and avoid the destruction in its wake. The movie when compared to the first 2 is not as scary or suspenseful because the new dinosaur they have created for this film is simply not as scary and the way it is was depicted does not inspire suspense. While watching the film, I never felt a sense of danger as the stars never acted like they were in danger. Knowing what I do about the first 3 films, the story was rather predictable and did not innovate or further the series at all. This isn't the best movie I have ever seen but I was entertained. The performances of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard kept me interested (albeit a little cliché). Some of the ""family problem"" stuff, I could have definitely gone without and the film kind of took a little time to get going. Fans of the series will not be disappointed with this installment and for those who have not seen a film in this series will be entertained as well.keithlovesmovies.com","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

There isn't much new in the way of a twist though. I remember the build up back when the first came out, people came out to the movie in droves. It really was like waiting in line for a ride. It was an original idea my Michael Crichton and everyone wanted to see the giant lizards. It was basically three things that made that movie popular: 1) The dinosaurs, 2) The action, and 3) the story. On all three levels I still give the first one a 5/5. This new one is good, very good. It is a rollicking rode for sure and worth the price of a ticket. At the same time it really lacks in the story department. I went in hoping to get something new and fresh that made me think about dinosaurs. In between the guttural dinosaur special effects, it just isn't there.Having said that, I doubt moviegoers really care about that. The dinosaurs and there, in full tech regalia. I've always thought dinosaurs were cool. I like to watch them but in real life they aren't there. I even think museum bones are a bit boring now thanks to this franchise. I felt the need to explain to my 8 year old that dinosaurs were extinct. It seems kids in the past 20 years have seen them so much on the silver screen, they seem real. I loved the movie, I offer no spoilers except to say you're gonna love the dinosaurs and the action. Some stories don't need to be improved upon, maybe that's what the makers of this Jurassic Park were thinking.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

You just know someone is going to get devoured. It's just a matter of who's going first.22 years after the original Jurassic Park was built, the popular tourist attraction Jurassic World operates, as originally envisioned by the visionary John Hammond. Visitors can interact with herbivore dinosaurs and witness the decimation of livestock by the carnivores. But after 10 years of operation, the park's visitor rates are declining. They need something that's going to bring back the people. As a result, they create a new dinosaur. But this dinosaur's more intelligent than the mad scientists who created her. and pretty soon, the park becomes an entrée plate of goodies. The real question is, who stays alive and who gets eaten? For those who love a good monster movie, you're in for a good time. The action comes and goes and the survival horror mentality is there.First of all, it was nice to see Chris Pratt as the hero but since he came off the lapels of Star-lord in Guardians of the Galaxy, it's kind of hard not to see him that way here. To me, he's still Star-Lord, except now, he's dealing with dinosaurs.Bryce Dallas Howard plays the quintessential woman of the film, Aunt Claire. And personally, I wanted her to get eaten the most (Well, except for Private Pyle) She demeans her nephews and treats them as if they're young children, when they somehow get a 1992 Jeep Wrangler running on fuel and a battery that had been sitting for 20 years, and they can drive Stick shift. Aunt Claire wears heels and gets glorified like Wonder Woman. That's the only thing that prevented me from giving this movie a 10.And I mentioned Private Pyle. Vincent D'Onofrio. He played Private Pyle in Full Metal Jacket back in 1987 and here, in an ironic twist, he's now a top military guy, looking for a new way to fight insurgents around the world...and trained killer dinosaurs come to mind.To close the review, I recommend you go and see this film. It's going to have a sequel in a few years, and hopefully that one will be as fun as this one was.9/10","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie is directed by Colin Trevorrow and stars amongst others, Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins. Over twenty years have elapsed, since John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), failed in his dream, to build a theme park, housing live Dinosaurs. Now that dream has been realised, with a huge fully functioning park, known as Jurassic World, housing an whole array of prehistoric creatures operating on the very same Island.Brothers, Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) are sent to meet up with their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who happens to be the parks operations manager. However, on their arrival, they discover that Claire is far to busy trying to find backers to spend time with them and end up being escorted by her assistant Zara (Katie McGrath).Behind the scenes, lessons still need to be learned, as scientists splice the DNA of Dinosaurs, with that of present day animals, to create new, larger and more ferocious creatures. One of which, the Indominus Rex, is the parks new main attraction.Owen Grady (Pratt) trains the Velociraptors, with some quite astonishing results. Head of security, Vic Hoskins ( D'Onofrio), however, believes the Raptors true destiny lies within the US Military. A move that Owen strongly resists, which causes friction between the two.The parks owner, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), asks Owen to check over the new enclosure for the Indominus, before it's presented to the public. Owen immediately tells Clare, that the creature is dangerous, due to it only ever knowing solitude and isolation.A shock wave thunders through the park when it appears the Indominus has escaped. Clare and Owen enter the enclosure and suddenly realise that they're not alone as they come face to face with the beast.The creature makes a dash for freedom and makes it's way in to the islands interior and Masrani sends in a team to try and capture it. However, the team are slaughtered and Clare orders the immediate evacuation of the parks northern sector.Zach and Gray sneak away from Zara and ignoring the order to evacuate, continue in to a restricted zone in a gyro sphere (A strange spherical vehicle), to explore. They come under attack from the huge Indominus, but manage to distract it long enough to escape. They end up at the ruins of the old Jurassic Park visitors centre and manage to get a Jeep running and make their way back to the resort centre. The Indominus continues in it's trail of death and destruction, with all efforts to subdue the beast futile. Hoskins assumes command and comes up with a desperate plan to use the Raptors to track down the Indominus. However, things don't pan out as expected, as the Indominus has Raptor DNA and seems to have the ability to communicate with the Raptors, causing them to turn on the already terrified and powerless humans.The special effects are outstanding as are the interactions between humans and dinosaur, in this, the best of the Jurassic movies.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The only link in this film, besides the title and the park, is Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong). Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt, is very awesome, and a fan theory is that he is the boy from the original Jurassic Park that is teased by Dr. Alan Grant. Nothing confirmed, but a fun idea. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron Howard) stars as Grace, the park supervisor.Some of the best scenes remind us of the original, and why it was such a hit in 1993.

Rather than match the suspense of the original it when gung ho on action and effects with a huge screen time for dinosaurs which is what we all came to watch. It was a little corny here and there but i think it saved itself with playing on that a couple times to not take itself too seriously.

The plot formula is long worn out, to the extent that any form of believability is absent. That's not to say that a film about a dinosaur theme park ought to be realistic, but the characters are so moronic, and the key story elements so ludicrous and formulaic, that there is not enough left to tie it to the real world in which it sets its fantasy, and therefore there is no reason to care. This is not helped by wooden stock characters and the utterly predictable relationships between them. This film is a monotone, generic smashy-crashy blockbuster, devoid of charm, nuance, or emotional depth. And to add insult to injury, despite over 20 years of improved technology, the CGI dinosaurs are rendered less realistically than their counterparts from the original Jurassic Park!

Its most remarkable aspect, in general, is illustrating how challenging these franchise reboots can be. We have had a number of decent-to-excellent reboots in recent years -- here's a healthy reminder of how leaden they can be when things go wrong.There are a few good ideas buried in the film, especially the soft critique of corporate hegemony and its brand-everything mindset. It tries to have its cake and eat it too by incorporating the significant amount of product placement into this critique, thus attempting to make a virtue of necessity while it cashes the checks. This might have had more resonance if the film wasn't so soulless. The design of the world -- no longer just a park -- is a nicely conceived update of the original that allows for both visually stylish enhancements, like all the holographic projections, and plenty of visual callbacks to the original. Unfortunately, the latter just serve as several well- placed reminders of how much better ""Jurassic Park"" was. Jack Johnson's character, a coordinator in the central control room whose name I've already forgotten because he's so uninteresting, wears a t-shirt from the original park he bought on e-Bay and says how much he respects its legitimacy. This is another example of the film trying to insulate itself from obvious critiques. As with the product placement scheme, it doesn't really work as well as the filmmakers seem to think it does.One of the worst aspects of ""Jurassic World"" is that it takes the least appealing parts of ""Jurassic Park"" and runs with them, especially the sentimentalizing and anthropomorphizing of the dinosaurs. ""Park"" was guilty of this too, at least compared to the harder-edged, more clear-eyed novel by Michael Crichton from which it was adapted, but only around the edges and only in service of broadening the film's appeal in an all-ages direction. ""World"" goes whole hog in this direction, despite regular monologues and commentary from Pratt's Owen Grady, who is supposedly training raptors, that these are animals and should be respected as animals - - commentary the film repeatedly undercuts by depicting the dinosaurs as military strategists. The lack of faith the film has in its own ""assets,"" as Bryce Dallas Howard's corporate functionary who runs the park keeps calling the creatures, is the most depressing and cynical aspect of this whole enterprise, and left me wondering why I went to see a movie that trades on the wonder of dinosaurs while refusing to believe that actual dinosaurs would be wonderful.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

And it does so in a tremendous production. All of the performers are excellent in their roles. Even the dinosaurs perform better. There is a human to dino sequence in this film that will bring most to tears. There are other creature to human relationships that are fascinating.

That is a big reason why it was so successful, but that is only a piece of why the movie is so great. The rest is great characters, great acting, great direction, great score and a great script. Jurassic World has none of those. Without those elements how can you sweep me up into believing that Jurassic World could actually exist? You can't and because of that there isn't a cool moment in this movie that really matters or stands out. There are only 2 or 3 surprises in the movie that aren't in the trailer, and the ""surprises"" are so predictable. There were so many moments where it recycled Spielberg's work. It sounds like that would be cool, but when you see it its so tasteless. Let's have a Jaws moment, let's have the Trex running after the car moment. Does this have anything new to bring to the table? Not that much I'm afraid.I had low expectations for this film going in. I'm the biggest Jurassic Park fan you can meet. I really hoped it would bring me back to the place I loved in any small way it could but it didn't. This movie doesn't take its time showing you the wonders of the Park, it rushes through it like it rushes through everything else.Even Jurassic Park 3 understood how to create suspense. This has none. No sense of how big these animals are either. Remember the famous water rippling in the glass? The feeling this huge thing was coming to get everyone? Nope. Hey cinematographer, ever heard of shadows? You can use them to create fear? Anything? I guess I'm asking for too much.They threw in some nostalgic moments in there but literally stomped all over them. Great, thanks.The only good parts are the CGI and the use of one animatronic dinosaur, glad they figured out that would be effective. The ending is alright but predictable. Other then that don't waste your time with this monster mash. That's all they think making a Jurassic Park sequel needs. Well think again.","60 out of 162 found this helpful.

The park shouldn't have created the Indominus Rex, otherwise it'll cause the people to panic around the park and cause a lot of chaos.

But, it is not ignoring The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. While neither sequel is referenced in the film, their events have been referenced in the film's promotional materials and viral marketing. For example, the San Diego incident is mentioned, John Hammond died shortly after the events of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. In real life, Richard Attenborough died of natural causes on 24 August 2014, aged 90. There is a Hammond's memorial statue in the Innovation Center in this film, in a feature introducing the character Vic Hoskins, it's revealed his team did work involving flying dinosaurs, referring the Pteranadons that escaped at the end of Jurassic Park III. The bones of a Spinosaurus can be seen in the main plaza of the park. T-Rex is even shown to smash through them during the final fight. As a way to show that the T-Rex is still the king of the dinosaurs. In a likely reference to the fan complaints that the T-Rex was killed by the Spinosaurus in Jurassic Park III. Read and digest that how ever you like, all it was and is, is an article that came out saying that the director said it is the sequel to Jurassic Park.. you don't say. It feels and resembles lots to do with Jurassic Park... wow really? D'oh. The island in which the events of Jurassic Park happened, happened on Island Nublar in which Jurassic World happens. This means you do not need anything to do with The Lost World: Jurassic Park or Jurassic Park III because they happened on Isla Sorna/Site B. The sequel to Jurassic World will most likely revisit this island, as well as mention, what probably is happening on the island in Jurassic World.. its not that hard to just suspend your disbelief for a bit until you get your answers. Oh and the books are different to the movies. Savvy? Groovy. Glad I could help. Thank you for your cooperation. Jurassic World were like a SyFy film. We have dinosaurs used for war. Really? I were expecting the rap tors to say ""Alan"" at one point or riding a bike. Literally as bad as one of those Dinocroc vs. Supergator type movies. Bad CGI. Bad acting. A complete embarrassment to all involved. It's only saving grace is that it's occasionally so bad that it's kind of funny. And the Jurassic Park theme. The music still moves me to this day. They should not use it for nostalgia. John Williams has not written a hummable tune since Jurassic Park! I want to hear a new Jurassic Park theme! They are just trying to make the stuff that is already been done, to be groovy.","16 out of 36 found this helpful.

Now 27, I still hold that same fascination, meaning the Jurassic Park franchise is something i have always held dear. My old headmaster always used to say ""Finish Strong"", so before going into detail about the positives about Jurassic World, I want to thrash out a few of the main issues I had with the film. My main negative was the characters themselves were not done anywhere near as much justice as they should. Chris Pratt, though excellent throughout, didn't really have a real story arc to his character. Bryce Dallas-Howards character did have this arc, however it felt very forced and un-natural. The supporting cast should have been given more air-time and fleshed out more, and the less said about the children and their storyline the better...Other irritations include the CGI, at times used well however others it was very patchy and no-where near the ground-breaking levels of the original. There were numerous plot holes, and certain elements that were just plain irritating (the much talked about ""high heeled sprinting"" a major factor). There were also parts to the storyline, such as the ""Raptors for Weapons"" arc, which didn't feel properly fulfilled.Luckily, however, these negatives can be (mostly) swept away by the main reason this film was so enjoyable - the Dinosaurs themselves! The I-Rex was brought to life excellently, and stole every scene she was part of. The Velociraptors were, apart from some questionable CGI at times, great to watch. Supporting Dinosaurs were also very well done, with any dino on dino interaction excellently put together. The nostalgia factor was ever-present throughout the film - some of the moments that hark back to the first film are sublime, and will have you glued to the screen trying to get a peek of what Isla Nublar has become 22 years on from Jurassic Park. To top the film off, the finale was absolutely breathtaking - it packed action, heart and drama into a scene that, being a Dinosaur nut, goes down as one of my favourite movie moments for a long time.For those who are worried that this film is another Jurassic Park 3, your fears are eased. It is not perfect, however I thoroughly enjoyed my hour ride through Jurassic World, and barring this islands existence in real life, cannot wait to revisit again for Jurassic World 2. A message to Spielberg and anyone else involved in this inevitable sequel - please focus on a fewer main, well fleshed out characters, and allow us all more time in the company of these prehistoric beasts!!","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

Almost every scene of Jurassic World is intense - and it has a storyline and climax that satisfies. Set in the Caribbean Islands again Jurassic World draws on the same storyline that the first three Jurassic movies do in the way that it brings people to the island and does not have the attraction brought to the people. The attraction in this movie's case is called Jurassic World, and unlike the original Jurassic Park island owner Masrani (played by Irrfan Khan) has made this park MUCH GRANDER than John Hammond's original island. Of course it has also been updated since the 1993 park technology wise and unlike that park this one, until things go wrong halfway through the movie, is successful!! What I like most about this movie of course is the dinosaurs and their action!! When I originally saw Jurassic Park back in 1993 winding down my final years of high school dinosaurs themselves were the draw, and what a draw they were!! Computer graphic technology by Lucasfilm was the newest thing on the scene and director Steven Spielberg picked the perfect movie to show it off!! Fast forward some 22 years later and the dinosaurs of course are still the main attraction by most but the action of the dinosaurs is also an attraction as well. Unlike that first Jurassic Park movie where we basically saw by-the-book dinosaurs, scientists here at Jurassics World (the park not the movie) and in Jurassic Park III (the movie) have felt free to take liberties with their scientific technology to go ahead and experiment on the dinosaurs making them even more aggressive, scarier dinosaurs to satisfy costumers. Back to the movie though. I don't want to go into too much detail about what goes wrong in the movie and how it is solved so that I don't ruin the movie for you, but I must say that it is really exciting!! There's tuns of dinosaur action and a scene that will take you back to a Hitchcock classic (The BIrds) as well as an ending you will never forget!! The acting by the two main characters, Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) as the military specialist Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard (Spider-Man 2) as Claire Dearing, the park administrator, is very good. Trevorrow's direction is very good as is the writing. As I have mentioned throughout this review the action by both the dinosaurs and the humans is great, it's the reason why most people buy the ticket or buy the blu ray to see the movie. The soundtrack is outstanding and Jurassic World simply is a movie that's a great way to spend time with family or friends!! 8 out of 10 stars!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Johnson, Judy Greer, Vincent D'Onofrio, Nick Robinson, Lauren Lapkus, Omar SY, BD Wong, Irrfan Khan, Brian Tee, Ty Simpkins, Andy Buckley, and Katie McGrath Directed By: Colin Trevorrow Review The Park Is Now Open When it was first announced that they were making another Jurassic Park movie I was like why, and then I looked at the title and thought about it and said to myself ""this could be the best on the series."" But then I read reviews and see the first film which is a masterpiece, and I become very worried. Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. Claire played by Ron Howards hot daughter runs Jurassic World and gets her friend Owen(Chris Pratt) to check on the new attraction that scientists spliced to release it in Jurassic World. When this new dinosaur tricks them and gets Owen in the cage to try and eat and is let loose killing for sport. Claire and Owen's team hunt the dinosaur to take it down. My history with these Jurrasic Park films this week has been high and low. The only one my mother loves is the first one and she thinks Spielberg is a fantastic director while I think he's great but not amazing. I loved the first film, hated the second, and enjoyed the third, even though I saw it's flaws. This film is an action/adventure thrill-ride, so it's not like the amazing wonder of the first film. It's serviceable fun and a dang good sequel. Chris Pratt I was afraid was going to play Star-Lord again in this movie, but he didn't. He acted more like a general then anything to me. His acting was good and now Bryce Dallas Howard(who has stated wants to be Captain Marvel) is an actress who some say is terrible but me personally I like her and thought that this was best performance and film. I even noticed one star from the show New Girl in the movie and thought that was funny. The two kids who play Claire's Nephews do a good job as far child actors go and one of them is actually that kid from Iron Man 3. The special effects are pretty good but also a little funky in some scenes. It's actually sad when you think about it that our culture is not as mesmerized as we use to be by CGI because of how often we see it. But the direction from newcomer Colin Trevorrow is what helps this film along with the first films original director producing. Jurassic World is a great fun ride at the theater with some funky CG in some scenes but good acting, fun story, and great direction with a director and who were obviously passionate at making the best sequel to a 22 year old cult classic, I'm giving Jurassic World a four out of five.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is a sequel to one of the revolutionary film in the history. Real-life actualization of child's favorite imaginary friend exactly as he or she sees in the book was sensational. Adventures in dinosaur land was that exciting, thrilling, and powerful.'Jurassic World' follows the similar build-up of the story with modern touch and bigger scale. It utilizes computer technique developed exponentially in 20 years. Dinosaur's blood, scar, movement, and even facial expression are more realistic. Entertainment aspect is bigger than the last movie. New spices added; more utilities in the amusement park; visual effect is more appealing. Also, the fact dinosaurs interact with human-beings shortens the distance between two species' relationship. Dinosaur stays friends for kids even after the movie.Only fault...

It's hard not to, when we live in a film world that gives us Godzilla (some decent monster action, practically non-existent humans) and the new Planet of the Apes films (which has two of this movie's co-writers, and has arguably greater CGI/mo-cap and writing). What Colin Trevorrow and producer Steven Spielberg do here - and make no mistake, this is very much a Spielberg production - is try to give the monster-movie-CGI-heavy blockbuster a jump-start with things that are familiar as well as new creatures, new peril, and a much bigger park. This time it's open, folks, and this place must have a helluva insurance premium.You know the set up and what'll happen as soon as you see the trailer, or just read the following sentence: the scientists in Jurassic World have 'designed' a dinosaur hybrid (we don't know everything that's in it, which is part of the mystery), and because it's been in captivity all its life, it's extra-dangerous and unfamiliar with the world around it. So, yes, in short, dinosaur breaks out, wreaks havoc, other dinosaurs spring loose, and the velociraptors are used to try and track this other big 'Indominus Rex' down. Yeah, wait, what? Jurassic World certainly delivers on the peril, on some clever lines and witty banter - especially between Chris Pratt, as the Navy-Seal turned raptor hunter, and businessy-turned-sorta-bad-ass Bryce Dallas-Howard - and there are some legitimately funny turns of the story. One such one is when a villain gets the perfunctory monologue about his ""real"" plans cut-off by another dinosaur. And when the dinosaur action really kicks in, mostly in the last third, it has some umph to it and is directed slickly and with some tension.What the movie may be missing for me is a full-on 'wow' factor of it. For kids this movie may be the bees knees. For an adult, as I now am, it wasn't very scary (no no, no 'six-foot turkey' comments for now). By this I mean, even though the action is well-staged and it has that solid, Spielberg-sense of direction where you always know where everyone is, the surprises feel genuine, and if there's any excess it feels like it's all in the brazen fun of what the Jurassic series is, when the suspense happens it kind of comes quickly, like the Rex attacks. Part of this for me is that, as good as the CGI is here, I miss the practical dinosaurs of the Stan Winston age. Only once is there a dinosaur that is actually *there* on the screen, and it's for a moment where it would've been silly to have an animated one otherwise.This isn't to take away from how cool they do look, on the whole. There was never a moment where I thought any of the fakeness took away from the action. If anything the velociraptors, at least in close-up, look better than they ever have (in computer form, I should say). But this is a gripe that I couldn't shake, and still put it a notch below what the WETA folks did with the Apes movies - perhaps more on par with the work in Godzilla last year. As for the humans on screen, they all have charismatic and interesting actors, including Irrfan Khan as the new John Hammond (this time he can work a helicopter). Do they all get dimensions? Some more than others; the kids here basically have two molds, with maybe just a hint of bonding over the course of their escape-from-dinosaur peril. And one of the stranger things is to see BD Wong here, the only carry-over from 'Park', now as a corrupted scientist-engineer. It's like if I were to see Walter Peck in the upcoming Ghostbusters reboot: like, OK, cool, uh, hey again...Jurassic World does its job better than the previous two sequels - there's no real annoyances with the characters, or involving gymnastics or whatever - and is worthy of a matinée, adults and kids included. The best it could've been though is hard to say.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

Can't believe that it's been over 20 years since the original. I remember I had just finished Camp America and was doing a bit of travelling. Jurassic Park was on at a local cinema and having loved the book I couldn't wait to see how Spielberg dealt with it.If I'm honest, I was a little underwhelmed. The way he brought the world to life was awe inspiring but I didn't love the casting of Sam Neil and I felt the whole thing was a little safe. Over time, I've come to love the movie and while the sequel was OK, I also really like the third and felt that the reappearance of Neil in the lead role was a welcome return.Last night was a completely different experience. The movie completely blew me away. I've been excited about it ever since seeing that Chris Pratt was attached and then watching a recent trailer sent my excitement sky high. I knew what I was in for. It's not about plot or story. This was going to be one hell of a roller-coaster ride.It turned out to be much more than that. It was everything I'd ever wanted from a Jurassic Park movie. Thrills, spills, tension and at it's centre, Chris Pratt doing his action guy thing. Just brilliant. Loved all the little nods to the original movie. And even the 3D was worth it. Trevorrow has shot such a beautifully vivid picture with so many bright colours that the transfer never jarred. It just dragged you straight in.I don't buy very many 3D movies but this will be top of my list.Michael Chrichton would have been proud!","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

Jurassic Park is my favorite movie to date, and I'd hoped based on the premise that this film would reinvigorate the same themes (with regard to harnessing nature and taking advantage of scientific advancement) but was sorely disappointed. For a start, the acting and the script are terrible. The only character with whom I identify and sympathize is the T-Rex, and that's mainly because she's the same rex that appeared in the first film and I feel some kind of kinship with her. The movie focuses primarily on two kids, neither of whom are relatable (and the older one, honestly, is kind of a dick), Chris Pratt's character (who has minimal depth), and the lady scientist (who is a walking, talking stereotype of the female Ice Queen). You don't feel saddened by the fact that any of these characters might die. The 'raptors are severely mollified, the ""new"" dinosaur is inexplicably genius while simultaneously devoid of character (unlike the 'raptors in Jurassic Park), and it seems like ever other scene is a direct knockoff of the original.I have to imagine that someone somewhere was placating themselves with the knowledge that these scenes were an homage to the original, but they weren't. They were a knockoff. The writers looked back at the previous movies and cobbled together some hybrid formula, with facets that mostly didn't work for Lost World or Jurassic Park III, and called it a day. There were several scenes that actually sent the entire audience into fits of laughter - unintentionally. The exposition is awkward, the characters are unlikeable, and the action is laughably fake. As I said, I really wanted to like this movie...but it was just as bad as a SyFy original. Absolutely no depth, just lots of CGI (and one laughably brief shot of an animatronic dinosaur).","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

Eventually, I watched that movie and it was as good as I had imagined. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not really innovative because it was similar to the original movie. The storyline was very well written and well-explained, even though it was kinda simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The filming location of the movie was really good, just a huge island, full of dinosaurs, in the middle of nowhere. Also, the casting was nice and their acting was descent. I have to admit, it wasn't a very funny movie, however it was very intense! Gladly, there were too many action-filled scenes and most of the dinosaurs attack scenes were really adventurous. Moreover, the dinosaur's design was really good and the CGI effects were very well edited, because they were super realistic. The killcount of the movie wasn't bloody, at all and most kills were done off-screen. Overall, ""Jurassic World"" was an enjoyable action movie, very thrilling and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They are not justified.The first of a new trilogy of films, Jurassic World brings us back full circle to the original film. Back to where it started.The movie is obviously having a go at corporate greed with the park now fully opened and a genetic hybrid dinosaur designed to lure in more visitors.The movie is a thrilling yet familiar ride back through the park. We meet new people and see new dinosaurs that we never saw in the original trilogy.The movie has the same sense of humour that the original movies had. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are the main stars, and they have amazing chemistry together.Full of action and suspense the movie is a fantastic thrill ride from start to finish. And as usual with this series, the visual effects are always top notch.So sit right back and enjoy the dinosaurs creating new havoc on the island","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

'JURASSIC WORLD' (IMAX 3D) Straight away makes you realize why Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors in the world. Jurassic World is Poorly Directed, Executed & VFX so poor that it feels amateurish. The INDOMINOUS REX (Main Dinosaur) looks ugly on Screen, Its 2015 we got the best of technologies yet it ain't convincing. Constant References to the 1993 BlockBuster Film Jurassic Park is annoying and want to beat the living daylights of the makers. It's been 22 years to Jurassic Park; even today that film seems way ahead of its time, even today that film will keep you on the edge of your seats but sadly this one doesn't. Chris Pratt does decent work in the film, Irrfan Khan is good. Rest all the characters were bad. Cinematography is bad. Editing is even worse. Four Screenplay writers couldn't come up with a decent script, what a shame!! 3D is Converted adds nothing to the film, Not Shot in IMAX only Presented. Background Score by John Williams is the place where you get Goosebumps and brings you back to the times of Jurassic Park. Poorly Sketched Characters, one doesn't connect with any of the characters. Overall the dinosaurs presented in the movie are ugly looking and stupid. (1/5) One Can Happily Skip this film and revisit the 1993 Blockbuster Jurassic Park on BluRay or DVD.","14 out of 33 found this helpful.

This movie was proper epic and the showdown at the end was amazing. I didn't really see the point why the director added the kids because it would have been much better if it was just based on Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). With that aside, the CGI was amazing and the director done a great job with making it seem like the dinosaurs were really next to the humans. Anyway, this 4th movie in the Jurassic Park franchise, sees a rich business man, Manrani (Irrfan Khan) who wants an new attraction for his popular theme park for all ages, so the scientists come together and build a monstrous, genetic killing machine from the DNA of various dinosaurs. Claire is in control of Jurassic World and she is trying to convince some investors to fund the attraction whilst looking after her nephews who have come to spend some time with her. As she is too busy to spend time with her nephews, they go off on a VIP tour of the theme park, with a guide, to see the various dinosaurs that it has to offer. On another side of Jurassic World, Owen is in charge of the Velociraptors which he has built a relationship with. Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) plays a militant army man who wants to use the Velociraptors as killing machines because Owen has the ability to control them but Owen is totally against the idea and he is more interested in taming the animals who have the ability to become killers. Because of his amazing ability to communicate with the Velociraptors, Claire calls on Owen to have a look at there new genetic dinosaur, the Indominus Rex and they soon realise that he has gone missing. Owen then takes a couple of his work colleagues to see were the dinosaur has disappeared to and they are shocked to see that he has tricked them by making it seem like he was missing but he is really there. The Indominus Rex then escapes from his compound and the ferocious killing machine is heading towards the theme park which has over 20,000 visitors. After many attempts to capture the dinosaur, and failing at every hurdle, Owen turns to his Velociraptors to save the day, only to find out that there species is also in the Indominus Rex DNA. Also, Claire's nephews have gone missing so they have to track them down while everyone is running around in a panic because loads of flying Dimorphodons have been let loose from there compound. Anyway, the only way that they can stop the ferocious killing machine is by releasing the Tyrannosaurus Rex who goes toe to toe with the Indominus Rex, with the help of some Veloraptors. The storyline was very well put together but the director wasted a lot of time on irrelevant material. Once the movie eventually gets going it's full of intensity and some gruesome scenes, for a 12A certificate movie. To me, the Indominus Rex looked pretty scary for a 12 year old and the way that it was killing people is enough to give kids nightmares. Anyway, the attention to detail was spot on and Chris Pratt was the perfect choice for his role. You can tell that he tamed down his acting, compared to Guardians of the Galaxy but there are some comedic scenes which gives the movie a great variety of mixed emotions. I had to watch the showdown at the end a few times because it did shock me, like the end fight in the Incredible Hulk between Hulk and Abomination, so I can't wait to see what they do with the sequel, or should I say the 5th movie. My overall opinion of the movie is that the script was a bit sketchy but the action scenes were amazing. Great, epic film.Round-Up: This movie was directed by Colin Trevorrow, 39, whose only brought you two small movies called Reality Show and Safety Guaranteed starring Aubrey Plaza. He must have given a hell of a pitch to get this project because he hasn't had that much experience behind the camera. With the help of, highly respected, Steven Spielberg as executive producer and Frank Marshall as producer, they really put together a great film but it could have done with a few tweaks in the script. With that aside, it's still the 3rd biggest movie of all time, making a whopping ($1.7Billion), behind Avatar ($2.8Billion) and Titanic ($2.2Billion) so Colin must be very happy with his 1st major project. The first Jurassic Park is in 19th place with $1Billion and Jurassic Park: The Lost World is in 99th place with $612million so, for some unknown reason, much more people paid there big bucks to see this movie, than the original. I did prefer the original movie because of the water shivering in the cup scene, along with the man getting eaten by the dinosaur while he's on the toilet. Anyway, Chris Pratt, 36, has really hit the jackpot with his last 2 movies and with another Jurassic World in the pipeline along with another Guardians of the Galaxy, the Magnificent Seven and the Real McCoy, he has enough projects to keep himself busy. Bryce Dallas Howard, 34, has signed up for the sequel and she is due to star in Disney's remake of Pete's Dragon with Robert Retford playing her father. The chemistry between these two actors was great in the movie and I'm glad that the director didn't push the romantic element. Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $1.7billion (3rd Biggest Movie of All Time)I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan and Omar Sy. 8/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What comes after that? Indominous rex of course!With each sequel or reboot there has to be a sense that things are moving forward or at the very least things getting bigger. In reality humans may have tried to tone things down after the incidents of the first three movies but as Dr Wu put it ""you didn't ask for reality, you asked for more teeth.""
Training velociraptors to respond and obey human commands was a different, yet aggressive move forward in the world of living alongside dinosaurs. The indominous's ability to camouflage itself made for a complete difference in the approach as to how dinosaurs frighten us.This movie may still lack in some areas where the original film did not but I do like the way the characters were developed. It may have been somewhat rushed but I still got a feel for who these people are and what drives them. I didn't care much for the two boys. I feel they settled for two kids less than worthy of the rolls they played but they got the job done nonetheless.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Very unbelievable because the mutant dinosaur doesn't just cause a lot of destruction, but is actually made out to be evil. I don't think a dinosaur had the intelligence, capacity, or motivation to be evil. A story line such as this could be a cartoon for children under 5 but it is insulting as a movie for adults. For example, at one point in the movie, it is shown that the dinosaur is 'killing for sport.' This is ludicrous to be believe that any animal is capable of this other than humans.

Initially, I had no interest in seeing this film. I thought basically its just dinosaurs running here and there. But I watched the first film again. I became a fan of it. I skipped the next 2 (basically because of its reviews). I watched this. And I was overjoyed.Plot: When an Indominous Rex gets out of hand in the newly built Jurassic World, its upto the authorities to get a control on the species.Story and direction: Now I went into this film knowing that it couldn't be in level with the first part. That was ultimate. But I was expecting a decent film. And yes, I got that. The VFX and camera work both are good. The dinosaurs looked a little 'faked' at times although the character designs for the dinosaurs were great. Hey, but that's just me. The film actually takes a little time to start, about 20 minutes. But after that, it was bang on. I liked the entry to Owen's character. He showed that there is a great promise to this franchise. The story was basically here and there. There were subplots that were kind of distracting me. The kids were kind of unnecessary. It felt as if they were recreating the first that also had two kids!!!! And using raptors as military weapons!!! That was atrocious. Here that was not even necessary. The climatic battle between the dinosaurs was a visual treat to the eyes.Performances: Chris Pratt proved that he can do roles other than the Star Lord. Bryce Dallas was also great. Vincent D'Onofrio was good as the semi-villain (although the part was not needed). The kids were also fantastic in their roles. Irrfan Khan again proved that why I loved him. B D Wong was OK.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be the scene after Chris Pratt's entry. The communication and bond that was shown between the dinos and humans was phenomenal. I hoped that this theme would have been further explored in the film.Verdict: Jurassic World is actually a good film. It has some flaws but it is watchable. Definitely not better than the original. Can't actually wait for Fallen Kingdom to come.I am giving it an 8/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

World Class VFX makes this movie fair better than all other movies in this jurassic park series. Screenplay is pacy and has mix of all emotions. Brother's affection is beautifully depicted in this movie. Visual effects are nor overdosed, it certainly adds lot of flavor to this 2hr movie. Excepting for the first 10 minutes, there is never a lag in this movie. Director Collin Treverrow has done an exceptional work.. Each and everyone in the star complement themselves well. Hero ""Chris Patt"" aka Owen does well in this movie, he certainly resembles Brendon Mccullum. Music is good, although some portion do has shades of BGM used in ""Lincoln the Vampire Hunter"". Verdict: Thoroughly Entertaining Visual Saga.... Towards the end, got the feeling that the movie should never end...... Rating; 4.25/5.00 Top Class VFX with a spellbinding screenplay...

Fallen Kingdom which I've seen in cinema and thought it was good and thinking that it is the same thing The Lost World and then they're making a sixth and last film and the Jurassic Park and World franchise is finally wrapped up. The story, I don't know how to say it, is the same thing as the original but doing it in a different way but you know what? It really works. Chris Pratt is really good in this since he starred and gained his fame in Guardians of the Galaxy. The park called Jurassic Park is created by John Hammond and then it's recreated into a new park called Jurassic World. Like I before, the dinosaurs are the best thing about it and one of them which is an Indominus Rex escapes and goes on a rampage. BD Wong returns as Dr. Henry Wu, Lex and Tim are two grandchildren from the original and now it's the two boys called Zach and Gray. They're not annoying like I said in the original Jurassic Park. And there's is one thing that is important for the fans and that is the Tyrannosaurus Rex appearing and fighting the Indominus. The best part about it is the end and it is all in sequence. Jurassic World is a fantastic popcorn thrilling blockbuster with good visuals which are not as good as the original but still good but the film has it's flaws because the story has the same elements from the original. Jurassic World is not as good as the Jurassic Park but everything about it is just impossible to hate and it made billions of dollars. The Jurassic Park films are fantastic. But the third film is not as good and it's hit and miss for people but I don't mind it. Jurassic World is the best film of 2015 and it feels like Lightwater Valley.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It does however work as a great dumb blockbuster, and I think by this point in the franchise everyone's willing to settle for that. It's a brainless popcorn flick, the kind where the villain is someone who thinks uncontrollable prehistoric monsters can be made into weapons and little kids quip ""I can't wait to tell mom!"" two seconds after they escaped a gruesome death. Speaking of gruesome deaths, this movie is chock full of them. The script to the original was obviously a lot better, but this one has almost non-stop action, a surprising amount of variation and a truly dazzling climax. The clumsy set-up of the inevitable love subplot was even a bit too dumb for me (the first dialogue between Claire and Owen is the most forced exposition you'll ever see), but apart from that I was entertained throughout.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The storyline picks up with the Jurassic Park science and concept being inherited and a new park being created that's almost ready for opening. As the commercialization is being wrapped up, some families come into the park for some test runs. What could go wrong?This movie is directed by Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World Dominion) and stars Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Irrfan Khan (Slumdog Millionaire), Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black) and Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3).This movie did a great job of catching the feel of the original Jurassic Park movie with family, love, adventure and survival by any means necessary. I adored the CGI and diversity of the dinosaurs, though the water one was a bit over the top (how could you ever control that). Pratt was a great addition to the cast and delivers a funny and easy to root for hero. Bryce Dallas Howard delivers a solid, irresponsible aunt character. The raptors were great and the dinosaur battles were awesome. You really get sucked into the events and universe quickly and this does a great job of capturing the imagination. The ending was amazing and worthwhile.Overall, this was a perfect relaunch of the Jurassic Park series that's an absolute must see. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The set design of the park is breathtaking as are the special effects. Director Colin Trevorrow has done a great job with mega-crowd scenes and multiple thrills.The buildup to the action/adventure is also surprisingly fascinating. The story takes a shot against the radical bigger-is-better greed and its corresponding interference with nature: something that is rampant in our modern corporate world. (This is ironic as the movie is coming from one of the biggest forms of this mindset: big-budget Hollywood movie-making.)Once the action takes place, this theme disappointingly dissipates. While character development almost always takes the back seat in such movies, there could have at least been a confrontation against one of the characters (or even the showing of remorse) on the trouble she helped create. In addition, some of the performances are also disappointing.However, ""Jurassic World"" is big-budget Hollywood at its best. Overall, it sets out to entertain and it does so quite well.RATING: * * *OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS: Special Effects, Set Design","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Those that are made usually do well if they can get above 7/10 on IMDB, they are usually lamented for being too far fetched or falling apart somewhere along the lines. I think Jurassic World is a classic blockbuster thrill ride done extremely well though. There is a lot of heart and the characters are fully fledged and presented in a way that you genuinely believe in them and root for them. It is difficult to put my finger on exactly how they achieved this where so many others struggle, it must be a combination of areas where there is excellent attention to detail to make this film really tight for our suspension of disbelief and capacity to buy into the movie.

"1","/10","Very weak film that should not be rated as high as it is on IMDB.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7647148/?ref_=tt_urv","balder777","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur115572916/?ref_=tt_urv","15 December 2021","This is probably the weakest entry in all 5 current Jurassic Park films. Everything about this film is extremely weak and formulaic, and devoid of creativity. It fails on everything that made the original great.1. The premise (a new park full of genetically modified Dinos) doesn't really make sense.2. The CGI and Dinosaurs do not feel threatening or real.3. The original was a somewhat silly story cloud under witty dialogue, a memorable cast, an underlying political message, and realistic & beautiful scenary and shots (by none other than Steven Spielberg). You have none of that here. What you have is a formulaic modern Hollywood B film with all it's cheap CGI and bad lines.What made the experience immensely worse are the two children characters, who are ridiculously obnoxious, and Bryce Dallas Howard's character who goes beyond obnoxiousness with terrible lines, and a sexualisation of the character (eventually running about half naked on stilettos whilst a T-Rex chases her) that felt forced and cringe-worthy.This is an objectively bad film. They did however fix many of the mistakes in the sequel (Fallen Kingdom), dispensing with the stupid characters, improving the action scenes, and making Bryce Dallas Howards' character actually somewhat loveable.So one may be able to give this film a pass as ""the first try in the reboot series"". The second is a definite improvement and the upcoming third might be a masterclass. Let's see.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Delivers on thrills and visuals, but don't expect much more","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3264131/?ref_=tt_urv","confrank","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26034614/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2015","Jurassic World, starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, comes approximately 14 years after the movie watching world gave up on ever getting a good Jurassic Park sequel. This time at least, we get a plotframe that is completely different from Jurssic Park 2 and 3. It's not greedy idiots sending lambs for slaughter to an island overrun by dinosaurs to be inevitably eaten. No, we actually have a functioning theme park! And people go there as a vacation now since it's ""safe"". What could possibly go wrong...?Everything is the answer you're looking for, and no thankfully I'm not talking about the quality of the overall film. When buying a ticket with ""Jurassic World"" written on it, a set of expectations and visions form in your brain of how this movie is going to take shape. Whatever you imagined, I'm almost certain you're mostly right. Like me, you will likely be neither disappointed or surprised (or rather, disappointed you weren't surprised).Whatever tales you may have heard about bad CGI are false. The park, the dinosaurs and the landscape look great. There's some minor enhancements to the dinosaur animatronix that some have complained don't look like real dinosaurs. If that's you, let me ask you this: have you ever actually seen a real dinosaur in person? Didn't think so.Then of course there's our huge ensemble of characters. Jurassic Park had a small group of intermingled characters that worked very well off each other and really felt like they were united in the conflict together. In World, we get more characters, more plots, and sadly, a much more bloated feel to it as all of these separate plots make the movie feel disconnected. Half of these plots feel like obligatory clichès, and more focus on a few characters would've likely created an atmosphere closer to the heartiness and emotional gravitas of the original.Jurassic World is primarily marketed as a kids movie, so I understood why they initially thought putting two kids as key characters may be a good idea. However, all they really contributed was an absolutely pointless family subplot, grungy and mopey child angst and about 20 minutes of the movie we didn't really need. Aside from the kids, the antagonists of the movie were essentially cartoons. Within the first 30 minutes, you were mentally pointing out which ones would die and what horrible death they would be subject to, most of the time with clairvoyant precision. I was really hoping to see some surprises here that defied the conventional blockbuster. Sadly, they didn't seem interested in showing up.The only character you can truly care about here is Chris Pratt's Owen. He's for the most part, the moral center of the story, and easily has all the best action scenes. He has a very 80's action hero feel to him and Chris Pratt's charismatic, likable cockiness feels like a return from the decade. It's no wonder this guy is being fan cast for almost every action movie reboot or video game based movie in production, as there's no doubt after his Jurassic World outing he could pull off seemingly any of them.Of course at the end of the day, the real stars are those ancient, scaly, rascals causing all the trouble. They're what get butts in the theater seats, and when they come to fight, it's a damn good time. A little more dino v. dino would've been great, but we get enough to satisfy our hunger. Still praying for a hilarious Jeff Goldblum cameo in the sequel.FINAL VERDICT: Jurassic World may suffer from bloatedness and predictability like any sequel is prone to do, but for a movie about dinosaurs wreaking havoc on a theme park, we get plenty of suspenseful thrills and exciting action scenes to satisfy our summer blockbuster craving.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

Chris Pratt is likable but one dimensional. He's the tough, fearless, no-nonsense hero throughout the film and we know little else about him. Vincent D'Onofrio, usually a very good actor, seems to be channeling Brian Dennehy as the predicable, one dimensional villain making a bad situation worse. Bryce Dallas Howard has the best part as a career company shill for JW, who never even got to know her nephews but must now risk her life to save them at the expense of the park she was so devoted to. The movie is pretty much non-stop dinosaurs fighting people and each other. With modern special effects being what they are these days, even that is becoming routine and not enough to save the stale story line. The movie can be mindless fun but nothing more.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

As far as the story line, I was expecting much more, I was expecting something completely different from the first three films and it was just a tired re-hash with fresh idea's in terms of dinosaurs but the human element of the film was boring.

This film certainly had great sound effects so the vibration of seats was a good one to experience.Coming to the film, there is no value add I got, apart from better visual and sound effects than the classic and original Jurassic Park made in 1993.

It's not anything outstanding but not a downer either. First let's start with what I like: The acting is great. It's a high breath of life after the atrocities that were in Lost World and JPIII. Chris Pratt doesn't overact to anything like you'd might expect in a Jurassic Park sequel. Also, there is more of a story than its predecessors, and the effects actually look as if they put effort into it. However, there is one major problem I have with the movie: It tries way too hard to be a monster movie, and not a science fiction film. It's going the 1998 Godzilla route and just trying to make everything go with the 3D. So to sum up, it's not bad, but it doesn't measure up to 1993's Jurassic Park.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Is a repeated Episode, is the same criticism that I have against lazy directors like J. J. Abrams in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I can not reward such amount of remake content with a positive score. If it were like a thing adapted to a movie for the first time it would be different, but this is clearly not the case. Another beef is the horrendous Jimmy Fallon cameo, he is the worst of all those talk show hosts, I think it was meant to be intentionally bad. But his real life cameo somewhat removes the timelessness of the original, so that moment somewhat hurts it a lot for me. I suppose it is still a little better than Force Awakens, but neither of those remakes is as good as the originals, even if VFX and acting are not good. Velociraptors are ok, Brice Dallas Howard too, and the meta comments which bump it above other lazy remakes like The Force Awakens but not quite near good. They gotta stop with this remake sequel and just jump to start with original sequels. If you put the ""new characters"" trough the same thing the original characters faced, then they aren't new and are as outdated as bad milk.

Jurassic World brings us something I think we've always wanted to see, a fully functioning Jurassic Park. What would that look like? How would people react? We caught a glimpse of the potential in the original but this is the first one to deliver on that huge, world changing mega park idea. The problem is, this whole movie is just a park ride. It's a flash in the pan, a long wait for a short payoff that's almost entirely derived on the notion of thrill over substance.We are firmly in the same world as the previous films. How in the world did this park get green lit? How many people have died from these dinos now and NOPE! Park still gotta park! We create animals that are sheer nonsense for a park and the loosely tied explanation is almost as nonsensical as the creatures themselves. Pratt is fine here, but he's really just Star-Lord with dinosaurs. Howard, bless her is trying something but I don't think it ever quite works. Thing is, the originals showed reverence for the creation, the heroes were all scientists, they understood things on a philosophical and scientific level that added texture and gravity. Pratt is just an action star, making this basically every action movie except this one has dinosaurs rather than aliens or robots. Howard is just a blasé member of management, giving us lines about T-Mobile sponsored attractions. The characters diminish the significance of all this. Pratt tries to remind us that these are animals but he speaks of raptors that are so atypical to everything we feel we know that it hardly matters.In the end, the curtain falls and credits rise and nothin changed. I feel no compulsion to ask what if, to explore the ethical ramifications of creation, no urge to quote lines. Instead, I want to laugh at it, to mock it. The meme of Howard outrunning a dino in heels rings through my head, the notion of Pratt training a raptor like its a dog, the military man somehow not understanding what they're working with and... None of it means a thing. Its just like the amusement park it emulates, fun in the moment but afterwards your sunburned, your feet hurt and you just want to go home.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It almost entirely omits the themes that make the concept itself interesting and it misses out on any engaging characters, through which we should be viewing these extraordinary events in order to actually care about them. It also manages to totally overload the original trilogy's computer-to-practical ratio, losing out on all components that could make its, admittedly sometimes impressive, visual effects seem truly believable. The CG always feels exactly as such and doesn't become an extension of the story or world, unable to elicit the wonder or fear it once did with ease twenty-five years ago. It doesn't help that most of the narrative is essentially nonsensical and every few moments there's something to roll your eyes at. Plot points provoke pained sighs as opposed to a widening of the eyes, and the exposition is so blatant that it's a wonder why you're shown anything at all. It gets to a point where you realise that the filmmakers don't trust you to understand their narrative and so tell you everything at least twice, even when it's right there on screen. The movie is more interested in showing you dinosaurs dealing out damage to one another than anything else, with the suspense the series is known for at perhaps its least prominent. It really is the lack of character, despite the many core players (who all consistently make unintelligent and unbelievable decisions, by the way), that puts the final nail in the coffin of this technologically advanced but entirely less believable sequel, though. It just goes to show you that the script is the most important thing, everything else is just filler. Filler is exactly what this feels like. 4/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

He decides to rebuild the park, a short distance from the original facilities, renaming it Jurassic World. However, they used new dinosaurs in addition to the historical ones, created with genetic crossing. Of course, things get out of control again and everything ends up bad.The worst of this film is extreme predictability. From the beginning, we know more or less what will happen and how it will end. It's just a matter of seeing the details. There are scenes that are truly copied from the previous films, with the addition of some make-up and effects to disguise a weak story and a recipe that has worn out a lot after three films. The lack of tension and sense of danger also disappoint. Even the worst sequels of ""Jurassic Park"" had moments where we felt that the characters could die there. Here, everything is artificial and controlled, like a video game.The cast is, to say the least, irregular. I liked the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt, even though Howard appears in a character who takes a long time to gain our sympathy and who seems quite cold and disconnected from reality in the initial half. Irrfan Khan did a good job by giving life to Masrani, who looks like the mix of a utopian idealist and an unscrupulous capitalist. Less interesting, because totally empty of dramatic value, are the performances of Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, which only exist to be in danger and to be saved, by BD Wong and Vincent D'Onofrio, the cliché of cold individuals who only care about money, and Katie McGrath, who only exists to be eaten alive!It is in the technical details and production values that we can guess how much money was actually invested in this film. The cinematography is very good, with good colors and some scenes and sequences impress by the visual beauty such as the landscapes of the new park, the scenes in the forest or even the walk between dinosaurs inside an electronic glass sphere. There are a lot of special effects and CGI involved, of very good quality. The sound effects, however, and particularly the roars, were recycled from previous films, as well as the soundtrack... but the soundtrack had to be present because it is one of the most iconic ever in cinema!In conclusion ... the film is a production that probably would be excused, as it recycles a formula that has long lost interest in the expectation of making it attractive by throwing it money. It did not work well, with the irregular cast performance and the weak script, without life or emotion, being decisive for the failure. However, it was still able to entertain. You can see it once, but it's not a movie I'd like to revisit.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The sequels that followed paled in comparison to the original, but still retained a sense of fun and understanding. Cut to 2015. Thank you Colin Trevorrow. Thank you for uninspiringly and atrociously murdering an already quality declining franchise that land-marked my childhood. Jurassic World went through development hell, a roulette of screenwriters and directors that at one point or another were deemed unfit or felt the story needed betterment. It's all the more revolting that the final product we were given is such a lazy, blunt and appalling rehash or update of the original entry. Every plot point is uninspired, every single idea is pedestrianly realised and every look overly stylized and saturated. As a devout film fan myself, whose list of guilty pleasure or so-bad- that's-so-good films is almost embarrassing to admit, I found(ind) that Jurassic World cannot in anyway qualify to any of such categories. This is a franchise that I followed as I grew up, spawned by one of the most marvelous films ever made; this fourth entry though managed to shamelessly spit on its legacy, reduce it to laziness and banality, to a level of insulting dullness. Once more, let us thank and grant Trevorrow such honour.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Only the visual effects people seem to be doing a good job.Colin Trevorrow does not seem to be a very good director when it comes to directing actors, almost as bad as George Lucas. I think he's a hack. I didn't like his direction and his editorial choices in Safety Not Guaranteed either, huge chunks of that film should have been removed.The musical score of JW is very average and frequently lays on the syrup. I think it's partially a consequence of the very poor direction. The job of music is to score the actual emotion in the scene, due to the sub-par direction there is very little emotion in scenes, hence why the music is so jarring.And even the production design itself was a underwhelming. It did not feel like a significant place to visit.It seems to me that the most talented people these days are working in American TV, while cinema has the dregs and the ""former greats"" going through the motions for a big payday.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

I got very bored about 20 minutes in as it was all so very predictable - including the ending. I appreciate it is very hard for film ""franchises"" to do something surprising in the sequels (Alien, Jaws, Star Wars, etc etc) but this film was so transparent it spoiled the viewing. I also found the gender stereotypes quite annoying and even insulting. At best this was something to do on a cold and wet July evening and at worst was a waste of money. I get the feeling that the financial backers want a safe formula so as to make a profit. Seldom do I see an idea that I think is bigger than the film these days - and when will the financial backers and directors ever learn that CGI cannot make up for a powerful story?

In this case, structure wise it is pretty much a reboot of the first movie, ignoring the continuity of the lesser sequels. There does exist some winks and nods to the other movies, but this is meant to be a new starting point for the series. Both this one and the original take place in a dinosaur theme park where a dinosaur breaks loose and must be stopped. The difference in this one, aside from general quality and novelty, is now the park has been opened to the public. Since this is not a reboot, but a canonical sequel, this begs the question: how stupid would people have to be to make the same mistake again?The movie is in a hurry to get to its dino break out and eat people part of the story. To get to this point as quick as possible, the characters make a series of idiotic decisions in order to create a deadly dino and have it out in the park. First the company needs to make a super smart, camouflaging, blood thirsty monster. Second, they need to ignore the signal tacking and send people into the cage to investigate where the dino went. Third, the guards need to open up the big dino door and let them out and about. Finally, once the dino is out, keep the park open to give the dinos as much to eat as possible.The effects of this movie do not hold up as well as the 1993 original. And more importantly, the characters in this film are not remotely as memorable or likable as those in the original. The scares aren't as good, the awe and wonder, nothing is as good as the first. But they are arguably better than the sequels.The villain's plan to weaponize the raptors is hilarious. The way he leaves the movie gave me the biggest laugh of the movie. There are a handful of moments loaded with simple dumb pleasure. Raptors running with motorcycles, dinosaurs teaming up to attack other dinosaurs, and dinosaurs breaking loose and attacking a park full of people. The movie has its moments, just don't go into it expecting high caliber entertainment. The movie isn't saying anything new, it's a pure popcorn flick.Don't expect the next Jurassic Park, but it can still be an entertaining theme park ride.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There's a few great action shots, and the production value is adequate for the time. They weirdly use CGI for parts that could easily be practical (Velociraptor heads in the peculiar wall muzzles), so it's definitely not aged as well. But, it's serviceable.The Indominus Rex design is actually pretty solid, and the concept of them experimenting with genetics to make more crowd-pleasers is a believably natural evolution in the 'scientist-playing-god' area the series started off in. The concept of training raptors, is pretty good. The concept of the park re-opening is also: good.But the reasoning is dumb.Re-opening the park when they're clearly not prepared is dumb. These are massive deadly creatures, why is there no contingencies? Why is the 8th richest man in the world scared about losing a few million dollars worth over people's lives and the park closing down completely?Training raptors for the military is dumb. Do the script writers even understand modern warfare? What do they do better than modern tech? Dogs can smell incredibly well. Raptors? They can run fast I guess?The Indominus Rex being made because people 'find dinosaurs boring' is-you guessed it-dumb. We can see the park filled with the crowd going insane over these creatures. And sure, the characters might just be dumb. But they're not really presented as such. Surely they could come up with a better reason to play with genetics. And yes, I'm aware 'dumb' is too prevalent in the review, but it was prevalent in the film too, and I had to sit through it.But hey, maybe the characters redeem the plot?Chris Pratt plays... Chris Pratt.Bryce Dallas Howard has the most complete arc, and I didn't mind her character so much. But, I don't even remember her name. That first film I remember all the characters, even Dr Wu. He's in the first film for like, 2 minutes. The kids do a decent job, but again it's hard to believe the older kid not being interested in dinosaurs. Is there other parks on the mainland they've been exposed to? And the subplot around their parents is rather odd. Couldn't they learn from Jurassic Park III that nobody really cares about divorce in their dinosaur sci-fi movies.Just, talk about the morals and ethics of the park. It's open and working; there's so much to explore.I really wish I liked this movie more. But I think it's dumb. Lots of bizarre writing choices for a convoluted script make it hard for me to enjoy. And the problem is, I remember liking Fallen Kingdom even less. Me and my friend are watching through the series slowly, and I am absolutely dreading the next entry. But hey, maybe its smaller scale narrative will be better on a rewatch? Maybe one day I'll get over the fact that none of the Jurassic Park sequels get close to the quality of that glorious first film. Though, as I've said before, perhaps it's apt that they never match the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jurassic World, the fourth movie in the franchise, packs none of the first film's punch. Instead, ""World"" wastes the potential for suspense on huge amounts of surprisingly cheap-looking CGI, a ludicrous storyline and completely flat, uninteresting characters.This is a high budget movie that looks like a cheap knockoff.

Both assured that this film would take the franchise back to its roots- thus introducing all of the wonder and enthusiasm that surrounded the first two entries of the series. After seeing this movie, I must say that no film has ever left me so confused and utterly disappointed. The premise is unfathomably stupid. The cruel, simple truth is that Jurassic World aspires to be far greater than its writers intended. By that, I mean that any film that is added to a legacy of notorious blockbusters should continue in their footsteps. Many other reviewers of this picture have made claims as to why the first two films in the series were so successful, but for the sake of argument, can we not agree that practical effects, realistic dialogue, and a certain tone of seriousness significantly contributed to the success of those films? None of the components listed above are to be found in Jurassic World. If anything, the film lays out a rigid set of moral rules that approach issues such as genetic modification, corporate greed, and social injustices, yet, does not seem to adhere to them in any fashion. The film flows as if it is ignorant of its own contradictions, with the sole purpose to ""entertain"". And entertain it does in some form, but once again, the first two entries did more than that- they confronted us in our seats with moral dilemmas that not only advanced character development, but questioned the moral fiber of the scientific and corporate communities at large. Although a disappointment to the die-hard Jurassic fan, the film isn't a complete failure. Certain scenes were shot beautifully with a high amount of tension present, but this was never the result of anything more than fancy camera angles and expensive equipment brought forth by a studio that is in pursuit of the ""almighty dollar"". There's nothing special here. Don't get excited. You will be sorely disappointed.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

When I first heard about a new Jurassic Park movie (back in 2006), We already had heard word it was going to be called ""Jurassic World"" But we didn't know about it and plans for the movie were still in the beginning phases, it didn't help that 2 years later Micheal Crichton died and all word about another Jurassic Park movie went silent. Now (2015) several months before the release, I heard word again about Jurassic World. It brought back thoughts I had in 2006 that it would be another flop like ""Jurassic Park III"" After finding the first teaser trailer and seeing the Jurassic World website and going so far to create a few more fictional websites to really dig in and build up the internal universe of the movie I thought ""Ok maybe this will be good after all"" since they were going the extra mile to bring more of the fiction to reality.I went in with high hopes since they were trying to make this feel as real as possible and I pushed aside the thoughts I had years and months back, So I went into the theater with expectations up rather high, yet I came out saddened, it wasn't good at all. I over-hyped myself hoping it would be good. Yet it didn't deliver. Maybe I'm jaded by the original Jurassic Park and the Micheal Crichton Novels. But there was seriously no magic to this film.The first Jurassic Park was magical since it was one of the first films to display dinosaurs in a way we had never seen before. Before Jurassic Park, all we had was Claymation. Jurassic Park was one of the first films to display dinosaurs realistically. Today it is dated, but it still holds that magic every time you see it. It was a rather magical thrill ride.The second film ""The Lost World"" while it wasn't as good as the first one, it wanted to continue the story of International Genetics (Ingen) and wanting to bring John Hammond's Dream to life except this time in California at an abandoned Jurassic Park Amphitheater. And it had some of the magic but it was very much a fast paced action adventure ride that was hanging on the coat tails of the first film.The Third one cut out the ingen storyline, but continued the idea that man should not try to play god with genetic engineering. It left itself down to being a fast paced action ride instead. Which is really the beginning of the end of the Jurassic Park franchise.The new one tries way to hard to capture the magic of the first one and try to pretty much retell the story of Jurassic Park again except with an opened theme park, and even bring back Ingen as a security/military division of the Masrani Company that acquired it some years back (based on the fictional details from the Jurassic World website and the tie in fictional Masrani company website.)And seems they automatically went back to square one with Ingen. Instead of having learned the lessons of John Hammond and his nephew from the second film, they are back and intend to do more than just help the Masrani company with there Jurassic World theme park, they have other intentions that involve certain modified Dinosaur Embryo's.And just like with the last film they have to introduce an even bigger bad ass dinosaur that can outclass the T-Rex. Except... This new one isn't an actual dinosaur with fossil records, this one is a 100% engineered dinosaur based on several creatures rather than that a dinosaur that has a bit of frog DNA to help recreate it. And I'm not spoiling anything by saying this. This is stuff that can be found on the Jurassic World website. Stuff you could pick up before the films release.The story is the biggest problem I have with it. It's utterly predictable, with what seems to be a bunch of idiots that seem to have failed to understand WHY the original Jurassic Park failed. Not only are they so over confident and seem to have no humility at the fact at a possibility the park COULD fail. Especially with the genetic engineering of there animals (remember the first film?)... But that the filmmakers had to sneak a hint in early on in the film to blatantly state ""Murphy's Law is about to happen people,"" I mean I kinda had expected the film would be a little predictable and follow the formula of the last 3 films, I didn't expect the film to shove it in my face about 10 minutes into the film to tell me it's going to be predictable.And from there it's just the same old formula. Boys go to park, Wowed by attractions, Park owners over confident and inept, Something happens, People get killed, Dinosaurs on lose, all hell breaks lose, boys get lost, boys found and get back to park, park is being rampaged by dinosaurs, They somehow escape the island, Not a single one of the main characters your suppose to care about die at the end, literally the end.If you think I spoiled anything there. I honestly didn't. The movie is THAT PREDICTABLE! It's as predictable as any of the teen slasher movies like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Halloween"", even ""Scream"".Do yourself a favor and save your money, wait till this thing is out at Redbox or even Netflix and then make your decision on whether you like it or not.Because it is not worth seeing in theaters.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Complete with rides, free range dinosaurs and a monstrous king of dinosaurs, what could possibly go wrong (again)...?I wasn't a fan of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World just seems like the same central plot, set in a different location, with different characters and 2015 CGI. Plot is pretty basic - humans develop dinosaurs from DNA, put them in a park, they run amok (much scenes of humans being gobbled) but are somehow defeated. Oh, and throw in some out-of-the-blue, no context, implausible romance too, in case the movie wasn't stupid enough.Characters are one-dimensional and pretty much cardboard cutouts of your your standard action/horror movie categories. There's the sensitive hero, the neutral party who becomes a hero, the well- meaning person who causes the calamity (and tends to die), the unlikable guy who you know is going to meet a sticky end at the hand of the dinosaurs, a wise ass who makes heaps of cynical quips but never contributes anything constructive, hapless kids, other innocents caught in the middle whose survival depends on how innocent they actually are, and/or how nondescript they are (more nondescript means more expendable).There's a pretense of setting the scene for the movie, but this really just wastes time and pads the film. We all know that the dinosaurs are going to start munching on humans at some point, so get to it!

One of my favorite phrases of hers is, instead of ""I don't like it"", she proudly proclaims ""I CAN'T like it."" This saying can help with referring to situations in which, no matter how hard you try, you simply are unable to enjoy something. This perfectly encapsulates my feelings for Jurassic World, the uneven follow-up to one of the greatest blockbusters ever. With weak writing and thin characters, I simply can't fully relish in the decent thrills, marginal humor and slight wonder. The story follows the formula to-a-tee: naïve awe, something goes wrong, people die. The film tries to pinpoint this, openly commenting on how jaded audiences are no longer impressed with seeing dinosaurs; they must be bigger, cooler, and have more teeth. This provides for some fun science-vs-business dialogue and cool chaotic amusement park set-pieces, providing some truly great Jurassic moments. Unfortunately in the end, JW is less like a film and more like Universal trying to boost ticket sales for their theme parks, with laughable dialogue and way too many characters to invest in. The failures here are not from lack of trying, but recapturing the magic of the 1993 classic is proving to be almost impossible. The references to that first film are nice, but it only serves as a reminder that we aren't watching that original masterpiece. In JW, the effects are less-convincing, the animatronics are all-but non-existent, and the emotions feel cheaper. So while it may be entertaining enough for a first viewing, it won't be an enduring classic. And I can't like it.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Well, here's an opportunity to easily write something better. ""Predictable"", and ""trope"" hardly do justice to the production-line effort to make money.The film starts with a couple sending off their two sons to Jurassic World. Pointlessly, it transpires they are in the throes of a divorce. Is the unfolding adventure going to bring them together? We never find out - so why include it? At one point, thousands of pterodactyls escape - as the film ends, they are all still out there somewhere unless they are homing pterodactyls.Bryce Dallas Howard starts off as the killer business Exec, with in minutes she realises the futility of this and reverts to the weak female and from then on sets back all progress in gender-equality and obviously wants to be a housewife and have lots of babies with the Pratt character.Pratt's character, the dinosaur trainer (yes, I know... a dinosaur trainer) is the clean-cut hero you've seen millions of times: you know he's immortal and will have a few good lines... he has two in 124 minutes.The basis of the story revolves around the ""trainability"" of Velociraptors and the idea that they can communicate and plan better than the average human. OK, this comes from the ""Jurassic Park"" - but Velociraptors having a conversation with an overgrown T-Rex...? Yeah, I agree, it's OK for kids... but not if you're over 10.There is the standard mad scientist, the standard megalomaniac and deluded villain (just like Jurassic Park) I suppose they are there to use up the discarded words from earlier Jurassic scripts.Why 4/10?

Every time they've unveiled a new attraction attention has spiked. But for the past few years it's been slowly declining. People just aren't fascinated by dinosaurs anymore. So, they decide to make a new one. Cooler, deadlier and bigger than any dinosaur to walk this earth. Pretty much THE definition of Murphy's Law.""Corporate felt genetic modification would up the 'wow' factor.""""They're dinosaurs, 'WOW' enough.""I put that quote in there as I believe if there was ever a line within a movie that perfectly explained how idiotic and unbelievable the films plot will be. That's probably it. Now I don't l know about anyone else, but I can guarantee you I would never get bored of seeing a T- Rex. I don't believe for a single second that people would lose interest in that. There are movies I can watch over and over again and never get bored of. So I can promise you if there was a way I could see an alive and breathing T-Rex. I would see that every single day.What is Jurassic World? It's intense, it's suspenseful but above all else, it's REALLY fun. On sheer entertainment value it's one of the best I've seen so far this year. Behind Mad Max and Kingsman. Even though it's not human the Indominous Rex is one of my favorite movie characters so far this year. That thing was Super cool. She ate a ton of people, violently might I add, this movie was extremely graphic for a PG-13. She was deadly (Obviously, i mean it's a dinosaur), smart and really coolThat brings me to my second point. The I-Rex was written better than 80% of the characters in this film. You've got kind of a sub-villain who is basically a cartoon of every person in a movie who wants to take something and use it as a weapon. He basically wants to take the Raptors you see Pratt training in the trailer and use them for war. Which if you ask me is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. There is no logical scenario I can think of where that doesn't end badly for you.I wasn't a huge fan of the humour. I'm probably in the minority but I didn't like Jake Johnson's character. Like, at all. The only reason he's there is to add comedic relief. The only problem was I didn't find him at all funny. I didn't laugh at any of his lines. The all felt forced like they were just trying to lighten the mood, but failing. They were just snide comments like that one kid in school who always argues with and talks back to the teacher just to get some social recognition. He was a completely pointless additional character IMO, the movie would have played out exactly the same without him.The scene from the trailer where we see Owen slide under the truck was kind of like the kitchen scene of Jurassic Park, just not as good IMO. It was suspenseful, heart pounding and it showed the intelligence of his character, because we don't want dumb characters in a movie like this. Well, we don't want TOO many of them. Every time the I-Rex was on screen I was glued to it, you could not divert my attention if you was on fire. I was kind of worried that we see too much of her and the suspense wouldn't be there. The most memorable part of the original is that we didn't see the T-Rex until 50 minutes in, which built the tension, built the suspense. But what this movie does is utilize the characters in such a way that you feel like you're stuck in the situation with them and THAT gave us that tension. That fear. I just feel the original did it better. But then again, comparing this to the original is just inane, I mean it was Steven Spielberg.I don't know if it's just the scripts that are written for him or the kid himself, but I really don't like Ty Simpkin as an actor. I didn't like him in Insidious, I didn't like him in Iron Man 3 and I don't like him in this. He just bugs me. He's basically a packed sandwich and every character he plays is just adding an extra slice of annoyance after each movie. His character was there for no other reasons other than to be saved and add pointless subplots, same with his on screen brother. They were in the movie just to be put in danger so Pratt and Bryce would have a reason to risk there lives. Just to add a certain amount of emotion, but i didn't feel the emotion. The characters weren't written well enough.Owen (Chris Pratt) however was great, other than the dinosaurs he was my favorite part of the movie. He was the only one who really had any intelligence. If i'm completely honest, he was really the only interesting human character. I would go as far to say he was kind of a Jeff Goldblum homage. He spoke like Ian Malcolm did, he had the great charisma as Ian Malcolm did. He acknowledge how bad of an idea creating a Dinosaur is (Which to be honest. Shouldn't everyone?) just like Malcolm did. The movie is self aware of the original but I think it beats you over the head with it until you get the message.In a movie like this I don't really care if it's predictable, i don't care if it's not the most cohesive story ever written. That's not what i'm going into this movie for. I'm here to see gargantuan dinosaurs and watch people get eaten. And on that note the movie more than delivers. If you go into this expecting award winning story telling, You'll be disappointed.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

Take one disaster McGuffin, (in this case a genetically created monster but could just as easily be an earthquake or a shark or a sinking ship or invading aliens etcetera) add earthy scientist to whom nobody listens, military Secret Man who wants the McGuffin for a weapon, business type who just wants profit, chuck in some kids-in-danger (always a must), divorcing couple whose relationship problems are miraculously solved by destroying the McGuffin and a couple of nerds to do the 'Tech Speak' and there you go, one disaster movie. I personally found the dinosaurs had far more personality than any of the characters. Why can't Hollywood spend just a little more on hiring decent writers who can build believable, rounded characters and original scenarios? The actors did a fair job with the material they'd been dumped with but none of them could raise their characters above cliché.Once the monsters get going it's a good romp with great special effects and that is the saving grace of an otherwise very badly written movie.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Of course you do. It's a fun little moment. But it's also an easy joke and a sour, callous moment in a film that otherwise is pretty respectful of the life and death stakes at play in its scenario. Well, the makers of Jurassic World, mad little scientists of cinema that they are, take all the narrative DNA of the original film they can get their mitts on and pump in a whole lot of the toilet scene DNA to fill gaps in the chain and beef it up to modern standards. The resulting film is occasionally enjoyable on the lowest level of sensation, but mostly an onerous exercise in empty spectacle devoid of wit or humanity.Despite the lip service this pays to Spielberg's comparably towering original, this new dino epic inverts nearly every element that made the first entry work so well and endure to this day. Chief among this is the original film's absolute love of science. Yes, the ultimate message is the danger of science overstepping its boundaries, but our main characters were two paleontologists and a mathematician. Here we must settle for Chris Pratt's ex-Navy man (I never thought a film could put me in the position of finding Chris Pratt unlikeable, but here we are) and a host of faceless paramilitary jug-heads. The strain of militarism runs deeply in the film (despite its pretensions otherwise) and combined with a general lack of humanity forcing me to the point of outright rooting for every human to be gobbled up whole and never heard from again.Colin Trevorrow, likely in a misguided attempt to apologize for not being Spielberg, throws limp dick semi-satire all around the periphery to no real avail. It's telling that this film cues up John Williams iconic theme with shots of a theme park thoroughfare dotted with corporate logos. Hey, Starbucks. 'Sup, Brookstone. Hiya, Samsung. Hang loose, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville. For all its hip po-mo posturing, this is an oppressively imagination-free affair, a sponsored dinosaur of a film, Comcast/NBC/Universal Pictures Presents Nostalgia Tinged Blockbuster 2015.In his 1993 review of Jurassic Park, Ebert lamented that film's lack of awe and wonder. Perhaps he was right, but there was genuine terror and at least a cursory streak of humanity. The only such sensations dredged up by Jurassic World are a blood-thirsty cackle here and there. The problem isn't that the film appeals to our most base instincts, it's that it fails to satisfy them fully.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I like Chris Pratt and he's decent in this, but the script is absolutely atrocious. There's no sense of purpose to anything happening or the filmmaking, other than to remind the audience of other far better movies. There are homages and nods to Spielberg's prior filmography and I picked up a little Hitchcock influence, but this film doesn't pair these allusions or inside jokes with anything marginally original. The CGI is good but with such a poor script, two dimensional characters and no real vision the film just goes nowhere and ends with a laughable conclusion. It's basically a glossy extended Mercedes commercial. Don't waste your money!","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's one of those movies that you can't really hate, but you don't necessarily love. The graphics are great and the idea terrifying, so what more could you ask for from a movie about dinosaurs? There is plenty of action to go around and keep you involved and a variety of new dinosaur attractions to make the movie seem fresh. But that is not to say the movie didn't have problems, the story as a whole was average at best. But who goes into a movie about dinosaurs expecting a strong character driven thriller? There is not much to say here, this is a popcorn movie pure and simple and it exceeds as such.But the main reason holding the movie back from being considered great is that the trailers show just about everything the movie has to offer. From the trailers alone we see the Indominus Rex close up, tame raptors, the gyro-spheres, the mosasaurus (the giant alligator dinosaur), the pteranodon attacking from the sky, and the creators confirming if the tyrannosaurus rex would be in the film or not. The movie left hardly any surprises in the actual movie to make it something special. Not to mention the overall story being extremely predictable, from the downfall of the Indominus Rex, to Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard character's relationship with one another. Jurassic World is about as straightforward as you could expect.While Jurassic World isn't the best action movie of the year, it's still quite incredible and breathtaking because of the science both behind the camera (CGI) and in-front of the camera (the park design and the Indominus Rex). It's a fun movie that certainly has its faults, mostly thanks to the marketing team, but there is still something satisfying about watching dinosaurs destroy everything in their path.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

Jurassic park was and still is one of the most influential and magical movies of all time. To this day, the special effects are still amazing!! And the characters are unforgettable, the sequel was highly underrated but still couldn't live up to the first. I personally haven't seen part 3 in a while so I won't comment on it. But Jurassic world on the other hand...to sum it up, I think it was forgettable and blended in with everything else Hollywood is giving us today. I especially think it's sad that most of this generation loves and has seen this movie without even seeing the first! And when you type up Jurassic on Google, Jurassic world automatically comes up first! Not the original?! It's Also funny how this movie has cgi that is so obviously computer generated, and the actors aren't interacting with anything organic; when in the original, yes there was cgi but there was also A LOT of puppets and animatronics that the actors can interact with. Overall this movie isn't special, or anything new. It's just forgettable.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

So its, not like I was thrown a curved ball of garbage. Movie starts out excellent. Your given a world that you've never seen before. In fact its just as beautiful and new as the old movie. So yes, you are blown back. You see some of the trained dinosaurs. It wasn't totally lame, and it was somewhat unbelievable. We move to the genetically enhanced dinosaur and the roller coaster ride starts immediately. I think it was quite lazy if you ask me. Like they ran out of imagination and just started the movie way to fast. Before that, you do see some similarities to the old movie. You see the same genetic scientist from the first movie who Dr. Grant was talking to about the raptors being made on the island and Malcom was debating about life finding away. You also see that someone else took over that old dude's dream of making a park. Anyhow, you see like in every movie that there is evil people trying to control nature. It worked well in the first film, but it really fell apart after that. You'd think they'd get the point. Spielberg likes to push this idea of people not being able to control nature. But its done so many times before that its pretty dumb now. I can't believe the security on the island decided to battle the dinosaur hybrid with raptors for crying out loud. Its pretty dumb. The genetics guy gets taken off the island before the end by the remaining security and makes it possible for another Jurasic failure. Throughout the movie you are given way to many impossible scenarios so that Spielberg's message can be scene. The two major problems with the film is that one, its the same story plot as every other Jurassic film. Seriously, its kind of boring and lame, and shows lack of imagination. Secondly, the film becomes a confusing type of film. Is it a dinosaur film? Is it a science fiction freak film? The film was violent. But except for the beginning you don't feel that dinosaur aspect. You feel more of a freak/horror film science film feel afterwards. Its not a good film, but like myself, I really needed to see it for myself because I really didn't know what to expect. I think it makes you to curious. But pretty much, your getting exactly what your thinking before you go in to watch it.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

With great trailer but seems to fail to satisfy people when the movie shot the theater.I should say that this movie have many ways to expand better. But unfortunately the director's lack of experience was made this movie nearly unmagical and less catchy. My conclusion is the script, storyline, acting (except Pratt), was a medium range.A failed using of CGI with an intention to give magical expression to viewers was a huge mistake. Spending so many budget for a hope to give a magical things like spielberg did. The only scene which impress me only when mossasaurus's appear, besides that it was empty. But we already seen that mossasaurus in trailer right, too bad i got no surprise.A wide range of actors also made this movie low-rated. Trevorrow's intention was wanted to lower the budget and increasing the movie's popularity in some region. So he cast vary actors from many regions. But it were all failed. Nothing giving a marveolus perform with a drama-force sci-fi film, even the leading role herself (Dallas Howard). Maybe it's only because of lacking experience. I hope he grow someday to be better.No such magical sensation, with mediocre performance from actors and actress. Drama-force sci-fi storyline with an intention to develop a connection between dinosaur with humans. Jurassic World was lacking things that only Spielberg can bought to. It was called Magic !","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

I was only a wee lad when the first Jurassic Park came out ( OK, a teenage wee lad, but still ). The only live action dinosaurs I had ever seen were the rubbery land of the lost style claymation ones, so a film with realistic giant lizards just blew my mind. With each subsequent film though, I watched with increasing disappointment as they seemed to run out of ideas and milked the concept dry. After Jurassic Park III came out in 2001 a pale imitation of the original, it seemed as though the franchise had finally burned itself out and I was fine with that.Still, a decade and a half later when they announced a new Jurassic movie I found myself getting excited despite my previous misgivings. It seemed as though they had found a way to revitalize the concept; instead of a constant parade of rich idiots trying and failing to harness the power of an extinct world, we instead got to witness a Jurassic World theme park fully realized. Disney, but with dinosaurs. And with Chris Pratt as the leading man, having just starred in the Guardians movie as a surprisingly good action hero, I was really looking forward to seeing him as a no-nonsense dino wrangler.And to be fair, he is one of the things the movie gets right. The Jurassic movies have always had a certain ""fall to your knees before mother nature"" flavor of preachiness to them, one that screeched to a crescendo with Vince Vaughn's Van Owen character in The Lost World. And Pratt's character Owen has that same undertone, but delivered in a much more balanced and palatable format that makes its point without being overbearing. Add to that fourteen years of improvements in CGI that makes dinosaurs so realistic you can almost believe they are out there somewhere and it seems like a winning combination. Seriously, even the first Jurassic Park, as groundbreaking as it was, had moments where you could see through the illusion. Not so here. The dinosaurs in JW are so life-like that you pretty much never get pulled out of the story by the visuals. If I was an actor, I would be seriously concerned about where these capabilities will be in another decade or two.But unfortunately, this brings us to the end of what JW did right. There are a lot of little things that annoyed me in the film, but really it boils down to two big things. The first is just that the entire thing is not believable. I don't mean impossible; with many movies you have something that would make the story impossible in the real world. A McGuffin, if you will. You start with the real universe, the one you and I live in, and you add something to it. Maybe it's faster than light spaceships, or time travel, or maybe it's a shockingly dangerous school to teach children magic. As a viewer you can suspend disbelief for whatever it is and just enjoy the story. What is important is that after you have made your changes to the universe your story from that point on has to be consistent with the rules you have established; characters have to behave in a way that is logically consistent with the universe you have created or the audience will feel like you are manipulating them.So if you have created a world that is just like ours except that there are hordes of flesh eating zombies all around, and then have a character that lives in that world get killed while they chill in a backyard hammock, singing at the top of their lungs, eyes closed listening to their IPod, it will tick people off *because nobody who lived in that world would ever do that*. You know, unless they were suicidal or something. That's what I mean about believable.And this is where JW breaks down in a big way. Obviously they need for something to go wrong so that the dinosaurs can break loose and create mayhem, but they choose to do it in a way that is completely inconsistent with how anyone in that world would actually behave. They have them make decisions that are so obscenely stupid that you almost find yourself hoping they will get eaten just as punishment for being so cartoonishly arrogant and foolhardy. And then three quarters of the way through the movie they double down on the gambit and do it again! It shatters the illusion. I'm not going to go into details because I don't want to post spoilers, but trust me; you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.The second major problem I had with the movie is about how females are portrayed in it. The friend I went to see the movie with is a woman, and she was kind of upset by the heavy 'damsel in distress' theme of the movies only major female character, who is one of the aforementioned characters making obnoxiously stupid decisions during the film. Her role seems to primarily be to put thousands of people in mortal danger and then to run around screaming and cowering behind Pratt. And I mean really, we live in a post-Katniss world now people. She took down a fascist regime with just a bow and arrow; a woman can kick *ss and melt the heart, I think. Do we really need to cling to this saved by the big strong man theme anymore?Anyway, the last thing I'll mention is that I saw the film in IMAX 3D and I have to say that it didn't add much to the experience. A few cool helicopter scenes, but that was about all. If you are going to see it, stick with the standard viewing and save a few bucks.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

The underlying theme is STILL that man cannot control nature and that a dino park will by some unknown law of the universe inevitably collapse. This is nonsense, and it's one of the weaknesses of the original film as well. Why do these films have to preach some pseudo-philosophy? Why can't they just be about the wonder of dinosaurs or the thrill of walking among them or being hunted by them? Why is there always some b.s. Hanging over these films?Of course, they have now added a new theme: trying to use dinosaurs as weapons of war is also bound to fail. And that is actually true, but we don't need to sit through two hours of people trying to use these beasts as weapons in order to learn that it's a bad idea. Of course it's a bad idea. It is a terrible idea. No one can control these things. They are incredibly difficult to maintain. They need massive cages and tons of food, and they can turn on their handlers. They will attack both friend and foe, and ravage any civilians they run into. And anyone armed with an automatic weapon, i.e. Any contemporary soldier. Will be able to shoot them dead. Sending dinos to attack soldiers armed with machine guns is as dumb as sending a bunch of elephants. They don't stand a chance. There, I answered your dumb question about whether or not dinos could be used by the military. But of course, we have to watch the entire film to reach that conclusion. Except we don't. In the sequel they just kept that retarded idea going.Now, let's look at the characters. None are interesting. There are some dull kids, an annoying strong and empowered woman who is so out of touch with not only femininity but humanity that she can't even bring herself to hug her nephews, a moron who genuinely believes dinos would be the best weapon imaginable, and our would-be hero who has no charisma and runs around in a silly vest that makes him look gay.Nonsense in this film starts early, as the film annoyingly wants to make a point that the strong and empowered woman is neglecting the kids that have come to visit the park. Now, she actually runs the park on her own, yet her sister somehow imagined that she would have the time to spend several days with her kids. Where did she get that crazy idea? Does she have a clue about what it means to run a dino world that covers an entire island?Then we get to hear some boring speeches from the guy that wants to use dinos for military purposes. Everything he says is literally retarded.But then everyone starts acting like a retard. They enter the enclosure with a monster dino in it because they couldn't be bothered to check whether or not it's in there. They send a dozen guys with toothpicks to try and stop a gigantic beast. The kids decide to disobey orders and try and get themselves killed. Everyone here is an imbecile, particularly the writers whose lazy writing is pure convenience for the plot, but a slap in the face of the viewers.Oh, at one point a woman in heels outruns a T-Rex. Need I say more?How they managed to make dinosaurs this boring is beyond me. Zero stars.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But again, the way characters interact, the following of the plot, it is just, so amateur, this kind of stuff happened in 90's or early 2000's. Come on it is fricking 2015. I believe CGI and some good acting and roots of this movie got it a 7.0 on IMDb. But it should not have. This is 5.0 even when you try to be very optimistic about it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Then you'd figure they would've learned the lesson in the sequels, but no. They mention continually in ""World"" that cloning dinosaurs en masse in an enclosed space is a bad idea, but hey: we've got fences now!The twist in ""World"" is that they cross-clone dinosaurs. The star of this episode is the ""indominus rex"" (eye roll) which is basically just a bigger version of the T-rex from the first film. They give it the DNA of apex predator, long grabby arms, and the brain of Adolf Hitler--what could possibly go wrong?Chris Pine, an actor who got his start by playing fat fools, plays an American war veteran who also, somehow, is an expert dinosaur trainer (WTF?) who attempts to assert authority in the film with wise, wildman insight. At one point in tracking the ""indominus"" (jeez) they come across a dead dinosaur. Pine's character remarks, ""It's not eaten! The indominus is killing for sport!"" Oooooh, if we didn't hate the indominus before, we really hate 'im now. Being a genetic freak is one thing, but hunting for sport is just unacceptable.The movie continually reminds and tells us how 'cool' Chris Pine's character is: from the kids telling the female lead ""your boyfriend's a badass,"" to them asking her if they can stay with him. Chris Pine, however, is no alpha. He's a clueless git who happens to have a thick neck, and whenever he tries to strike a serious face he couldn't look more stupid. And none of the other cast have much charisma either. Except for maybe Judy Greer. (And the guy playing her husband seems more like an alpha than Pine.)There's kind of a novel twist on the formula halfway through where the dumb humans use dinosaurs as hunting dogs, but the way they run and are shaped makes them look like big chickens. John William's score is distracting and gets in the way, and the movie is a multicoloured mess.Avoid.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We follow brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell on their visit to the park, where their aunt Claire Dearing is the park's operations manager. She leaves the boys in the hands of her assistant because she is to busy with the park latest attraction: a super predator named Indominus‍ rex. Claire asks the best ranger of the park, Owen Grady, to inspect the paddock of the Indominus rex but they find no sign of the creature. Can the new park handle this situation of a super predator on the run? And what's up with navy veteran Owen Grady who suggests to use the dinosaurs for military use? And are the brothers Mitchell safe? Jurassic world is basically the same movie as the very first one, only now the park has survived it's test runs and is open to the public. The park looks great on screen and you can imagine that this is the park that John Hammond had in mind in the first film.I liked Chris Pratt in his role as park ranger and Vincent D'Onofrio did a good job as well portraying the military involvement in the park. The brothers Mitchell were better left out of the film as there is no chemistry between them whatsoever. I had the feeling they are just there to have the Indominus rex something to chase and Chris Pratt something to rescue. And while the action scenes look great, it's just a run-of-the-mill predictable monster movie with nothing in it you haven't seen before. It also recycles a little bit to much from the first film, including being surrounded by raptors in the entrance building.To sum up: a mediocre popcorn flick that's entertaining to watch but nothing special.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Every scene with them in it was phenomenal. However, the movie turned out extremely cheesy. The kids could be taken out of the movie and it would have been ten times better. Me and my girlfriend laughed every time those two came on the screen because there was always something extremely cheesy and lovey to be said. It seemed like the director was just trying to force a story here. The kids did not belong in this movie. They honestly made me want to get up and leave the theater... that being said the rest of the movie was great. The CGI was wonderful and all of the dinosaurs were realistic. In my opinion I think many other directors could have made this movie one hundred times better. So I went in the middle and gave it a 5. It's actually really disappointing to me because this movie could have been one of the best of the decade. It's too bad they had to try to force a feel good, brotherly love story into a movie that involves dinosaurs tearing apart humans.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Jurassic World may boast of all that motion capture technology, but put side by side Bollywood exploits such as Kochadaiiyaan, it comes off as an amateurish, cartoonish effort.Pratt is virtually in every frame of the film, and as usual he oozes style and confidence. While the movie is decently paced, every scene is either some human drama or a non-dino sequence. The result of the motion capture technology is abysmal. The reason for doing motion capture is to impart real feel to animated characters. In Jurassic World, the effect is opposite- there is no real emotion in the facial shots of the dinos. Had it been a live action film, it might have looked good. But today's audience used to Avatar and its ilk, this mediocre effort simply does not cut the cake. Even Cars 2 features better animation! The whole mess is rather dreary. It maintains no consistent tone aside from rushed desperation. This is nothing like the colorful silliness the Japanese monster movies are famous for.This expensive experiment to immortalize our reptilian brethren might be good enough for die hard fans, but still cannot make up for its complete lack of connect, and its technical shortcomings. The last scene indicated a sequel and more product placements from ecco-friendly coporations- hope that is done better. 3/10","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It is easy to understand why.As an addition to the series it is derivative, clichéd, lazy and half baked. As a stand- alone action film it is rather good.The problem with the series is that the original brought together great writing with Michael Crichton, a great idea, ground breaking special effects, and Spielberg. That is a potent combination.Four down the line, there is no Michael Crichton, no original idea, great special effects and no Spielberg. The wonder has gone.Which if you are checking out the series for the first time, is fine. Bryce Dallas Howard is hot, Chris Pratt is handsome, and there are lots of dinosaur moments eating each others, and humans. Yet once you have seen the dinosaurs doing their thing, and the genetically modified super dinosaur doing his/her thing, the tension drops, and on an island, there are only so many people you can eat. The jeopardy isn't really there. A risible sub plot of a team developing raptors for military purposes is, risible. The breathy claim that they could have worked wonders in Tora Bora is just stupid.The original was a great film, this is just good entertainment. There is nothing wrong with that.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

To me, anyone who's out there creating, making films and the like for everyone to enjoy and share emotion, has my support behind them. But that doesn't mean I still don't have an opinion about what I watch.I love all kinds of movies/films. I'm not as easy to disappoint, due to having no expectations when I walk into a theater. From that, it gives me an optimistic attitude when I watch films. And ordinarily, I don't review movies/films. I just enjoy them. But in this case, I'd like to share my viewpoint.I was very much looking forward to Jurassic World. The original will always be one of my favorites, and even the Lost World. Jurassic 3 will even hold a special place in my heart, because I was such a fan of the series as a kid. And I really wanted the same for part 4. But I was less than satisfied.What baffles me is not the fact that part 4 pales in comparison to the original, or the cartoon-ish characters of the story, the undeniably un-Jurassic execution, or even the story. But it's the fact that the 4th installment of Jurassic Park is considered one of the best movies of the summer of 2015. It makes me sad to see all of these wonderful films that have come out, just this year alone even, that don't do nearly as well. Child 44, Black Sea, Chappie, Blackhat, Kingsman, Insidious 3, and even Terminator Genisys were among those to do poorly in comparison to Jurassic World. Even Mad Max: Fury Road, aside from overwhelmingly positive reception, barely made a standard profit. Terminator 5 was a much better film in almost every way, and yet was overrun with negative critique. It's just sad to see such wonderful underrated films get thrown under the bus, especially compared to such an overrated monster movie.I don't see Jurassic World as part of the series. It just doesn't mix well at all. With the cheesy one liners, incredibly campy and expendable characters, overused comic relief that spoils almost every dramatic scene, and the execution that doesn't capture any of the emotion that at least both previous sequels could partly achieve, it's a wonder how a movie like Terminator Genisys would end up under pressure, especially after Salvation. I'm not a Terminator Genisys groupie, and it's definitely not my favorite movie that's come out lately, but it's the perfect example of how the critical reception of both Jurassic World and Genisys should have been the other way around.In the end, Jurassic World isn't a bad film. It's enjoyable. But it's a disappointment to the Jurassic series, which has had a rough ride after part 1. Even though they don't compare to part one, The Lost World still had fun characters that behaved like actual human beings, it captured the Jurassic emotion, and it had heart. Part 3 was less than appealing compared to part 2, but it has its moments.Jurassic World is an over-rated, cliché, unoriginal, and cheesy monster flick that might as well star the Expendables. But I will say it is enjoyable, but not as part of the Jurassic series.Rant over!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Ironically, this is a perfect metaphor for the franchise itself – it takes more than just a CGI T-Rex to get a ""wow"" out of audiences now-a- days, and this fourth Jurassic installment seems to acknowledge this, even though it fails to do anything spectacular or different enough to recapture even a sliver of the original's awe factor.Jurassic Park may have been my first cinematic love, so it was only natural for me to be excited about Jurassic World when it was announced. Although skeptical about certain aspects of the film's production, I held out hope that it would be made with care enough to at least elevate it above the previous two sequels. Unfortunately, this is the first major disappointment of the summer; it's little more than a dumb, run-of-the-mill schlock machine, and has more in common with a SyFy Channel Original than a Spielbergian blockbuster.I knew from merely the first ten minutes that this was going to be a downhill ride. Incessant product placement, rushed storytelling and bad acting abounding, Jurassic World's utterly forgettable characters and cringe worthy script only remind us what a masterclass in narrative structure and suspense building the original film was. And yes, even this latest installment's visual effects fail to impress – the CGI is average and it really doesn't help that all this has simply been done before, much better.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both good actors, but the material they're given to work with is abysmal. The character models are cliché and sexist, and the romance feels no less than revoltingly shoe-horned in. After the brilliant Mad Max: Fury Road so refreshingly raised the bar and upset the balance concerning what is expected from a big budget action flick, the many sins of Jurassic World seem all the more lazy and unforgivable. Oh, and the cinematography, lighting and editing give the film the look of a commercial for the entire runtime, which it basically is anyway due to the shameless, nonstop product placement.Marginally better than Jurassic Park 3, but not even deserving association with Spielberg's original masterpiece, Jurassic World's finale of battling 'Rexes is the sole moment in the film in which I felt even remotely on-board. And even this battle is in many ways an inferior reenactment of the climax of last year's Godzilla, which was a far more successful attempt at a Spielbergian monster movie. Jurassic World is depressingly bad; I can't really recommend it on any basis.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

My personal favorite of the trilogy is Jurassic Park 2. When i started watching Jurassic World i never thought that there would be annoying kid characters and silly looking mix-breed dinosaurs. Instead of focusing on real species they decided to make something original , intelligent enough to outsmart humans , but IMO the creature needed a bunch of laser beams and a machine gun. The plot was very predictable, they focused on very few dinosaurs too , i felt like i was waiting many years for nothing. Despite my disappointments, the movie features beautiful looking dinosaurs and action scenes which makes it another entertainment movie without much of a sense.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I never expected it to be better than the first film but I didn't think it would be so far below it.The film aims to pay homage to the first. So much so, I found myself rolling my eyes by the second half of the movie with how many shots echo the first film. In fact, by the end I was annoyed that it pretty much ripped off the whole first film and didn't have the decency to do it well. Within the first film, there was a large amount of tension. You really felt like the main characters were in danger and felt scared. But in this film I did not believe that any main characters were in danger even though they were depicted as such. For a film that has lots of 'scary moments' I really didn't feel any tension and you could tell straight away who was going to be dino chow. Yes, I am making lots of comparisons with the first film however it echos it so much you can't help but do so. There are some positives of the film - It is cool to finally see the park in action and thriving. Having the John Williams theme within the film does create the nostalgia and feeling of continuity. CGI in most parts is good though I found the CGI textures look too shinny - the first used real props which made the textures look more real.Now for some major issues of the film. Seriously, the most plausible part of this movie is actually creating the dinosaurs.The characters act in the most stereotyped way it's ridiculous. The brothers - texting teenager who checks out every girl (even though he has a girlfriend) and the younger but super smart one who is scared for their parents divorcing. The 'villian' and his motives for using the dinosaurs. His actions throughout the movie were so predictable it was laughable.The male and female leads. Possibly the worst scripting for the female lead - Laura Dern's character was smart and believable. Bryce Dallas-Howards part was so one dimensional it wasn't even plausible for her transition from uptight CEO to searching the jungle for the kids to shooting dinos. Oh and all in a white pant suit and high heels!!! Then we have Chris Pratt. Really, raptor wrangling??? Come on, the first film made them scary and gives no plausibility that human interaction would be possible beyond being their meal. Now we have Chris Pratt jumping in there being the raptor whisperer. Please!! And there are some serious plot holes that are in effect to keep the film rolling. First, we have a large resort with dangerous animals and situated in a tropical cyclone area. How is there NOT a proper evacuation protocol in place other than mustering people into the one congregated space where the dangerous animals can enjoy a buffet. Then there is the supercharged Rex. Who has these abilities that allowed her to escape her enclosure then never uses them again. Oh and this enclosure has smaller walls than she is high, so that totally makes sense. And the Gyrospheres - why would there not be an auto-recall function for safety purposes? And taking the sphere for a ride off road after an evacuation call AND through a suspiciously torn gate seems like a great idea. Eye rolling was occurring frequently after this point. Overall, I was strongly disappointed with the film. It had great potential to be equal to the first but fell far below. But since it's done so well in the box office, it seems I am in the minority of my views.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Calling it bad writing would be unfair to writers who actually where giving freedom to write a compelling story and failed. This was not the case here. No, the producers wanted Dinosaur X to fight dinosaurs A, B, and C and told the writers now make it happen. So what you get is a story full of characters that are only there as excuse to get that particular camera shot of the dinosaurs. They all behaved so illogically that I cheered for he dinosaurs to eat almost every one of them. You can have good writing in blockbuster movies but when you restrict writer to creating camera shots and fight scenes you get garbage. My question is why would any writer put their name on such a garbage script? I have to admit I feel a little bit of shame for tagging along with my family to a movie that I had low expectations for. Because that 10 dollars went to reward this poor effort and goes along with millions encouraging producers not to care about good scripts. When this movie exceeded the worse of my expectations, I had to write a review. Moreover after hearing that this was the number 1 movie at the box office, I knew this travesty needed to be exposed. I even feel bad for criticizing the writers so much because I don't know what kind of deadline they were working with. But the result looked and felt like a lazy effort. The compelling characters in the whole movie were Chris Pratt's character and his 1 assistant played by Omar Sly. I would have cheered for everyone else to be eaten The characters not being consistent and behaving illogically reminds me of Prometheus (2012). I think that movie received so much flak because other movies in the series featured smart resourceful, consistent characters that drove the movie. The writing is so bad in this movie that these writers are on my ""wait for it to show up on cable"" list. Truly horrible and I wish I had a larger scale differentiate it from other bad movies that received a 4 from me.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Other parts are certainly a good mix of scariness and campiness, but otherwise it is just unforgivable because, unlike Sharknado, the movie wasn't in on the joke of how dumb it was being.Chris Pratt does a great job with his character - very likable and probably the least dumb one.

In a hanger full of injured. The two main stars rush to the aid of the emergency services asking how they could help. No time for makeup or future planning, their one thought was to act selflessly.And that's not what happened. This film is wonderfully ironic. The people who put commerce before caring and attention to detail are villains. The film makers would never cut corners and had objectives beyond profit making surely. It's a children's film so it has themes adults believe children relate to; recycling is good so the script is recycled (from most films but particularly from Jurassic genre films), the photographic techniques are borrowed (from titanic), the music is recycled, the ending is recycled, the moralising is recycled.The character stereotypes are predictable; ignored computer geek, hapless women, kids who would rather listen to music than help fight, commerce led baddie, reckless and poorly organised guys with guns, main characters who have film editors and script writers to gift them extreme luck and immunity from everything except bad acting.The hypocrisy follows the industries norm. As is expected, people are shaken, eaten and trampled on but its OK as collateral damage is expected in the fight against, well, anything. Dinosaurs are misunderstood and nurtured but if they misbehave, shot. And there's no doubt a gun shop in the foyer as, the NRA preach, having the means to shoot someone is a constitutional right greater than the sanctity of life.There are the usual attempts at casting diversity for the lesser roles but they play second fiddle to everything, particularly the CGI. The film is admirable as a bunch of images and is watchable but contains nothing memorable. It is another wasted opportunity to make something really worthwhile rather than a scheme to make lots of money. Perhaps that's the real message.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Nothing new that we have not seen before. I would disagree with a lot of the reviewers that it was better than JP 3. Jurassic Park 3 still had some originality in terms of introducing the Spinosaurus to the public after the tried and tested T.rexes of the previous films, and the rather exciting entry and extended part played by the Pteranodons. Even the visuals concerning the flying beasts were quite exciting and innovative at that time. It still had some of the wild, jungle like quality and appeal of the original classic.

Unfortunately, it's not perfect and it has a few problems.After scientists create a new dinosaur, it's shown to be intelligent and it escapes. Then the workers need to stop it before it kills the people on the island.What's good about this movie is that it seems slow at first but then surprises us and causes the action to pick up drastically. The action scenes look good and several scenes keep us on the edge of our seats the entire time. It doesn't have the same amount of tense moments that the original film had but it still delivers a fair amount of thrills.The effects are probably the best in the series so far. They are well done and they look realistic. There are a couple of scenes which look obviously cgi but not enough to distract the viewer from all the thrills.The film has mostly new characters. Chris Pratt's character showed promise but he gets overshadowed instantly when the carnage begins to happen. The film is mostly light on character development. I was at first going to ignore this but then I realized - what do we know about Pratt's character besides the fact that he works with the dinosaurs? Most if not all of the characters were so underdeveloped though that I could care less which ones lived and which ones died.There is a much higher body count then all the other films. But it lacks the showmanship and tension that Jurassic Park had. Also, while its script is slightly predictable, it does not overstay its welcome. The finale started off okay. It had its fair share of thrills but it was very predictable. It could've been seen coming from a mile away.This is a huge improvement over Jurassic Park 2 and 3. It's not perfect but it's showing promise that this once beloved series might come back.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Not only were they groundbreaking for their special effects but they were intelligent stories, which were well filmed and acted by a stellar cast. I even have to admit to enjoying the third film in the series, which a lot of people have put down. So, when I saw this episode was on the drawing board I was a happy bunny. However, when I saw the cast line up and the story synopsis I decided I'd wait until the film made it onto telly. Two years from the release and the movie is on... Boy, was I glad I waited(?) What the hell were the writers and director thinking of(?) There are so many holes in the story it leaks crap in the majority of scenes. The acting ranges from abysmal to average. And, the special effects appear to be below par for the time - the opening corvid shot is really horrendous.Poor Michael Crichton is turning in his grave.What the first three films showed was that Murphy's Law was more than prevalent on an island where dinosaurs roamed. So what do we find when the film starts(?) The park is open and has been running for a few years. You just know they've been lucky so far and that their luck is soon to run out. Then we learn the scientists are creating new ""Dinosaurs"" to keep the punters happy and spending their money. I can hear Malcolm screaming now, ""Will these idiots ever learn?"" - Evidently not Malcolm. Even worse is that on the other side of the island they're trying to train raptors. Though we're never really told why they're being trained, there is a military element which wants them as weapons (yawn, what else(?)...). I think it's because somebody had a great idea for a CGI scene later in the film... and this is the only way they could link it in.This leads me to the CGI Choreography because this is what it is. There are sometimes when it's just way too overcooked to be believable. The nannies, Zara's (Katie McGrath) dance of death is a particular case in subject. For me, this was just ludicrous and stupid.Back to the errors in the story, saying that there were no ""Dangerous"" animals on the island so the customers were never at risk was an outright lie. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who runs the island actually believes this, even though the latest creation, which she signed off on, is very dangerous... as well as the raptors... which she also knew about... then at the climax of the film... well, this is one woman you shouldn't trust - ever.One annoying thing, for me, was when Claire reprimands a colleague for wearing an antique Jurassic Park T-Shirt because it could be upsetting to the customers because people died there. The thing is, he never mingles with the vacationers. Secondly, the voice on the tannoy, at one point, actually welcomes everybody to Jurassic Park - Not Jurassic World!I also hated the kids in this film. A geek and a trainee stalker. At least with the original kids, Tim and Lex you could relate to them, this, on the whole, is because there were well written and well acted. Grey (Ty Simpkins) and Zack (Nick Robinson) are pretty two dimensional and boring, which can also be said for the rest of the cast, especially Claire. Only Chris Pratt, as Owen, and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Hoskins, give decent performances, though their characters are very cliched.This is one boring, seen it all before, cliche-ridden film that I'd not recommend to anyone - even if the end scene is quite entertaining. I'll not watch this again and I cannot believe there's a sequel in the pipeline.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Before I started watching it I was dreading the thought of it, since I didn't thought much of the film the 1st time I saw it. But as soon as it started, it wasn't that bad.I still don't think the film is good. It's certainly terrible when it comes to story and characters, but it's pretty well put together in the technical departments. Like the sets, the locations. The park in Jurassic World feels like a real park. Something that exists and it's physically possible for me to visit.
And that's such a breath of fresh air, especially when you start thinking about all those Marvel and DC films. Take Black Panther for instance. Comparing Wakanda or even the scenes in South Korea with anything from Jurassic World, and Black Panther comes out losing, because it's scenery looks fake as sh**. While here, everything looks nice, clean and authentic.Jurassic World as great production value. Something that's important if you want your film to look good. Now, where the film fails where others might succeed is: in the direction, the characters, the tone and the plot.Wanting to use Raptors in a real like war scenario and believing that Raptors would be better than modern technology is stupid. It makes no sense. If you were talking about dropping a few Raptors in an enemy camp in order to create chaos, then yes. That makes sense. But wanting Raptors to team up with soldiers and thinking this is better than using some piece of technology... Its just stupid.For some reason everyone treats this new dinosaur has some kind of Godzilla type threat. Something that's impossible to destroy even with nuclear weapons. And when you see her getting easily wounded when a missile barely hits her... You start realizing that maybe the problem isn't the fact that this dinosaur is smarter than the others. Maybe the problem is that the people in charge of the park are really bad at their jobs. Like, they are the most incompetent idiots you could ever have hired.And the tone is all over the place. Between the nostalgic soundtrack and the park, which is meant to make you remember that feeling you had when you saw the original. You have forced humour that reminds you of Disney films. Violent animal attacks that are presented in this visceral, gritty realistic way. Something that just doesn't mix with the childish characters and stupid one-liners. It just becomes awkward. The film becomes a giant, bloody mess of different ideas, each one executed in a different way.Giving it a 5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There's nothing. The characters are so uninteresting and boring, the lines don't carry enough weight, everyone in the movie seems to just appear and then disappear. If compared with part 1 of the series, this part is less than half. I feel like they want to capitalize on the dinosaur franchise just because they want to get all the money out of the fans, instead of focusing on the quality of the characters. I want the people in the movie to be the main characters, not the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs only know how to scream and attack people. I want the villain to have intrigue, plans, betrayals, twists, and especially a message about humanity and environmental protection, which I didn't see in the movie. This is a better movie to watch once. Don't watch it again. For fan service, it did the job. For everyone who wants to remember this movie forever and feel satisfied after watching it, it completely fails.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Jurassic World ""Rant-View:"" Or How ""Blue the Velociraptor"" is the love interest Christ Pratt deserves","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3807102/?ref_=tt_urv","RogueKnite","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33134328/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2017","When talking to friends and family about this film I always referred to it as Jurassic Park, because it always looked like a facsimile of the 1993 film. It seemed like they took every touch point from the 1993 film & copied it over to Jurassic World. One of the first shots in JW is that of a complete flyover of the park from the famous Jurassic Park gates, accompanied by the legendary John Williams' theme swelling in the background. In the 1993 film, this was a stirring moment, we were entering the park for the first time, we had no clue as to what was behind those gates, or the chaos those gates were holding back. The gates symbolizing the latch on Pandora's Box. In JW, we get the EXACT SHOT with identical musical cues. Yet the scene has no more than 1/10 of the impact it did in 1993. We know what's going to happen in JW, the awe is gone.The only facet of JW that improves on JP is the special effects. The visual effects and sets are impressive. The dinosaurs & the actual Jurassic World park look spectacular! At this point, you're probably wondering ""What else matters?!"" Well a lot actually. Especially when all of your human characters are less fleshed out than the dinosaurs. One of the many elements that made JP such a classic was its human characters. Each character was developed & felt like a three dimensional person. Even side characters, Samuel Jackson's technician & Wayne Knight's two-bit villain all have character motivations that make their character choices understandable.In JW not one human character is developed in any meaningful way. Our main hero, Pratt's Owen, is a former Navy Seal & a now dinosaur trainer (these scenes would be ""side-splitting"" hilarious if it weren't for the dialogue), period. That's it. We know nothing else about him. Other than him & our heroine, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), went on an ill-fated first date. When all hell breaks loose in Jurassic World, Claire goes to Owen to save her nephews solely because he's been designated ""hero man"" by the film's script.Let's now segue into JW's child characters, Zach & Gray. Zach & Gray are Claire's nephews. Zach is generic teenager #3 & Grey is generic kid who loves dinosaurs. These two serve no purpose other than being a reason for Owen and Claire to venture into Jurassic World. Every scene these two characters share makes absolutely no sense. They're there to be our virgin eyes into Jurassic World, showing us the park for the first time. Except we've been here before. Jurassic Park already explored the splendors of the dinosaur theme park. It's the equivalent of a friend telling you about the first season of your favorite TV show, which you've watched all 10 seasons of and know the dialogue inside & out. You're essentially being forced to consume something you've already digested.To say the script is garbage would be generous. The most worthy belongs to Vincent D'Onofrio's Vic wanting to use the Velociraptors as modern infantry. Claiming Velociraptors can't be bartered, hacked, or deterred in their pursuit of their prey. Hence, they are the perfect soldier. Pratt's Owen argues with Vic numerous times over this until the story calls for the (in)famous ""Pratt riding a motorcycle with a pack of Velociraptors"" shot, then Pratt's character does a complete 180° on the issue, which ultimately fails. I'd go into more detail, but that's spoiler territory.The best characters of JW are the dinosaurs. Not only because you have empathy for them, but because they are the only characters that are fun. Pratt's four Velociraptors are fun because they each have a name & distinct character traits. ""Blue,"" the leader, & the others follow her lead. Blue plays a critical role in the whole film, especially the climax. Pratt & Blue have more chemistry than any other two character in the film. It can be argued Blue is Pratt's true love interest, in lieu of Claire.But what are our heroes, unless they have a worthy foe? The ""big bad"" of JW is Indominus Rex, the first intentionally homicidal animal in a modern blockbuster. You could look at Indominus as the dinosaur version of Jason Voorhees. Indominus kills anything in its path simply because it's ""bad."" Another baffling decision made by the script. Indominus is eventually taken down by Pratt & his gang of misfits. The climax (one of the few bright spots of the film) is so over-the-top, it will be nearly impossible for the inevitable sequel to top.To call this film flawed is kind. I love cheesy movies. I love bad movies. There's a charm to something that goes so hilariously ""off-the-rails."" Yet Jurassic World is not an example of this. Halfway through Jurassic World's 124 minute runtime, I was pretty sure I lost my mind. At numerous points, I could not believe what I was watching was actually greenlit by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Never mind the record breaking box office and audience acclaim it's garnering. If you're still reading this (bless you!) I implore you not to see this movie. I don't even mean at the movie theater, but in general. Go watch Jurassic Park if you're inclined to see Jurassic World. Seen Jurassic Park already? Watch it again! There's nothing Jurassic World can give you that an umpteenth viewing of Jurassic Park can't.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I like all the installments for various reasons, film or literary, no matter how bad some can get. The first film is one of my favorite movies period. The Lost World, while inferior to the first film definitely, is still a worthy sequel and I feel is a very underrated film. I'm also a fan of the books by Michael Crichton of which the first two movies are based on. Jurassic Park 3, while certainly not a good movie like its predecessors, I can enjoy as an entertaining monster movie.I wasn't expecting too much going into this film. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the first film or even the second one. I was only expecting it to be an entertaining monster movie like the third film and that's exactly what got.The story is very simple. Twenty years after when the first film took place the park is officially opened (had been for years) and tourists are flocking to it by the truck loads. However, people had become desensitized and bored by regular dinosaurs so the owners and scientists in their infinite wisdom decided to create a genetically modified hybrid to up the wow factor. However, the hybrid escapes and starts wreaking havoc around the park and freeing other dinosaurs from their containers and everything goes awry.The film does have a few things going for it. It is quite entertaining as a straight forward monster movie and it did give me feelings of nostalgia. I like it mainly for the same reasons I like Jurassic Park 3 in that it's a fun monster movie.I also like that it tries to do something different with actually having the park up and running along with the incorporation of the dinosaur hybrid which is a cool monster with a nice design. Easily my favorite thing about this film is the Indominus Rex. It's a cool design, and it was enjoyable watching it work. The park itself also looks very nice and it was cool to actually see the park actually functioning.Chris Pratt also does a good job as the lead and I liked his character. I was worried from the trailers of him being a raptor whisperer. However, I think they handle it fairly well. It further establishes that these dinosaurs are not monsters (besides the new hybrid) but animals as the first two films made clear. I also like that they establish he's not in full control and the relationship has to be constantly tested. He's like a lion tamer.However, that's where the praise ends. Firstly, the CGI is horrible. It's been over twenty years since the first film yet the effects are easily the worst out of all the films. JP 3 had better effects than this. The effects for these films should be getting better not worse. The dinosaurs all look so incredibly fake it's not even funny. All the other films used animatronics along with the CG but this it's obviously 100% CG. If they did use animatronics then they definitely used CG over them.Also, the cast is subpar. Chris Pratt's character is good but he's the only one in my opinion. All the other character I was not invested in at all. Granted there was no character I adamantly disliked but no one I really cared for either besides Chris Pratt. The villain is also very one-note but, thankfully, he doesn't play a major role.Not to mention there are so many nods and even scenes reenacted from the first film it's ridiculous. I know this is the first film from this franchise in a long time and some nods are fine but there were so many of the same beats being hit it got a bit annoying. The final battle especially felt a lot like the final battle from Jurassic park with the raptors.Overall, Jurassic World is not a worthy sequel to the first two movies. I'd say it's on par with JP 3. In fact, I like JP 3 a bit more because of my nostalgia for it. However, if you're a fan of Jurassic Park then there's no reason not to see this.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Perhaps it shouldn't have been surprising, however, since every 'Jurassic' sequel has been a disappointment. I'm sure that Colin Trevorrow tried to make an interesting film, but it ultimately turned out rather bland. With horrible cinematography, an exposition-filled screenplay, and an over-reliance on CGI (that will make this film seem older than the original in a few decades), 'Jurassic World' is a major disappointment. Still, once you accept that this is going to be a predictable Hollywood blockbuster, there's some passive fun to be had and there are far worse films of this type out there. Chris Pratt is pretty entertaining too. 5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I love dinosaur movies and I loved all the old Jurassic Park movies. Although this movie (forgivably) lacks many of the elements that made the Jurassic Park movies so good, like a decent theme, a moral, and underlying character conflict, it also lacks characters that we can identify with or have any concern for. Even this might be forgivable, but at some points, the characters (portrayed rather flatly by incompetent acting/directing) act so idiotically, that I found myself actually hoping they would get what was deservedly coming to them, knowing that they probably wouldn't, and indeed they didn't. I find myself more tolerant of evil in a character, then just plain stupidity; and sadly, due to poor scripting, storyline, or directing, the main characters in this movie just came off as stupid, idiotic fools. While the CGI was fantastic, I really couldn't help but feel it didn't make up for having to suffer through 90 minutes of listening to vapid characters.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The Audience is built in, ready to Go and Spend, Spend, Spend, until the Movie approaches the now attainable Billion Dollar Commodity.This is Product First and Art second. No one involved down to the CGI Filler Artist, had any reservations about how this Picture would be Consumed. So the Creative process from the Idea to Script, to Finished Film was never in danger of being a Loser and that is hardly an Inspiration for the Imagination.That's exactly what this Film became and is, a Prefabricated Movie with just the required amount of effort and Wha-La, let's all go to the Bank. There's something to be said about the ""Struggling Artist"".The Movie is Mediocre, considering, passable Popcorn Entertainment. The 3-D does its job, the Sound System strains to Impress, the CGI is Expensively Slick, the Characters and the Actors delivering the One-Dimensional People to the Screen are the least impressive of the Package.The Story is Lame, considering, and seems Trite, Recycled, and frankly quite Dull. The new Hybrid Dino is Unimpressive and You have to look closely to Differentiate the T-Rex. The Raptors as Trained Military Might is Hardly anything Surprising, and in the End, handled Awkwardly.Overall, this is an OK Film and it delivers, somewhat, the Stuff it is Selling. A minor Disappointment because the True Wonder of the First Series, just like the Story here, is ""Old-Hat"". The Joke going around when the first Film was released...""You can't tell the fake dinosaurs from the real ones.""

Same old plot, they changed the heads of the bodies is all. The animals still look the same, the labs still look the same, the jungle still looks the same and the island.. well guess what? It still looks the same. This movie series fixation with a dinosaur park is making Michael Crichton giggle in his coffin. Or his cold-storage nitrogen tank. Whatever. Hope he's still collecting his piece of the action somehow. No imagination, lots of money splashed all over the screen. Lots of ""lets keep it in the groove"" thinking. The producers must have gotten a few real belly laughs as the storyline tracks along about cynically keeping the park visitors entertained and distracted while doing just the same thing with the movie audience, manipulating them time after time, scene after scene movie after movie, to cough up their money again like the suckers they know us to be.

Films that really have nothing to offer anyone who actually went to College. I'm all for a good adventure-in fact its what I like to watch the most in movies but I wasn't impressed with anything other than the film looked like it cost a fortune to produce. I was more amazed by the amount of money they probably had to spend to achieve the desired effect of creating a movie that looked like it cost a fortune to make. I don't think thats the same thing as an adventure. The plot line was virtually non-existent being merely a 'next step down the greed ladder' for the pseudo corporation that created the Jurassic theme park in the first place. The idea of using DNA trapped in amber is real science but I didn't get a sense that this movie would necessarily appeal to younger people with an interest in science. It was the kind of thing that Disney did a lot of-suggest science in a movie but don't actually talk about any specifics. ROOOAAR goes the big Dinosaur. OOOOOH goes the audience (supposedly). I doubt they were too many OOOH's and AAAH's for this movie-I think it probably got the ho-hum reaction it deserved from the thirteen year old audience it was targeting. Dinosaurs.

The movie lacks the type of excitement from the previous Jurassic movies which is the authenticity of being in a place with dinosaurs. This is because of the blunt character expression of the kids (main actors) being chased by a humongous dinosaur and also the overall character feel of the actors playing their roles. Chris Patt did well tho portraying his role. Even with the interesting idea of mixing genes, they failed to showcase a lot of that feature. Not much of dinosaur facts exposure, some were just mentioned without visual representation. It would have been more interesting if there were new species discovered and introduced. I lost the realistic feeling when the 2 boys were able to start a car that has been abandoned for 20yrs and a few other scenes. Overall the script could have been improved and better Actor selection for key roles. I like Chris Patt and Bryce Dallas and few others but some were not just cut out to play their own.

I liked the plot and the characters, the pace was very good and suspenseful, and the film culminates in an awesome way that I did not see coming.Why, then, was I not as scared as I was by the other films? I watched the first movie about a week ago in preparation for this one, and I couldn't block out one question; why does Jurassic World feel less real? The animation is too fluent. A large factor can be blamed on that. Real animals don't move every single joint with every step, like robots. We seem to have a reached a point where too fluent animation results in less connection to reality. Because the dinosaurs don't feel real, they're not as scary. Some animatronics by Stan Winston would've helped. There is even a particular, groan-inducing moment where a character bangs on a window from the outside and leaves his bloody hand imprint on it. That is a B-movie sign right there.And that's a shame, 'cause Jurassic World is not a B-movie. But the dinosaurs, the way they move and - most crucially - the way they eat people isn't as chillingly real like it felt in Jurassic Park and the unfairly maligned The Lost World.And you know what the result of that is? You don't fear the dinosaurs like you did in the first movies. The big evil dinosaur in Jurassic World causes a lot of destruction, but it doesn't scare you like the T-Rex did.In wake of 2014's Godzilla, where they brought a colossal monster to life, Jurassic World has no excuse. I wanted to love it, but it only manages to place third in rank of the four Jurassic Park movies.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Perhaps I should have realized, that I'm not the film's target audience. And what's all this about coca cola in the big studio films nowadays.

Maybe it was just me but the dinosaurs looked more realistic and lifelike in Jurassic Park. And that was 20 years ago!I looked forward to the use of the signature Jurassic Park theme song but was so disappointed at the poor usage of the theme song and the overall weak music score. The opening sequence to the actual park felt like a whimper instead of a majestic roar.All of the main characters were dull and frankly forgettable. Honestly I could not care less about any of the humans and in the end was only interested in the fate of the raptors. It's ironical that the other summer blockbuster Age of Ultron managed to humanize super-heroes and yet here the humans are de-humanized.Most disappointingly, this film had none of the artistry, attentiveness to detail and passion evident in Jurassic Park.

Kind of like Spaceballs did with Star Wars. $180 million ??? for what? And somewhat positive critical reviews? have they all been bought? The movie is a non-stop orgy of clichés. Every twist and turn is entirely predictable and makes you feel bad for the writers and directors who seemed to be trying hard, but producing total drivel. Do not subsidize this trash.

Neither group has the definitive word on anything and often are wrong because they are looking at the wrong things. No one is expecting movies like Jurassic Park to be Pulitzer prize-caliber material. The goal is entertainment. If you were entertained, then stop complaining. If you were not, you most probably have engaged in so much entertaining activities in your life that nothing will satisfy you.I am a Jurassic Park fan. I own videos of all three movies and watch them often and they still entertain me. From what I have seen of Jurassic World, I expect to be further entertained. If you are looking to critically take apart a movie and don't just sit back and watch it for its entertainment value, you are only cheating yourself.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

"1","/10","How I would rewrite Jurassic world","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5243608/?ref_=tt_urv","s-01154","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur103154083/?ref_=tt_urv","8 November 2019","This was the most disappointing film of all time in my opinion. Jurassic fans like myself have waiting for the perfect fourth installment of the Jurassic franchise to come after Jurassic Park 3. And when it was announced in 2012 that the fourth installment was titled Jurassic World, we all lost our minds. And some people genuinely enjoyed this film, and viewed this as an enjoyable and a popcorn movie, and an action packed film with dinosaurs in the middle of it. In Other words, it was a fast and furious film with dinosaurs in the middle of it. While others like my self saw this as an utter disappointment to the franchise. My head was hung way too low after I saw this film. And this is this is how I would chose to rewrite the film:The story follows a fully functional park in the distant but near future, as a strange man who works for Bio Sin, Ingen's rival (Ingen is the company that runs Jurassic park and Jurassic world) shuts down all systems in the park, leaving it with no power, no electricity, complete darkness, loose dinosaurs, a completely shut down Jurassic World. This would leave quite a scary, dark, and horrific setting for the characters to face.Make this film the first rated r film of the franchise. A PG 13 film could be released alongside for kids to watch. But the real movie is rated r. Meaning full on gore and blood and violence. So decapitated heads, limbs, bloody carcase, etc. There are also some Horror elements implemented too. Many stunning horror scenes could be shot especially with the raptors. This will be the first movie where children characters in this film die.One horror scene would include an Ingen Soldier in a dark hallway, he lights a flare to see where to go. But as he walks he hears a suttle snarl or growl if you will. And as he looks around to see what's going on, he looks up slowly and and sees a velociraptor up on a vent in the ceiling. The soldier pulls out a pistol, aims for the raptor, and shoots. He misses and raptor roars and jumps on him. As the raptor claws his back, the soldier tries to crawl his way out if the hallway, and this is where the gore comes into play. As he drags himself across the floor, he leaves a trail if blood smeared across. The raptor then snaps the soldier's neck with his mouth, and feeds on his intestines.Keep the previous dinosaur designs from the previous films of the franchise. One of the most disappointing things about the whole film was its cartoony and fake dinosaur designs. The completely changed Rexy's appearance, the raptors look disgusting and outlandish, the pteranodons look like pigeons with crests, and the stegosaurs look like they got ripped from the pages of a dinosaur book in the 1960s. Rexy's design should stay true to how she looked in Jurassic Park. The Velociraptors should keep their Jurassic Park 3 designs, but change they're colours to differentiate between the Jurassic World and Jurassic Park designs, and the Male Raptors should have more feathers. The pteranodons should keep they're Lost World or Jurassic Park 3 designs, although I prefer the Jurassic Park 3 designs as they look more menacing but The Lost World designs look good too. And finally the stegos should keep The Lost World designs exactly the same unchanged.The visual effects should be delt with the same way they were delt with in the original Jurassic Park. Jurassic World had one of the most cartoony and fake CGI ever in my opinion. The original Jurassic Park that came out in 1993 had one of the most stunning CGI shots in all of cinema history. We live in an era of technology, this should not happen. This Jurassic World should be done the same way Jurassic Park was. Stan Winston animatronics and puppets for close ups, and CGI for wide shots.Characters include Owen Grady but not a raptor trainer (we are not going the military dinosaur route at all) Tim Murphay, Lex Murphay, Tim's children and Lex's children, Simon Hammond whi is John Hammond's son (John hammond created the first Jurassic Park) Ian Malcom and Ellie Satler and Alan Grabt although they won't be on Isla Nublar.The Park will include a large futuristic Visitor's Center, not like the one in Jurassic World, a pachycephalosurus fighting arena, two separate Rex enclosures, one that includes Rexy, and another that includes a feathered T-Rex, a Raptor family pen, and aviary with Pteranodons and Ramphyrincus, a carnotaurus forest, a dilophosaurus pen showcasing hunting shows of them hunting down cows and goats, Baryonix and Suchomimus River, a large herbivore valley which includes Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, Pachyrinosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Diplodocus, Iguanadon, Stegosaurs, Kentrosaurus, and many more. Other enclosures include Spinosaurs Lake, the aquarium which includes creatures like Leoplorodon, plesiosaurus, elasmosaurus, etc. Transports around the park include advanced Jeeps for the rangers, a much larger monorail, a submarine ride around the aquarium with non carnivorous creatures, and ranger car tours around the herbivore valley, and a large transport in the gallimimus herd.This is how I would rewrite Jurassic World. In my opinion this would make for a more compelling and stunning story. I believe the audience would be at the edge of their seats, and frightened when watching this.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's like, imagine you have a flow of energy in a circuit. If you like disrupt it, then the flow doesn't work right? We have a flow that is satisfied by the movies we watch, and when that flow SUCKS, our bodies begin to shut down because they're not working circuits. Your legs keep fidgeting because you're bored, your breathing becomes difficult, all in all it felt crap to see this. Makes me wonder if you can even hold them responsible for making such atrocious cinema, because seriously I even had stomach problems after seeing it.Or maybe that's because I see too much Jurassic Park in youth and was let down so I got like sick or something...but anyway! Know that I'm one of the biggest fans ever to exist of Jurassic Park. I had all the cool toys, everything. Charts showing the dinosaur sizes, video games, and all from the cool era back then. None of this J world filth. Real old school Lost World and JP3 stuff. So if there were anyone to have review this movie, it's me (and of course the other fans out there too).It sucked right from beginning to end, the dinosaurs are reduced to annoying playthings, like literally it's not like ""oh that raptor is scary"", it's more like ""that raptor is annoying, like that kid who keeps going number two on your lawn"". It all reeks of annoying things. It's sad, it's not even like it's disturbing like Saw or Texas Chainsaw Massacre or something, it's just annoying.Dinos are not these creatures you can turn into graphic barbie showcase things with the ugly kids riding them and ugly kids going to see them in a park. They're noble beings, full of power and majesty. LISTEN TO JOHN HAMMOND AND MALCOLM IN THE 2ND MOVIE FOR Christ SAKES, the creatures need our ABSENCE, and that includes the makers in our world that try to make (*cough* steal 1990's filmmakers ideas) stories and CG models out of them. They all look like they've been animated by selfish people, a loving CG artist makes even the cruddiest of 3D modelia shine with life. It's just a matter of a simple loving touch, that's what makes CG great (I know from some experience with CG). This movie had none of that. So sorry, the dinosaurs don't make you drool with immense urges to draw and colour them in all day, to have complex dioramas with your toys, it makes it worse than a street dog in your head. Just some ""oh look tommy, there's an annoying dino, go pet him"".Our dinos before had vicious survival based lives and they were as great as seeing your own mother and father when they came on screen. They marched in and ran the show, they were precious. The roars still fill my ears when I sleep at night.All the intro garbage crap with the kids and the dumb texting girlfriend nonsense, you put that in a kids movie? Seriously? That's when you know never to trust ANYTHING from this film company again, they're frauds. There was even a VERY big hint at a nude subject in the movie which I won't dare discuss. People are swearing left and right, like jeez you think the small words aren't swear words? You think our beloved Jurassic trilogy has language like that? You clearly don't know what a kid friendly movie is. Don't take your kids to see this, it's not worth it.The dinosaurs are all trying too hard to be cool, and YES I do treat the dinosaurs as their own creatures even through the screen because they were amazing enough to receive that treatment in the 3 movies. All the personifying of the dinos making them into more things for humans to control is annoying. Like a dinosaur movie isn't about them helping each other beat the bad dino like humans would, these makers are trying to make them like humans. These animals work alone and look like REAL animals when they think. YES, they can be friends but it has a different feel. It felt more like pixar creature love than anything. Complete disgrace to what keyboard and mouse is meant for. All the CG programs have been disgraced by this. The music blew too.-10000/10 if I could, but sadly 1 is the lowest rating the website permisses.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Starting with the very first scene, honestly, it struck me as a movie with no ambition. Yes the visual effects were pretty good. But it was apparent that director Trevorrow was perfectly content with making something that was forgettable, mediocre yet still capable of making some good money. I think he accomplished that.The whole 2 hours were just extremely uninspired. It felt like they didn't decide to make the movie because they had an idea or a story, but because they found the money. It was scattered with clever cinematic tricks here and there but not with any coherence.Jurassic World was supported by a solid cast but their talents were hampered by uninspired storytelling. There were also too many characters for any of them really to have enough screen time to not be one-dimensional. Irrfan Khan and Omar Sy in particular had so much more to offer. So goes for the film scoring talent of Michael Giacchino. Many times I found myself wishing it simply had used the same music from the original Jurassic Park done by John Williams.Lastly, the title is very misleading. There is little about it that goes beyond the island although that seems to be what Jurassic WORLD implies. All in all an unnecessary addition to the franchise, well to the fans at least.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I have followed the Jurassic Park World from the beginning, and I am glad this rehashing of Jurassic Park is over.I was incredibly disappointed by the lack of dinosaur screen time compared to the 20+ characters; to the ever expanding plot that just used the dinosaurs as an afterthought.When the dinosaurs did appear on screen, I loved it. It was grand, memorable, and worth the ticket, but that was never the forefront of the movie. So those moments were few and far between.I truly had great expectations, and was sadly disappointed in more ways than one. Just watch Jurassic Park (the original) if you still have a craving to watch this movie after this review. Even if you have seen it a hundred times as I have, at least you want experience the crushing blow that I receive tonight.Maybe they made the ever ending new addition characters the main focus of the movie because this movie focused on dinosaurs in ""our world"" now. But, I do think that was 100% a flaw. Even if the dinosaurs are in our world now, they could have explored more into what that looks like, and not have those topics or subjects covered as an afterthought.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some examples include Force Awakens, Incredibles 2, and PotC: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Jurassic World is perhaps the worst offender of this pack. It follows a plot very similar to the 1993 classic that became one of the most popular movies of all time, and yet manages to fall short of it in virtually every aspect, creating a vastly inferior product.Jurassic Park was one of the last major blockbusters released before CGI became the dominant form of effects in movies, and its visual effects are still outstanding to this date. The effects in Jurassic World manage to be worse, even 22 years after the original. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park still hold up. These will look dated in no time. Spielberg's blockbusters from Jaws to E. T. to Jurassic Park are loved in part because of how real they seem. Not even the reuse of John William's outstanding score from the original movie can recreate that magic.While this isn't a good movie, it isn't a particularly bad one either, and it does have redeeming values. The two main characters, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), are fine. While their relationship is iffy, the performances from those two are good. The relationship between Pratt and Blue, even as CGI as she is, is well done. While the effects are inferior to the original's, they aren't that bad, and the original's are among the best ever made, so it's a high bar to begin with. Michael Giacchino, while he's no John Williams, does a good job. The movie has some good original ideas in it. The pod that they ride around in is an example. And while they don't stack up to the '93 movie, there are a few moments that invoke that horror element.All in all, the movie just feels like a soulless cash grab. I don't like to call movies soulless because of all the work that goes into them, but what else is there to say about this? It's a watered-down version of Jurassic Park that still managed to rack up $1.5 billion. And with ""remake-quels"" like this, Force Awakens, and Incredibles 2 racking in the billions, brace yourself for more on the way.Even the Universal Studios ride is inferior to the original. At least the original is still up and running in Orlando.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well, it literally was 'once' great. Here goes a movie about the actual park with dinosaurs as it's opened to the public. Everything's wonderful until the biggest, baddest dinosaur escapes! The movie stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, along with some kids that were hilarious! They had me in tears when the dinosaur was chasing them. Wait, I wasn't supposed to be laughing? Oh. But seriously, the acting is fine for what it has to be. For me it's a hard movie to review because I'm pretty neutral on it. Everything was just fine. Nothing was spectacular, everything was pretty bland. Well let's at least start somewhere. Is there any characterization? Well, it's about as one dimensional as you can get but at least their not card board cut outs. Chris Pratt plays Owen, and he's reminiscent of a young, one note Han Solo. The only part I actually felt myself enjoying thoroughly was the end action scene, and that's just because it was mind numbing action that I could turn my brain off for. If you pay attention to detail, you can nitpick just about every little plot point to pieces, which is a huge problem, not just with this movie, but with many movies today. It just shows that there was barely any effort put into it. They mostly likely wrote a quick script, slapped the Jurassic Park name onto it and released it. I've been hearing a lot of ""It was good compared to the other blockbusters we get"", ""It was better than the sequels"", which brings up the question: Is that the bar? Is the bar so low for movies that when we get a mediocre one we have to force ourselves to enjoy it and say that it's the best we're gonna get? No. We should be demanding better films and more effort but the average movie goer doesn't care enough. We shouldn't be accepting decent films because they're better than other ones that come out. The bar needs to be higher. All in all though, Jurassic World isn't terrible. It's fine. It's whatever. It's a movie. Don't go into this expecting a great action thrill ride. You'll merely get some enjoyment. The end action scene is fun but other than that the movie is pretty bland. 6/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Ironically, one of the reasons for which I loved Mad Max Fury Road is the use of the same themes, camera angles and tricks from the old movies. That is also one of the reasons for which I find Jurassic World a terrible film.Back when I was 12 or so and I went to watch Jurassic Park in the cinema, I fell in love. OK, I was fascinated by dinosaurs back then, and the movie was innovative in more than one way. I even continued to follow the sequels, and liked them enough.Although I grew up both physically and mentally in these more than 2 decades, unfortunately it seems that the Jurassic Park franchise didn't: they still use the same bad jokes, the same clichés, the same predictability and the same scenes. In this last case, literally: you can actually see some scenes copied from the first movie, perhaps from the other 2 as well. OK, granted, there's not much to do with dinosaurs but to scream, run and hide, although re-using not only stories, plots and sub-plots but scenes themselves with new actors in them is a bit too much. Honestly, at this point, recycling scenes is not an option in what it was a multimillion dollar Hollywood franchise. Let's remember that this is not a remake, but a whole new movie/sequel on its own (presumably).Apart from that, we get some bad acting (that ""cool"" guy, Owen... Jaysus...). Something the previous movies could boast about was a good cast, generally. I missed some cameo, although I liked the appearance of Dr. Wu (even when they gave him such a miserable part - I guess it's more to add to the lack of charm).And, why, oh why, do they have to include dinosaurs brawls??? Are these people 12? Hm, perhaps... Maybe some of us got stuck somewhere back there, more than 2 decades ago.Definitely, a very miss-able movie. Funny how they talk about innovation in it, when the product itself is all but that. One thing they should do, though, is to market those all-purpose high-heels, I'm sure women would appreciate it. I think there's an interesting entry in the msg board about it, along with other ""great"" moments of the film. For all the plot holes, poor acting, repetitive and unimaginative action and so on, I'm extremely surprised and disappointed that Jurassic World has a score of more than 7 here, at the moment.From now on, I will also be screaming, running and hiding from movies directed by this ""genius"".","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The storyline basically followed the same formula as previous Jurassic films, well it would really, but overall it was a big yawn. At times I was quite lost with some of the dialogue and was totally lost when the younger kid waffled on about 'more teeth' and then another dinosaur gets let out, I know I did not got to sleep but I missed something somewhere.

So I watched it a second time and now I have slightly different opinions now.So to start with some basic opinions, I feel that Jurassic World is cheesy as hell, but it is still a lot of fun and a lot better compared to the other Jurassic Park sequels.Lets start off with the positives, the effects are pretty good. I love how some of the dinosaurs have a great presence in the scenes they are in, they feel like they are really there at times. Chris Pratt was good in the movie as well and had some good comedic scenes. But mostly the movie is just a really fun ride, its very enjoyable to watch.Now for the bad, there are a lot of kinda uninteresting characters in the movie, *cough* Obligatory child characters *cough*, and also some annoying ones as well. Another thing about the movie as a whole is that it is incredibly cheesy, cheesy to a whole new level at times, but it is kinda funny though. But the thing that annoyed me was this one character who had the great idea of wanting to militarize dinosaurs, which if it was just a joke then that would be fine, but they keep mentioning it and the character is just talking about nothing but that every time he is on screen he was just obnoxious. It was really satisfying to see him get eaten by the raptors also.So finally, Jurassic World was very fun but some of the aspects of the movie kinda make bad from a critical stand point, but it is still very enjoyable but not a good movie from a technical stand point.Final Score: 5.5/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Then go home and watch the original again. The first once is SO much better in every way than this one.Despite how bad this film is, it will remain #1 for some time and, due to the extreme revenue it will produce, we will be given a Jurassic V.

It wanted to be intelligent, it wanted to be heartfelt, it wanted to have a sense of mystery and wonder.Jurassic World is not that kind of movie. Instead, it feels like it's a robot's understanding of what Jurassic Park's ideals are.Nothing about this film feels natural. In the original Jurassic Park, you had great character moments, like Ellie and Alan's tension over wanting to have children, and how that evolves over the course of the movie. Jurassic World vaguely gestures at some tired, generic personality traits, and figures that's good enough. She's a hard-nosed business woman who learns to stop neglecting her family, he's a rugged modern cowboy with a heart of gold, and a pair of brothers bond despite their age difference. It's basic film 101 stuff, the sort of thing you'd see in a forgettable Hallmark Channel made-for-streaming movie, and nobody ever feels more human or nuanced than this.The end result is something that feels processed, manufactured, and factory-made. Maybe not the worst thing in the world for a film, but not interesting or unique. Just the next thing off the assembly line.That being said, at least the action in Jurassic World is pretty decent. The dinosaurs still look cool, and it makes the most of its two-hour run time to show you a lot of them. At the time of its release, this movie might've actually had the highest dinosaurs-per-minute ratio out of all of the Jurassic Park movies. The explosions are big and the creatures are bigger, and that part is still fun.But I couldn't shake the overall feeling of cynicism. Even the movie itself spells it out: Dinosaurs, it claims, are boring now. The public just wants scarier thrills, and louder roars. Jurassic World delivers, but at the cost of its soul. It's ironic in a sense; it's almost as if the movie suffers the same failings that the real Jurassic Park itself would.A movie that was made without anyone considering whether it should be made. Profit and franchise potential above all else. They stood on the shoulders of geniuses just so they could slap it on a plastic lunch box. A product, nothing more.I don't regret having seen Jurassic World, and I don't hate it. But Jurassic Park was a movie I could watch over and over again, and love every single time I saw it.Jurassic World is not a movie I have any immediate attachment to, or desire to re-watch any time soon.

There's a real sense of dread, even though we know that in a movie of this type the heroes ... well that would be a spoiler, I guess, although I'm sure everybody knew how the movie would end after the first ten minutes.All in all, a thoroughly one-dimensional movie -- long on dramatic effects, short on everything else.

I am a big fan of Chris Pratt and enjoyed the original Jurassic Park when I revisited it last year. There were mixed expectations coming in with many friends telling me they really enjoyed it and many critics I know or follow being not so thrilled about the new Jurassic Park (World) reboot. What would this relatively unknown and new director (Colin Trevorrow) come up with? In the fourth installment of this prehistorically new world, it picks up 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park (1993). Jurassic World follows many characters, and two of those characters are brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell (Zach Robinson and Ty Simpkins) who get sent off to the theme park by their parents. Right after the two kids are out of hearing range, it is apparent that their is high tension between the grown ups and it is later revealed they are in the process of getting a divorce. This is my first problem with the movie, this side story line is solely their to raise the stakes for the audience in these two kids, and it is done in such a blatant and uncreative way. This is an ongoing theme throughout the film and a huge problem with the writing. On the other end of the plane is Zach and Gray's aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who runs the whole park. She is clearly a driven and work focused women who hasn't seen her nephew's in over 7 years. The boys are clearly disappointed when she is taken away on business and leaves an assistant to show the boys around the park. The business is a new attraction to revive the theme park and boost attendance. It is learned that this new ""asset"" is a genetically enhanced super dinosaur, and the billionaire owner Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) wants to make sure the dinosaur is safe enough to open up to the public. This is when the one and only Chris Pratt, playing Owen, finally comes in. I am a big fan of Chris Pratt for my favorite movie in many years The Lego Movie, and the very solid Guardians of the Galaxy.He was a moderate bright spot in this movie and was a good fit for the role, while not blowing me away as he did in the previous two films mentioned. Owen, being a Velociraptor trainer has considerable skills in this field but him and two others are tricked by the dinosaur and the other two characters pay the ultimate price and all hell is broke lose when the dinosaur escapes.In the escape of these many prehistoric animals there is a mad dash by the characters to control or eliminate the outbreak, and specifically the super dinosaur who caused it all. In this chaos Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), the head of security on the Island, wants to use the Velociraptors and his men to eliminate the problems, and him and Pratt's character clash drastically. In the first attempt to take down this creature it is CLEARLY noticed that he has camouflage capabilities when the leader of the hunt party yells out ""HE HAS CAMOUFLAGE"" before being eaten. This provides two problems for me with Jurassic World; first being the heavy handed writing and unbelievable lines delivered by characters. There is no way that character would yell that right before his ultimate demise, and we don't need to be clearly told the dinosaur has this ability because we can see that for ourselves. Second problem is my biggest problem with this movie, and it is the lack of care for the human characters deaths but a huge sentiment when one of the animals or dinosaurs is killed or hurt, it is like PETA made this movie. Can't really get into it anymore without spoilers but look for it when you see the movie, all the dramatic heft is for the hurting or deceased animals which is fine, but there is almost a disdain towards humans in this movie. I loved Marley & Me and it brought me to tears, so don't freak out that I hate animals, but when there are people dying all around and there is no care in that, but a clear dramatic focus on these genetically modified animals, we have a problem. On that note, this is a moderately violent and scary movie so young kids may be frightened. Jurassic World suffers from a heavy handed script, and an even more heavy handed animal activist agenda. There are significant thrills in this movie that can be thoroughly enjoyed, but in the end is a forgettable disappointment despite it fattening the wallets of studio executives.Check out all my reviews: https://reviewsbycaleb.com/","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, I was stuck in a deja vu of having seen the plot and knowing what lies next. The movie starts off with introducing two kids who are on a trip to Jurassic World with their mother's real sister Claire being the main head of handling the Jurassic World. Owen played by Chris has his four trained dinosaur and is called upon Jurassic to examine a new genetically modified dinosaur.The movie follows a simple plot and the acting was rather less impressive. Over the whole course of the movie I ended feeling very little for the characters portrayed. Good part, starting with graphics which are in abundance and the sound quality. Overall an average movie which you can go out and see for fun especially for kids but if you have developed an intolerance for commercial movies with little application to acting, plot and character build up then you might consider skipping the stone.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

To be honest, I thought it was the last TRUE summer blockbuster. I read the Michael Chrichton novels and enjoyed them they way a diabetic enjoys an ice cream cone; truly a guilty pleasure. Giving in to the suspension of disbelief, I had a blast seeing the first film, an okay time with The Lost World and a slightly better time with Jurassic Park III. The two sequels drew a lot of the story plots from the two Jurassic Park books, which was great, since Michael Chrichton had a wonderful imagination and was a talented story teller.Herein lies my issues with the re-boot, Jurassic World. It's simply a re-hash of the original films. There was a lot of scene-for-scene copying going on. Two kids being looked after by an aunt (instead of an uncle)? Check! A dinosaur expert to save the day? Check! A woman who screams, ""RUN!""? Check! T-Rex roaring at the end of the film? Check! The only thing missing was Newman, but at least they got his jeep to make a cameo. Seeing as Newman got eaten in the first movie, I suppose that's excusable.I think I should have seen this movie in 3D to get the full movie-ride experience out of it. Unfortunately, I waited around and missed my opportunity and saw it 2D at a (fairly packed) theater. The noise was all there, the chase scenes using a motorcycle and ORVs was there, Jeff Goldblum's photograph was there, which makes me think he's going to be in the Jurassic World sequel. What was missing? Well, Michael Chrichton's imagination for starters.The writers grabbed all of Chrichton's (RIP) original ideas and made them unoriginal. Directing was poor; the only character development worth mentioning was what they did with the genetically modified alpha beast. To be honest, there was almost too much happening on-screen and at times, it seemed like the CGI rendering couldn't keep up with the processing speed of the computers they were using to build the animation. In 3D, you probably wouldn't notice, but in 2D, the poor flicker rate was enough to give me a headache that lasted for the rest of the day.Overall, the movie was a fun summertime romp. If you can catch it in 3D, give it a shot. Otherwise, wait for it to show up as a rental. It's about as worthy as sequel to the franchise as The Lost World was... maybe a little worse.5-stars seems like a fair review from my perspective.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was boring, trite, predictable and overly contrived. Story line lacked dynamic appeal. Acting sub par. The CGI was good but one would expect it to be given advancements in technology to date. Over all a disappointment and in my view, the worst installment in the series even surpassing Jurassic Park 2 for that spot. I guess that it wold be a reasonable rental for a$1.50 at Redbox if your're having trouble with insomnia or if you're looking to complete the viewing of the whole franchise. Beyond that I think it would be fair to say that this film fell far short of my expectations.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Although it is set some twenty years after the events of the first film, and although the similar plot centers around a theme park with live dinosaurs, there appear to have been no lessons learned. The entire movie feels as if the viewer is stranded on the island with everyone else, except that they're on the Island of Poor Decision-Making Skills and not fabled Isla Nublar.Like most people, I was pretty charged up to see the new movie, since it'd been so long since the first go-around that the special effects have become much more invigorating and realistic. As fate would have it, however, the effects looked to be about the same as they had been in 1993, and that's saying something. I even saw the movie in 3D, thinking that lifelike dinosaurs would help make good use of that technology. Nothing doing. The 3D felt almost nonexistent, and not in the sense that it melted into the background (so to speak). It felt, in fact, as if someone had forgotten to leave it on for the duration of the movie.Jurassic World is set in what's more or less the present day. The park has indeed reopened, under the stewardship of Masrani (Irrfan Khan of Life of Pi). Masrani presents himself as someone who doesn't care so much about profits as he does about people being entertained and wowed by the park's attractions. Yes, sort of reminiscent of John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough) and his grand vision for the original park. Masrani's operations manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), as the movie opens, is showing off the park to potential sponsors. You know, like the Coca-Cola Pavilion at the World's Fair. Or whoever sponsors Spaceship Earth in EPCOT Center, for those of you who have no idea what the World's Fair was.The same day that Claire meets with the sponsors, her nephews Gray and Zach arrive for some bonding time. Seems Mom and Dad decided to send the boys to the park so that they could interact with Aunt Claire, who hasn't seen them in seven years or so. The presence of the kids on the island forecasts doom from the get-go, because certainly at some point they need to be imperiled. Don't worry; they will be. Being a stereotypical hard-driven, childless woman, Claire hands the boys over to her British assistant, who promptly loses (is ditched by) them. Older brother Zach is moody and somewhat sullen, as teenage boys are wont to be, and younger brother Gray is full of both energy and dino details, much like Timmy from JP1.This time around, the big attractions aren't the T-Rexes (or their exes - ha!); they're bigger and badder. The park's new creature is called Indominus rex, which turns out to be a hybrid of a T-rex and several other animals. Don't ask which animals; it's a secret to everyone, even Claire and Masrani. At any rate, to make sure everything's good to go before the new dinos are unveiled to the public, park trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is called in to evaluate little Indommy's paddock. The paddock looks secure, all right, but wouldn't you know it, the beast appears to have departed, presumably for a place where one can swallow cows whole without having to wait for a server to show up.And with that, our plot is really set in motion. There's a dino on the loose! It's funny how this keeps happening. Only now, instead of a few people who are scoping out the park before it officially opens, there are tens of thousands of people on the island, with the park fully open for business. But there's no reason to close the park, right? Of course not! It is not revealing anything of importance to mention that the first group of guards to try to contain Indominus carry nonlethal weapons. You know, so they can stun a seven-story tall monster. This is not as effective as you might think.Jurassic World is much more action movie than sci-fi movie. Instead of human characters exhibiting human characteristics, we're presented with an relatable group of people. Pratt's Owen is a hero, a good guy who has qualms about mistreating all creatures, but he's more Rambo than Indiana Jones - or Alan Grant. I like that he's there to save us all, but the lack of development of his character, who's sort of a combination of Grant and Ian Malcolm, means the movie takes a step backward in terms of fundamentally sound, creative writing. Perhaps this is the result of four different people having a hand in the screenplay.If you're too young to have experienced Jurassic Park or just plain like dumb and loud action movies, Jurassic World should please you. Kids should like it, particularly since there's little to really scare the pants off them. There are several homages to not only the first JP but also JP II and JP III, which does place this one solidly in the same cinematic universe as those other three. But two hours of chase scenes interrupted by too many haphazardly animated, similar-looking dinosaurs fighting each other and smashing humans may grow tiresome as you await the inevitable and foregone conclusion. Not to mention the obvious setup for a fifth movie.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Let's get that out of the way, because that's pretty much everything that is right about this movie.Certain people did one or two things right. George Lucas, for example. Steven Spielberg is another. But every single piece of cinema he has done after, say, Jaws, or Indiana Jones, is simply terrible.Take this movie. Jurassic Park had a certain charm, but once you get past the couple of minutes of CGI, you notice how terrible the movie is. Bad acting, bad plot, terrible acting, ham-fisted approach to storytelling, horrible acting, you name it.All of this - and more - is in this movie. It's basically a remake of Jurassic Park - it's the exact same premise, with mostly the same characters. Can Spielberg think of anything else other than child geniuses? The story is laughable - you get this feeling that the characters need to do something, fast, and they stop and try to drive the story... slooooowly. The ham-fisted approach is there - characters won't only tell you what is going on, but what exactly is going to happen. The whole movie feels like a mega-million dollar school project.Once, I thought Spielberg was an amazing presence in the movie business. But that was 30 years ago. Right now, I can't imagine why people flock to watch his movies. Perhaps because the alternatives are even worse.Save your time, watch it on video. Better yet, avoid.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Somehow, yet another Jurassic Park exists with no explanation of where it came from and the main characters once again travel to the island only to find themselves running from the dinosaurs later to escape from being eaten... Brilliant.The director, Colin Trevorrow is now slated to write and direct Episode 9, no doubt ending that franchise on a low note. The characters in this movie are so vapid and one-dimensional, you will find yourself rooting for the dinosaurs, hoping they will kill lots of people in some grandiose fashion like in the previous installments. It tries to be suspenseful, but fails miserably. Chris Pratt, who was terrific in Guardians of the Galaxy looks totally out of place in this one, displaying the same idiotic expression on his face throughout the entire film that never changes. This movie is far worse than The Lost World and that's saying something.","2 out of 20 found this helpful.

""Bubblegum movie"", you chew it and spit it out - not a classic.All i remember from the movie is Starbucks, Pandora, Mercedes, and i hate at least the first 2. These movies of the new age care more about marketing than the movie itself, the plot, the characters etc. As many one star reviews already pointed out, this movie lacked in every department. Many useless scenes and things that don't make sense. And if you have to feature a pretty redhead in heels and a sexy guy to make it interesting, your game is weak. As a redhead myself her copper hair was the most interesting thing in the movie. BUT everything felt incomplete even the romance added. I told my mother who wanted to see it ""you wont be scared at all, you wont hold your breath, no suspense"". ""Action"" seems to start very early in the movie but randomly and every scene gets watered down and the movie is in a hurry to go back to nerdy good old normal. Actors are too cold, too apathetic esp the ones in the computers room. Seems like they were forced to add some mild drama moments for old times' sake. Fast paced, no mystery, no anticipation, no fear, no escalation; so flat, ""safe"" and predictable - with scattered random mediocre short action scenes(for an impressive trailer), and the main focus is always the well lit view of the various brands they advertised. Technology at your feet but 0 inspiration. From a gadget addicted generation to the gadget addicted young viewers (the boy trying to make the other one get off his phone) - if you grew up in the 90s you know what i mean. They dare to threaten us with a sequel. If you held your breath with the raptors in the kitchen room and the jello trembling, and if you felt like the one being chased, then you demand something more!! If i were Mr. Trevorrow id be ashamed to name it after the originals. Buut one more reason to watch the good old ones again ;)","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

The beauty of the sceneries, these drone like captions which were quite impressive and the rendering the dinosaurs is actually very well done and quite realistic. I tried to watch to movie without making reference to the past Jurassic parks and decided to handle it as an innovative product. Needless to say that I was deceived.The build up to the interesting part of the movie takes way too much time. This got me particularly bored for a good section. And when came the action scenes, I must admit that they were impressive even if you could read the story and the finale before the movie had even started. Something which brings me to the second point.I actually got also bored very quickly with the story which turned out to be particularly predictable and generic. You'll find all the classic action movie cliché. So I'll not be saying anything precise on that aspect.However, the most annoying element was the music during the different scenes like a way to force the spectator to feel or react in a certain way. I found those to be particularly tacky, invasive and annoying most of the times. Action movies should leave to the spectator a certain degree of liberty with his feelings. Most of the action scenes were already quite impressive and did not require this useless addition.I found some of the acting to be particularly bad. Anyways, as far as certain characters go. Bryce Dallas Howard was not particularly convincing in the role of a boss and neither was she convincing in the role of a ""Tomb Raider"" like adventuress and neither was she convincing in a more emotional role. In resumé, I found her to be quite useless when she was painted as the main character to lead the movie with Pratt.Add to the fact that she was running in a forest all throughout or running away from dinosaurs like Usain Bolt in high heels without them breaking ever. I mean, any woman that would realistically do that would have her feet completely bummed. That alone just does not make sense at all.Even when she tried to revolt, she just did not seem all that credible. The law and order cast was kind of surprising -- and, Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio actually played his role quite well since I was only really accustomed with him in the series. BD Wong though was probably a little less convincing. He does not seem to have a huge acting palette (though I would have to see him in other movies).Finally, Omar Sy, this was a difficult movie for him. He's a very good actor in that comic type of role and this one did not have a lot of space for him to express his talent. I found him to be particularly invisible and relegated to some sort of cheap 5th hand role when he could do and be much better than that.I really wanted to see this movie but I can't help but feel after watching it a sentiment of bore. Hence the 2/10.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

But is it worth the wait? Well it was for Universal the film stomped into theatres and looks set to break into the prestigious billion-dollar club in box office gross. Benefiting the relentless marketing campaign which included a mock and very impressive Jurassic World website highlighting the impressive attention to detail put into the park. As for the quality of the film it may not be able to match the original, but it is certainly the superior of the three sequels. The main distinction between Jurassic World and its lesser counterparts The Lost World and Jurassic Park III is that Jurassic World poses the same the same theme which was the main driving force of both the first instalment and Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, a theme best explained by Dr. Ian Malcolm's memorable quote ""You were too busy asking if you could, you never stopped to ask if you should"". The park is run by Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), an eccentric Richard Branson like billionaire and the only returning character Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) who serves as a modern day Victor Frankenstein. Both could have served as exciting representatives of the dangers of capitalism and science but instead they are pushed aside for the typical all American action hero. This could had been a problem if it wasn't taken over by the always lovable Chris Pratt who has further cemented himself as the hottest star in Hollywood.As for the other characters they are rather one dimensional and undeveloped. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the conventional stubborn businesswoman, Claire, who predictably evolves into being humane, while her sister Karen (Judy Greer) spends the majority of her limited screen time back in the United States crying and worrying over her sons (this is even before the Dinosaurs start rampaging across the island) while her two children serve as the Tim and Lex stand in's. They are in the form of Zach (Nick Robinson) who is your typical hormonal teenager constantly using conveniently labelled electronic products and his dinosaur obsessed nerdy little brother Grey (Ty Simpkins). The biggest disappointment however is the clichéd human antagonist Vic Hoskins played by the wasted Vincent D'Onofrio who plays a bad guy whose bad for the sake of being bad. Hoskins is Ingen's head of security whose plan is to weaponise the raptors trained by Pratt's character Owen, at no point is his plan a secret as it's the first subject he talks about. The character of Hoskins is paper-thin and is a character more suited to a 90's family film, a certain Brian Blessed voiced hunter springs to mind. The plot involving Hoskins is part of too many undeveloped subplots that only add to the run time as opposed to the story. The main culprit is when while on Jurassic World's monorail Grey begins to randomly cry over the likelihood of his and Zach's parents getting a divorce, this subject is never bought up again failing to capitalise on adding any depth to the brothers. These uneventful subplots are likely the consequence of too many scriptwriters working on the screenplay. Four screenwriters are credited, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, served as the original screenwriters while Trevorrow and his Safety Not Guaranteed partner Derek Connolly later stepped in for the final draft, four very talented screenwriters, but all likely to have clashed during pre-production. But as any fan of the Jurassic Park franchise should know the real stars are the dinosaurs and boy they don't disappoint. The Indominus Rex is a breath of fresh air, which was lacking in the other sequels. She serves as not just a good threat to the park and its inhabitants but also a solid representation of the dangers of science. While the other ""assets"" in Jurassic World consist of the monstrous Jaws eating Mosasaurus and the previously underused Pterodactyl's, both of whom are most welcome and give the film a sense of individuality. While the 'old school' Raptors and T-Rex make more than just fan service cameos and even become integral to the main plot, even the biggest cynics will struggle to smile when the T-Rex and raptors are on screen. Trevorrow shows that he is capable of taking on such a high profile production, Jurassic World may be lacking the personality which made his indie-sci-fi-comedy debut Safety Not Guaranteed such a delight but this is a film which despite its flaws is made by people who are clearly passionate about this franchise and it will certainly appeal to fans of the original and introduce it to younger generations.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

That doesn't mean you get away with just casting him and not bothering with any other decent actors, a script, a director or anything else that makes a decent movie. But what's particularly crippling about Jurassic World is that Trevorrow and his three fellow co-writers populate the film with stock human characters who as much personality as the dump I took directly after watching the movie. Pratt demonstrated a winningly self-deprecating sense of humour in Her, The Lego Movie and on the TV series Parks And Recreation, and his ascension to movie star with Guardians Of The Galaxy was especially cheering, suggesting that he could become an A-lister without losing the modest humanity and sweet common touch that were his trademarks. Sadly, his Owen is a somewhat sensitive mush mouth who probably had to be held back several years and in real life would have tattoos on his neck and hands. He also seems to read of a q card: Whether he's establishing a personal connection with one of the dinosaurs or bickering with the walking nun's fanny, Claire, the character isn't much fun — nor is he compelling or swaggering enough to come across as a magnetic dramatic presence.

Sadly, for all those involved, humanity is so bored of T. rex and velociraptors that attendance is down and so is sponsorship. Therefore, thanks to Henry Wu (B.D. Wong reprising his role from the original), the lab have created a monster to woo back guests and moolah. Obviously, much like John Hammond's first attempt at messing with nature, things don't turn out as they planned.Chris Pratt is a velociraptor trainer (what?) who is brought in to inspect the fence surrounding this new investment by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who just happens to have family visiting for the week who are currently going through a crisis. She's far too busy to hang out with her socially misguided nephews and dumps them with her PA. Naturally, they promptly run off. Owen, the trainer, is being wooed by InGen (remember them?) to use these trained velociraptors as weapons of war. The scene is set for carnage. Or is it?What follows is so mind-numbingly dull, obvious and really rather badly put together that you will be forgiven for believing you're watching a cartoon or magic show. The main issue is that, unlike its original predecessor (or even Lost World) it can't make its mind up if its family entertainment or adult horror. This new dinosaur has every ability to terrify and yet instead the characters are faced with these horrific situations in which they remain entirely stoic or consider with mild curiosity. Contrast that with the girl in the original wetting herself before she'd even set eyes on the T-Rex and then entering a fit of cerebral palsy when confronted by a bronchiosaur. Here, two children are brutally attacked and barely a minute later are having a wander around the old jurassic park site, enjoying the murals and technology on show. Not to mention having the wits to hotwire and refuel a car that's over 20 years old. If these horrific acts occur and the characters who are facing them don't care, why should the audience? Part of the problem is pacing. The Indominus Rex escapes 20 minutes into the film, we see it in all it's glory five minutes later and then for another 2 hours watch it tear the park apart. That is far too long a time to watch a set piece implode. Therefore scenes of exposition and moments of incredulity occur to further the plot and push the I. Rex towards the park. When it finally reaches the park, 20,000 guests seem undisturbed by the massacre occurring. One very nasty moment sees a woman repeatedly drowned and bitten by pterodactyls only to be eaten by a much bigger dinosaur and the characters watching do nothing but enjoy the show. Could they actually help? Probably not. Would they watch like it was an episode of Sex and the City? Doubtful, also. And the CGI... the CGI! Good God, the first thing you see is a CG bird and my first thought was ""obviously this is a simulation at the park,"" but no, this is real, this is a bird generated by computer graphics that is meant to be in the real world. Great to know that in a movie redolent with CGI that it is going to be rather bad. It really, truly is. No scope, not one iota of attention devoted to realism, this is a cartoon through and through.However, not all of it is bad. The dino fights are brutal and the few new ramifications for the park are wonderful to mull over and talk about after. Chris Pratt, despite playing the worst possible character ever (a velociraptor trainer?!?!?!) manages to remain charismatic and heroic. Bryce D. Howard is also compelling as a control freak watching her World be destroyed bit by bit. All in all, however, my advice is to go home, by the original on blu-ray or 3D, invest in a good TV and sound system and just scare yourself silly with the original. You'll be pleased you did.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

They figure if they reheat the same leftovers, people will show up again and again. The sad thing is they're mostly right, at least with the simple minded among us.You've seen everything in Jurassic World before, only better. And while this film is miles ahead of the weird, unhappy one after, it's miles behind the first one. Chris Hemsworth or Pratt or whatever his name is is every generic Hallmark movie type you've seen before. His character is all action, little brains, but in a movie this dumb, that still makes him the smartest character onscreen. He's joined by Ron Howard's daughter -- you know, a nepo baby -- as the manly PR person with the big caboose. They're like an over-the-hill prom couple, so nauseating together you'd think you really were watching a Hallmark movie.What else is there to say? It's the same plot as the last three, which is to say the humans think they're in control and the dinosaurs still manage to get free and wreak havoc. There's nothing in here that is remotely fresh, with the possible exception of some particular cruelty to an office drone who, while annoying, still doesn't deserve her fate. The director, Colon Trevennanananaeasoh seems to delight in how she gets dispatched.There's a couple of annoying kids, too, but then all of these movies have that. The movie also walks a line between being a ""serious"" monster movie and camp, such as when we see the fullback Howard run down a puddle-strewn alley in her heels.The usual special effects are here, but somehow not particularly special. There are few scares but the movie pretends like it has more. I'd hoped after this one they'd make no more -- I mean, why ruin the legacy of what was one pretty good movie, one so-so movie, and one underwhelming movie? But, no, they just had to do another one and then one more. I guess if the only thing on the menu is franks and beans, that's what people are going to buy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We've moved on from Jurassic Park to Jurassic World, so maybe i'm a little harsh since they somewhat acknowledge things have changed.This movie does half of what it wanted to do well and the other half so wrong. I like that there is more of a background to Dr Wu and an explanation behind what Ingen did in the past, including the reasons for genetic differences etc. But even in this action/fantasy movie we take a few too many trips to silly town, starting off with Chris Pratt playing Owen Grady training Velociraptors? It's just something that does not need to be in the film and it doesn't fit. The only purpose it serves is to have an easy way for our main characters not to die and a great advert/poster when Mr Grady rides alongside them on a quad. Seriously, I mean it has even made it onto the cover here on IMDB.The action scenes aren't bad, but there is far too many of them and did you enjoy the T-Rex turning it's head to the side to look through a car window in the first movie? Because get ready to see every dinosaur do it repeatedly any time there needs to be a little tension. It even makes it into the next movie too, and the only reason it worked so well in the original? Because the action was built up and it was only used once.In the end Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do their best to make the movie fun, and along with the new introduction of an underwater reptile it isn't all bad.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The actual movie itself played second fiddle to the jaw dropping advance in technology that we saw as dinosaurs roamed the screen. The subsequent movies were always destined to struggle as the wow factor had gone and we could focus on the movie itself. Even 20 years later the dinosaurs don't really look any more impressive. Maybe they would have done in 3d.Anyway as to the movie itself it will not come as any great surprise that the recently opened park is destined for some issues keeping those pesky dino's under control. In an attempt to keep the public in awe the geneticists have created even more jaw dropping hybrid dinosaurs. You have to question with all the issues that have surrounded the park whether anybody would ever consider visiting.Anyway think there was a bit of a love story going on with the same success at chemistry as the dino geneticists. As with many blockbusters couldn't help hoping the dinosaurs would win, but will have to hope they stage another comeback in a couple of years time - sure they will!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was thinking about hitting the ""spoiler alert"" button but this movie was so recycled and dry that there was no need. Let me first address the acting. Pretty bad. Ty Simpkins (Insidious) gave the best performances and even outshined Chris Pratt, who is usually outstanding, but he was mildly amusing and too badass for a Chris Pratt like character. The film was lazy, poorly executed and it was one of the few films where I wanted it to be over. Save for some good but not great CGI and special effects, the movie was not stunning nor extraordinary like a Jurassic movie should be. They didn't even bother explaining anything, they simply dove right into the action that people distinguish as ""a good movie"". However, I am a huge fan of Chris Pratt and I always enjoy seeing him even if he's not his usual self. He's not that great of an actor, he can play one character, the goofy, lovable, mildly stupid hero, but he still somehow delivered to me even through his mediocre performance. I would just skip this movie all together, as it's 2 hours of your life better spent watching Ant Man or Southpaw that you'll never get back.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jurassic World takes the next step and actually opens the park which is the most interesting aspect of the film but the films biggest crutch is nostalgia. This film is more concerned that you remember the spectacle and amazement of the original instead of creating its own and the films biggest flaw is having no characters to attach to, none of them are relatble or even intruiging like Ian Malcolm, Alan Grant, Ellie sattler, John Hammond or even his grandkids. Logic goes the way of the wind and completely abandons the movie instead opting to do whatever is ""cool"" or of course nostalgic. This is perhaps the lowest point of the franchise lacking any heart or soul. If you love the dinos and good writing need not apply this film is yours, otherwise like everyone should have done with the idea of ressurecting dinosaurs after the original, this film is a hard pass.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It isn't absolutely terrible or anything, and Chris Pratt does a highly decent job with what he has to work with, but it's still easily the worst of the four. Yes, I said it. Jurassic Park 3 is a better movie than Jurassic World. Let's just skip the fact that the special effects actually looked more realistic 20 years ago (!!!) and go straight to the meat of it...The beginning of the movie was filled with silly conversations of stereotypical character that made my brain hurt, the plot quickly developed into something far fetched and unnecessarily ridiculous, plot twists were cliché and/or even more far fetched, the ending was wrapped up with a icky-sweet and stupid moment, and last, but not least, the movie left us with some gigantic plot holes. I mean, we're talking inexcusably unresolved problems at the end of the movie, that rendered everything pretty meaningless. I'm left questioning the professional abilities of the writers and the director.What were they thinking?! As I'm writing this, The Lost World has a 6.5 rating, while Jurassic World has a 7.1 rating. That is unbelievable. No way is this a better movie than The Lost World.All in all, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it. Go ahead and bring out the popcorn and drinks! Just don't expect movie history to be made. Sure, there were a couple of cool moments and some nice scenes, but nothing like in the first two, and sadly the CG stuff quite honestly make things less believable. I think the movie is mostly saved by Chris Pratt being quite badass, so there's that to look forward to.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The other good aspect about this film would be that it doesn't use shaky cam. However this film has a lot of problems and the first of which in my opinion is the special effects, they are not very special the CGI used has made the dinosaurs look fake, they looked better in the original film. The second thing I didn't like is that this film is not well paced the script is not written that well because the action does not take place until the second hour of this film. The other thing that annoys me is that some of the characters on screen do stupid things and nothing ever happens to them.

It's binary fine: one bit this way, one bit that way. The ""world"" is, and exists only because some well-off humans can afford to blow some dispensable income on travelling to an island for a few days to gawk at the amazingness that is an unethical use of science.The movie is superficially pro-science, giving evolution its second 15 minutes of fame. We can create fantastical entertainment, but it might also kill us. Modern problems sure are two-edged swords!We have a throwaway plot, that profit is king, and privilege is best when you are on an island full of over 20,000 people trying to outlive a gaggle of pterodactyls. And let me put on my ""old man"" hat to say the movie is unnecessarily cruel and sadistic, with the British assistant suffering a worse death than anything from the Final Destiny movies, to the bitey-biteyness of all the bloody dino fights.Sad, sad, sad, we must feel at the pointless murder of all the happy-go-lucky, vegetarian, apatosauruses, who in reality are nothing but a stream of ones and zeroes. The cruel world spawned by an Asian biologist and an Arabic boss-man-owner is just an island of corporate greed, floating on each scene's profit models, only to have the Pretty White People swoop in and save most of the visitors. Never mind the Tyrannosaurus Rex nor the countless pterodactyls running amok and wantonly. It's an adventure of privilege, a privileged adventure.Star Lord reprises his iconic role as Butt Lord, the only man in the world who can relate to lizards because he's the only one who treats them with respect and treats them like they're real animals. Plus, he was also in the Navy (and is not a Navajo), so he really knows how to stroke a lizard.What's a villain? Who's a bad person? Corporate greed and its devotees. Everyone bad dies savagely, and no one good suffers too much. That's why we all need to make Good Life Choices. We should never play God with life, that's pushing it too far, and none of this mess would have been possible without evil scientists' desires to control and improve upon God's design.Instead, we should commodify the human spirit, body, and soul. We should make everyone desire the same things, so we can maximize profit by reducing the cost of producing or tolerating variety. Watch as a fine-tuned machine mechanically separates chickens. With time and a spirit of the will, someday a machine will mechanically separate people.Near the midpoint, the Pretty White People find an overgrown, old Jurassic Park spot, a reminder of the first movie, a movie that was better in nearly every way. It no longer matters whether the CGI looks or feels real. You simply watch in awe that professional actors could ever deliver such crappy dialogue without laughing or wincing.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Too much of this felt like a product not a film. The Indominus talking to the raptors was silly, the characters were pretty 1D and didn't have any real development or arc.

Yes says the scientist in the next scene.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First timers may feel the ride to be awesome, but to you it would just be something you just had to do.This is exactly the problem with the new movie in the Jurassic Series.You have seen it all, been through it all, so you are not surprised, by now you also know the different kinds of dinosaur species which exist and you also can predict what happens and how the movie gets to end.I am not saying it is a bad experience for the movie going audience, but it is not a WOW experience either. Jurassic World is a hybrid of the previous 3 Jurassic movies.Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the operations manager of Jurassic world says halfway through the film that to pique the audience's interest, new and improved attractions should be provided or else they would start losing interest in Jurassic world and that's what the filmmakers intended to do with this one, Each of the Jurassic series provided with a meaner and tougher beast then its predecessor.In this one, we have the the Indominus Rex(a hybrid of Abelisaurus,Carnotaurus,cuttlefish,Giganotosaurus,Majungasaurus,Rugo PS,tree frog,Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Velociraptor DNA), which means like the cuttlefish it can also camouflage itself and can hunt and chew its food like the T-Rex.Coming to the movie, we have two teenagers who are whisked to this Jurassic World while their parents are undergoing a nasty divorce. Zach and Gray are looking forward to meet their aunt Claire, who is the operations manager at Jurassic world. But Claire busy with the Indominus Rex hands them over to her assistant.The owner of Jurassic World Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) enlists the assistance of Owen (Chris Platt) to oversee the safety and vulnerable areas in the Indominus Rex Enclosure.The inevitable happens and The reptile breaks free and the two teenagers are trapped in the park. Claire and Gray set on a rescue mission to get the kids back, even while a team of experts is brought to hunt the reptile. Sounds familiar! It should, kids trapped, dinosaur breaking loose, killing people and rescue mission- weren't these the themes of the former 3 Jurassic movies.OK, the movie was predictable, but in its defense, it was not hammer and tongs, and The CGI was excellent, there are enough thrills to make you crush your popcorn pack.Bryce Dallas Howard is excellent as Claire, and the way she switches from a professional corporate executive thing to a worried aunt is commendable. The scene where she shows Owen that she is ready for any eventuality is hilarious and she managed to get the timing right when she flees from the Indominus Rex and ignores Owen's hand for help.Chris Pratt is no great shakes as the heroic Owen, there is something missing in his characterization that we do not even mind when Claire takes over completely from him and carries the movie on her shoulders.Irrfan Khan's role was more of an extended cameo, and he managed to steal the thunder with whatever little screen time was allotted to him. Wished there was more of him.Kevin Stitt's editing was crisp and that contributes a lot in making this predictable movie interesting.John Schwartzman's Cinematography was good and the way the opening scenes were captured was excellent.Colin Trevorrow managed to direct this one with whatever material he had on hand and using the preceding movies as a kind of bible to take things forward. Wish he collaborated with a better script writer to come up with a novel theme rather then dishing out leftovers.If you ask me to rate this one, I guess I would go in for 2.5, watch it if you have nothing else to do and if you still do want to take a ride into the Jurassic era, I recommend watching JURASSIC PARK once again.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

But due to a steady decline in attendance over the years, the team decides to unveil its latest attraction; a genetically modified hybrid. However, things soon spiral out of control when this new monster escapes from its enclosure.Directed by Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World is only his sophomore feature film & it's a huge responsibility, both in scope & expectations, for the movie is envisioned as a sequel as well as a possible resurrection of the dusted franchise. The new director does bring an interesting viewpoint that aims to revitalise the series without competing with the legacy of the original but he also fails in implementing that idea on the film canvas in a satisfying manner.The screenplay is another culprit for neither the plot nor the characters carry any depth, the dialogues are eye-rollingly cheesy, plus the story lacks any element of surprise & is way too predictable for it to be any fun. The technical aspects don't have anything new to offer here other than providing a slightly improved visual encapsulation. Isla Nublar is brought to life in splendid detail yet it seems to have more resemblance with a petting zoo than a dinosaur theme park.Cinematography impresses as well as disappoints at various moments for there are plenty of scenes that could've benefited from a different viewing angle and thanks to its continuously shifting focus, even its action sequences fail to make the desired impact. There's no proper set-up to any major sequences, the suspenseful mood is pretty much non-existent, and the extent to which product placement is infused into the whole narrative is maddening.Michael Giacchino's score also fails to provide an immersive experience and it is only when John Williams' iconic theme hits the screen that a deep sense of warmth & intense feelings of nostalgia are evoked. It's just amazing how inferior the visuals effects are in Jurassic World when compared to Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park or The Lost World. Even Jurassic Park III had more realistic-looking dinosaurs than this latest entry plus the CGI rendering isn't up to the mark either.Coming to the performances, the ensemble comprises of Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan & B.D. Wong, and each of them either underacts or overacts. Pratt dons his Indiana Jones suit to play the Velociraptor expert & trainer, Dallas Howard is busy hamming all the time, D'Onofrio's work is all over the place, Omar Sy exists for no reason, Khan's input is as viable as his works in other Hollywood flicks and the two child actors are as stupid as kids usually are.On an overall scale, Jurassic World is as disappointing a feature as I expected it to be after checking out its trailers and is no different from the usual mindless big-budget blockbusters that plague the silver screen at this time of the year. An absolutely flat cinematic experience that features lifeless characters, hollow dinosaur-action, no suspense, zero soul & while it isn't entirely a disaster, Jurassic World never for once comes close to capturing the unparalleled magic of Spielberg's timeless masterpiece.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

There's tons of suspense, many ""jump"" scenes, and some chases/crashes; basically, the characters -- including children -- are in near-constant peril. (All of this is made more intense in the 3-D version, though the effects aren't as overbearing as some newer 3-D releases.) Expect a bit of mild swearing (as well as one ""s--t"") and some smoking and drinking, too.
