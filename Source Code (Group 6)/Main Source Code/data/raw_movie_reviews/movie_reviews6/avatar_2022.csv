But Cameron should be better than this.I'm a big fan of Mr Cameron. Not only for his directing skills, but also for his screenwriting skills. But this time he seemed to have missed the goal. I know he rarely does sequels. But is this the best he could do? The story has not changed anything compared to the previous episode. Repeated crises, repeated enemies, repeated conflicts,and wait a minute,WHAT? Even repeated Titanic. Are you serious?As a director, he also did not reach his previous level. For a long time, the pace of the film felt too slow. Yes, the underwater scenes are phenomenal. But this is not the Blue Planet, this is a sci-fi action movie. At least it's what most audiences expect from the film, isn't it?","278 out of 416 found this helpful.

The movie tries to focus on ""family"", and with Jake and Neytiri already had a movie, this one focus heavily on the children. But most of the plot lines fall into the trap of being a set-up for sequels. A few plots left unanswer in the end and a few plots begin after the mid point and already wrap after just after being introduced. Some of the charcaters are downgraded into 1 dimensional and some do not learn anything meaningful throughout the story. And the focus of the movie shifts completely once entered the third act which diminishes all the set-up from before.In conclusion, definitely a must watch, better visuals but slightly worst script.","172 out of 254 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Damn James Cameron...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8735920/?ref_=tt_urv","Dory_Darko","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14277539/?ref_=tt_urv","14 December 2022","He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.","1,053 out of 1,679 found this helpful.

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","1,196 out of 1,989 found this helpful.

While the movie boasts stunning visuals and a unique underwater world, it lacks the emotional depth and compelling storyline that made the first film so memorable.The biggest issue with ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is its lackluster storyline. The plot is thin and predictable, with little to no character development. The film relies heavily on clichéd tropes and predictable twists, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and uninvested in the outcome.Another problem with the movie is its pacing. The movie is slow and meandering, with scenes that drag on for too long and fail to move the story forward. The underwater scenes are beautiful, but they can also be overwhelming and repetitive, leaving the audience feeling numb rather than immersed in the story.The characters in ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" are also disappointing. Despite the efforts of the talented cast, the characters are one-dimensional and lack the depth and complexity of those in the original film. Even the villain is cartoonish and uninteresting, with no real motivation or backstory to make them compelling.Overall, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a lackluster sequel that fails to capture the magic and emotional resonance of the first film. While it may appeal to fans of the original for its stunning visuals and familiar world-building, it ultimately falls short in terms of storytelling and character development.""","12 out of 12 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Another technical achievement for James Cameron but the story is simple and forgettable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8736298/?ref_=tt_urv","jaysonpajaronvistal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158145467/?ref_=tt_urv","15 December 2022","I decided to rewatch the first Avatar last night before watching Avatar 2 and I am always in awe of how stunning the visuals are; it was a crowd-pleaser and more agreeable for the general audience. However, with the first Avatar, the story was basic and simple---it was rather forgettable. The thing is, the Avatar franchise has a simple story but it was told grandly. 'Avatar: The Way of Water' was a captivating visual feast, with every attempt beautifully framed via painstakingly flawless CGI, but the message about protecting your loved ones is not new to us, but it was ingenious. James Cameron's level of perfectionism translates to the audience; the details of every frame are precise and I can't help but wonder how on earth he has done that. It is the simple plot accompanied by such technical achievement that has always been the formula for almost all of Cameron's movies, not just Avatar. Simplicity is not a bad thing.Just like in the first Avatar, characters are established a lot, and there is not much emotional attachment during the first half. However, the thrill and excitement peaked during the second act were worth it---This is the trick for most highly-budget films, they will entice you with visual and technical achievement, but the story is not that grand nor special for the audience to keep talking about it in the next 5 years. The Pandora world Cameron takes us to is excellent and magnificently conceptualized, but the story is missing the emotional draw that made this film a pretentious masterpiece. Though the visuals are still magnificent, it's difficult this time not to recognize the repetition of the story and the limited character arcs the movie presented. You will remember Avatar---aside from blue people---as a movie with impeccable and out-of-this-world visuals, but the story remains forgettable.Some films are just pure escapism and sometimes that's what audiences need, and this is what Avatar 2 delivered. Avatar 2 doesn't necessarily check all those boxes to become a great film, but what it does right will offer viewers moments of astonishment, full-body immersion, and beauty. You can easily watch the movie and points out its mistakes and flaws, but it is hard to resist the fun and adventure the film delivers throughout its 192 minutes runtime. It is clear that James Cameron is making this movie for a general audience, and while imperfect, it certainly seems to serve its purpose.","283 out of 456 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Messy and Inconsistent Plot Points, Over bloated With Teen Melodrama, But Pretty Visuals","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8834199/?ref_=tt_urv","dommercaldi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96338646/?ref_=tt_urv","29 January 2023","Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?","357 out of 437 found this helpful.

It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.","420 out of 703 found this helpful.

I'm just gunna write from my heart here on this one, mainly because that's what was impacted most by this ""movie"". We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable.

Some lower ratings will be expected since it wasn't as action packed as the first one and the main plot isn't anything mind-blowing. However I think this was an amazing experience. The visuals were truly stunning and mesmerizing. I'd say 99% of the effects in this movie were unbelievably good and where there were some few scenes that could've looked better, those scenes still looked as good (if not even better) than most other block buster movies like the MCU. Story wise I believe it was simple, but definitely not bad. The movie focuses more on developing the characters bond with each other and their own individual progress. The movie wasn't as action packed and grand as the first Avatar, which is to be expected since there's 3 more films to follow now. The 3+ hour run time felt like it flew past and as the movie was concluding I actually wished it was longer just cause how amazingly well done the effects were, especially the underwater scenes.The movie definitely lived up to all of my expectations after the first movie, which basically were: even more incredible visual effects, cool action scenes and a good story.","153 out of 247 found this helpful.

I watched the movie hundreds of times. The expectation was very high.The visual of the movie is very fantastic. The 3D seems real. It was a great experience visually. Overwhelmed with the visual effects.The story was missing, it seems like a very common story. It was very predictable. Some scene was elongated which was boring. Seems like watching discovery channel in 3D in the cinema.My personal rating is 7 for this movie only for the visualisation of the Pandora's water & the animals under the water. May be for the movie I would give a 5.We have got lot's of finest movies from Jams Cameroon. He is one of the talented directors of all time.

Nowhere is this more evident than the mammoth Avatar sequel. He pulls off yet another visually stunning film that feels real, but the indulgence of the studio and no one to say no to him create some unfortunate flaws.The humans are almost universally cartoonishly evil. When they come back to Pandora, their ships essentially nuke a majority of the setting of the last film. They cruelly hunt whale analogues, specifically hunting females with calfs, all while knowing explicitly that they are intelligent, emotional alien species.Cameron's biggest issue though is the cast. There are about 10 or so main characters in this movie, and Cameron tries to give all but two a complete, separate, story arc of their own. Several times it feels like 3 movies were actually spliced and intercut together because there are so many threads being handled at the same time, but to his credit, they all come together exceptionally well in the climax and are all fairly satisfyingly and efficiently resolved.So while it is fashionable to hate on everything that anyone ambitious tries to do right now, and try and root for everything popular to fail, I think Way of Water is a very interesting experience which should be seen in 3D at the theatre as the director intended. Because, while the film is by no means perfect, when someone tells you they built their own rocket to Mars in the back yard, people should gather to watch the launch because succeed or fail, it is going to be worth the price of admission.","23 out of 32 found this helpful.

JC's return doesn't disappoint providing a story with more depth, emotion and fantastic new characters.8 or 9 out of 10 is the rating this movie deserves to be. The only moments that let the movie down are some cheesy and cringey lines from the kids and Neytiri almost disappearing in the second act, otherwise, this movie is amazing and sets up the coming film's brilliantly. Worthington and Saldana provide the audience with incredible performances as they did in the first. Lang continues as Quaritch which is great considering his fantastic antagonist role in the first film, will be interesting to see his role in 3, 4 and 5. Finally, some great additions to the cast who play Jakes kids and those of the Metkayina clan. Will be interesting to see if Cameron can pull in some more A-listers for the coming sequels!IMAX and 3D is the way to go for this if you do decide to see it, you will not regret it.Unfortunately, people will hate this film as audiences are too critical these days, but it is what it is.Can't wait to be back in the cinemas for the third instalment!","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

Creates a beautiful, vibrant world with a basic, paint by numbers plot. If someone had stepped in and cut this movie an hour shorter, we might have been okay but instead I was getting bored, checked my watch and saw I still had 45 minutes to go.Is the world beautiful? Yes, absolutely. Does the adjusted frame rate work? No, action scenes feel like a cut scene from a video game. How's the story? Mediocre. The overarching story gets lost and forgotten because James Cameron wants to paint the whole world. As he does that, he fills it in with random cliché side plots to distract you until you remember, oh yeah, there's a big bad villain out there. The story feels like something my 6 year old niece would write. Bouncing from one thought to the next.Rough synopsis: Oh the *Insert character/Group* is in trouble! Lets go save them. How could you do that? You know better. Here's a beautiful CGI thing to look at. Rinse/repeat.Major themes carry over from the first one. Humanity is bad except for ""our"" white savior. He's the good guy. Here's a new group of Navi that don't trust us at first but they'll come around after a scary moment.The story feels like Cameron kept adding on one story trope after another and no one walked into the room to knock the pen out of his hand. If you end up watching it, do yourself a favor and get up to pee halfway through. Grab some popcorn and a drink. Maybe taking a break from Pandora will make it not so insufferably long.","5 out of 5 found this helpful.

As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed.

And, for the most part, it's a visually stunning and modestly entertaining piece of cinema. But is it the masterpiece everyone has been anxiously waiting for? Hardly. While the film is long on style (it truly is gorgeous to look at), it comes up short on substance. The script is the main problem here, telling a tale that's not overly engaging or insightful (certainly much less so than its more compelling predecessor) and full of story threads that either regurgitate material from the original or borrow from a variety of other sources, both narratively and visually. Then there's the runtime, coming in at a whopping 3:13:00, far, far longer than it needs to be, especially in the overly protracted closing hour. The action sequences become a bit tiresome and gratuitous after a while, and other segments feel like a polished travelogue for the Pandora Chamber of Commerce. What's more, there are storylines left unresolved, making this a picture that can't fully live up to being a standalone entity (one of my moviemaking pet peeves). To its credit, though, the picture's pacing is surprisingly tolerable for a film of this length, and it makes excellent use of its 3D technology (perhaps better than any other movie in which I've seen it employed in recent years). Still, for an offering that's been 13 years in the making, I expected something a little fresher and more inventive than this. But, for those who can't get enough of this franchise, this installment should satisfy nicely. And, if not, fans can look forward to three more sequels scheduled to be released over the next six years (though I'm not sure how many of them I'll be seeing).","65 out of 105 found this helpful.

But nonetheless, maybe it just tell us how important that simple message is.All in all, might just go and watch it again for the visual treat ;)","38 out of 63 found this helpful.

However, I am happy to report that this movie has exceeded all expectations and allowed me to relive the original experience of my younger self.Its visuals alone are enough to send any casual viewer into a trance, allowing you to be spoon fed the entire time by James Cameron and his wildest imagination. The underwater visuals are simply astounding and I have no doubts your eyeballs will be working overtime to keep up. While the colour blue does seem to be the entire theme of the movie it's more than fitting for a film that is at least 60% underwater.The plot itself is not the most immersive part of the movie but I assure you it's made up for by the entire experience. To summarise, James Cameron has done an amazing job, I'm glad to have lived to a time where amazing sci fi concepts can be brought to life and given the justice they deserve.9/10 would recommend.","38 out of 63 found this helpful.

It was a movie that I couldn't find what I wanted in the story part. If we focus on visual quality, I don't have much to say about it. It may even be the best film to shoot underwater. You feel like you are under the water with the players. But that's all. This feeling may turn into why I am watching this movie after a while. At least so did I. Of course, everyone has different viewing tastes. If you say I like visuals very much, it gives me great pleasure to watch, watch this movie.

Which is unfortunate. We're basically talking about the fictional representation of poachers and colonists, so if you feel attacked you should read an actual history book.The movie was probably one of the best of 2022. Still slightly too long for my taste, the middle part of the movie did feel like a stretch sometimes. But I guess that that was the necessary foundation for an incredible finale.It had to do plenty of world building and introduce new characters which were all established well, though I kind of feel that Avatars world building is not detailed enough sometimes, it just builds everything through CGI and then tells 1 or 2 stories and thinks its sufficient. I'm expecting a lot more detail to also challenge the audience. The relationships established are great, you get a really good sense of the family dynamics (which means there is not much room for other characters) and the fighting is top notch. What actually bothered me was how one sided the villain was, I mean towards we see some improvement but I wished he was more multi-faceted tbh. But still all in all great Cinema experience and a step up from the first movie! I'd rate it an 8-8.5 but due to unnecessary review bombings I'm rating it as a 9.","9 out of 12 found this helpful.

Cameron knows well how to immerse his audiences in the incredible sight of aquatic plants and sea animals including the giant whale-like creature.There are some dynamic set-pieces, dizzying action sequences and panicky thrills - but then there is all the ethnological and biological material, like a fanciful issue of National Geographic brought to life in very slow motion (an impression not helped by James Horner's 'world music' score). The balance between these filmic elements is as fragile as Pandora's ecosystem - and there are many moments, even longueurs, where this balance is in danger of tipping the wrong way. Avatar: The Way of Water feels long - a sprawling, indulgent trawl through an invented ecosphere that may mirror concerns of our own planet, but also both explores and exposes the limits of wonder.","35 out of 59 found this helpful.

The indigenous in this place are called Na'vi, harmonious and peaceful and they're free, with Jake Sully as their chief, they have the power and belief, to force adversaries away and make them flee. But these invaders play their cards as Avatars, it gives them strength to match the locals and it jars, so Jake moves his family, away to islands out at sea, taking to the air, while traveling afar.101 years before Avatar The Way of Water was created, Charles Chaplin released what must have been to cinema goers at the time a work of amazement with 'The Kid', to this day one of the greatest pieces of film projected on a big screen. Comparing these two films is impossible, the advances in technology and the way images are presented today is mind-blowing. I left the cinema excited but a little sad, that I won't be around to see or experience what magic film lovers might absorb, and how they might absorb it in the year 2122, but I did feel overwhelmed at the incredible effects, the imagination, and innovations used to present an analogous story to ones lived out on a planet whose environment's not too dissimilar to Pandora. While the themes it transmits are by no means original or new in their translation, the way they are presented, over three hours that flies by, is truly awe inspiring and almost beyond belief.See it on the biggest screen you can, in 3D, and savour every moment of it.","156 out of 302 found this helpful.

The sequel to the 2009 hit still glimmers with soul and shows a keen understanding of the craft it takes to create a motion picture. The CGI and effects are sublime, a beauty to behold. The musical scores, as well as Zoe Saldaña captivating vocals on a certain track are also truly heartfelt and help add to the magic and ambience that is Pandora.Unfortunately, while this picture has a lot to boast about visually, I found the story to be safe, unoriginal, and lacking. It's a shame, as once you get to the meat of what is happening which is explained early on, you expect there to be more to it as time goes by. But what you see on the surface is what you get. This doesn't mesh well with the one dimensionality of characters, new and old who are brought into the Avatar universe, quickly to be forgotten. Bad guys who are one note, with simplistic motives, with no sense of curiosity or reaction to the world or the events around them. Even if the film is going for sending a message like it's predecessor, I think the characters require more deft handling to really bring them to life and show a bit of confliction when dealing with their inner demons. The black and white storytelling creates an easy plot devise to rally around the bad guys defeat, while unapologetically sympathising with the good guys. It's a laziness that shouldn't be present in a film of Cameron's caliber.In relation to the characters mentioned earlier, I also couldn't say I found there to be any stand out performances from the cast in this movie. While I didn't find anyone's performance lacking, I also wasn't blown away like I had been with the first. Neytiri, played by the masterful Zoe Saldaña showcased a plethora of emotion in the first movie that still resonates to this day. But in The Way of Water, despite her character being given things to work with, and still personally being the strongest in the cast, I was still left wanting more. So you can imagine how I feel about the rest of the cast. But that is no way saying that the acting was subpar, but rather again that the direction and writing didn't give them too much to work with. Despite having a running time of over 3 hours, this film still felt somehow rushed in that I wasn't able to connect with the characters in the same way that I did the first. And this feeling, or lack thereof, comes back to bite in the final act of the film, which left things feeling very anti-climactic and unfinished by the end. At least for me.Overall, this film is a stunning spectacle that I would recommend fans of the first to see. And while I am overall disappointed in the direction this film took as a whole, I am still optimistic about the franchise and what sequels will have to offer in the future.","15 out of 22 found this helpful.

It all feels like a big filler movie to an upcoming third movie. The motivation of the antagonist is really state of the art and super cliche. There are a lot of scenes that are way too long and do not bring the story any further. There were a few moments in the cinema, where I wished that the scene is finally over.When I try to remember the highlights of the movie, there isn't any particular moment to name. (My biggest highlight was the mission impossible exclusive look before the movie, which was ironically way more memorable as any scene of Avatar 2)The characters are super boring and I wasn't really interested in one of them. Till the end you really even can't differentiate between the two sons, because they basically have the same look and Character. It tries too hard to be emotional, but fails to succeed, because of the lack of care for the protagonists.Effect wise there are a lot of pretty moments but also a lot of super ugly 3d Videogame, bad physics moments that really destroyed the moment. It's just not consistent. If you compare it to lasts years Dune, in which everything is a super consistent and polished world, you realize that there are big differences between those two movies in terms of world building and set design. But there are indeed some really beautiful moments and great sets, it just isn't consistent.The High frame rate often really enhances the experience, it just isn't there all the time, which leads to moments where the framerate changes with every cut. It looks really jittery in these scenes and is a little bit annoying.It's not a bad movie, but in my opinion far behind all the expectations and no where near the cinematic milestone some critics have talked about. It's a pretty standard, mediocre film with some great and some bad visuals, a weak uninspired story and a run time which is half an hour to long.","82 out of 150 found this helpful.

It just flows slower than the original. There will be a point for all of us where the story slows down enough to make you realize you have to go to the bathroom and that's how much you actually love the film. For me I think that was 12 or 15 minutes before the end credits rolled. That's pretty good.As a sequel we got a more Indepth look at the characters from the last movie, which included some surprising comebacks, and of course we got some new characters as this story is no longer about Jake Skully's adventure, but the adventure of the family he made snice we last saw him.What I found interesting is that the hole hoopla of the film is that its filmmaker James Cameron had to wait the 12 to 13 years for the technology capable to make this film. You could say the sign of a good director was that I could not tell what that technology was capable of, but I have to say, visually, that first film was far more outstanding than what I saw here.I did love the introduction of some new characters that brought us the new culture of the sea people, but in comparison to the original I was expecting a lot more underwater spectacular, I was expecting to see dozens of alien marine life, but Camren chose to concentrate this marine life to one creature which was not a bad idea cause it led so greatly to a well-formed story.I'll admit this adventure had a few loopholes that I think were done on purpose because we know the franchise is growing, but this second Avitar movie, not surprisingly worth that IMAX 3D ticket price in every way possible.","167 out of 331 found this helpful.

But what I've noticed most is how technical feats are always used in the service of character and world-building.You will find out by watching this movie, James Cameron is a master of technology... and his direction in this film is the most accurate of its kind. Overall, the film is a technological marvel with a breathtaking worldContrary to some critics, I must say that this film is at its best in terms of story, spectacle, spirituality and beauty of this filmmaking and storytelling.As I was already sure, this movie will easily receive several Oscars, including the best special effects and direction, and that it will undoubtedly break records at the box office (2 billion), probably!In the end, I have to say that James Cameron has managed to create a sea and galaxy epic that only he can handle. The movie ""Avatar 2"" is a strange, delightful, dark and very blue work. James Cameron is still miles ahead of the rest.","82 out of 155 found this helpful.

The visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning - so much so that you actually tend to forget how incredible it is while watching it since it is so masterfully done throughout.I rewatched the first Avatar the same day as I went to see this one, and even though there are some obvious changes made to the story and the universe itself, it isnt done with too much consequense to the overall experience so all good there.The only real criticism I have to give is regarding the story/plot - or the lack thereof. While the first movie had an extremely simple and unoriginal story at least there was one. Avatar: The Way of Water seamingly has no plot or considerable storyline at all and sets out mainly to show off its visual superiority which makes it seem a bit hollow. Naturally this is a shame but I will still recommend this movie for the visuals and the delightful reunion with the universe of Pandora.","28 out of 48 found this helpful.

I am in an in between zone where i can't say that the movie lived to my expectations nor did it really disappoint me, however i still enjoyed it with the great visuals but being perfect made it a bit weird at times! Also the movie has a unique problem which i never encountered before which is a frames problem. There were cut und shots where you will see everyone moving faster than the previous shots with something being strange about it! Also discovering the world during the first half of the film and trying to amaze the audience with beauty of the visuals was waaaay too long during the first half of the film, then the second half of it the action started and it didn't disappoint.

I was interested too but not as much as my son. There is enough feedback online on the movie being long, monotonous etc. Here I am presenting my views on the movie. Hope it is interesting enough.I watched the 3D, English version of the movie even though other languages were available. The only reason was that regional languages usually mess up the translation of English movies. What I have seen is that the feedback of negativity has largely come from people watching other languages.The movie starts off where the first part ends. Jake Sully has amalgamated into the Navii community and is leading a happy life with his wife and children. But, that is about to end when the Sky force comes back with greater power and in the Navii form to extract revenge by eliminating Jake Sully. Jake realises that this time, victory would not be easy and so runs away from his forest community to seek refuge in the water world clan of Naviis. The rest of the movie is about whether Jake succeeds and what price he ends up paying for success.Before I talk about VFX, I have to comment on the skill with which James Cameron has given space to emotions. For all its VFX, Avatar 2 is an extremely emotional movie about a family's fight for its existence. The skill with which he uses VFX to tell this story is amazing. The movie has huge VFX portions, but it does not take your attention away from the storyline or emotions.The VFX indeed is pathbreaking. I had seen the first Avatar in one of the largest IMAX screens in the world in US and I had great expectations therefore on the second one and believe me, it did not disappoint me. The climax portion of around 35-40 minutes indeed takes your breath away. The underwater visuals are so skilfully done that you become a part of the movie itself. You literally feel the water on your skin.Just don't believe any of the negative reviews. Simply go and watch. Its a long movie no doubt and you need some level of patience to dig into the movie. Believe me, its not time wasted.","46 out of 83 found this helpful.

The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.","178 out of 237 found this helpful.

The main reason for this approach was that the film lacked a strong screenplay and the story failed to captivate me. The narrative felt disjointed and lacked a cohesive flow, making it difficult for me to stay fully engaged.While the film excelled in its visual presentation, aiming to enchant the audience with its stunning imagery, it relied heavily on this aspect alone. The visuals were undeniably breathtaking, and the cinematography was top-notch. Each frame was meticulously crafted to create a visually immersive experience. However, the reliance on visuals seemed to overshadow the importance of a well-developed and compelling storyline.In comparison to its predecessor, this film fell short in terms of narrative depth and character development. The first installment of the series had a captivating story that kept me on the edge of my seat, whereas this sequel seemed to prioritize style over substance. The lack of a strong, engaging plot left me wanting more, as the film failed to deliver the same level of excitement and emotional investment.Although I had high expectations for this film, considering the visual enchantment it promised, I was ultimately disappointed by its shallow storytelling. It left me yearning for a more substantial narrative that would have complemented its mesmerizing visuals. Overall, I found this film to be a letdown, as it didn't live up to the potential set by its predecessor and left me longing for a more well-rounded cinematic experience.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is a nice progression from the first, we are quickly brought up to speed with what's been happening on Pandora and then we're off and even though some reviews complain about the running time it certainly didn't feel like 3+hrs long. I was completely engaged and enjoyed every moment.The visuals are truly amazing and really need to be seen on the big screen in premium 3D as James Cameron really does know how to use 3D properly rather than just as a gimmicky money maker. He doesn't rush things or jump around with a million different cuts so you really get to immerse yourself in this world that he has created and builds on what has already been introduced in the original. He really knows how to do a sequelGranted the story isn't breaking new ground but it's essentially about a family trying to survive a threat that will just keep coming after them but I don't think the intention was to give us a convoluted plot so it works wellThe world of Pandora is expanded upon in this film and we are introduced to another tribe who live by the sea, this then treats us to some spectacular visuals and allows the characters to grow. There is more emotion this time around and there's a lot more focus on family which I thought worked really well especially towards the climax.And talking of the climax I wouldn't be surprised if Cameron has seen all the big movies of the last decade and has been plotting how to upstage them all and in my opinion he has done that. The last hour or so is breathtaking, the action scenes are incredibly well done and just keep getting bigger and bigger and it doesn't feel like CGI overload either as Cameron lets you immerse yourself in this world before blowing your mind. Words simply don't do it any justice it really has to be seenThe visuals will undoubtedly get all the praise here but I felt the cast did an amazing job too and hope they get the credit they deserve as they make the Na'vi seem real. Stephen Lang especially is brilliant in his roleIt's great to have Cameron back as he is a special filmmaker operating on his own level and Avatar 3 can't come soon enough.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

To tell the truth, I expected a more interesting, multifaceted plot, but I got what I got ... Well, my personal expectations are my problems alone.The plot is about the new adventures of Jake Sully and his large family. He is pursued by the same Colonel Quaritch, who was in the first part. In fact, the plot completely copies the first part, only with different scenery, there is even an analogue of the character Giovani Ribisi from the first part. Some scenes are almost an exact copy of the scenes from the first part. It was depressing and I already thought that my review would be negative, but first things first.With such a long runtime, more than three hours, the viewer is not really told how the people have managed to return to Pandora, because we remember that in the first part they were expelled from the planet in disgrace. The plot includes a huge number of children and adolescents. Some of them turned out to be just useless and had no weight in the film. In addition, it is not clear where did the children of another leader disappear at the end of the film. The film, of course, is designed for a teenage audience and is already successful, but I still expected more from Cameron.There is no point in evaluating the quality of acting, since there are mostly CGI avatars here.The cinematography is actually quite good. Much attention is paid to the underwater world. This is not surprising, since James Cameron loves this subject and has made several documentaries about the oceans and their depths. But the script is very lackluster. The storyline seems fat-fetched, there is no feeling of grandiosity as it was in the first part, a lot of unnecessary characters, the dialogues are not worked out, the main antagonist is not impressive, etc. The scriptwriters did not even try to hide that the main goal of releasing the franchise is to make more money. When a film brazenly shouts to the viewer ""we didn't even try to come up with something new, because you will eat the old one in the second round"" this is very bad. However, 2022 was a sparse year for good films, so Avatar: The Way of Water is still a top contender.As for the good things, there is the stunningly beautiful world of Pandora and Kiri (Sigourney Weaver's character), but this is not enough for the film to receive a highly-ratef review. By the way, Kiri turned out to be a rather bright character and there is a feeling that in the third part she will have way more screen time.Usually, when I give a film a seven out of ten, then I have an overall very positive opinion of a movie, but since I compare it with the predecessor and generally expected much more, this time I have mixed feelings about this movie.7 out of 10.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.","237 out of 322 found this helpful.

But once the water appears turns into a jaw dropping experience of the highest level with outstanding production design, incredible diving sequences and likeable characters.The 3D feels very organic and less intrusive than in the first one, and the final 50 minutes contain some of the best action sequences ever filmed. They feel very real, with a smaller scale than the first one but much more impressive, and the visual effects are so good that they make Marvel films look like cartoon films.The ending left me with tears in my eyes and wanting for more, with the sensation that I had an experience larger than life. And that's exactly what cinema is about!!!Thank you, James Cameron. I can't wait for Avatar 3!","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

The visuals were stunning of course and I particularly enjoyed watching the Sully family adapting to a new environment and even seeing the inspiration from Maori culture with the water people was so cool to see! I was in awe the whole time, I felt as though I could relate with Kiri in a sense that I was just overwhelmed by the beauty of the environment and how so highly regarded the ecosystem is on Pandora.However, even though I know it's a film and it isn't real the cruelty shown in this movie felt a bit too real and I was really disturbed by it. This doesn't impact how I rate the film but for people who really cannot watch films with animal cruelty or are distressed by environmental harm I will say it is hard to watch at times. I do still recommend, though.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Basically, a rehash of the first film, but with added family drama and updated visuals","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8740598/?ref_=tt_urv","nicolasroop","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur105652437/?ref_=tt_urv","17 December 2022","To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. This should have been much better than it was. This was basically a rehash of the first movie's plot with added family drama and a switcheroo of who was becoming an avatar.First off, since when did they start growing avatars with human imprints in case someone dies? I thought avatars were piloted by humans and the only reason Jake was different was because their god chose him to be in that body. That part felt completely hamfisted into the film and seemed like an excuse to get some original cast members back.Secondly, where the hell did the human kid come from? There was no mention of him in the first film that I can recall and also seemed completely forced into this already bloated story. I enjoyed some of the extra family drama and characters. It added an extra layer and, to me, that's all it needed. Apparently, not according to James Cameron, who felt the need to bloat this film out to over 3 hours long for seemingly no reason at all other than to stroke his own technical ego. I couldn't help but sit there during certain sequences and think, this really did not need to be in this film and could've been cut with no consequence to the plotline whatsoever.Speaking of plotlines, did I mention this film is essentially a copy and paste effort from the first? They have to leave their island because they are being attacked and they go and learn the ways of the water people, similar to Jake Sully in the first film learning to live with the Na'vi. Then we have some drama here and there, and it all narrows down to the big showdown at the end. In that, I feel like the film lost the storytelling magic that occured in the first film. Also, not having any sort of romance or love story kinda killed the passionate feeling you get when you watch Jake and Neytiri mingling in the original. There is no feeling of love in this film other than the love for family, which basically makes it The Fast And The Furious with water beasts instead of muscle cars.My last gripe that I'll share with you is that it seemed like the creatures in this film were gentrified compared to the first. They all acted like humans for the most part, and lost their native ways and actions in favor of the screenwriter trying to make us connect with the characters, but it honestly had the opposite effect. It made me bored of them almost immediately and generally lost my interest throughout.Now, onto the reason why I rated this a 6 and not a 3. The special effects were outstanding! The IMAX 3D presentation was sublime. Definitely the best use of 3D I think I've seen on screen since the original. I also enjoyed that the entire film filled the screen, instead of films like Top Gun or Marvel movies that only utilize the technology for their action sequences and everything else(80% of the film) is presented with black bars.But here's the kicker for the visual effects that I think Cameron failed with. His use of fast framerate technology. The near constant switching between 60+ frames per second to 24 fps was jarring to say the least. I wished he would've just chose the 24 fps for the whole film. As a gamer who games on a pc with a 240hz monitor, the 60+ fps made it feel like I was watching cinematics from a video game instead of a movie. Some of it I thought looked fantastic, but most of it made me feel like grabbing a controller because it was basically a cut scene from a game. Took me out of the immersion, unfortunately. I do commend him for trying, but I wondered if he actually watched the final product himself and saw how strange it was on the big screen.Overall, it's not a bad movie if you're going to see some cool 3D and wonderfully realized, hyper-realistic animation. Just expect more of the same with this sequel, as opposed to the evolving we would expect from a 13 year production.3 blue beings out of 5.","29 out of 51 found this helpful.

The visuals are stunning but the story is heavy handed again and lacking in depth. If your story includes dialogue like the following then it lacks emotional depth: ""BRO. We've got to go now!"" ""I know cuz, I'm coming!"" ""Ok bro!"" It's still worth seeing in the theater for the visuals and the action sequences. And honestly the movie doesn't feel like it's over 3 hours. It's just disappointing that they couldn't come up with better dialogue and story than this in 13 years. I'm hoping now that they have the effects in place for the next films, maybe they can spend their time crafting effective stories and dialogue to accompany the fantastic visuals. This is a good but not great movie and one that I probably won't go out of my way to see again. Contrast that with Top Gun: Maverick, a film that was made with half the budget but lots of heart and fantastic action. I'd love to see that one again.","61 out of 118 found this helpful.

The Na'vi, their culture and their beautiful world were incredibly well executed with a lot of love and dedication behind it. It was such an immersive experience.And Way of the Water was no different in that regard. What an experience.Not perfect but the good, for me, far outshines the not so good.The story meant more to me this time. There are themes of loss and I did get choked up a few times. It was more emotional than I anticipated. I expected similar to the first movie but some aspects of the story felt more powerful.The execution of certain scenes was just phenomenal. From the cinematography, to the acting...the editing was great too. I felt like the 3 hours flew by, it was so immersive (both worldbuilding and story wise), enchanting and entertaining.The cheesy dialogue usually comes from scenes with humans but since the focus is the Na'vi it didn't really bother me. Same as the first movie...humans had the cheesy bits of dialogue while the Na'vi dialogue was beautifully done.I had an amazing time watching this movie and I recommend anyone to give it a try.Also, it's the very best movie to watch 3D IMAX. It's pretty much the only movie where I think 3D works the best.The 3D here was mindblowing. So many scenes where I just had this silly smile on my face...what an experience!But visuals and 3D aside, I did enjoy the story more. It gripped me from beginning to end.Are there things that could be improved? Sure. But despite a few flaws, it's still an impactful story.So yeah, I loved it. Stop reading reviews and go watch it yourself! 😁","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

You will see a lot of familiar characters from Part 1, including some borrowed scenes from the movie Titanic. Also, there were too many characters to keep track off, also the plot was little thin however, they set it up very nicely for part III to take place. Watch it 3D for even better experience.

I had my eyes glued to the screen the entire time. Even sometimes when the plot slowed down a bit, I was just stunned by the visuals and trying to take it all in. There was just so much detail to take in - really an incredible triumph and no doubt lots of hard work and diligence from James Cameron and his team.The story was quite simple and straightforward, but done well and despite this being a 3 hour movie, it didn't really feel like it dragged on - the pacing was great. There were some funny moments, as well as some serious moments, I did tear up at a couple occasions and especially the end. I don't really know how James Cameron made me feel like that over some blue CGI aliens, but he pulled it off. Additionally, I thought the music was amazing (RIP James Horner) and worked perfectly to elevate the movie even further (""Becoming One with the People"" is an incredible piece).A definite must watch and possibly the most complete blockbuster movie experience in quite a few years (watch it in IMAX 3D if you get the chance!).","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

At times there are some aspects that become a little more predictable and cliché but the visual prowess is just too magnificent to deny and once again the driving force in this spectacle. Cameron creates settings that are phenomenally breathtaking while bringing the heart pounding action. The emotional parts are still prevalent and help with the overall product. The voice acting and motion capture is once again terrific. Powerful symphonies ensue in the score. Overall this is a fantastic sequel though can meander slightly.

I have been very disappointed with movies in the last several years because escapism, a primary element in fantasy storytelling, has played second fiddle to the ever-present modern political tropes which mire us in the troubles of the day. On the contrary, Avatar: The Way of Water was pure escapism, in the truest sense of the word. The world Cameron has built looks alien, but feels real in the way we might wish a parallel universe to our own existed. The creatures and people of Pandora are familiar enough to resonate with our expectations but just different enough (better perhaps?) to make the audience long to explore this beautiful world in detail.Just like most reviews I have read, I found that the three hour plus run time was hardly enough. Cameron probably cut out a lot because there were few moments that felt unnecessary to the film. Something else that came as a surprise to me, given Cameron's preference for showcasing powerful female leads, which were prominent in this film as well, I would argue a primary theme was about the relationship between fathers and sons. I think too often these days we don't see masculinity handled in a nuanced way, but you see the spectrum of it in this film. From the destructive elements of struggle and war to the redemptive elements of strength and responsibility, the way Cameron depicted the bonds between fathers and sons was compelling, particularly as I have kids as well.Was everything perfect? Of course not. The motivations of the ""Sky-People"" made less sense than the search for ""Unobtainium,"" and the character tropes were a bit stale. The villains had a bit of a Jurassic World vibe, that was played out so badly in those films I almost walked out, but I could give Avatar a pass on because of all of the positives onscreen.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and the 3-D version was amazing and worth every penny. If you are reading this review, go see this movie in the theater, you will not be disappointed.

A 3 hour+ movie definitely scares a lot of people (not me I can watch hours and hours of pandora) but you don't feel that it's 3 hours cause you're just immersed in the world! I looked at my phone once throughout the movie and it was after 3 hours and I couldn't believe it.The story as everyone says, is simple but not in a bad way, and there are several twists and turns. Sometimes things were similar to the first Avatar and sometimes not.I loved the new characters especially To'ak but I feel like I was missing jake and neytiri sometimes.Also, The performances were amazing across the board (maybe a couple exceptions but mostly great)The visuals were out of this world (literally) and even just thinking about it I want to visit the world a second time next week.Oh and let's just say there are a lot of James Cameron Easter eggs scatters around which is fun.Anyways loved it and can't wait to watch it again! Definitely recommend- go see it!!!","18 out of 30 found this helpful.

It definitely doesn't feel like 3 hours, as the entire time you are engaged with breathtaking visuals and an amazing storyline! The visual effects in this film are incredible it feels like you are really there! I definitely recommend watching this film in the cinema and DEFINITELY in 3D, it really takes you into the world of Avatar and watching it in that 3D makes it feel like your truely with them! I wouldn't listen to what the critics say, as they nitpick at every tiny little detail. If you are looking for an action packed film with tons of adventure, this is the film for you! And even if your not into the whole action thing, this film is visually stunning with the incredible views and amazing colourful world of Avatar! I do feel like the start of this film was a bit rushed, especially for a 3 hour film they could've done a lot more with the start.

That money was spent masterfully and it looks beautiful. I think the reviews that stress the 'mediocracy' of the story is missing a point. I don't think the story needs to be very deep and calculating in this world. I think this movie is more like a documentary where you're witnessing what's going on in one of the most mesmerizing places in the universe. So, I liked the simplicity of the story, and the credit should be given it does a great job of making you feel the emotions and drivers of the characters. Maybe there are some inconsistencies in terms of physics but not significant enough to annoy the viewer. On the other hand, in terms the inherent logic of psychology and biology embedded in the entire movie, I would say it was pretty satisfying. The directing and acting is smooth and lets you connect with the characters, and with the everlasting dreamy visuals, I'd give this one a solid 8.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.","68 out of 88 found this helpful.

It barely sequel baits, focusing exclusively on this story and has surprisingly genuine stakes as no one truly feels safe or guaranteed to make it out alive.Sam Worthington gives a better performance as Jake Sully this time around, with his character showing more maturity and a stoic nature. Zoe Saldana doesn't get as much to do this time around but still has her fair share of emotionally powerful moments.Stephen Lang as Quaritch was one the best parts of the original and here he somehow manages to be even better, bringing more of the expected ruthlessness and tough exterior as well as showing a more human side to the character that's unexpected but really works.All of the new, younger actors are superb. They carry their scenes really easily and fit in naturally so it doesn't bother when the film focuses on them opposed to the adults. The best performance is Jack Champion as Spider whose a joy to watch and is particularly impressive as the only practical element in a lot of his scenes.James Cameron's direction is incredible, the CGI is insanely detailed and real, improving vastly on a predecessor that honestly still holds up. He also once again proves that he's one of few filmmakers to actually understand 3-D and uses it to its fullest. He even makes the higher frame rate good for the most part which is extremely impressive.The 3 hour 12 minute run time definitely sounds imposing but surprisingly flies by thanks to excellent pacing, keeping the film constantly moving without feeling rushed and is a testament to how a film's pacing matters way more than it's actual length.The music by Simon Franglen is really good, it's not an easy task to follow in the footsteps of the late great James Horner and even if most of the score is just the old themes recycled it only proves how well they work at evoking the necessary emotions for their corresponding scenes.","116 out of 243 found this helpful.

Avatar: The way of water is a very good movie. Is it better than the first? Not for me. The original Avatar was a beautiful film that had a simple narrative construct that was uncomplicated and panned out well, whereas this one was a bit frustrating in a sense.But first, a note about watching the film in 3D...I was excited to get the full 3D experience everyone talks about, yet from the get go felt that the glasses dimmed the whole experience, like I wanted to dial the brightness up. Lifting the glasses up and down it's clear that the original content balance and grade is just compromised with the glasses. Because each lens has to block out certain colours, that's the way it works. Those beautiful, vibrant blues of the water for example just felt a bit washed out. If I had known about this a little more I would have 100% watched it in 2D and I've already recommended this to several people. It may be personal taste but I also found that a some of the layers created with depth of field just aren't great as there is a lot of unusual fringing and out of focus elements that sort of gets in the way of the overall scene. I love photography and technical aspects of this sort of craft, but seeing it again in a modern 3D film just had me paying more attention to these elements rather than just passively taking it all in.Finally, onto the plot... or more so, the overall impression.Without giving away any spoilers, what I will say is that for me on reflection, 24 hours after seeing the movie, I keep thinking about many aspects that are just too far fetched. There is an over-reliance on Quaritch as the chief villain and how his character unfolds. This sense of frustration doesn't quite leave me wanting more just yet, more so wishing it panned out differently.Will I watch it again? Absolutely, but not in 3D and not in a rush. Very good movie though and a solid 7/10.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Possibly the best movie I have ever seen visually. Here comes the but...But, where this movie excels visually, it has come up short in the story/plot. It just felt a bit repetitive and was too similar in a way to the first Avatar movie.It felt that James Cameron's main focus was on making a near perfect movie visually but has unfortunately had a negative impact on the plot. Overall, it gave the movie a real unbalanced feel to it so I hope for Avatar 3 he can bring a stronger story/plot which will make it more unpredictable and enjoyable.One final point I have to make. Why did they feel the need to have Sigourney Weaver play the voice of her daughter that is still a child? Everytime she spoke, it just didn't come across right at all. Why is a child talking like a 70 year old woman?! What benefit did they get from this seriously? What a strange decision. If you have a female child character then cast a child actress.

So much detail was included in the design of all the machines, the organic creatures and the backgrounds. Many beautiful shots were included purely for esthetic enjoyment - like the silhouette of holding hands with the whale and the schools of self-luminous fish.The plot of course was more basic, with Disney-style wide appeal elements like the parents saving the children and vice versa, but given the magnitude of the achievement overall, the plot worked fine, and it will allow a wide range of viewers from younger kids to senior citizens to enjoy the magnificent of the cinematographic achievements.Overall, this dwarfed all the other blockbusters this year.

I was rooting, crying, and cheering out loud for weird blue Smurf athletes over genuine human characters. I was left emotionally exhausted after the (admittedly long) 3.5 hour experience from all the highs and lows. Were these feelings driven by great visual effects? No. They were driven by a genuinely exciting, moving story, with characters I was invested in 100%. And that's more to say than 99% of the rest of the drivel Hollywood dishes out. James Cameron (and by extension, his creative team) are in an extremely rare position in the film industry. They have almost unlimited resources at their disposal, and unchecked creativity. And unlike most other studios and filmmakers in that position, they delivered. This is not fan service. It's not pandering to some larger brand strategy or IP.

And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere.

The first was a technological breakthrough that broke new ground in 3D technology, and its CGI still stands the test of time. The sequel may not be known as another technological triumph, but 13 years of research and development in mocap technology did go into it. But this time the story is something that comes into focus elevated with Cameron's filming technology. He is more of a scientist than a director to me. This sequel wasn't made as soon as it was greenlit, as they made sure the script was their strong suit this time around, which shows in the world-building aspect and the story arc the character goes through, which definitely took a true visionary to write. If you got to experience it in a PVR or an IMAX theater, you've earned the right to brag. The profit margin for this movie is too high so I don't care if it's termed a flop in the end, but in many cases it has surpassed its predecessor.

The sequel may not be known as another technological triumph, but 13 years of research and development in mocap technology did go into it. But this time the story is something that comes into focus elevated with Cameron's filming technology. He is more of a scientist than a director to me. This sequel wasn't made as soon as it was greenlit, as they made sure the script was their strong suit this time around, which shows in the world-building aspect and the story arc the character goes through, which definitely took a true visionary to write. If you got to experience it in a PVR or an IMAX theater, you've earned the right to brag. The profit margin for this movie is too high so I don't care if it's termed a flop in the end, but in many cases it has surpassed its predecessor. It will be a shame if we don't get to see James Cameron's vision unfold due to the unrealistic (maybe) 2 billion dollar grossing limit just to break even.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

And when I say visual, that's all I could say was the positive.For all its shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed the first film. Yes the dialogue was flat, uninspired and derivative. But I feel it landed as a whole, and I actually cared for the characters.With The Way of Water, the script and characters are even more dumbed down to the point of insulting my intelligence. I know Cameron wants to hit his 4 quadrant demographic, but my god. This feels like a first pass draft in comparison to the first film.My biggest issue is, if I can't connect to the characters and story, and there are waaaaaay too many characters in this film, then the film (as spectacular as it is) ultimately fails for me.And this film failed with my 3hr + engagement.The 3D HFR is also a major complaint I have. Just keep it all in HFR. It was so distracting watching it bounce back and forth between 24/48 frames per second. It just doesn't work and constantly takes you out of the film. I actually think the HFR works especially in 3D. I didn't get any of that soap opera effect.I'm watching it again tonight in 3D HFR again. Will make my final judegement after this screening. Hopefully as I know what to expect, I can maybe enjoy this visual ride.","15 out of 26 found this helpful.

We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.Tonight, I experienced something new, an extra-ordinary film from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the film and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about film making is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Director James Cameron filming techniques. But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now producing the Avatar franchise, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest Filmmaker in Hollywood. I will be returning to future Avatar films soon, hungry for more.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sitting in the theater with my 3-D goggles on, I remember feeling like I had never seen anything quite like it. It was one of those movies, like ""Star Wars,"" ""Terminator 2,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""The Matrix,"" that brought visual effects forward in leaps and bounds and expanded the scope of what movies could do.""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" felt very underwhelming in comparison. Those visual effects aren't all that impressive anymore, or at least they're not fresh. The motion capture is much improved -- my kids were amazed when I told them they weren't just watching actors in makeup -- but the rest is just a CGI fest that you've seen a hundred times before. I didn't see this film in 3-D, so maybe that was part of my disappointment. But if your movie sinks or swims based on whether you see it in 3-D or not, it's probably not that good of a movie in the first place.The story of this one is rubbish. My heart sank when I realized they were bringing back the same exaggerated caricature of a villain and making this a revenge story. That's the best they could do? And they want to make four more movies out of this? I'll pass. This entire movie felt like filler, setting up a bunch of plot strands to be resolved in later episodes, but the problem is that I don't care enough about any of them to bother seeing how they're resolved.The whales were cool.Grade: B-","13 out of 22 found this helpful.

The story, the graphics, the sound, the cast, the acting, you name it.We get to see more of the massive wondrous world of Pandora in an absolutely immersive experience. The CGI looks so good 90% of the time it felt like watching real footage shot on a high quality camera.If possible watch this is a 4DX theatre, the wind and rain effects add a lot to the experience (not to mention the seats moving). 3D glasses also help, plenty of scenes work well with it.As expected this leaves you with a deep respect for nature and all it has to offer. While there are few truly evil characters in the movie, it really highlights how people can end up doing some very bad things without even thinking about it. Gives you a new perspective on how we treat the environment and why it's important to conserve it.All in all a very well deserved 10 stars.

But sadly with no real twist and turns other than the return of old characters.The movie then runs for 3 hours with various subplots being implemented that are in of itself interesting but often do not really contribute to the main story. With these subplots it feels like a series format would have been a way better suited choice and given the story additional breathing room to explore more of these side plots.Because many of the new characters are interesting and would deserve it.But instead the movie cramped it all into a 3 hour runtime and ended effectively on a cliff hangar with no solution to the conflict.

Well, this movie has both of those attributes dialed up to 11. The visuals, if possible, are even more impressive than those in the first movie. When I say the characters and environments are photo-realistic, that is not an exaggeration. This is one of the most visually impressive movies I've seen. That said, the plot is somehow even MORE bare-bones and cheesy than the first. Again, it's not exaggerating to say that about halfway through, I lost track of what the story was even about. You get so wrapped up in the visuals and the world that it's easy to get lost in it. That is both a good and a bad thing. Characters are, for the most part, pretty one-dimensional, especially the villains, who are about as shallow as you can get. The only exception to the bad guys is Stephen Lang's Quaritch who is a bit more fleshed out than his initial incarnation. The problem is there are so many new characters that it's difficult to give each one their proper due, although to be fair, the movie makes decent use of the time it has. Speaking of time, this movie is LONG. While the first one was long, this one drags on way longer than it needed to. By the end, even with the all the action going on, I found myself saying ""Ok, let's wrap this up!"".A couple other aspects I found refreshing: despite James Cameron's weird comments on ""testosterone"", this movie depicts fathers and fatherhood in a positive light. Also, it doesn't rely on awkwardly-inserted quips to force a laugh out of the audience *cough* MARVEL *cough*, but instead lets the drama unfold on screen. In summary, if you loved the visuals of the first movie, you'll definitely enjoy the ones here. If the lack of a plot from the first ruined it for you, then you might want to avoid this one.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

They are, to the full extent of the word, unbelievable. I was in complete awe throughout the movie. The details are ridiculous. A new standard has been set.I have to gush a little more. The original Avatar had groundbreaking visuals, but The Way of Water is MILES ahead. I couldn't imagine how much better it could get. And there are hundreds of stunning shots and beautiful images. As South Park taught us, James Cameron is always raising the bar.As for the overall movie, I thought it was pretty awesome, but not as good as the first (8 stars). I was more emotionally invested in the story for the original. I remember being legitimately angry at the sky people.And while the first one is so fast-paced, this one slows down drastically in the middle portion. It's still enjoyable but we stray from the main story and fill it with less important stuff like bullying drama. I think it was also slowed down by maybe showing off a little too much with the visuals. The original had a great balance of story and showing off.I had a great time with this chapter and look forward to more. I'm not entirely sure 3D is worth it, but IMAX is a must since the entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio.

He says if he did not make it in Hollywood he would have gone to university and studied engineering. He has also said several times that Avatar released in 2009 was to showcase the technology and not about the plot. But it took me several years to figure out that Avatar is Pocahontas in space because it is well directed and a visual spectacle.The sequel follows the same trajectory and it is underwhelming. I am not even convinced if it was necessary. Maybe that's why it took 13 years to be released because James himself might have not been sure about a sequel. The visuals are out of this world probably the best yet. I kept reminding myself that it is CGI and not real. James has set the benchmark once again. That's how good the visuals are. But the story is sub par. I was expecting a better story since five writers including James wrote this screenplay including the couple who wrote the recent Planet of the Apes films.Despite the weak plot, I cannot give this movie a 6 as it means below average. I give it a 7 because James did a great job creating Pandora. The fauna and flora seemed like what animals and vegetation would look like on other planets. The spirituality of the Nav'i and their close links to their animals is something Mankind should learn from.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

No.The 3D, the CGI, the Action are excellent, yes. In the past 13 yeast we had however seen similar. I feel like the reviews claiming that this is an esential blockbuster spectacle are exaggerated. Given the run time of 3+ hours, nice CGI really isn't enough to keep you engaged.The storytelling is problematic. I went into the movie expecting a simple story and there is nothing wrong with that. Top Gun Maveric was simple, but it worked. The story is simple, the characters are interesting, likeable. The problem is with the plot, which suffers from a couple of convenient deus ex machinas that were not set up before hand. On the other hand there are some 'problems' in the climax that could have been solved pretty easily by the new skills the characters had acquired, yet they do not do it because... reasons. The movie then suffers from resolutions that don't really feel earned, but also drama that feels fabricated just for the sake of tension.Though I had a good time, I absolutely do not feel like I need or want to see this movie again in the cinema again, nor do I feel compelled to send there my friends and family. I have seen The Batman, Top Gun Maverick and The Northmen twice in cinema this year. Avatar 2 was good, but didn't really feel essential.Oh, there is no after credit scene, so no need to wait.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

It's not perfect but people are gonna love it. Fans of 2009's Avatar are going to be under a spell revisiting this world with the 13 years of technological advancement, Cameron was clearly hard at work behind the camera. The theme of the new sequels seems to be clear: it's about family.With the gap since the last movie it was important to recreate the magic of Pandora right from the start and the film does take you right back into it from the first scenes with amazing visuals: the colors are popping, the scenery is magnificent and similar to its predecessor, Way Of Water sets the bar very high for special effects in future blockbusters. You can trust James Cameron with rich world-building but also for directing action that feels realistic and this movie gives you one hell of a ride in terms of spectacle. At times Cameron is paying homage to its own movies and I was totally on board with that. It is an absolute achievement on a technical level without a doubt.I was able to see the film in IMAX 3D (HFR Experience in 48fps) and I'm going to get into a minor nitpick that doesn't affect my overall judgement of the film. I am not a fan of high-frame rate (60fps instead of the usual 24 frame per seconds), and the screening I saw had some shots going back-and-forth between 48fps and 24fps which was distracting for me at first. I doubt this will be an issue for most people, and this might actually not apply to every screenings as it's going to be showing in Regular 3D and 2D everywhere, but this is something that bothered me, I'm not going to lie. It's as if someone was turning the motion smoothing on and off as you're watching a scene. That is the only technical nitpick I would have to add and this is why I want to see it again this weekend to get a better judgement.I don't want to say too much about the story and the characters because Cameron is clearly building something big that everyone needs to experience by themselves on the biggest screen possible. I would also suggest rewatching Avatar before going into this new one. Will it have the same effect that the original Avatar had? I guess we're going to find out in a couple of days, but my guts tell me that the audiences worldwide are going to love this movie and this is only the beginning for this franchise. Sure, a lot of this movie felt like setup for the future, but it's absolutely gorgeous to look at and never boring.

It's so bright and vibrant, I saw it in 3D, I'm not sure I'd recommend that over a regular viewing, that's my plan for tomorrow.It was long, but it's one of those films that moves on by quickly, I didn't fidget or shuffle about, meaning I was engrossed in the story.At times it's a little corny, and some of the dialogue will make you want to roll your eyes, but in the context it's a minor irrigation.

You will be lost in this World and will not feel that anything is unreal even for a second. Right amount of drama and action is used. Director spends time for viewers to get to know the World and feel for whatever is happening with characters and even animals. Complexity of certain characters captured is very well along with simplicity of Jake Sully whose whole agenda is family now and wants to take care of them by any means. Attention to detail for those living on ground and those under water is marvellous and in itself shows Director's great vision which he could draw on the movie canvas and we could watch it. Definitely a watch with family.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

But to be honest it didnt feel like a 3 hours film. Story was predictable. But the world of pandora seemed to be more beautiful and elegant than in Avatar 1. This one is surely a masterpiece and must be watched in theaters for the immersive experience. Cameroon is really a visionary. Pandora in his vision is truly iconic. Climax portion was awesome. CGI and motion capture is epic. The ending leaves door for next chapter. I thought of watching it after OTT release,but now feels great for not missing the theater experience. Fully satisfied. I am giving 10/10.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

But I have to admit, the story isn't as mediocre as I originally thought it to be (not saying the story is great, but definitely an improvement from the first Avatar film).James Cameron has somehow managed to recreate his breathtaking visual effects again, but this time better. I absolutely loved the visuals in this film, they're so amazing that they kind make me want to ignore all the flaws and issues I have with this movie and give this film a 10/10. Even if you don't enjoy this movie, you'd have to admit that try do have some pretty groundbreaking visuals, not to mention the last hour of the film is one of the greatest action-packed scenes visually, and it's been a while since I've seen a visual action packed sequence this good.Now with the visual rant out of the way, there is a lot to talk about;The story, while an improvement from the story in the first film, is still pretty simple. In fact, I'd argue that it's not too different from the first Avatar movie. The first film was basically about this human who's mind is transferred into the Avatar, and has to learn how to live among the Na'vi. The film is pretty much copy and pasted to this film, whereas here, Jake and his family of forest Na'vi kids have to learn to adapt to the water Na'vi tribe. And instead of protecting the forest, Hake has to protect his family. See how these two films are similar to one another?Now despite the film's premise not being too original compared to the first film, this film does a good job at fleshing out the new characters given to us. This film mainly focuses on Jake and Neytiri's kids and their struggles of being forced to adapt to this new location. I think the film does a great job at fleshing out these characters and making us care about their problems. My only complaint for the film focusing on all these new characters is that because we there are a lot of new characters in this film, older characters like Jake and Neytiri are forced to step back from the story, and I think I'd be nice to have these two characters fleshed out a bit more.Since we are on the topic of characters, one character that really didn't need to be in this film was Spider. Now it's hard to complain about this kid without getting into spoiler, but to put it simply, his motives make no sense. Spider is a character who is sometimes helping the bad guys, even when he's no longer being forced to be of assistance to them anymore. Spider's probably my least favorite character in this movie and probably shouldn't've even been in this film in the first place.This film is pretty mixed for me, but personally I really enjoyed it despite all its flaws. The visuals were amazing, as expected from James Cameron, a lot of new characters who I felt were fleshed out. And yes, the story is basically no different from the first film, but the film also does a great job at letting the audience explore more of Pandora, and because of that the movie makes me want to see what else Pandora has for us, making me excited for the third movie. Even if you didn't like the first movie, I encourage you to try watching this film and gain your own opinion on it, because I think this film was a big improvement compared to the first Avatar movie.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

It felt like as if I'm transported into the world of Pandora. Each shot is filled with rich scenery and amazing details. It's been a long time since I've watched a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.But I won't say that the film is flawless. It lacked a good story and there were many logical loopholes. It's like the whole movie was made just to show the beautiful underwater scenes. The film suffers from poor character development too. While the first part had a meaning, I don't understand what Cameron is trying to convey through this film.But all these flaws are overshadowed by the visuals. If you're someone who watches films for the sake of entertainment, you would surely enjoy this film.

At many points, the film reminded me of the Final Fantasy games, whose stories are often confusing and often forgettable, but which impress with breathtaking vistas and images, stirring emotional moments and epic action scenes. Avatar 2 offers the same.James Cameron has tried to weave too many ideas and characters into the film. While the first part told a very simple and archaic story, for which it was heavily criticized, here they seem to have tried to make the plot more complex and multi-layered but didn't really succeed. Maybe it's also because too many screenwriters worked on the story besides Cameron, and everyone wanted to bring their own ideas into the film.Ultimately, there are a lot of ideas thrown into the film that aren't really explored or thought through. There are many elements that are brought up and then never mentioned or are relevant again. Also, there are just too many characters that seem interesting but don't really have room to develop in the story and remain in the background without us really getting to know them (perhaps we'll have to wait for the sequels). The dramaturgy is often very convoluted, for example, the main antagonist disappears from the screen for almost an hour while the story takes on a completely different pace and feel, only to suddenly drops back into the story at the beginning of the third act. This especially reminded me of the feeling I had with games like Final Fantasy X or Final Fantasy XV (the comparability with FF X is also given by the water theme and spiritual aspects). Also, the plot invents way too many elements that just don't fit with what we saw in the first part, just to bring certain characters back into the story or because James Cameron liked to work with certain actors. Also, I find that certain aspects of the story don't fit with the spirituality of the Navi as we got to know them in the first part.But still, the film works on an emotional level. The relationship of Jake's family, the spiritual connection to the animals and the planet, but especially the surprising emotionality of the antagonist worked for me. The design of Pandoras oceans and creatures is fantastic and still unique, as it was in the first part, and the visual effects are indescribably beautiful. And the last hour was just insane, with about an hour of excellent action in typical James Cameron style. Overall, I thought Avatar: Way of the Water was a good movie. Mainly because of the visuals, the little emotional moments and the crazy action. So basically, not that much different than the first part. However, part 1 was much more focused and thought out in my opinion. The dramaturgy was much more structured, and the characters were stronger.","18 out of 32 found this helpful.

If you have 3.5 hours to waste and nothing else to do, then it will fill that gap. As far as the excitement is concerned, you will need to wait almost 2.75 hours till they get to anything that resembles it. Absolutely not worth a 12 year wait. As a fan of almost all things sci-fi, fantasy and comic book, this is no where near my top 25 list of movies in that genre by a mile in almost all categories except number of blue people in the movie. Falls short of infinity war and end game by a mile. And the cgi in Infinity war and Endgame were better too.

I'm not sure why people liked that but not this.I wasn't expecting much because people were saying the story line was so weak. I think the story part is powerful, on this and the first, but it is basic.

I hope they make a third movie. I notice on rotten tomatoes it still got 78% critic and 95% audience score, the latter is the only one that matters anyway.

The right decision I made was to watch it in cinema as it is wholly cinematic experience. You will not enjoy this movie on television or mobile. The visuals are stunning but it feels same as the first part. The story, for me, was little bit weak. It was mere copy paste of the first part except that the story took place in island instead of jungle.Movie's runtime also felt little bit long but given that we were given new info about the islands and there people, the long runtime was justified. James Cameron as a director did good job as always.Overall, it was a good movie (not great) and I would recommend you to watch it in cinema if you want to really feel/ enjoy it.","21 out of 42 found this helpful.

Now I loved the Marvel movies but recent additions have left me wanting something different and Avatar: The Way of Water delivered as a sequel by being better than the first Avatar.It was an emotional ride all throughout with some humour mixed in but it never felt out of place or forced. I was hooked from start to finish and despite the three hour runtime I was left wanting more. Each moment to moment setting felt well paced and never dragged on. It held your interest with good acting and tense, emotional or funny moments.My biggest gripe is the overall plot. It was absolutely a much more original story than the first movie but it was still the weakest aspect of this entire film. I felt for the characters on a moment to moment basis but I enjoyed the character and world building more than the plot.I absolutely reccomend this movie.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

The plot is essentially the same as the first film with no additional story and too many characters to really get attached to anyone. It's too long in my opinion, a lot could have been cut from the middle of the film. It's a 3+ hour film and almost 2 hours of it feels like a documentary and just doesn't have the same entertainment factor the first film had and ultimately being entertained is why I go to the theater. I didn't hate it but I also probably won't watch it again at any point. For me it definitely didn't live up to the hype of the first movie and the long wait for a sequel.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","315 out of 467 found this helpful.

It probably is the first 3D movie I have seen in years. At least James Cameron knows how to make the best out of the format as others do post 3D conversions.The 3D is brilliantly realised both in the jungle world and the sea world. Although you do wonder at times if you are watching a CGI motion capture animated movie or a live action one.The trouble is the storyline is hackneyed. I was reminded of the Matrix sequels where Agent Smith was brought back as the antagonist even though he was defeated in the first movie.Some of the movie did not even make sense. The Earth is dying and the Sky People have returned from Earth to colonise the moon Pandora. A year later ruthless Marine, Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) is resurrected as an Avatar of a native Na'vi along with others.Their job is to track down and kill Jack Sully (Sam Worthington) whose consciousness became part of a Na'vi Avatar body. He has been leading the resistance against the Sky People.Now Sully has to flee with his family to keep the forest tribes safe. He seeks sanctuary with an aquatic clan in the reef islands of Pandora.Given the Sky People had returned, some of them are hunting the Tulkin sea creature. You would have thought both people would had united to repel the prospective invaders. Not just for harvesting Pandora's resources but they are planning to repopulate it.At over 3 hours, this is a long movie. It is a kind of film you get the most out of in the cinema, I doubt I would watch it again on home viewing.","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

My Rating. 10/10Avatar: The Way of Water written directed and produced by James Cameron is the perfect example of a movie that deserves to be seen on the biggest and most high definition Cinema Screen you can find .We saw it on our local GMAX screen and for any movie that has a running time of 3hours 12 minutes to hold this movie goers interest it has to be special.Watching Avatar : The Way of Water on a television screen or tablet of any size would be an insult to the technology geniuses involved in the production and James Cameron's vision .It's been worth a 13 year wait between the first Avatar movie that broke all box office records becoming the top box office lifetime grossing movie of all time earning over $ 2.8 billion .I think one reason for Avatars great success is it's humanity ,which may sound odd as most of the film we are watching non human characters but the characters are warm and vulnerable with many values that we could well duplicate on our own sick planet, especially natural conservation and respect for our declining species of plants and animals.I was a bit doubtful about this sequel after being so underwhelmed by the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever sequel but The Way of Water is one of the most memorable and beautiful movies of the Fantasy Action Adventure genre I've ever seen.In this sequel we get to visit two wonderful worlds for the price of one of beginning in Pandora the Forest Kingdom then moving to the beautiful Kingdom of The Reef People . Jake Sully his partner Neytiri and their children have to flee their Forest Kingdom . They decide it's their only option after being hunted down by Quaritch a hybrid guerrilla Commander with the blue appearance of a Pandoran Na'vi to camouflage their intent and plunder Pandora .s Jake ( Sam Worthington ) leave their forest home behind to seek asylum with the tribes of the Metkayinan Reef people.The Sky invaders have returned to Pandora to colonise the Forest Kingdom due to Earth dying from neglect, overcrowding and lack of conservation does that
sound familiar? Earth today is spending billions of dollars on Space exploration to find intelligent life and suitable conditions for human habitation when we eventually ruin our own planet.There are many similar parallels and situations for humankind to identify with in this movie ,especially the suspicion and lack of acceptance of cultures other than our own . In this case the Reef People who have reason blame Jake Sully for bringing danger and conflict to their Paradise .It is a Paradise of beautiful undersea plants and fantastic creatures on the Metkayina reef including the Tulkun ,giant whale like creatures native to the Oceans of Pandora who possess their own names and culture as well as sophisticated music and poetry.The Tulkun play a vital role in the movie when they are hunted by the Sky invaders from earth to draw Jake Sully out of hiding.Avatar -The Way of Water already holds a number of production records I was interested to read that Kate Winslett who plays Ronal the partner of Tonowari the chief of the Metkayina Clan broke Tom Cruise's underwater Mission Impossible underwater filming record of 6 minutes when she swam underwater for 7minutes and 14 seconds.Also Avatar :The Way of Water is now the 7th film in history with a production cost of over $300million it's estimated the forthcoming sequels which are being filmed back to back will cost approximately $ one billion ,
There will be new worlds to discover in the future Avatar series as it's divided into 4 nations The Water Tribe, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads so we have many visual experiences ahead of unless James Cameron ends the Avatar series after the third movie if The Way of the Water isn't profitable.I doubt he has any worries in that direction as Avatar : The Way ofWater is the epitome of what great cinematic art is all about great skill and great talent but most importantly great vision I hope it succeeds .Special mention to Jack Champion who was very impressive in his role of Spider the young boy left behind in Pandora he plays a real Jungle boy captured by the guerrilla invaders for interrogation in their quest to destroy Jake Sully .Please don't wait for it to stream or the Blue Ray see it at a cinema .","44 out of 91 found this helpful.

Actually I might go as far as saying you won't even notice the use of CGI, although the film is basically all CGI. It almost feels like you are peeking a different existing world through camera.Back when the first Avatar movie came out, it seemed to be ahead of the time by 10 years. Now I watched The Way Of Water, I just can't help thinking this is still ahead of our current time, ahead of all the other movies by ten years.Everything is perfect, I have nothing more to say. We are blessed to have directors like Cameron who would devote themselves in movies and always strive for a more perfect picture.","19 out of 35 found this helpful.

Visually it is just as stunning, and I like the world building with the new ecosystems introduced.I think they're building up the next generation of characters, I just wish they would have brought in more of Jake and Netiri, instead of just protective parents. In the previous movie they felt more complex and interesting.I am interested to see what they do with Quartich, Spider, and Kiri's story arcs. I don't think they'll develop how you'd expect.I am hopefully for the next movie. But I still don't believe this movie was a good as the original.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it.

"10","/10","James Cameron promised and delivered, The Way of Water is better than its predecessor, a visual masterpiece - My Ultimate Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8744197/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water begins similar to the first installment and then becomes this magnificent story about fatherhood and family; about loss, humanity, nature and of dangers of corporate greed that director-writer-producer James Cameron executes brilliantly. James Cameron used real world problems with the rainforest for the first film and here he does a similar thing but with poaching. It fits the story and the world so well of the Avatar franchise. You notice it as much with this film as its predecessor how big of a passion project it truly is for Cameron. Back then he brought us a whole new world to experience and ground breaking technology to witness. With The Way of Water, he does it again, showing more of Pandora through its sea tribes; meaning new culture, underwater sign language and the new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before.Jake Sully lives with his newfound family formed on the extrasolar moon Pandora. Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home.Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in a different role. New cast members include Kate Winslet as Ronal; a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife, Cliff Curtis as Tonowari; the chief of the reef people clan of Metkayina and Ronal's husband. Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore; the commander in charge of the RDA's interests, and Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin; a marine biologist. The Sully family have grown to include James Flatters as Neteyam; Jake and Neytiri's first son and oldest child. Britain Dalton as Lo'ak; Jake and Neytiri's second son. Trinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tuktirey (""Tuk""), Jake and Neytiri's eight-year-old daughter and their youngest child. But also an adopted teenage daughter called Kiri who's played by Sigourney Weaver, also Jack Champion as Miles Socorro (""Spider""); the teenaged son of Quaritch born in Hell's Gate (the human base on Pandora in the first film) who was rescued and adopted by Jake and Neytiri and ""prefers his time in the Pandoran rainforest"". The acting was mostly superb, except for Spider who was played by Jack Champion (a newcomer) although an important supporting character, his acting was ranging from good to bad, mostly average. But let's dig into the great performances, starting with Sigourney Weaver as Kiri, Jake and Neytiri's adopted teenage daughter. Just the idea of someone aged 73 is playing a teenager through motion capture, it shows her acting range, a brilliant performance. I expected Zoe Saldana to have more to do, but I think she'll have an even bigger role in the third film, she was terrific though and had one of the better performances. Sam Worthington and Stephen Lang were also phenomenal. The performance that surprised me the most were Britain Dalton as Lo'ak, what a great performance, truly. He has a future in the business. That's what I love about James Cameron, his casting. Like Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, but also giving Sigourney Weaver another role after her death in Avatar which was one great and memorable death but also a brilliant performance. I also found that The Way of Water had more emphasis on drama and acting, the longer run time is a reason for that, the actors really got to act, but also learning to free dive. The cast did most and some even did all the underwater stunts, which is impressive.James Cameron co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (who wrote Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and War for the Planet of the Apes), with a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. The writing is in my opinion quite great, mostly, my criticism is at the end of my review. The direction and James Cameron's hard work is one of the film's highlights like the previous film was. Having read interviews before and after having seen the film at the cinema, I've read how supportive and great he was at giving direction to the actors. It's his vision and visual storytelling that makes him one of the greatest. Not many have succeeded with sequels, James Cameron have done it again and again (Terminator 2 and Aliens), and now he did it with The Way of Water.The visual effects and CGI these days, these last couple of years, have been extremely bad in comparison to this film. Avatar: The Way of Water has scenes full of visual effects, each frame with so much to please your eye, scenes with so much going on that multiple rewatches is on my agenda. It's a treat for your eyes, a real eye pleaser. The groundbreaking technology and visual effects is two of the major things that made Avatar into the memorable and biggest movies of all time, along with a lot of other things. But Pandora, the mind blowing planet that are so easy to get immersed to, the Na'vi and everything that went into them. For this film we got to see the sea tribes and thus getting to see the new technology James Cameron helped create, performance capture in underwater scenes. This man have changed lifestyle during the first Avatar and the second, but one thing that haven't changed is his love for the franchise, his passion, a true master at work. I also want to praise the cinematography, Russell Carpenter (who won an Oscar for Titanic) does some brilliant work, photographing so many stunning looking shots with spectacular angles. Overall perfect. Cameron and him are a great duo, you see it in each scene regarding how it was shot. Also, the editing deserves some praise, music definitely needs it. Whilst James Horner is missed (having done the musical score for Avatar), Simon Franglen comes in and does an amazing job, giving us a score both gripping and emotional. He's a great replacement for the maestro, James Horner.I've heard people calling it too long and for me and my girlfriend, the 192 minute runtime felt right as time flew by quick. Scenes could have been trimmed, sure, but lots of the drawn out scenes of nature and overall slower pace is there for a reason. Character development, mostly for Kiri who is the spiritual in the family. I actually think the film could have been longer, but this length is perfect for the film. In the writing and overall story, I think The Way of Water is better in every way than its predecessor. Yet it have been criticized for having a thin narrative. Yeah sure it doesn't have this mind-blowing narrative, it's actually quite simple, but it works so well because of the visual effects and Pandora as we get to explore lands uncharted to us viewers. Thus the simplicity works here, it's a story about fatherhood. Like what Sam Worthington said in an interview; ""He could have quite easily told the story of Jake and Neytiri going on battling the wars,"" says Worthington (who, like Saldana, has three children of his own), ""but when you add in the kids and having to keep them safe, or not wanting them to emulate you because it can get them killed, they're operatic themes.""Avatar: The Way of Water currently has a critic score of 77% and an audience score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, a site I normally never visit, film critics have more knowledge of film than most audience. I think it's fair, but honestly, I love this film and agree with film organizations; organizations such as the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Avatar: The Way of Water as one of the top ten films of 2022. I agree with that, completely. Also worth noting is how the film also received numerous other accolades, including nominations for the Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Director at the 80th Golden Globe Awards. Avatar 3 is coming in 2024, I'm ready. The Way of Water was everything I wanted for a sequel, but more. It's a magnificent film, with groundbreaking technology and visuals, a true visual masterpiece.","49 out of 104 found this helpful.

Saw this one in 2d and while visually stunning, it didn't have the same impact without 3d.When I saw the first Avatar my initial reaction was, No, this isn't realistic, greedy corporations wouldn't be so ruthless, and then I thought about it, and unfortunately the depiction is probably not that far off from what the world has seen from military backed commercial interests. But I still didn't want to see that kind of violence on these beautiful people and their world. But even with these criticisms of the original, the total package still got an 8/10 from me.This one is a repeat of the first film, so even with the stunning visuals it's a 5 or 6/10. Even the evil, jacked up military leader is the same exact guy! The only thing that has changed is the scope of ambition, this time they want to colonize the whole freaking planet for humans who've messed up their world. And while many love the realistic violence, I've gotten really tired of seeing people slaughter each other and the environment, though to be honest, showing the battle between technology and these water people was pretty unique.But still, is portraying this kind of good against evil the only story to be told with a budget in the 100s of million dollars and a subject matter that is beyond stunning? Knowing what I know now, I definitely wouldn't have gone to see it in 2d. In 3d it'd be worth it for me to put up with this outworn trope of a story just to see this gorgeous world they created.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Honestly the plot wasn't even terrible, there were some flaws but overall it worked well imo. This movie felt more like a bridge to the third movie and acted mainly as a device to build and expand Pandora rather than telling a brand new story. The themes were well explored, touching on topics like animism and gnosticism while reflecting real world environmental issues human had created on Earth. His fascination and adoration for nature and spiritual connections are just so beautifully portrayed, we all came from the ocean and our soul will eventually return to it after our death.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It did not blow my mind like the first film did. I really enjoyed myself, but can't say I loved it like I love every other James Cameron film.4. Partly this is because narratively the story structure is very similar to the first.5. Unlike T2 and Aliens, Cameron doesn't try a different path for the sequel. He just extends it.6. It's like a greatest hits of T2, Abyss, Titanic, Aliens and Avatar. Since I love those films, this isn't a complaint!7. Sigourney Weaver character and performance was truly enchanting. Sam Worthington was great too.8. I was never bored or cognisant of the 3 hours.9. Of coarse, the last hour is textbook action, emotion and suspense.10. The kids were all great, but the family angle still wasn't enough to earn #Avatar2 a place on the all time classics podium besides Aliens and T2. Hoping James Cameron pushes the narrative as far for Avatar 3, as he pushed the cinematic experience.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is so much detail and love that goes into the world and the things that live in it.It truly is a joy to behold.With that being said.It's goes on for entirely too long. There are extended periods that slow the movie down and make you loose interest. Most of its world building and revolves around na'vi teenagers. But it drags on for way too long and you grow tired of it.The focus on the na'vi teens is a strange one and gives the movie a ""for young adults"" feel.The action sequences are well done and tight. Again you can see that some truly skilled people were attached to this project. There is the odd choise here and there that makes you question the writing, but you can largely forgive that.All things considered it was a fairly entertaining movie. It just runs too long and focuses on teenage angst a little bit too much.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The biggest problem this film faced was the significant time jump between release dates, however, Cameron managed to maneuver around this, creating a captivating story that left plenty of room for further developments. Unlike the first film, this one focused heavily on emotions and familial relationships. It created the bond that so many of us long for when it comes to friends and family, and it made the events of the film a little more harrowing as they established very quickly that nobody is safe. Much like the first film, this one continued the storyline of environmentalism and colonization, effectively putting the audience in a place that has them rooting on the side of the Na'vi - and against their own people.In order to tell this story in the manner that was intended, Cameron waited until he had the technology available to create an immersive world for his audience. Especially with the use of IMAX and 3D effects, the viewer can feel transported to Pandora for the full length of the film, and will grow to miss this universe when the credits roll and the screen fades to black. The CGI for this film was masterful in every way and it can be difficult to find a cast that possesses the talent to perform with the technology that will assist in building this world. That being said, casting director, Margery Simkin, could not have done a better job. While the entire cast provided wonderful performances, Zoe Saldana (Neytiri) stood out with her emotional performance as not only a warrior, but a mother and wife as well. It was refreshing to see that, although she has different priorities now, she still held on to her values and beliefs in the same manner as the first film.The only thing that I felt this film lacked was a memorable soundtrack, as it seemed to blend in to the background of the film and was not as noticeable to me. However, this is not always a bad thing. It was still an important aspect in creating the desired atmosphere, and it did not overshadow the incredible action sequences that appeared throughout the entire film.With perfect pacing on a three-hour story that left me wanting more, it comes as no surprise that this film is quickly approaching the coveted $2 billion box office mark that very few films have seen - one of those being its predecessor, and another being Titanic (1997), all with the same director. Whether you are a fan of the franchise, director, actors, or just mildly interested in the story, I recommend seeing this film in theaters as it is a heartwarming and thought-provoking experience that is sure to make you excited for the third film.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

I went to see it in 3D, which I recommend everyone does if they can.It's a great follow up, with the storyline seamlessly continuing on from the original Avatar movie. Visually, the bar has been raised even further. It is simply stunning to look at, the 3D is amazing. The sound, including all dialogue is crystal clear. There's an awful lot of films these days where the dialogue is either badly recorded, or impaired by overloud music. Avatar TWOW is not one of them. The film is simply 3+ hours of gripping entertainment. I believe James Cameron is also using this platform, by the use of very similar parallels to things that happen right here on earth, to highlight, and raise awareness of what goes on around us every day. I've seen some scathing reviews from critics, mostly by people who hated the first film (well they're not exactly likely to embrace this one either then are they) or have some kind of vendetta against James Cameron. Whatever. Ignore them. Go and see it. Immerse yourself in it. No pun intended.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's stunning to look at and needs to be seen on the big screen. The technological advancements that Cameron has made to the medium of film, cannot be denied.Story wise, it's not quite as tight as the first film, but it's certainly not bad. The philosophical and environmental themes and motifs are still presented strongly. I do question the validity of this story arcing over 5 films, though. Perhaps it will be a generational thing and cover a large expanse of time, ala the Dune books. I guess that remains to be seen.Overall, a very entertaining watch and one I would recommend if you enjoyed the first film.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

U couldn't care less about any of the characters, and some scenes are just funny with the hissing like animals, it was just comical. It felt like a 3 hour commercial for kind kind of sea world. The script was terrible and the only time Jake said to his son "" i see you"" had no weight at all. I went with my dad thinking it was gonna be at least 60% as good as the first one, I left pissed off actually 1.because it was so long 2.at least if u make a 3 hr movie, dont let teens write the script!!

Yeah I know I'm late to it but it's bc I'm cheap and was waiting for Disney to stream it 😬. Did it have to be 3+ hours?! Completely unnecessary. I loved the first Avatar, which I saw in 3D and was truly just mesmerized by the beauty of the cinematography and didn't pay attention to the semi-recycled plot of colonizer coming in to ruin nature. So with Way of the Water, when u really think about it, the plot is pretty uncreative since it's basically the Colonel looking for Jake Sully the whole time. Although the scenes in the water were beautiful, did they really have to take so much time showing all the intricacies of teaching the kids to be underwater creatures?! Anywho there were about 3 times the movie could have ended but it kept going. Also why did the kids all have different accents?! Aren't they come from the same place?! Still one of the best uses of CGI I have ever seen but if James Cameron is going to keep having more and more sequels let's add some more creativity to the plot.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The times when literally nothing is happening in the story I couldn't look away, I'm so engaged in Pandora I could watch their day to day lives every film.People will say it's just visuals but there's great action, good world building and some good new characters too. The visuals are truly breathtaking though! Such a visually beautiful movie especially in 3D. Every time they would go underwater taking that breath in it made me take a breath too every single time.Some people forget that movies have to be entertaining too and not just crazy plots.

It's a grand and beautiful world filled with vibrant colors, exotic wildlife, and spectacular vegetation. The movie's visual effects team did an exceptional job of creating a world that's both breathtaking and realistic, leaving the viewer in awe.Another major aspect of the movie that shouldn't go unnoticed is the use of advanced motion-capture technology. The technology allowed the actors' performances to be captured in their entirety without the need for costume changes, and their movements were converted into the computer-generated creatures we see in the film, giving the Na'vi characters a lifelike appearance. The motion-capture technology plays a significant role in the film's success, helping to make it such an immersive experience.Despite the many impressive aspects of the film, the storyline left something to be desired for me. The movie's premise was straightforward, the battle over resources in an unfamiliar environment, a theme that's been used numerous times in other films. The storyline lacked originality and felt predictable. While the film's visuals were a feast for the eyes, the narrative wasn't quite as engaging, giving the viewer the impression that they've seen it all before.The movie's primary antagonist, Colonel Miles Quaritch (played by Stephen Lang), was also criticized by some viewers for being a one-dimensional villain. He lacked the depth of many of the other characters in the film and seemed to exist merely as a way for the plotline to advance. Even the movie's hero, Jake Sully, came across as generic, without anything particularly memorable about him.However, one thing that cannot be denied is that the movie did an excellent job of exploring themes of imperialism, environmentalism, and the damage humans can do to the environment when they're only interested in profit. The movie's message was clear in that it was a warning, reminding viewers of how easily we can overlook the consequences of our actions and how dangerous it can be to take the environment for granted.In conclusion, Avatar is undoubtedly visually stunning. It's a journey that takes the viewer to a world that's both imaginative and fascinating. The film's CG team did an exceptional job of bringing James Cameron's vision to life. It's a movie that can be watched for the visual effects alone, but its storyline may leave some viewers wanting more. Overall, Avatar is an impressive achievement in cinema that undeniably pushes the boundaries of what we thought was possible in terms of special effects but not so much in terms of storytelling.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","I will admit I was partially wrong about this movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8744461/?ref_=tt_urv","Benslie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69664646/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2022","The biggest thing for me when it came to this movie was the story for it. I was worried about how exactly they would continue this story naturally and keep the audience interested as well. While I do think the story was able to do all of that I also still think it might've needed a few more edits to make it a bit better. What I enjoyed the most was the family element in this movie. Obviously, between the first movie and this one, it was inevitable that Jake and Neytiri would have a family of their own. So I really enjoyed getting to see how connected this family is and showing the different dynamics in it as well. They felt like a real family with how the siblings would stand up for each other one second and the next just make fun of them. But due to how many new characters there are in this movie an important thing to have is balance. When a movie has new characters to introduce and have the audience build connections with them it's important to give them all enough time to develop and show their dynamics with other characters. Although I would love to say this movie does a good job balancing all of the characters in it, I can't say that fully. When it comes to the kid characters in particular the story does a good job of spending time on them depending on how important they are. But when it comes to the other characters in this movie at times I forgot they even existed due to how little screen time they get. I can see why in this movie Jake and Neytiri weren't shown as much but there was one character, in particular, I was surprised didn't get that much screen time.Spider, played by Jack Champion, despite being an interesting character didn't get that much screen time which was disappointing. He had so much potential to be this really interesting character to study but just ends up being forgotten along the way. But he wasn't the only new character who was just tossed to the side but also a lot of the Metkayina's were also just pushed to the side. I feel like when it came to pushing characters to the side it primarily affected the water tribe and none of the characters there were fully fleshed out. So many of them just ended up being flat characters and I really hope in future movies they get more screen time so they can be proper static characters. I think the biggest reason why some of the other characters who aren't a part of the Sully family get pushed to the side is due to the part of this story I didn't really enjoy which is the sky people returning. I'm not against them returning and kind of figured they were going to return it's just how they choose to have them return. In particular, how they decided to have Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang, return to be the big bad in this movie. I will applaud the movie for actually addressing how this is possible, despite it making zero sense, but I wish they created a new bad guy for this movie. But that wasn't my only problem with the sky people's storyline which is that it didn't feel fully thought out. There were two different storylines going on with the sky people with one of them just randomly being forgotten about and the other one literally appearing out of nowhere. I can see what the ideas were for this but I wish they had just adjusted it a bit to make it a bit more interesting. It's also because of this that at times the movie feels like it comes to a screeching halt. Overall, the pacing of this movie was surprisingly well done and I didn't notice how much time had passed. One of my biggest concerns was with the over three-hour-long run time and thinking there were going to be scenes that could've been cut or shortened down and I was partially correct.For the most part, I never felt like the movie was dragging at all and was moving at a decent pace especially in the opening scene when we're being reintroduced to the characters and the Sully family. But I did start to feel the pacing issues once the sky people return and the family go to the Pandora reefs. Once at this point in the movie is when I started to find scenes that could've been cut down or cut out. What I find the funniest thing though about this movie is despite everything flowing well the ending for this movie was so rushed. The ending can be best described as don't blink or you'll miss it due to how fast it goes. But I think the real biggest reason you don't notice how much time has passed is due to the special effects in this movie. Despite how many years have passed since the first Avatar movie came out there's one thing everybody can agree on which is the special effects aged super well. I specifically love how if you compare the motion capture from the first movie to this one you can for sure see a difference in the CGI. From the Na'vi to the creatures of Pandora everything looks so much cleaner and natural. This is especially true when it comes to the look of the creatures of Pandora. By getting to properly explore the reefs of Pandora we get to see all new creatures that mainly inhabit the ocean and once again I'm asking how can I ride them. The Ilu, Skimwing and Tulkun are all well-designed creatures that look incredible. But it's not just the people or creatures that are jaw-dropping but the environment of Pandora as well. We've already seen what the forest of Pandora looks like so it's exciting getting to see this whole other area and how gorgeous it is. Every scene that's underwater is just breathtaking and makes you wish you could go and visit this place. Definitely a huge round of applause for every single special effects crew person for their hard work creating these underwater creatures, the environments and the Na'vi people. But of course, without actors in the Motion capture suits, none of this would work out.I can't say the acting in this movie was the best but what I will say is that all of the kids in this movie really stole the show. For most of the teenage actors in this movie, this was their very first big movie role and it really doesn't show. All of them are able to convey the proper emotion that's needed for the scene and make their character stand out amongst the others. For those who have siblings will be able to most likely relate to one of the Sulley siblings due to how well they demonstrate the different kinds of siblings everybody has or are. A person who was a surprise to me was Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, who plays Tuk, as I expected Tuk to be the cliche annoying little sibling but was actually fun to watch. I will say as the youngest I did relate to her the most but the other person I related to and really enjoyed watching was Lo'ak, portrayed by Britain Dalton. Out of all of the Sully kids, Lo'ak was honestly the most interesting to watch due in part to Britain Dalton's portrayal of this character. He conveyed perfectly this kid who's trying his best to fit in with the others in his family while still being true to himself. He always stands up for what he believes in and despite everything is always there for his siblings to protect them from anything. Despite not having that much screen time another actor who surprised me was Jack Champion. Like I said earlier Spider is such an interesting character study as he's human but raised among the Na'vi. I feel like with more screen time Jack Champion could really bring so much to his character and make him a fan favourite. I remember looking at the cast list and seeing that Sigourney Weaver, who plays Kiri, was coming back for this movie and was curious to see how. Well, Sigourney Weaver did an incredible job playing the teenage daughter of Grace. I know for the most part it was because of the CGI that she looked completely different but I still couldn't tell that it was her playing this character. I thought they brought in a young actress to do all of the motion capture and she just did the voice work but no.Sigourney Weaver actually played Kiri from the physicality to the vocals and you can tell she put in the effort. She comes across as a regular teenage actor from her voice to her body posture and conveys that emotion so well. I will quickly say that despite not having a lot of screen time Zoe Saldana was also pretty good. Every time Zoe Saldana was on screen you saw Neytiri's character growth over the past years and how becoming a mother has changed her. She's super supportive of her family and just wants what's best for them. She also just brings such raw emotion to this character as well that you're just hypnotized by her performance. Everybody else in this movie was also pretty good but due to many of them not getting much screen time they couldn't fully show off their acting ability. The last thing I want to mention is the editing in this movie because it was just weird. For the most part, the editing in this movie was just fine but there were a few occasions where the editing was just weird. There's this one scene where this one thing is happening and then it randomly cuts to something else not related for only a couple of seconds before cutting back to the original thing. It was during these few moments that I was taken out of the movie experience and decently confused. In the end, Avatar: The Way of Water surprised me but also proved me right by still having some issues with the story.

In the first movie of the series the story was stronger. The visuals are better this time, which makes it more enjoyable to watch. But I think the story was better the first time. I couldn't watch the movie in 3D, but I can't say it met my expectations. It seems like it was continued because the first movie of the series was successful. I don't want it to be perceived as a negative comment for those who haven't seen the movie. What I'm trying to say is that James Cameron is a genius who does very good work. But I think this movie was made on the success of the first one. The fact that both movies end with the same scene seems to indicate that the third one will come.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was watching the movie with a friend and he couldn't help but fall sleep. He did for 3 times and his snorting is too strong so we left for the sake of the audience who actually were less than 10 people. I couldn't care less on leaving behind something that was as dull as pain; not even 3D glassed helped out ...

One of the best cinematic experiences i have had in a long time! The movie looks absolutely stunning!! Most of the time i couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't! Thats how real it looks! Every piece of scenery is something to admire! The visuals might not be as groundbreaking as they were back in 2009, but they are still some of the best i have seen in a movie! Cameron expertly crafted this world that you just immerse yourself in!I Also enjoyed the story as it was not following a formular we have seen before, as the first one did where er could recognize the story from other pieces of media! The new characters were great as well and i just really enjoyed exploring this world with them! At the end of the movie it also became obvious that there are still 3 more movies to go as it doesnt quite feel like a conclusion or solution to what was set up!I dont Know if it is better than the first movie as i see this more as a cinematic event! If you want to watch this movie, watch it in theaters! Watching it at home will not give you the full experience.. trust me!","32 out of 66 found this helpful.

It is one of those movies to ACTUALLY experience on the big screen in 3D, like you're in another world. James Cameron has pushed the limits of technology in cinema once again to seek his vision. There is a lot more action in this movie than the previous film, a lot of new characters introduced, and a lot of BLUE in this film. The story is very simple, more cliche- like, which I was a little disappointed by hoping we get something more original. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie for what it is. One thing that frustrated me was this human character that can't decide what side he's on and it goes on like for the whole movie. Hopefully Cameron do better with his character in the next film, but other than that, I give this movie a watch if you're into the same stories you heard before looking drop dead gorgeous.","22 out of 43 found this helpful.

In fact, it felt more like an episode than an epic.Basically we get a familiar world (albeit a water location), unremarkable characters and a familiar enemy & plot. I didn't feel like I'd want to sit through the same movie again at the theater anytime soon (unlike my reactions to the first ""Avatar"" and Titanic).Even so - the wonderful aquatic visuals for for most of the 3+ hours created an ""experience"" of sorts. It let me let off my feeling that the intro was a bit rushed with the character introductions and explanations (esp. The kids).I hope Cameron is able to recapture his ""epic"" moviemaking style in Avatar 3. He's a great movie-maker and I still plan on getting tickets for the sequels.","14 out of 27 found this helpful.

I was dying to watch Avatar 2 in theaters and the wait was 13 long years.Avatar 2 can be considered as visually extravagant with amazing scenes which will captivate you mainly the underwater sequences. But the 13 years they took for making this CGI masterpiece, they could have invested that in the plot. The story is wafer-thin, blatant, cringed and cliched. The dialogues were like ""meh"". The crux of the story is like a rehash of avatart. Adding to that, the movie is excessively long which will test your patience even though the scenes are alluring. The action scenes were okayish, there are lot more parts in which the continuity goes to the space. I think James Cameroon invested his major time and hard work into the technicalities and the other side went west. The another major letdown is the background score, which is not elevating a single scene in the movie.Bottomline
A Visual treat overstretched boring movie.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

I smiled, laughed, cried, my heart raced, and my jaw was agape many times. It's the best cinematic experience I've had since the first Avatar (13 years ago!), maybe even surpassing it.I'll be seeing it in IMAX in a couple days, and any other screen style I can.Bravo to everyone involved with this masterpiece, it is a whole new step up in cinema, much in the way Lord of the Rings was for its time.Avatar: The Way of Water truly has a beautiful feel to it. The writing and story is superb, the casting and acting is stellar, and the theme of sacredness about nature and the ocean is woven into every frame of the film. The main element that really impressed me was how seamlessly the CGI melded with the real people interacting with Pandora and its inhabitants, making me completely forget that this gorgeous world we dive into isn't footage from Earth, despite me wanting it to be.I loved how the film takes its time with character development and letting the audience breathe in the beautiful world of Pandora, rather than rushing through everything (like how many other blockbusters do), and also not wasting a moment.I am really happy and excited that we're going to be getting at least 3 more Avatar movies after this, at least hopefully! It feels like we're back to an era of movies that I'm excited about again, after about a decade of drought. That being said, the movie's title is very fitting; an oasis in the expansive desert that modern media has long been.Update / Edit (Aug 30th 2023): (contains spoilers)After having watched it again on digital copy just now, I think this movie is specifically designed for IMAX 3D, and outside of that format much of its charm is lost. My first impression as written above was quite overzealous and rose-tinted, so here's some extra thoughts:Way of Water is a visual feast for sure, best theatre / IMAX 3D experience I've had since Avatar 1, but I still prefer the first one; the story is better, tighter script, and the best building tension to final battle in any movie I've seen. Also the second one didn't quite hit as hard as the first one did. Avatar 1 is perfect, endlessly rewatchable, not a wasted scene throughout. However it does feel that Way of Water could have done with tightening up some more, especially the plot and script, in order for it to pack an emotional punch similar to or greater than the first. The final battle of Water could have been much grander, involving the Metkayina throughout rather than just the start when they quickly disappear inexplicably. At least give an explanation of why they suddenly vanished, and why Neytiri was side-lined for much of it only to occasionally pop in when the story needed her to.Going forward in the Avatar series of movies, I hope James Cameron can refine the stories of each, and how they're told, to make us fall in love with Pandora like the first one did, as Way of Water didn't really do that for me. I hope that this film will be the weakest narratively of all the Avatar films, and the upcoming three will take the feeling that made so many of us fall in love with Avatar back in 2009/2010, and ramp it up.The rule of thumb however with most movie franchises is that the first one is the best, and the following ones aren't quite as a good or memorable. However, James Cameron has shown the world that he can make sequels better than their originals (Aliens, T2), so I hope that he still has that magic in him.","41 out of 89 found this helpful.

And you'll find out that technology is not all and not the way to give peace to your soul.""Avatar 2 The Way of the Water"" is an impressive spiritually movie with a lot of slamming criticisms against the behaviour and bloody ignorance of human beings who had not learned from their mistakes in the Past.It's not just a movie.

I personally didn't feel any lag, the progression was great. But some would say he spent lot of unnecessary time showing underwater scenes; but for me every single minute was a bliss, it defined the emotions and the feelings.I've read somewhere, one of the editors of the films said it raw. When they showed the first cut version to James; he became furious and told them to put every damn 190 minute of the film back; this is James for you.It's been 13yrs since the first Avatar, and hence this had to stand to the experience we had with the first one. With all the latest technologies; there was something new we all needed, and it was present in this.Coming to plot, yes it's a very simple plot. Nothing new, family is more important; they stay together, fight together. This I'm telling in simple words, but James will make you emotional watching it on screen.Definitely there are some plot holes, I won't write it here, then it's a major spoiler. But Avatar 2 stands for itself than one; it's a buildup for the 3rd.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

I tried to watch it three times, but just could not overlook how the na'vi are portrayed the way we have portrayed the American Indians, and how the invaders are are made to come across as thoughtless, callous American soldiers. It also does not help that the action scenes are not very realistic, even though they are done with wonderful graphics. I was really looking forward to enjoying this movie because I had loved the original Avatar movie.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

An impressive visual spectacle that was worth seeing in a big cinema, but not much substance to it. This sequel was was pretty much cast in the same mold.I went to see it expecting that it would be a movie that I would probably only watch once. But that it was one best appreciated in a cinema with the biggest screen and biggest sound system I could watch it on. With 3d glasses to boot. In that regard it delivered. Just like the first movie it was gorgeous and the world it was set in was wondrously captivating. The stunningly designed alien creatures and landscapes lived up to the original film in every respect.Also like the first movie it had a bland story with cartoon villains. Basically a thinly veiled (and poorly delivered) social message. The villains are 19th century colonialists dressed up as futuristic humans. They go to a far away planet and basically say ""let's destroy this pristine environment, steal the natural resources and kill the native inhabitants - bwahahaha."" Primitive natives fight back against the evil high tech army with help from defectors from the bad guys who have gone native in the vein of Dances with Wolves. The story (both the original movie and this sequel) really doesn't have a whole lot more substance than that.Enjoy it for the visual spectacle but don't go expecting much more than that. If you plan on watching it on a little tv at home then don't bother since you'd be missing most of this movie's good points. It was a movie that was precisely what I expected. No more and no less.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

I think that was the most surprising thing, that the story kept moving at a nice pace. Especially for a 3 hour+ movie. The action was phenomenal, the story satisfying and warm. Jake and neytiri as parents is wonderful. We watched in 3d and I felt like maybe it was lacking some color-I want to watch it in regular vision as the colors were one of my favorite parts of the original. I'm a lover of the water so seeing the sully family adapt to the way of the water was a treat. A must see for any avatar fan. I hope Cameron can keep the good momentum on this series to the finish line.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

As with the first Avatar, the facial effects on the Navi creatures are just impeccable. Whereas most movies have effects work that you can find in any video game, Avatar sets itself apart by a mile because of the detailed effects work. To build these blue-creatures who flawlessly move and emote, interact with water- they are fully realized beings. The effects of these creatures is just wow.Then you come to the story- boy oh boy- It's far weaker story than the first Avatar. I don't know who the protagonist is supposed to be. Is it Sully, is it his kids, is it the other kid? Whose story is this?It's very scattered and at 3 hour of runtime, they could have easily cut it down to make a more focused story about 1 protagonist.Finally, the 3D- the James Cameron Team and Lightstorm just knows how to make 3D work. Like in the first Avatar, Avatar WOW is really well designed to play as a IMAX 3D experience.This is also truly a movie where you could easily get up to take a pee break whenever and you really wouldn't miss anything. Seriously, this is the one great thing about the movie- you can get up and leave anytime to take a leak or just go do something else. It doesn't need to be 3 hours.The Weak story and the long runtime knocks it down for me. The effects work are worth watching on the biggest 3D screen.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I highly recommend watching it in the theater as there are just so many details in the movie that are stunning. The change of location seemed unnecessary as it's being presented in the movie, but honestly it took the movie in its own needed direction. Part of me wishes they didn't bring back the humans and let us just enjoy the world of Pandora more because the non-action sections were so immersive.

The visuals were absolutely stunning !! The score was also really good, having samples from the first movie also was a nice touch. The acting was all top notch and the action was good. How the movie leaned on family and it's importance I believe was the main motivation of the movie.The movie also got us to really care for the animals on Pandora once more, connecting them to us. I did really enjoy it.A key takeaway is the amazing visuals I have to speak on again, the movie makes you want to be there, to feel it to experience it, to be one with it, I think with the third movie being at a faster pace and more action, this could be one of the best set up movies out there !!!Now the downsides, I don't think the movie needed to be 3 hours, I'm not against long movies but I don't think the story was strong enough for a 3 hour film. The story itself was good but felt stretched out a bit for me, rather than a solid line it grew but felt distorted as we go along yet find itself in the last 30-40 minutesIt could be my cinema but damn so scenes were too loud, as beautiful as the visuals were, there was a few too many scenes of just swimming, I get that's it, the way of water but sometimes it felt like it was just there to be, ""look I'm pretty"" rather than having a point to the scene.Overall it's a top sequel and I'm quite intrigued to see where the series goes and I'm hoping for a third, I definitely recommend a cinema experience don't wait for streaming.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

My score could've been lower if I didn't watch it in 3-D.This movie does a lot of things right. One thing they do right is the VFX. Everything looks amazing and well done. The editing and music is spot on. The direction of the film is good. The actors are very decent. A lot of people return in more ways than one. The chemistry between the actors seems good. Nothing for us. The dialogue is pretty much good throughout the film.Although it is beautiful and well done in certain aspects, there are some things that are wrong with it. The beginning is interesting and good while The middle can drag a bit and the end is very good.The story itself is okay at best. They don't reinvent the wheel or nothing like that.

Actually, the great. Incredible CGI. I am sure the actors worked extremely hard to make this movie. That's it.The bad. Pretty much the same premise as the first Avatar but longer. Same acting. Very good but nothing spectacular. But I blame the script. This movie is pretty much just like the tens of thousands of movies made in America, very little imagination as far as the script goes. Scenario after scenario, most were just stupid and predictable. One thing would happen and you knew what was next, just like those tens of thousands of movies.What I didn't really like were the kids. Do the script writers think that all kids, today and in the future, are stupid, ignorant, selfish, hateful, liars, and when in imminent danger, think everything is funny and okay. Script writers kids must be the worst. 2 hours and 50 minutes, the kids are horrible, 10 minutes (okay, maybe 15), the kids are saviors. And the dreadlocks, come-on.I can only hope 3/4/5 are scripted, not like just about every movie ever made, with the same old scenarios, not like the first two, but with a unique direction that takes us to a new experience with smiles, laughs, cries, and adventures that we knew not were coming.Thank you for your time.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first movie did it well already and now redoing the same thing somewhere else feels tiresome.

What facilitated that emotion was a blind approach where I went into the movie with no real idea about it. I took a similar approach to this movie too.I was dazzled by what True IMAX could bring to life. The visual brilliance of this movie brought out the world and the characters to life, but the story lacked depth.It mostly contained a lot of platitudes about family, about the way of water, and a whole lot of action with no meaningful underlying message. It was just about eat or be eaten. At certain points, it felt more like the Fast and the Furious series than it did of the wondrous landscape Pandora could have been.Visually stunning. Kudos to all the people that made it happen. Fire the writers twice for essentially dishing out a meaningless story that focused on platitudes and not at all on character formation, suspenseful twists, or anything that could have made the movie as good as the first one.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

You would think after all this time they would have made it better than the first, but it looked just as bad as infinity war CGI.For what I did watch, I would have loved to have kept going if the animation was better. If I could have been entranced in the story. Avatar is meant to be beautiful and magnificent, awe you and inspire you. And the scenes on Pandora's beauty they had in the movie could have done that, if they had chosen a different animation style. I'm so frustrated about it because I wanted to love it.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It must be seen in 3D to be truly enjoyed. A good film and I recommend it to fans of the original. However, I am ambivalent on the story line - do all of the humans (other than Jake and a few other characters) have to be complete a-holes? And I am a bit tired of being hit on the head by the anti-colonial message from James Cameron. The parallels to the European conquest of North America and genocide of native Americans are obvious. OK, we get it! Move on. Again, I still recommend the film for the visuals and action, but the storyline has become tiresome.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The film's release was delayed for various reasons, but people don't lose attention to it. I'm talking about the biggie and you knew it already. There is no need for an introduction to the veteran filmmaker James Cameron. We were stunned by his early works like Titanic, and Terminator, and when he came with the first part of Avatar, we were just out of control because of the visual images and the new way of visual representation. We wondered about Pandora and the blue people. After 13 years when the sequel comes up with a bang, we just feel the same kind of thing likewise the first part. Cameron once again produced something out-of-the-box visual magic with the assistance of new technology. In the first part, we saw the magic of the forest and now it's about the like sorcery blended in the sea (water). Avatar - The way of water primarily focused on the character detailing rather than the first part something came out of freshness because we all need an introduction to Pandora and its inhabitants. When it comes to the sequel we already knew about it and that's why Cameron specifically focused on the character arc. The movie clearly shows the detailed aspects of the characters Jake Sully, his wife Neytiri, their children Neteyam, Tuk, Lo'ak, and also Kiri, Ronal, Tonowari even the villain Quaritch too. The story is not at all a fresh one but the way of execution is unbelievable. Migration was the basic element of the first part but here it is expatriation. Jake Sully and his family become refugees because of the coming back of the sky people. So they are forced to move to the other part of Pandora. The people residing in that part were sea people. They live and develop their life according to the sea. They gave shelter to Sully and his family and trained them to communion with the sea. Then James Cameron invites us into the beauty and mystery of the sea and that was a splendid visual treatment. In the end, all are united to fight against the sky people. I'm not going to spoil much more. Kate Winslet bags a record beating Tom Cruise by holding her breath underwater for continuous 7:14 minutes. Tom did it for Mission Impossible and Kate's record-breaking was viral news. Cameron setups new types of equipment for the underwater shoot. As we said early the visuals are splendidly more in 3D which illuminates people to expect the next 3 parts. But there is nothing hooking at the end portion of the film about the upcoming parts. I expect a scene after the end credits (it is usual). But aside from when I rethink that kind of a hook, I feel that there is no need for such a thing for the audience to wait for the next parts.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Instead, it is really itchy to the brain seeing corporate work intertwined with personal revenge.What brought to the Pandora for corporate work is profit as efficient as possible, but No! It is revenge! No real corporate does that in reality. Instead you have a group of capable military that their work is hijacking corporate resources with too much unnecessary work.

What can I say? I think there was an improvement in many aspects and despite its length, for most of the film I enjoyed it. The CGI is completely hypnotic, as is everything seen on screen.Regarding the script and the development of the characters, I find myself in the same position as the original film. The same trite conflicts that we have seen countless times in other films, the holes to force more and more films in the saga (we will know that there will be at least 5). In general terms, the story captivated me a little more than the original film but my feelings are the same. I give this sequel an extra point, because the visual effects alone carry the 192 minutes of film, but James Cameron needs to keep improving if he wants to keep his audience for 3 more sequels.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even moreso in 2022. Now they fine-tune motion-capture. I think they used too much motion-blur, but it matters how far the viewer is from the screen.James Cameron proceeded to make THE most- violent movie I have ever seen(!).

Well he failed big time because almost every single story beat was telegraphed from miles away. In fact, most of it so so telegraphed that if you took Ma Ma out of the 2012 Dredd movie just after she took a hit of Slo-Mo even SHE would have seen it all coming.It's a good thing we're really only here for the visuals, then, isn't it?

This is one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had in my life. James Cameroon is a cinematic genius. Worth the 13 years wait. Astonishingly beautiful.From start to finish the movie keeps you engaging, making you more and more indulged in Pandora's world. And this time the Pandora's world is even more beautiful underwater.I know there are some talks of story being weak and unliked by critics, I would just say that go and see for yourself, you'll not be bored even for a second. It is awe inspiring and wonderfully made. What else people want?Go see it in IMAX and enjoy!","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Something was missing compared to the original, and I don't know exactly what, but I have some contenders.High frame rates *do* in fact make things look more realistic. That also makes them flat and banal. It lookwd more like a soap opera or a home movie than an epic film.There writing was even more basic and bland than the original as well. Unfortunately this time the acting was not enough to elevate the CW quality dialog and story.I feel like this is James Cameron's Phantom Menace. Either he has eliminated anyone in his circle from challenging him, or this movie was made only to sell toys, or both.","12 out of 14 found this helpful.

The 3 hour and ten minutes length didn't seem to be that long since the story, it's visuals and screen action kept my interest peaked and made the time fly by. The film should be seen in 3D for best visual effect as it was made for 3D viewing. I definitely plan on buying the 3D blu-ray for my collection when it becomes available.

It is the most technologically sophisticated dinosaur in the world of movies yet. If Oscars still mean anything, and if there still is any justice left on our planet, then ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" should win best VFX, best cinematography, best sound design. Win or be nominated, at the very least.If you watch movies carefully and pay as much attention to detail as you can, and if you've read my review for the first one, then you know there was a slight VFX error in that one. It only occupied a handful of seconds, but it was there, and you cannot change that fact. I'm not saying I saw that error on viewing one because that was more than a decade ago now, but I'm certain I did spot it very early on. I didn't pay attention to it because I was heavily interested in the plot, but then I decided to review the movie, and I couldn't turn a blind eye on that little moment that had been bugging me for all those years of me and ""Avatar"", so I took a closer look and saw what I saw. There it was. I've now seen the sequel. Finally, and I was watching it on that huge screen, and I was paying attention, and I didn't spot anything visually wrong with anything. Thumbs up, for sure, not to mention how the first one was a forest movie, and this one is a different story, it is an ocean movie, but it still has some nice reminders of the forest. Safe to say it is visually even stronger than the first one, absolutely. The sound was also amazing. The only element of the package that is weaker than in the first movie is the music here. It is good, make no mistake, but it does not beat the original score by the now late James Horner. R. I. P.So, the package of this one is as high as possible, probably the highest thus far with the whole underwater motion capture work and everything. But the content is also interesting. In a way, it is the polar opposite to the package. Not in the quality regard, no, the plot is good. You see, the visuals are as new in terms of their production as they get, they are the technologically freshest. But the story here is an old one. Is this basically yet another older film on another planet like many would say ""Avatar"" was basically ""Dances with Wolves""? No, it isn't like that. But the core of the plot is family and how it functions, and this is a very old and familiar topic. A father protecting his wife and their children from peril is what this movie has to offer. This is classics, a dinosaur of a tale. Regardless of how ""sci fi"" this all is, the plot is very understandable and human. By the way, if you haven't seen the first one, I suspect you won't be confused much and you'll probably catch up. Is the second one a copy of the first one? No, it is not, but there are elements that tie the two plots together well, and it should not be hard to figure out who is who and why they are where they are.The characters deserve a special comment. ""The Way of Water"" has a way to bring back some of those that did not survive the first movie. It does not make the most sense, of course, but seeing Quaritch in action again is brilliant. Unless the upcoming movies in this growing franchise take a bad step, Quaritch and Spider will be what Vader and Luke were to the old ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Mark my words. Sigourney Weaver is also back. Her character is gone, for sure, but there are flashbacks, and more, and even though it also raises a question or two, it was done for a reason, and the surface of that reason has been decently scratched here. The plot thread will go on. Unfortunately, there is no way to bring back Trudy, and it would be nice to see her again. Well, not everyone gets to come back. But then, who knows? It isn't easy to do such things without getting carried away and ending up with something ridiculous. So far, everything is alright, and it should stay that way.By the way, what is a character, exactly? Does it have to be a living creature? Does it have to be human? No, because a robot can also be a character in a story. In this movie a whale is a character. A huge underwater life form is a character in a motion picture. It has a history, it has intelligence and kindness, and it shows care for the ones around. And it can fight. The ""Avatar"" franchise isn't what you need if you want interesting characters, you say?! Well, nobody here may be Anton Chigurh or The Joker from Nolan's Batman movie, but the characters here are clear, relatable and interesting nonetheless, and most importantly, the movie is daring and good enough to question what a character even is and proves they don't even need to speak. This is impressive.You know what, the three hour runtime I did not even notice, I didn't get tired of sitting whatsoever. A decent sized chunk of that runtime had me crying for a number of reasons. What got me first was the awe. Then the movie got me thinking about how the beauty I was seeing was fictional, and the real beauty on our real planet is dying now, and that is sad. Finally, when it came to action and violence, the movie really got serious. James Cameron should be nominated as best director once again because he is so good at working with drama in a motion picture. Thank you, Jim.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I want to live there again with my family and have a sea horse and a space whale that I can talk to and ride.Then when you think about how the film is like 90% CGI and then see what you're seeing on screen I don't know how they did it...so many scenes look like real life. I saw it in IMAX 3D and there is NO OTHER way to experience this film. James Cameron is an absolute mad lad for pulling this off and making it far exceed the first one in every way. Cameron's world and story is completely realized. Everything meticulously thought out and placed on the screen to make you feel a sense of awe and wonder. The forest is beautiful but the ocean....just go see it and you'll know.The plot was very simple but done perfectly. This resonated with me because someday soon I will be a father and have kids of my own and I could complete relate with how Jake felt about protecting everyone.It didn't feel like over 3 hours long and when it ended I was was pretty sad as I walked out into this boring world back to my car and my reality.GO WATCH THIS IN IMAX 3D.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

However, apart from the visual effects, in my opinion, you don't have anything else to get hooked on, since although the story tries to show the continuation of the life of the main characters, they lose prominence in front of the visual shots, and in fact, the story itself ceases to be the protagonist, to give prominence to the visual spectacle.Avatar 2 is much more visual and fanciful in terms of special effects, and for that it would be worth watching.But Avatar 1 had a balance between special effects and development of the story and plot in general, which made it even interesting to watch it multiple times, as there were several elements to analyze. In Avatar 2, you wouldn't have much to enjoy except the special effects, as even the music wasn't that great.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

You'd be forgiven to think that you are maybe watching a documentary on Discovery channel half the time. Apparently James C's idea is to provide a sense of wonder with new flora and fauna to compensate for the lack of originality in script or characters. Frankly its boring.Only those who go to movies for the animation and visuals will appreciate this. If you care about original screenplay or interesting characters, look somewhere else.

I personally feel like the action and the special effects are way better than they were in the first movie. I also like the darker vibe it takes towards the last half. With that being said the story overall is very convoluted. Especially with the amount of characters that are in the movie. Sometimes the characters do things without any explanation and it feels more like shock value then something the character would actually do and it's hard to connect with them. But overall it was an extremely fun movie and I have never seen visuals like this in my entire life. You definitely need to experience it in the theater. Also the villain Quaritch is the best part of the movie. I am looking forward to the next one though. I feel like there's going to be a lot less set up in the third movie and it's going to be a much more enjoyable story. But for me personally I loved the underwater stuff and I really genuinely cared about the message more in this one. I think that's what James Cameron cares about more is that you connect more of the message than you do with the characters.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The storyline picks up after the previous film with Jake an Avatar, happily married and with a family of his own. When the military returns and it is overheard their mission is to kill Jake and his family, they move from the woods and go into hiding with the people of the water. How long can they hide before the humans find them...and finding Jake may not be their only motive...This movie is directed by James Cameron (Terminator 2) and stars Sam Worthington (Clash of the Titans), Sigourney Weaver (Alien), Stephen Lang (Don't Breathe), Zoe Saldana (Guardians of the Galaxy), Kate Winslet (Titanic), Joel David Moore (Dodgeball), CCH Pounder (Robocop 3) and Cliff Curtis (Sunshine).The special effects in this movie are absolutely stunning and the underwater elements are beautiful and very well done. The characters, both known and new, are fascinating and very entertaining. From a storyline standpoint, this might not be as good as the first film, and there's an overuse of the children for cause-and-effect moments, but it is still science fiction gold and worthwhile. I always adore how these movies highlight the impact of colonialism on culture, nature and the indigenous people. The action scenes are out of this world, whether it is action in nature or the more traditional shootouts, explosion and hand to hand combat. Everything about this picture is fun.Overall, this was worth the wait, a science fiction masterpiece that's an absolute must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend.","34 out of 74 found this helpful.

It is a duplicate of the 1st one in many instances, e.g. Instead of deforestation and strip mining, it is slaughtering the whales! Instead of riding on the ""flying creatures,"" they are riding on the marine creatures... However, the scale of this sequence is much smaller, focusing on a man's duty to protect his family.The pace is good!! It is filled with amazing CGI and actions to keep your interest going, and your boredom away, even though it is a 192-minute movie!The movie could be split into 3 parts: The 1st part is about the introduction of characters. As such, anyone who does not watch the 1st episode will learn to know the characters of Sully & his family members + spider + the bad guys. Of course, having watched the 1st episode is always advantageous to knowing this movie better.The 2nd part is that they go underwater. This is where one will see how visually impressive and breathtaking the movie is, with soothing colors and all kinds of amazing marine creatures. This part may be slightly lengthy, but overall it is ok!The 3rd part is all actions pushing toward the final battle. Audiences will get all kinds of visual excitement from the actions.One thing I love about this movie is that it addresses most of the doubts, e.g. Why is Tulkun so intelligent? What are the steps of hunting Tulkun? What does 'butterfly jelly fish' do and so on. With this, it is self-explanatory, or it clears your doubts when things happen!However, this movie is not perfect, and there are some drawbacks as follows:
Firstly, the Major Quaritch (bad guy) is a military guy, but I saw no tactical or logical wartime attack or defense strategies from him throughout the movie.Secondly, the emotional value is much weaker this time. It touches on family ties, but it's rather touch-n-go, and audiences are unlikely to be moved or emotionally involved. And, the emotional bond between Tulkun the kids could hardly touch one's heart too.I gave 3.75/ 5.0. Overall, it's a nice movie. It maintains the standard or quality as of the 1st episode. BUT, what's more, other than the same environmental theme (e.g., deforestation, whale conservation) + beautiful CGI? I supposed audiences would wish to see more than these, after the long wait of 13 years later.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

There was zero creativity in this movie, wasn't everyone expecting insane alien ocean life?? It's a movie about humpback whales with more fins.

From that day onwards i was waiting for the 2nd film to hit the theater and watching Avatar the way of water on the very first day is an experience on itself. The visuals as usual is stunning and some scenes we literally out of this world. The 3D really utilizes our peripheral vision because some scenes i felt the characters are coming from the far corner. The story is emotionally attached to the place and we overserves will be involved and will feel like we are there watching the whole thing unfold before our eyes. The music, the sounds of everything happening are top notch and i could go on explaining how great everything was. But for now go enjoy this visual masterpiece of a movie for you self. The direction of Cameron, the performance of the cast, the effort from the whole visual effects team pays off in this long movie that is full on engaging and entertaining.","16 out of 31 found this helpful.

You ask your co-workers if they went to see it, and they of course have, like everyone else. They say ""yeah the special effects were pretty great"", and thats the end of the discussion. And we all did the exact same thing when the orginal came out 13 years ago.Its competently written and acted. It undeniably looks impressive. It has some emotion, but not much suprise. You might have even cried at the end. But the truth is also that you forgot 95% of this movie the second you left the theater or turned it off. You don't remember any details of the plot or the characters' names. You probably dont even remember the main character's name. It's not worthy of extended discussion of its themes and I'd guess that less than 1% of people ever went to rewatch this bloated 3 hour sequel to another cash machine from 2009. This movie has absolutely no right to be over 3 hours long.Way of the Water IS the film industry in one movie. Its a gluttonous and intelligent machine that converts money to entertainment back to money as efficiently as possible. It practically has it broken down to a science how much to spend on a project, how much it will make, how long to wait before releasing a sequel, the etiquette of its dialogue to reach the widest audiance possible, how not to cause any offense or controversy whatsoever, what portion of the budget goes to effects, actors, and marketing, what time of year to release, and how it ends to keep the door open for another sequel without creating the expectation for a sequel which might not be worth making from a financial standpoint.The first Avatar had legitimate thematic purpose with the Alien species being representative of indigenous peoples who are invaded and bullied by more advanced societies, but Way of the Water is just a lateral sequel to that which follows the same characters and similar chain of events all over again 13 years later. But it doesn't matter because everyone have forgotten that entire film since.Marketing and box office numbers might have someone believe that Avatar is one of the biggest and most well known brands in film, but the truth is that almost nobody has ever had a conversation about Avatar outside of talking about seeing it in the theater earlier that week. These are the most expensive movies ever made, but nobody remembers what happened in them. And in 2035, people will go and see Avatar: Way of the Sky, and do it all over again.EDIT: Apparently, an Avatar 3, 4, and 5 have been scheduled to release before 2032, so its actually worse than I thought, point made.Or maybe this was all intentional. That the $5.2 BILLION grossed by the Avatar films is a metaphor for how uninformed people are silently robbed of their land and resources over a long period of time. And by the time they notice, the machine is too powerful and they are technologically overmatched and doomed to live a in a world of hollow entertainment in the shadow the of golden empire of Hollywood.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Graphics are much better in the second movie but of course tecnology is getting better with years. Even though the graphics are better than any movie you might watch, the impact of avatar 2 is far from avatar 1. You won't have goosebumps. I find the intro to be weak and really fast.

The initial rendering of 3D on screen was so that I never felt that it failed to mimic ably the perception of depth. In fact in the first Avatar; I often had the feeling that what was seeing on the screen was the juxtaposition of several flat planes one after the other. The technology at the time did not allow depth to be continuous and progressive. I therefore hesitated when purchasing my ticket to Avatar 2 to opt out of 3D and go for a good old 2D screening. Well I would have been wrong. 3D does work in this instance absolutely stunningly. The only quirk is that it darkens the image and thereby dimming down the colors, which in the Avatar's universe are a source of amazement.Progress was made on the VFX as well. There were some brief and rare moments within scenes in the first arc when Na'vis, Pandora's floras and faunas or human machines felt unreal. None of this occurs in ""The way of the water"". All feels real and at no point did my gaze spot an instance on the screen that revealed the computer generated nature of what was shown.Story wise, ""Avatar : TWOW"" builds on all the traits that we know make great entertainment. This is the reason why I do not give the movie a perfect 10. The script is build around themes that have been proven to work effectively in fiction, time and again across centuries. So you can't really be surprised here. You won't experience a ""wow, I did not see that coming"" as Darth Vador revealing he's the father. However storytelling and dialogs are really handled to perfection to the point where, while the movie lasts 3 hours, I ended up wanting it to last twice as much.It is a family story with all the inner workings of a family : love, misunderstanding, longing, aggravation...It is also a coming of age story as well as a reinventing oneself story and a good vs. Evil story. So as I said earlier James Cameron really throws at us all the tropes of successful fictions of the past. But he and his writer team managed to commingle them magnificently and it works out !I think that where James Cameron does a better work than Georges Lucas on Star Wars is in building a word that feels at the same time coherent and complex. One of my main issue with SW is that Lucas had the tendency to throw species or strange devices on the screen without ever pausing to reflect on whether it was coherent within the universe he was building as long as it was fun. The pink elephant playing drums in Jabba's lair is a perfect illustration of this fun vs coherence choice. In Avatar's world everything makes perfect sense within the whole ecosystem depicted. Even the human machines are well thought of on top of being a spectacle by themselves.All in all Pandora remains visually breathtaking and engaging. Watching the movie, it really feels as if we are embarking on an exploration of a far away world that is stunningly beautiful.There isn't much to say about the acting apart from stating that It's really flawless. There isn't one moment where I ended up thinking that it was acting or that the characters on the screen were 3D computer generated constructs.All in all so a spectacular and entertaining experience that I enjoyed tremendously.","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

The cinematography is wonderful, mainly in underwater scenes, achieving powerful and beautiful visuals. The special effects are good, although in a couple of scenes they can look a bit unreal. The soundtrack is amazing, especially the action and suspense scenes. The greatest success is the script, as I mentioned before, it focuses on a story that deals with the problems of planet Earth but seen from the fictional Pandora, the human destroying everything in its path and what is different. Once you've walked out of the movie theater, remember ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and its message, drop the cants about it making you cry during its run on screen but out there you're back to being a person who treats your family badly or a neighbor. Do not belittle an animal either. The film's message is clear, live it in the cinema and in your daily life. Also remember that the plot of the film revolves around adapting and knowing good things around you but which you were unaware of or feared. A great movie and a possible winner of several Academy Awards next year.","20 out of 41 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Not every movie needs to have complex storytelling in order to be great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8747811/?ref_=tt_urv","Aleksandar_Ilic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39170283/?ref_=tt_urv","20 December 2022","One of the most anticipated movies ever finally arrived in cinemas, but it was worth the wait! Avatar (2009) was the highest-grossing movie of all time, and the sequel was supposed to be released in December 2015, alongside Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It has been postponed many times since then. Those are the two main reasons Avatar: The Way of Water was such a highly anticipated movie. The third reason is that it's a new James Cameron movie. Think about how awesome that is. This is only his second movie in the 21st century, so it's a must-see.Many years have passed since the first movie, so Avatar: The Way of Water opens with a brief exposition to bridge these two movies. I don't usually appreciate it when a movie starts like that, considering it is poor storytelling, but it was a much-needed exposition. From the opening shot, we see Floating Mountains that are captivating as always, and immediately you are transported to the magical world of Pandora. Frankly, I wouldn't mind listening to a weather report while these immersive shots emerge on the screen, let alone exposition.After the exposition, we see military people arriving on Pandora, and that scene has a powerful message. When human spaceships land on Pandora, as a result, they burn an enormous part of the forest with the spaceship engines and wreak havoc on wildlife. Obviously, they don't even care about it at all. They were only looking for a convenient place to land without even thinking about the environmental consequences. This scene says a lot about human nature. Wherever they go, they bring destruction with them.The good thing about a sequel is that we don't spend time with humans like in the previous movie except for a new character called Spider and just a few others. An even better than that is the fact that Sam Worthington only stars like a motion capture character. He doesn't portray his human character anymore. I consider his acting as a critical flaw in the first Avatar movie.From the start, we follow Jake and his family members. Throughout the film, we can see his struggle as a parent and his attempts to protect them from danger. There is also a struggle among his kids. They want to be seen as adults, hunt with their tribe, and fight by their side. As time passes by, Jake becomes overprotective, although it backfires on him. His kids want more independence, which leads to more disobedience, in an attempt to prove themselves as brave warriors. This story is a recycling of many movies in the past, so that part became too familiar and tedious.Numerous characters died at the end of the last movie, so we have the opportunity to meet plenty of new ones. As for the Spider, a new human character, we only learn that he is wild and unpredictable, especially towards the end of the movie when he makes some very unnecessary decisions.As we saw in the trailer, Jake has four children now, but Cameron doesn't dedicate screentime to all equally. We spend most of the time with his oldest daughter Kiri and his youngest son Lo'ak who somehow oddly resembles a lot like Robert Pattinson. Of course, it's not him, but once you realize it, you can't help but look at him that way. The audience will probably like these two the most. I think Kiri has the most compelling character arc development. She is a young shy Na'vi girl who has difficulties fitting in with a new tribe. She is different and sees it as a negative because the other kids see her as a freak. Countless teens can relate to her character as they try to find their place in this big modern world.The thing that bothered me the most was the villain of the movie. We already knew it would be the same antagonist as the last time. Quaritch is coming back, and I think it is a wrong decision. There is no good reason why he is returning after he died in the first movie. Even worse is that the final battle in Avatar (2009) loses its significance now. The only reason I can find for the revival of the Quaritch ties to the main plot.In fact, the plot is simple. Humans want revenge for being banished from Pandora at the end of the last movie. They come again, and they fight with Jake. That's it, the whole story. The fact is that there is no good reason for the continuation of the story. Villian lacks motivation, and the entire movie wouldn't exist if the ""Sky People"" haven't returned to Pandora to seek revenge. But there are some advantages and disadvantages when a movie has a thin plot.Cameron dedicated time to enriching his characters, and I liked how he developed them throughout the film. Certain characters need to make tough decisions towards the end, so we learn a lot about the other side of them that we didn't know existed. Look at it this way, movies like Raid (2011) or Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) have simple plots, yet they were one of the best action movies in recent memories. Those movies know what they are and what they are trying to accomplish. So not every movie needs to have complex storytelling in order to be great.Hayao Miyazaki, the greatest Japanese animation director, once explained a term called ""Ma"" which we can translate as emptiness. Miyazaki said, when you clap a few times with your hands, that's just unnecessary noise. Miyazaki further explains: ""The time in between my clapping is Ma. If you have just non-stop action with no breathing space at all, it's just busyness. But if you take a moment, then the tension building in the film can grow into a wider dimension. What really matters is the underlying emotions...""This is exactly what James Cameron tries to do in the second act of Avatar: The Way of Water. It takes time away from the action to explore the majestic underwater world. Nothing crucial happens to the plot in this part of the movie, yet we see a series of the most magnificent shots in cinema history. During this sequence, at least four people left the movie theater and didn't return. It is evident that the audience only seems to care about action in a movie nowadays and nothing else.The funny thing is when Lo'ak is swimming with a whale, it was actually my favorite scene in the entire film, and that tells a lot, considering it lasts for 3 hours. We need more scenes like these cause while I was watching Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, I got overwhelmed with action sequences, hence I got bored. It had the opposite effect on me, and I don't believe I am the only one who feels this way.There are also an abundance of awe-inspiring action sequences in the first and especially the third act of the film. Despite that, I felt partly disappointed with the final battle as it lacked scope and grandeur compared to the first Avatar movie. It's done on a smaller scale however it is intended in that way to become more personal for the characters, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I didn't expect it, although I believe I will appreciate it more on consecutive viewings.Avatar: The Way of Water is an excellent movie, but I don't think it will be as impactful as the previous one. When the first movie came out, it was leagues above every other sci-fi/fantasy movie in terms of CGI. It was a massive leap forward regarding special effects and motion capture improvements. I respect James Cameron, as he chose to film numerous close-up shots with actors wearing motion capture suits and bravely demonstrate what he was doing in the last five years with his talented VFX team. He doesn't shy away from it as we see in other movies, trying to cover up special effects with overly dark scenes and hoping audiences won't notice how terrible CGI actually is.Visually it's an astonishing achievement. But a problem I have is that Cameron overuses blue color combined with purple, which means the movie has a limited color palette. I think I saw all shades of blue in this movie, but it reminds me a lot of a first movie, and it is hard to distinguish visually one film from the other. When they go underwater, it is appropriate for the screen to explode with blue color, but he uses this color literally in every scene.I adore the decision to shoot this movie at a higher frame rate because you can see movement more clearly. Many people don't like it, since they are used to movies filmed in 24 frames per second. We only need time for our eyes to get accustomed to 48 fps. If we get more movies with higher frame rates, we won't notice anything strange with quick movements, as we sometimes do now.Another essential technical improvement, compared to other movies, is the stunning utilization of 3D. I can't remember the last time I said that about a movie. Honestly, I've avoided watching films in 3D for years, but Cameron really knows what he is doing when he shoots in 3D. One of the few directors who can seamlessly incorporate 3D technology in the right way, so I definitely recommend watching it in 3D and, of course, in an IMAX theater to experience it in the best possible way.What I value the most in the film is the message that shows us that we should protect and preserve the marine world and, in general, the entire nature on our planet. Even in the last film, he left a strong message about the importance of preserving the rainforests. I respect that he tries to leave a clear message to the younger generations of how important it is not only for our future but also for the future of our planet.Avatar: The Way of Water is an immersive experience, so I didn't mind a 3-hour runtime. Unfortunately, the majority of the audience today can't hold their attention for that long, but that shouldn't prevent directors from having shorter runtimes. As James Cameron said recently in an interview: ""They can see the scene they missed when they come to see it again.""","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The technical skills here are off the chart.The story, however, is just ok and really is a sort of rehash of the first film. No spoilers here, but I will say the story was very very basic and was a major disappointment to be honest, considering the writing skills of James Cameron.The character work is fine. Again, there's not going to be awards there, but the actors are good, especially the awesome Stephen Lang.Like the first film, I think this is slightly over-rated. Well, the first film was very over-rated in my opinion. It was solid but not amazing story-wise.So, overall, pretty good.I expect the last 3 films will go the same way: Technically excellent, so-so story. They will definitely make lots of money. But will they be very highly regarded in years to come.... I don't think so.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

There were some very long sequences in the water that seemed to drag on and on. I was most surprised though that 3D has not advanced very much since the original Avatar was released. The 3D picture still seems dim and washed out at times, while up close fast-action sequences continue to suffer from blur, even with the 45fps refresh rate. With that said, the imagery is still mostly stunning but don't expect the wow factor of the first movie, there's nothing new here. In my opinion, Avatar: The Way of Water struggles to decide just what type of movie it is, a kid's movie or an adult movie. Much of the dialogue and storyline seems to be aimed at the 12 and under crowd, but then someone's arm is suddenly ripped off. Like the first movie, there's a lot of underlying messaging and subtle innuendo aimed at the audience. I'm sure this will be debated endlessly just like the first movie was. I gave it a 7 out of 10 mostly for the filmography. If I was rating it solely on storyline, it would've received a 5 from me because I was checking my watch about every 15 minutes during the last hour.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is an incredible movie that completely blew me away! As an amateur movie enthusiast, I must say that this film was a true masterpiece. Director James Cameron did not disappoint with his long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster hit, Avatar.First of all, the visual effects were absolutely stunning. The world of Pandora came to life in a way that I could not have even imagined. The colors, creatures, and landscapes were so vibrant and detailed, it felt like I was right there alongside the characters. The underwater scenes were especially breathtaking, with the way the light danced and reflected off the water creating a truly magical and otherworldly atmosphere.The storyline was just as captivating as the visuals. The characters were well-developed and had such depth and complexity that I found myself emotionally invested in their journey. The theme of environmentalism and the importance of preserving our planet was also beautifully woven into the story. It was a powerful reminder that we are all connected to nature and that our actions have consequences.The acting was superb, with standout performances from returning cast members like Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver. But the real scene-stealer was newcomer, Bailey Bass, who played the role of a Na'vi teenager named Kari. She brought such a sense of vulnerability and strength to her character that it was impossible not to root for her throughout the film.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water was an amazing cinematic experience that I would highly recommend to anyone. It exceeded all of my expectations and left me feeling inspired and awestruck. James Cameron has truly outdone himself with this incredible film, and I can't wait to see what he has in store for us in the future.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film was scripted really well for me, by James Cameron
The plot was really intresting, the action and special effects made that
ilm even better. Music from this film was probably my favourite thing
about it, it was balanced beautifully and made by one of my favourite
music artist called ""The Weeknd"". Music conveys a lot of feelings and is
setting the mood. As I said, special effects were really realistics, the
Pandora world was really beautifull. Main actors like Sam Worthington
who played Jake Sully or Zoe Saldana who played Neytiri were still there
playing really unbelievably good, they are really great at expressing
emotions so we can experience this movie in the best way possible.Overall, I recomend this film to everyone, especially to people who
like fantasy movies. For me it was really gorgeous film to watch.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film is visually stunning, I have never seen anything like it. I was lucky enough to see it on an IMAX screen and it blew me away. The detail in the nature and the creatures and people and the Na'vi (the blue characters) was breathtaking. Watching the movie is like looking at a masterpiece painting in a museum.

I actually think the story is a little stronger then the first movie although it's pretty painfully obvious that James Cameron has dragged the setting to the area he's most comfortable in, underwater, and he's pulled out all the tools from his bag and liberally using aspects from The Abyss, Titanic, Aliens from the deep etc.No complaints with the casting really, and most of the characters have at least some depth and believability although some of characters had plot induced stupidity (one particular one is telegraphed but not quite earned and I guess more interactions between the characters in question were scripted but cute due to the very long running time)Only saw it in 2D but I am going to see it in 3d IMAX after xmas so it might just end up being mind-blowing like the first one was visually.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Avatar returns -- weak in some places, but stronger than ever in others","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8745516/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2022","The conversation around James Cameron's Avatar has changed over the years. When that movie came out in 2009, pretty much everyone -- including those who liked it -- said the same thing: ""This is just a showcase of visual effects; its script is a retread of various White Savior plots and the only remarkable thing about it is going to have aged once we reached the next breakthrough in 3D animation, motion capture, and all that junk"". Take that, highest-grossing film of all time!Here's the big question, though: Just how much better have visual effects actually gotten since the early 2010s? If anything, the age of streaming (demanding a continuous output of new site content where quantity must trump quality) and Cinematic Universe ""deadlines"" has all but forced them to get worse.So now, movie-goers are rethinking Avatar in a sort of ""You never know what you had until you lost it"" sort of way. (I've seen something similar with two fully animated pictures from the same era -- namely The Adventures of Tintin and Rango -- where someone noted that 2011 was the year we finally nailed stylized character designs mixed with photorealism and proceeded to not attempt it ever again.) Moreover, they've been absolutely stoked for its sequel, the idea of which was kind of a joke up until recently (particularly the way that Cameron's mindset reduced itself to ""Oh yeah, you don't want a sequel? Well I'm gonna make five! What now, losers?"").There have even been some revisionist takes, mainly seen on Twitter, where people claim that they've always loved the film (same as viewers of Arcane and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners totally never made fun of the computer games on which those shows are based). They never minded that the plot felt rehashed and clichéd; instead, a spectacle whose emphasis is its visuals and imagery is exactly what cinema should be (hence they're also mocking whichever critics make this complaint against the new film). They never thought the climax was overlong and boringly bombastic; instead, the scene where Stephen Lang gets in a mech suit that wields a big knife while stuff goes ""kaboom"" behind him before he gets out of the mech suit and wields a smaller big knife was cool and great, actually. Unobtanium? What an awesome name for a thing!Really, I think people are just starved for anything that puts that much effort into spectacle, world-building, and sci-fi wonder -- and has the money behind it truly deliver.And to be frank, Avatar: The Way of Water is not only a surprisingly welcome return to the fluorescent alien jungles of Pandora, but one that takes what I liked about the original and does it even better (because yes, the technologies have improved since 2009; we just throw together slop like Thor: Love and Thunder, She-Hulk, and *insert any Disney+ Star Wars show that isn't Andor* anyways cuz we got output quotas to meet). We also get to explore the secrets of the seas this time, as we're introduced to the amphibian (?) Metkayina tribe. (By the fourth sequel the franchise may have completed its version of the Seven Gelfling Clans from The Dark Crystal.)I like the characters more here too. Zoe Saldaña and Sigourney Weaver once again act well through the mo-cap (there's a ""twist"" to the latter actress' role that I won't give away here), and Sam Worthington is nowhere near as bland as I remember him. Among the many newcomers is Kate Winslet, who is marvelous as usual (she also had to hold her breath for a record-breaking 7 minutes while free-diving for the shoot, because Cameron's gotta Cameron).Still, there were parts where I lost interest in these characters, factions, and conflicts. I expect to be met by appalled comments (""How can you care about things like whether you care?"") from one side and smug ""Told ya so""-s from the other. Rest assured, I was never actually truly bored; the film is much too beautiful for that.I mentioned before that I've seen critics outright pan The Way of Water in the same terms that some panned the original; they dismiss its tedious ""video-game action"" and complain that there's nothing in-between the pretty sights but generic 80s movie dialogue, info dumps, and sexy Na'vi. Zach Handlen of Time noted that ""Cameron's sensibilities have gotten less adult"" with his latest films, calling Titanic ""grandiose YA"" and arguing that Avatar is a kid's cartoon that goes harder than usual -- so I guess Captain Planet with a Lord of the Rings budget.However, I think there's more to The Way of Water. There's certainly more to it than the first Avatar (which I'm prepared to concede is better than we gave it credit for) while its sense of interplanetary awe remains as strong as ever -- now letting us see more of its luminescent wonderland and follow characters that are, at the very least, pleasant to be with. Speaking of Cameron's career and past breakthroughs, The Way of Water also features call-backs aplenty to everything we've seen from him, from Aliens and the Terminator movies to Titanic and The Abyss (which I maintain is the smartest, scariest, best-looking, most powerful film he's made).That's not ""unoriginal"" the way that the first film peeked at the homework of Costner, Zwick, various Disney directors, Kroyer, et al.; it's a heartfelt look back at the journey that led here, and the innovations that made cinematic feats like this -- where people truly get to feel like they've stepped onto another planet -- possible. I just hope that not as many neckbeards kill themselves over this one. ""The most dangerous thing about Pandora is that you grow to love her too much.""","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Our youngest fell asleep about 2/3 of the way in (3hrs was a bit too long for him) & our 10yo barely made it all the way to the end but he did just manage it.We saw it in 3D, which was definitely worth doing, I reckon. There are some really nice jungle & under water shots that are made even more amazing by the 3D treatment. Some nice action scenes, too. It did seem like they'd forgotten to apply the 3D effect to the occasional shot here & there but, overall, it was very, very good.Our kids loved it & we were initially concerned the 3D might bother them, hurt their eyes or give them a headache or something, but neither of them had any issues with it.There's a lot going on in the film & I won't spoil it for anyone but it's the sort of movie that I reckon could easily be watched a handful of times for fans of the genre as it just has so many different ""sections"" to it; the kind that, for me, make movies like Aliens & Thor: Ragnarok so rewatchable. And James Cameron's attention to detail & adding certain scenes (like when the humans are going through the motions of loading their boats onto ramps & into the water) that other directors are unlikely to have bothered with, really add to feeling that he really spared no expense with putting his vision together. My other half disagrees with me on this point & reckoned a lot of that ""fluff"" could've been trimmed out to shorten the runtime. I guess you can't please everyone...The CG effects are top notch, of course, & the story isn't half-bad, either, so go & give it a watch... but ensure you get plenty of rest the night before as it is quite long; especially for the kidlets!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

had the ugly one and funny caracters had the rediculous
one (for example spider). In conclusion i think that
,,Avatar2"" is fascinating and who likes science-fiction
and action movies should watch it.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Can always tell an entertaining movie when we all talked about it afterwards on the ride home with no down points about it. It's a beautiful movie and really doubled down on family bonds which was a breath of fresh air. After the disappointment we had with black Panther 2 we were all worried about the runtime and horrible story telling but it was just perfect amount of both. Every moment was justified and was building up a new future to look forward to in the world of Pandora. Even with the long runtime we all are ok with going to imax to watch it again but this time in 3-d (tickets were sold out). Keep them coming we are on board with this style and art of entertainment.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Not what I was expecting. Besides 1-hour full packed action scene everything else is just one huge encouragement of family values. If I wanted to watch some mediocratic family soap opera, I would have gone to see Home Alone, Frozen, Harry Potter or something else. Far away from being good as first part. Don't trust me, just look at the ratings. Effects are stunning though and general story line as well. But I don't understand why every darn 5 minutes has to have some family moments in the movie. I'm going to skip theater next time when Avatar 3 come out.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

No, when I went to the theaters I just wanted to have a great time during this 3h, enjoy the scenery and dive into this world. And this exactly what I got. The CGI was once again mind-blowing and I love how much time Cameron invests into introducing us into the water world especially paired with this amazing soundtrack. Although I understand if some people complain about the long running time but I think it is comprehensible. Moreover, I really enjoyed seeing grown-up Sully with kids who get their own coming-of-age kinda storyline. I don't care if you could have predicted the happy ending from the very start, in Avatar 2 I WANT Sully to be the saving hero and I WANT the kids to have their cliché and stereotypical moments. I loved this movie just as much as the first one.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Avatar 2 is probably one of the most boring movies you will ever see. There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.","101 out of 152 found this helpful.

Disney's ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" which clocks in at over three hours long, is being hailed as a stunning piece of cinema, generating a ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. ""The Way of Water"" follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who are now the parents of four Na'vi children. The family is driven from their forest home when humans return to re-colonize parts of Pandora. Way back in 2009, ""Avatar"" arrived on screens as a plausible and exciting vision of the movie future. Thirteen years later, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" - the first of several long-awaited sequels directed by James Cameron - brings with it a ripple of nostalgia. Jake and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) are raising a brood of biological and adopted children, whose squabbles and adventures bring a youthful energy to the sometimes heavy, myth-laden narrative. Cameron's embrace of the idealism of adolescence, of the capacity for moral outrage as well as wonder, is the emotional heart of the movie. You feel it in a horrifying scene of tulkun slaughter that aspires to the awful, stirring sublimity of the last chapters of ""Moby-Dick,"" and also in the restlessness of Lo'ak, Spider and Kiri as they try to figure out their roles. Although Cameron's sequel is highly anticipated, it's not necessarily parallel to the rabid Marvel and Star Wars franchise fans who flock to the earliest-possible showings. ""Titanic"" (1997) and ""Avatar"" (2009) both opened on this weekend, in different eras of preview shows. ""Avatar"" grossed the equivalent of $5 million (adjusted) in midnight shows only. Neither film had an opening that conveyed their ultimate success, but this was due in part to the more-limited theater capacities of the period. ""Titanic"" ultimately grossed 22 times its opening weekend; ""Avatar,"" 10 times. That record makes any definitive response to the preview numbers more difficult. Quaritch is joined by some deadly human fighters too, and Avatar: The Way of Water encourages us - successfully - to root against humanity for all the destruction it's unleashed on the world. We've seen that before, including in the first Avatar, but it speaks to Cameron's real achievement, which is to bring us into total identification with these computer-generated Na'vi characters.","17 out of 34 found this helpful.

While before this, it was just a beautiful visual idea. Pandora is created for the first time in this film, not because of Cameron's tough filmmaking style. Rather, it is the emotion that create it. Yes, it is the emotion that make Pandora. After Aliens 1986 and Terminator 1984, this movie is Cameron's hardest and toughest movie. This movie is a great work that a tough filmmaker makes up with emotions. The world of Avatar is readable, not too complicated. But it takes form. Avata 2 ' s special effects are not just an invention. Rather, it serves the story.. it serves the characters.. it serves the mise en scene. .... Jake sully and his wife are paid again and are not just big stars of a simple romantic standard level of payment.It seems that here the filmmaker should not refer his story to a film of the first part, but James Cameron explains everything with the focus he has in filmmaking during short impressions.This movie is much better than the first part because here we are not going to go through a very long and boring introduction about a multi-line story. This movie starts from the first moments.The dialogues are not on air. In this film, the director has become an expert in the world of his film and remarkably innovatively creates a very good interaction between action and adventure. It can be very difficult to formalize the plot of a traditional story better than this.I have a nostalgia with the special effects of the first part of this movie (only with its special effects), but that does not make me want to prefer the first part. The difficulty of this movie is like aliens. And I have never seen its softness in Cameron's films.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

So much hype, anticipation and build up surrounds this film........can it live up to expectations or will it be the biggest flop of all time?I'll be honest, I don't really remember the first film back in 2009 at all really. I do remember going to see it and thinking it was good. Being blown away by the incredible visuals however not really buying into the characters or story that much. Sadly for me ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is more of the same!James Cameron has once again created a visual feast for the eyes, from start to finish this film is sublime to look at! The technology that Cameron has been pushing for years has 100% payed off in a truly awe inspiring way. I can't think of another film that pushes the boundaries with technology than this film does. Huge credit to the team behind the film for making this possible!The only other positive that I enjoyed about the film was the world building and the expansion of the story. It was fascinating to explore the world more and see new incredible things bought to life.However for me thats where the positives end, the rest of the film is just meh to fine. Not for everyone but for me some of the most important aspects to a film are characters and story. If you have a great story, complex and interesting characters, that is a great foundation to build a film around! Sadly for me this film relies far far to much on the special effects as the wow factor whilst leaving the story and characters behind in quality. For me its just not that interesting, I'm not saying its terrible because its not. However I was hoping an expecting a bit more considering how long Cameron has had to make this film. It feels a very safe and simple story to tell and doesn't take too many risks.Of course I understand that this is the first of 4 million sequels that Cameron is planning for this franchise lol!70% out of 100, its a good film. Top tier visuals from start to finish and something that is game changing! No other film has effects this well crafted! However the more important parts to the film ie; the story and characters are very underwhelming. I wouldn't say this is any better or worse than the first film all those years ago.Just like ""Avatar"" from 2009, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" will be pretty forgettable!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The core of the stroy sully stick together and fight together against any hurdles. In Avatar world Navi's are more emotional and civilized than the sky people (humans).The way James visualise pandora it is outof the box .

It is particularly appreciated that these young characters are likable unlike so many of the spoiled youth depicted in movies and shows today. In the end, however, the story of the movie is not particularly interesting, let alone original. But James Cameron's mastery of filming, editing, sound and of every other aspect of filmmaking makes the movie a total blast to watch, even if one doesn't ever really know why. Such belief in the power of the moving image to move audiences is refreshing at a time when the movie experience is constantly being degraded and the theatre experience at risk.From a story standpoint, beyond the character introductions and some small details, it all feels very similar to the first Avatar. The main difference is maybe that the bad guys this time around have adopted the form of the Na'vi. Beyond making hand to hand combat scenes more balanced, this change turns the core conflict in the movie from an ethnic and cultural conflict into what appears -at least visually- as a pure power struggle. One can imagine possible echoes with the evolution of the North American society movements in the last ten years.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

It took that kind of screen technology to a new level. More than a decade later, Avatar: The Way of Water has the same impressive visual impact. The color palette is smooth and bright, the underwater world with all its new creatures is amazing, and it's all realized down to a level of detail that nothing else has reached. Seeing it in 3D is a must.But then we get to the storyline and the characters. This is where I have problems -- we've seen all this before in umpteen Western movies and their type. The human ""colonialists"" have once again arrived to shove aside and subdue the primitive natives, so that they can exploit Pandora's magical resources. In the first Avatar it was the mineral Unobtainium; in this one, it's a sort of whale oil that stops aging. The human soldiers all seem to be just thugs. And on top of this we have Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), now resurrected and cloned into a Na'vi body, who's on a personal vendetta to find and kill our hero from the first movie, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington). Quaritch is just a stock, one-dimensional villain. (Say what you will about the Marvel superhero movies, at least they give their villains decent backstories.) I was constantly wondering, don't the people who are sent out on these interstellar expeditions have to pass some kind of qualification tests for things like ethics and common sense, let alone skill and intelligence? And then there are the gender stereotypes, unfortunately, that are repeated in both the human and Na'vi social structures. Everything in the characters and societies seems to be borrowed -- the Na'vi sea peoples that take up most of the story are straight-up Maoris, as far as I can see.Maybe I'm coming down too hard. My wife says that this same destructive storyline played out any time in our past where a more technically advanced culture moved in on a less advanced one, so why should it be any different here. And my son-in-law says I'm overthinking it anyway, because it's just entertainment. But I'm hoping the next one will have a better, more nuanced script.Incidentally, if you want to see this as an action movie you'll get all you likely wanted and more. The inevitable Big Showdown at the end goes on and on and on though. Too much.So in the end -- for the visuals and the richness of invention I give 10/10, and because movies are a visual medium by definition, that's a big factor. For the action -- maybe only 7/10 because it's overdone, and for the plot and character -- maybe 5/10 at best. Worth seeing? Certainly, and certainly in 3D.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie is perfection on itself.The story is about family and unlike the Fast and Furious family theme, this one actually does explore what that is. Union, family, love, compassion, strength, all of these topics are explored across this film in a masterful way.James Cameron can take the most basic of plots and the most basic of sets and turn them into a very complex original work of art. The entire final fight in the marine ship during the day looked very basic but then at night, it turns into an action survival arena that helps develop the family relation even more.I could keep going, this film is a cinema expectable like no other.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Subjective. I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.","215 out of 340 found this helpful.

The larger mix of protagonist characters made for a less predictable list of specific narrative events compared to the first film. There were also just more characters to keep track-of and keep the viewer focused. The overall story events were appropriately what most people should suspect. But the 3D viewing experience kept me entertained and engaged the entire time. I suspect some of the more negative reviews might have come from people who saw it in 2D. I imagine some of the long visual sequences could get a little slower and less engaging without the 3D.The story seemed less unimaginative than the first Avatar. This isn't to say the story is brilliantly written or innovative. But it didn't feel to me almost like a carbon copy storyline of two other colonialism movies like the first Avatar film. And for me that's a big plus.The visual effects were also incredible to likely no one's surprise. They someone seem to exceed expectations even when everyone is expecting them to be brilliant from the start.A couple negative notes which apply more to this film than the first Avatar: A lot of the story early is communicated via voiceover. And in this film there aren't even video logs as an excuse for the blatant exposition within the storytelling. Another complaint is that this film feels more like a setup for more films compared to the first one which feels like it could have worked as a solo film is it somehow was the same, but didn't make enough money to justify any sequels.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

However, to protect his family, Jake Sully decides to keep them protected with the water tribe's help hence the name ""Way of Water"". However, as usual, the Sky people come back to poke their nose into their business hence evoking yet another massive war.If you notice very carefully, Mr. Cameron has very smartly used the exact same story as the 2009 avatar. A group from a different tribe landing into another tribe , learning their ways, some emotional bonds, an ultimate long battle between sky people and the Na'vis , and ultimately becoming one of the tribe members. This was the same formula of Avatar and now also in Avatar 2. Very smart Mr. Cameron.Coming to the performances, it's again terrific. This time the film focuses more on Sully's kids as they are new to the world of Avatar and how they ultimately become fighters. Emotions are there in perfect proportions, evoking smiles and tears just when needed and not unnecessarily. Cameron is a master of emotions and his film Titanic too was a proof.No doubt it is a visual spectacle. The underwater scenes are absolute breathtaking and in 3D , the experience is surreal. Do not watch it in 2D at any cost, unless you cannot afford 3d or imax.Climax was yet again pretty similar to the first Avatar, intense but this time , it's even more stretched to the point that i was not very happy. At the beginning of the climax i was enjoying every bit but once after sometime you will realise, that things are just not ending and that's were you feel bored rather than more excited.Cameron, in the final bits of the climax battle sequence, gives a mini tribute to his own film Titanic lol. You watch the film to understand it. I wish Cameron could have chopped off this Titanic section.Overall, Avatar is a visual treat but in terms of story, nothing new . It will definitely extend into a 3rd film and i hope Cameron does not paste the same concept story again there otherwise my ratings will go down further.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was everything I could ever ask for. Cute kids, BEAUTIFUL visuals, and emotional scenes, one from Zoe Saldana that gave me goosebumps. I admit the script could be stronger, and the villain could be different, and the humans and Na'vi could be fleshed a tad bit more, but I came away from the theater feeling satisfied, like I just got off of a really good rollercoaster. I still think about the movie maybe hours after watching it, just contemplating how simple it is for humans to have their own Pandora on Earth, we have everything here. We are just polluting everything and mining poor Mother Earth to death. Chills from the Weekend's song on the credits and Neytiri's song. It's just as great as Leona Lewis' sendoff of the history making first film. It's worth the wait. Have an open mind and immerse yourself in the experience, learn the way of water.

By the end of the movie i was kind of tired and annoyed by that.Bringing back Langs character is a huge mistake.

It isn't easy because there is nothing else like this series. It has taken over a dozen years to bring the second instalment of the Avatar story to our screens and, in doing so, it has created the usual dichotomy of Avatar 'fans' and Cameron 'haters'. So, what was MY take on this Sequel? Well, firstly I watched this in IMAX 3D, which is the top of the range experience. I would certainly NOT bother with this format for 95% of the other Films out there, however, this is a Cameron production and he does nothing by halves. Having seen the recent 'Avatar' re-release, I anticipated that this would look visually incredible - and it DOES. The VFX are SO far ahead of anything I have seen (it 'trashes' recent MCU efforts like the risible 'Thor: Love & Thunder'). So the VFX and indeed, the fabulous cinematography, are astounding, with the underwater sequences in 3D being particularly stunning and effective.The story has been criticised by many people, probably because it is the ONLY element left TO have a go at, but again, the story is a continuation of the relationship between Jake and Neytiri, only decades after the events in the first Avatar. Briefly, the 'Sky People' are back - yes, those Humans are a real pain - but this time they bring a whole new motive for landing on Pandora AND they bring a 'Quaritch avatar' with them, no doubt because he has the proper motivation to hunt down Jake. Problem is, Jake now has a Family and pretty soon he decides to move from the Forests out beyond the seas to live with the ocean 'na'vi'. Needless to say, it isn't long before the 'Sky People' in the shape of Quaritch, start closing the net...
Yes, a straightforward storyline - as if most Hollywood blockbusters have anything else! - but it is HOW it is executed that counts. All of the characters, from the members of the Sully Family to the 'new' Quaritch are given screen time to develop, extremely unusual in Films this large. The most fascinating is Sigourney Weaver's 'Kiri', who appears to be more than just an 'old soul' in a teenage body.The middle section of the film looks like a nature documentary on 'Pandorian ocean life' and the relationship between the wildlife and the sea Na'vi 'Metkayina' is especially focussed. All this gives way to the third act, a typical Cameron 'tour de force', of a battle between the 'mechanised humans' and the more primitively armed 'Na'vi'.Overall, this is a Film I actually want to go and see AGAIN. It was packed full of detail, much of which viewers would struggle to take in on the first viewing.THIS is exactly why I ignore the 'haters' and also the rather childish reviews of some 'so-called' serious Film Critics, who for some reason write trite reviews that show no objectivity at all.Cameron's greatest skill is to give us something that is entertaining, spectacular AND with a serious underlying message. Unfortunately, there are still cinema-goers who just want to watch movies with NO message at all.Avatar Way of Water wears it's creator's heart on it's sleeve - Cameron does care about the natural world and what we are doing to it. It comes through in every frame of this 3 hour magnum opus.The 'world Building' for just these two Films leaves everything else in the shade and I for one will wait with eagerness for the next Chapter in this saga.Keep going Jim Cameron, I want to see more!","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

I have to compare it to the original, and by that comparison it does not measure up.The important thing this movie lacks, that was so special in the first, is that movie had heart. Cameron introduced us to a whole new world, but more than that he gave us a story that made us care about those people. He made me care deeply and that is why the first move is such a favorite of mine, and I suppose why it has made more money than any other film ever. This new movie has sweet characters, but we care about them only as much as we care for any character we know is just a fictional bit of storytelling. That is one way this movie really takes a hit. But that is not the only way. When I bring up the idea of this movie as a stand alone it is not just the first Avatar we would have to ignore, but also the other movies that it draws from so heavily. Titanic. The Abyss.Which brings up another issue. Cameron has done some amazing, creative work. This movie was amazing for its visuals, but otherwise the creativity seems to have been spent. I am left to think that Cameron wants to do Avatar movies for the rest of his life because what he has done before is all he's got left.There are so many holes in the story here that it shocks me it took him 13 years to put it together. Sully acts out of character. Issues arise that come up but go nowhere. The story is sloppy.Still, it is edge of your seat stuff. It is very entertaining. It is gorgeous. I did care about the characters, albeit only on a surface level, not deeply. If I didn't have to compare it to my favorite movie - which has so much heart that I love the way it makes me feel when I watch it over and over again - then it would be easy to be less critical.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The visuals and the 3D made it amazing, and the story, even though very predictable, was still good. It also kept me entertained the whole time and I'd even watch it again even though the movie is super long.I'd definitely recommend it to all those who liked the 1st one because the movie really does get you to connect to the world of pandora and gets you to connect to the characters as well just like the first one did.James Cameron once again did an amazing job.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Avatar: The Way of Water is not complex- it's very easy to follow what is happening on screen.And OMG- the screen! I don't know how he achieve this, but James Cameron once again gives us such amazing entertainment that we will remember if not forever, at least for a very long time. I had the opportunity to watch the film in IMAX and I can say that technically the film is polished to perfection. The 3D is crisp and deep. From the camera movement to the music, Cameron presents Pandora in such a way that once again proves to us why he is a pioneer in the genre. The underwater scenes are so immersive that at some point I expected Sir David Attunborough to start explaining what is the migration cycle of the tulkuns.Can't wait for the third movie of this installment.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

I get that the children are part human but did they really have to say ""bro"" every other sentence? I personally didn't really care for Jake Sully's kids. Besides the subpar dialogue, what kept me in my seat was how photorealistic the VFX were. Every time I thought I saw a beautiful shot, the next one would blow that out of the water (pun intended).Two things James Cameron knows how to do right is pacing an action scene, like the final battle, and directing a sinking ship. I'm intrigued with the direction Cameron is going to go with the rest of the series. What's next, Avatar 3: The Drift of the Sand?!I'm excited to see the rest of the other species and races Pandora has. To offer but could we possibly keep it a bit shorter? My eyes, back, and bladder really felt the full 3 hours towards the end there and that was pushing the limit for a runtime that most people can handle without a captivating story to keep us in our seats.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

I have no idea what this film's detractors are talking about?The first Avatar film is now 13 years behind us. Yes - 13! It set a new standard in eye-popping visuals. The story wasn't brilliant, but it was probably one that needed telling. Overall, I would give that 10. Groundbreaking and fantastic.Avatar: The Way of Water is just as good as the first film and it's similar in a lot of ways. The story isn't the best, in fact, there are times when you think, Mmmm... BUT, that doesn't stop The Way of Water being a great film.The point I'm trying to make is that the visuals here ARE JUST SO AMAZING that you can't take your eyes off the screen. You really are transported to the planet Pandora, in the thick of the action.The first few scenes in the sea are truly beautiful and awe inspiring. Breathtaking actually. Make no mistake, The Way of Water WILL win Oscars for visual effects.Sometimes films are great because everything comes together: script, story, acting, filming, soundtrack, and the film needs all these pieces in order to work it's magic on us. The Way of Water is not like this. It works not because of script or stuff like that, but because the visuals of this fantasic world of Pandora are so brilliant, so convincing.There are self-proclaimed ""purists"" who will review this film and find fault in it trying to make themselves look clever. They will express disappointment. They are missing the point. Avatar: The Way of Water is a technical and visual masterpiece. There is no equal to it: a new definition of ""the immersive experience"". Go and watch it in 3D, and leave Earth far behind.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

It makes things look fake, and when a film is already heavy laden with CGI that is a recipe for a dizzying and nauseating experience. In this film, unlike The Hobbit which used HFR for the entire film, James Cameron uses HFR (48fps) for action scenes and the Standard Frame Rate of 24fps for close-ups and dialogue. It does not work. Cameron is a master of the craft and has always been pushing the boundaries of film and advancing the viewer experience, but this experiment must come to an expedient and final end.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

This part 2 of 5 is OVER THREE HOURS LONG. The line for the bathroom following is gonna be long.Just kidding. Unbelievably, I am recommending this movie. And frankly, I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS. I only went as a favor to a friend. And there are TERRIBLE things about this, but the good outweighed the bad.(I don't wish to rehash the original, but if you need a recap, seek out that page.) About the same time since the 2009 blockbuster, or 13-years later, Hero-Jake has a family on Planet Pandora. Despite him originating as a villain, he became the Alien Planet Tribal/Warrior leader. Unfortunately, the Sky-People (i.e., Hysterically ""evil"" Earthlings) are back to seek revenge for their defeat in the original movie. Good luck to wherever Jake takes his family for safety.I had a feeling this would be better than the original, but not by much. I hated the original's regurgitated plot and as great as the graphics were, I truly felt the ""Tall Smurfs"" (that I referred to them as) were fake AF. In fact, when I saw the countless trailers for Avatar 2, I thought the Tall Smurfs STILL looked bad. (Same thing happened with 2002's Spider-Man. I saw the trailer for that and the FX looked hilariously bad. When the movie came out, it looked perfect.) Luckily, they DID look better in the finished product, but still cartoonish.I will get the negatives out of the way. The story was meh, but serviceable. The dialogue was some of the WORST I've heard in decades. Like painfully terrible. Think Phantom Menace bad. The Tall-Smurfs still looked fake, but not AS fake in 2009. And I think worst of all: BAD Editing. Scenes just abruptly ended and started mid-action with the next set of characters. It was really jarring.The remaining graphics and attention to detail: SPOT ON. Like magnificent. I saw it in 3D, but on a regular screen. Unfortunately, the entire screen was not used, leaving large vertical black boxes on the left/right of the screen. So that WAS distracting. The 3D still looked good. GREAT? Nope. Plus, there were so many 3D-tropes used. While I expect that from Friday the 13th Part III or Jaws 3D, I don't from James Cameron. But I will say, any scenes at water level: spectacular. Like breathtaking.Another positive: despite its 3+ hour runtime, the time FLEW BY. Only ONE TIME in the entire movie did I feel it drag. I could forgive that for any movie. There was enough action, dialogue and plot devices to make us NEVER feel the 3-hour timeframe. Also, I did like how they explained back many of the original cast, even when they had previously died. And finally, I will give MAJOR kudos to a tremendous, albeit inevitable, climatic final battle. That last third made up for ANY shortcoming this film had. I had so much fun in that final act and it was everything I personally wanted it to be.The movie did feel like maybe 6-8 TV episodes I just binge-watched. I would not have been opposed to a new series or miniseries taking place post 2009's Avatar. If you view it that way, the 3-hour runtime will also flyby.I only saw the original Avatar once and in theatres roughly 2 months after it premiered. I actually didn't want to see that, either. My friend dragged me one week after he had already seen it 2x without me. Unintentionally, I made us late that weekend and the movie was sold out (as it had been for weeks.) So, we tried again the following weekend (of which I still didn't really want to see it) and was successful. I thought it was OKAY at best. I gave it 4/10 stars and honestly felt I was being generous to my friend who really loved this movie. I mostly hated how fake and dumb the Tall Smurfs acted and looked. Plus, the story, stolen from Fern Gully, Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves, was atrocious.No matter. While I'll probably never watch Avatar: The Way of Water again, I do recommend it and not upset I saw it. I HAD vowed off the sequel(s) due to my distain of part 1. Because of part 2's enormous upgrade in quality, I WILL see the remaining movies. You can tell in this one where the franchise is headed (these movies are WILDLY predictable) and I am curious to see it all unfold. Just in case I'm wrong.Really doubt that, though.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

With his exceptional zeal for the ocean and water, James Cameron returns with the revived Avatar series after 13 years. When all hopes seem lost for CGI as Marvel disappoints us in a string of controversies, The Way of Water demonstrates yet again the pinnacle of visual effects from this decade, defining what immersive experience truly means as the audience roams the soul-capturing sceneries of Pandora. In addition to the otherworldly techniques, the movie's cinematography, aesthetic design, and biome layout continue to be superb and meticulous, elaborating a dissimilar yet equally appealing face of the planet. It is extremely unusual for a sequel to be produced with this level of sincerity, as I am awed with satisfaction and surprise.(Spoilers and criticisms ahead) Although maintaining the technological quality, the original film's central plot of natives versus colonizers has been simplified into colonel Quaritch's personal vendetta against Jake's family, which, despite saving the time to establish numerous intriguing characters, dilutes the depth of the story. Speaking of characters, both Jake and Neytiri's roles have been greatly reduced to fulfill Lo'ak's dynamic, whose identity crisis and journey of adaption are perceptibly trivial compared to his father's. Kiri's mystical connection to Grave and Eywa is hinted throughout but ends up unexplained; Spider's lineage and relation to Quaritch could have been a major twist especially after Neytiri's frenzy, yet are also left unresolved; Ronal, performed by Kate Winslet, can be portrayed as a queen with traits beyond Mo'at, but simply disappears from the final battle. Not to mention, the reef tribe's tolerance of the Sullys seems rather insensible knowing that the sky people are hunting for them. Too many characters to sketch, and too many threads to knot, as the movie is forced to sacrifice good narration and tempo.However, if ignoring my high expectation, the film's not half bad compared to most other sequels: complete storyline, likable protagonists, and absolutely mind-bending effects. At the very least, I did not feel drowsy at all throughout the three-hour watching. Disregard the cost, find the best theater in the neighborhood, and submerge yourself in The Way of Water.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

First of all it doesn't feel like 3 hours has passed when you sat to watch on the film. The film is so mesmerising like you can feel every bit of the scenes that the director is trying to show. The way James Cameron designs his characters, species and the whole world is just powerful and I don't think anyone can nearly touch him in this kind of things. He doesn't focus on story but the way he gives time to his characters the world building the visual experience scenes that shows how creative he is. VISUALS in this film is on another level. It feels like you are actually diving in the water world experience. The animals that he created for water world is just amazing to see their design & the making of this creatures is so damn good. There are many characters in the movie but by the end of the film you'll easily know all characters because that's the creativity of James Cameron. He gives every character its time to perform and to build the story for the perfect conclusion. Actors are powerful and specially all cast has done tremendously well job. As compare to part 1 part 2 is very strong in Visuals, Emotions, Actions but lack of human side this time because the director has more focused on the water world and it's visuals. Try to watch this in as big screen as possible. And if you love the 1st one then this will blow your mind....","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

Movie Review ;The master of cinematic grandeur, James Cameron, is back with another banger, Avatar: The Way of Water. Avatar (2009). Took a generation by storm with its never-seen-before visual spectacle in an unseen 3D format, and the box office number sparked to beat the long-standing ""Titanic"" (1997), again a Cameron film. Someone wants to bet against him for a sequel? Think again. You'll have to slap yourself. ""Aliens"" (1986; the prequel was by Ridley Scott, though), ""Terminator 2"" (1991, a groundbreaking sequel to his own groundbreaking classic), and now ""Avatar 2,"" Cameron hits a Hat Trick of fulfilling sequels. The first generation of cinema lovers told us about grandeur in films like ""A Trip To The Moon"" (1902), ""Cabiria"" (1914), ""Napolean"" (1927), ""Metropolis"" (1927), and ""Cleopatra"" (1934), the next generation told us about ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), the next group was mad about ""Star Wars"" (1977), ""ET: The Extra Terrestrial"" (1982), ""Jurassic Park"" (1991), and then came the generation of ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar,"" of which somehow I was part. Now I'll tell my next generation about the magnificent visual phenomenon of Avatar: The Way of Water.Avatar: The Way of Water takes place a decade after the first film. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) are living together, but they are a family of six now. They have two sons, one daughter, and one adopted daughter (of Dr. Grace) and continue to fight the sky people to prevent Pandora. Colonel Miles Quaritch's resurrected avatar (Stephen Lang) seeks vengeance on Jake and Neytiri and is willing to go to any length to get it. As the threat becomes more dangerous, Jake decides to leave Pandora and migrate with his family. The Sullys take shelter at the waterland called Metkayina, ruled by Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his wife, Ronal (Kate Winslet). Will Jake and his family manage to stop the Sky People by running away like this? Avatar: The Way of Water is all about this epic battle.Somehow, I have always believed that Cameron's high-budget films are not about good stories. Be it Aliens, Terminator, Titanic, or Avatar, they all had sort of decent stories, but yes, the ideas were brilliant. Cameron's extraordinary vision and unseen kind of visualisation always had us drooling. Avatar 2 isn't a great script, just like its predecessor, but I bet you can show me a more visually stunning experience. I know you can't, because there aren't any. The visual hysteria of Avatar (2009) has remained unbeaten for 13 years, only because James Cameron was busy making Avatar 2. I just can't imagine what would have happened if he had succeeded in cracking those groundbreaking non-glasses 3D effects. I wouldn't have left the auditorium then, I guess. The family is expanded here and so are emotions. Avatar 2 employs the same trick that Cameron employed in Avatar, and some of its elements may remind you of the first film. It's like the same treatment again, but in a different world. Avatar had Pandora and too many humans, while The Way of Water has too much water and fewer humans. Believe me, Metkayina is more spectacular than Pandora. You can drop your thousand bucks for the ticket purchase now.It's difficult to judge the performances of avatars, as they are such rare creatures that you don't see often. Something that bothers me while reviewing animated and other artificial films, too. Here, it's sort of a mix, and the actors have really had to put in extra effort to showcase avatars as humans. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaa, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, Brendan Cowell, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald have put their souls into making the characters look real. But anyway, who watches Avatar films for acting? Who are we kidding?Avatar: The Way of Water's biggest USP is its existence on the big screen. If you can really divide films into a new theme called ""visual masterpieces,"" then Avatar: The Way of Water is that film and the table topper too. I had to pinch myself a couple of times to believe that it was happening for real on the big screen. The visualisation is simply outstanding. Even the word ""outstanding"" doesn't do it justice. It looks impossible that someone can really create such a world and keep you amazed for three hours with so many amazing visuals. How can I name one or two? It's like a house full of surprises, and you just can't help loving every single moment on screen. You know, I have wondered why people make films in 3D when you can't show the 3D effects throughout the film. A genius like Nolan knew it, so he didn't make 3D films. Instead, he went for IMAX and created a visual spectacle. Other directors weren't that smart, but Cameron was living in a whole different world. He knew people couldn't watch two or three hours of film with glasses on because you couldn't offer every single second in 3D format. So, he created an unknown world that can only be viewed in 3D.Avatar: The Way of Water will leave you speechless with its astonishing spectacle. Something that you can't imagine. Only James Cameron can. Dear Jim, what soil are you made of? How do you manage to leave us in awe with your vision every single time? When was the last time this man disappointed us? Talk about visual effects and theatrical experience, and I'd say Avatar 2 is magnificent, fantastic, outstanding, crazy, insane, amazing, miraculous, unbelievable, and what not. Just assume every superlative word that comes to your mind. The way James has mixed those 30 fps and 60 fps frameworks is the greatest example of cinematic majesty. If you understand what it is, then you'll be blown away by it. The cinematography, the background score, the crystal-clear 3D effects, the sound design, the screenplay, and Cameron's extraordinary vision will all force you to stand up and clap for the entire team of Avatar: The Way of Water. Yet another groundbreaking visual phenomenon by master Camron-that's the least I can say. Don't miss the biggest motion picture event of our generation, no matter what the ticket costs. An IMAX 3D or 4DX experience will take you to another world for sure.RATING - 7/10*","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

What is most remarkable for this sequel is that you don't need to know about or remember any details from the first movie to dive into this story at all. The visual effects are incredibly made, and most worthwhile to watch in 3D. With love for details in its flora and fauna, this foreign world is brought to life. At the core, this movie is focused on the bond of family under challenging circumstances, as well as about adapting to a new environment.This film should be credited for resurrecting of one of the most memorably ferocious villains in recent cinematic history. It is also a very reflective story line about humankind or here referred to as the ""Sky People"" who invade and destroy unknown territories before trying to find peaceful ways. This film is the best this holiday season from its visual execution as well as from its storyline and is highly recommended to everyone.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

""National Geographic: Planet Earth""! This film here is ""J. Cameron: Planet Pandora""!There is NO script, no story!In the first Avatar, we had a ""sci-fi"" space version of ""Pocahontas"". Cameron simply copied the Pocahontas' story and he made it ""scient fiction"" with INCREDIBLE visuals (CGI)! But okay, I loved Pocahontas fairy tail, I didn't care about it....But the problem is, the Avatar 2 didn't have a story AT ALL. The film is simply a COPY-PASTE of the original Avatar, without so much details (as the original story), very similar, simply now the story is not in the big forest but in the ocean.INCREDIBLE CGIs... breath-taking, you can't understand/feel that these are NOT REAL but made with computer! Seriously, AMAZING visuals!...And that's all, no story at all.I SUPER INJOYED the film, no question about it. But like I said is like A DOCUMENTARY, not a film. Almost the 2/3 of the (3 hrs) film are simply documentary, with amazing visual - you don't follow any story, any plot, nothing.I super like it... but is not a film, is a VISUAL CGI SHOWCASE of what modern technology can create in our days!","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Incredible spiritual exercise by Cameron","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8743438/?ref_=tt_urv","Jithindurden","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46647047/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2022","James Cameron did it again! This is a visual masterpiece that may be even better than the first part. Beyond the breathtaking and landmark visuals and the on-point politics which only become more and more important, especially from the country it is coming from, there is a magic that Cameron creates here that touches your soul.While rewatching the first part from the theatres, I felt that part of it and realized there's so much more to it than what is on the surface. It is even more clear here. I used to think Cameron is wasting years of his life on these projects but I can really see why he dedicates it to these. Way of Water made me feel, how spiritual these films are and how much they would've meant to Cameron. My favourite parts in this film are in the middle when the Sully family finds and connects with the different lifeforms and the life of water. The mystery behind the character of Kiri really added to my understanding of the importance of the spiritual aspect in the film.While looking at these films we can think that if they wanted to show the issues with imperialism and capitalism, and the importance of environmentally sustainable indigenous life, they didn't have to make it happen in an alien environment and this is simply a way to explore the visuals and the commerce with it. But watching this has really changed my opinion on that. I really get why Cameron waited long years before making these films to achieve the complete vision he had. The basic concepts he had to tell have been told in various ways so many times. But they are not magical enough to reach the hearts of the viewers the way something as visually stunning as Avatar does. But beyond just the visualization, there are so many factors hindering that in other iterations of this story. The world is inherently capitalistic and so many of the depictions of the truths would be viewed in a sympathetic light but still considered by most as a necessity or something that cannot be stopped. Spirituality has become a corrupted term that is only used by those who want to extort money and power from people. The corruption in the collective psyche of the world doesn't allow anyone to believe in the triumph of a social uprising by the marginalized anymore. When it is viewed from a distance as an Alien world, where nature itself can communicate with you, provide everything needed and doesn't really have anything to gain from the globalization of the western world it becomes much more plausible to believe in it. It actually showcases a world where natural social evolution would have taken a species without interference from a handful of people who holds power. Even those who firmly believe against such a social evolution would start believing in the way these aliens live. Showing the Na'vi people being truly one with nature and finding the beauty of the world and its meaning with it makes the film the ultimate spiritual exercise by Cameron to tell his philosophy on life. And he doesn't abandon his fun-loving side to do that. He indulges in giving you exhilarating action scenes along with the way of water in this film. The improved 3D technology and the 48 fps make sure it's not a gimmick and instead make you feel you are in there with them experiencing it.This film pays homage to a lot of older films of Cameron and parenthood has been something he liked to dabble with a lot. Here that is the central point of the plot and why most of the events occur in the order they happened. Unlike some other films, when they speak about family here, it resonates and makes the proper impact.For me, Way of Water is even better than the first part. This is one of the best films of the year and I'm eagerly waiting for the sequels because I can really see that this is just the beginning.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

Arguably ever, throughout the history of cinema, expanding upon the first's narrative with a consistency, discipline, truthfulness & austere maturity that I can't help but find utterly staggering to witness.Vital lessons have been learned, amendments have been meticulously made & the tailored refinements result in a product that carefully improves upon the original astonishingly, developing both the ensemble & the software used to bring them to life efficaciously. For example, just as the reality that the world around us has evolved (both technologically & societally) since the initial film's explosion in to the stratosphere of pop culture, so has the story set upon the planet of Pandora & the characters housed within its vast, bioluminescent expanses have noticeably grown wiser, more weary in contrast to when we last saw them (understandably jaded from their traumatic experiences), adding beautifully realised layers of depth to their characterisations which enhance the narrative by providing it with a level of emotional complexity & moral ambiguity that its predecessor was perhaps devoid of, by comparison (though I never previously realised it before until now); rather than continuing with capturing the leads in their youth, naively pursuing reckless ambitions of devout martyrdom & glory amidst a sea of banshees & bullets, bravely endangering themselves for a righteous cause they strongly believe in, the writers alternatively make the inspired decision to highlight how the creation of a family unit can drastically alter one's responsibilities, allegiances & values, shifting the stakes considerably - with their actions lensed through the perspective of parenthood - bringing their earlier valiant behaviours in to disrepute & consequently theorising that given the alteration in conditions, perhaps stoically warring against perceived inevitability (in a futile quest for pride, retribution or liberation) isn't worth the price paid when the toll inflicted is no longer potentially just with your life, but it could equally be exacted upon the lives of those whom you hold dearest? Due to this, maybe it's even selfish & sanctimonious? Subsequently, many fascinating, philosophical questions are asked (though particular emphasis is placed upon theorising whether one's definition of selflessness changes, depending on the person's unique situation) & the lines between incorruptible good / bad become less distinguishable when we're confronted with the notion that these new relationships aren't necessarily strengths or weaknesses, nor is the premise as simple as we'd prefer it to be; inherent traits of love V evil give way to far more nuanced expressions of humanity (& inhumanity, as either side is capable of expressing both in their own authentic way, when provoked), allowing for dramatic tension & naturally occuring conflict - that's engaging & deliciously complicated - to arise magnificently from those subtle dynamics. Moreover, the script intelligently possesses a frank (& genuinely honest) acknowledgment that maintaining fragile peace (sought to preserve one's bloodline) ironically comes at a personal cost, just as much as disturbing it does - & therefore, the legendary director uses the 3+ hour runtime to forensically analyse which approach is plausibly more destructive in the long term (to their sense of self & surroundings, for is tranquility simply delaying the unavoidable?) & he dares to debate whether fighting is ultimately worth the risk, in the grand scheme of things - or perchance, if passivity / cowardice is the only defensible method of guaranteeing the preservation of native people & the longevity of their sacred traditions? In addition to that, the children are used remarkably to highlight how the legacy created from such profound, past achievements can haunt those who are destined to try & step out from under that dauntingly monumental shadow in the future. Hence, it's not just an exploration of a strained family dynamic (when put under immense pressure), but how one lives up to the standards set by our forebears, whose successes have set a seemingly insurmountable high standard, for which they find themselves hesitant as to whether they could realistically achieve parity with in the present. Ergo, they're not simply battling the worst of humanity & the physical manifestations of it, but they are equally in perpetual conflict with their own demons & insecurities, internally - fighting on a physical & emotional level. Quite poetic, don't you think - considering the conditions of this hotly anticipated release?Special acknowledgement must also be made to the notably naturalistic way in which the series has developed too; seldom do tales progress so organically, with such effective & relative ease, flourishing like a tree, with its branches protruding outwards; characters behave in surprisingly conceivable ways, respond consistently to events as they unfold (where we can sympathise with their choices) & never rely on forced, artificially constructed moments of convenient contrivance to justify furthering the plot; each member of the ensemble is relatable, distinguished, flawed & set on a tightly focused journey that incredibly never deviates from their clear & unique path. Thus, the reach of this spans far further than before & yet irrespective of Cameron's bulging scale & undeniable grandiosity, the heart & intimacy is still never lost amongst the chaos of the ensuing carnage. Due to this, the soul captured magically in ""Avatar"" is resultantly retained unquestionably throughout & by the credits, everyone's arcs have come to a rewarding conclusion (until the next chapter). Heck, I'd say this feels even more personal & sincere - evocatively daring to provoke & challenge the audience with audacious creative decisions that may genuinely unsettle (a major gamble for a production of this size & magnitude) but thematically, it's faultlessly coherent, echoing the relevant, pre-established ecological messaging, gifting viewers with an experience that seems satisfyingly accurate, given the trajectory of their collective advancements.Speaking of which, if you thought the Oscar winning pioneer was willing to relinquish his title as the embodiment of what it means to be a visionary, industry defining trailblazer... Think again; paired with his veteran ""Titanic"" & ""True Lies"" cinematographer Russell Carpenter, even solely from a technical point of view, the duo have visually revivified the theatre going experience in a manner which can only be described as ""seismic"" & it's hard to imagine that this hasn't substantially changed the game forever, henceforth. You have not witnessed real epic spectacle until you've laid eyes on the fruits of their labour. In the same way we were given a glimpse of what to expect from productions years in advance before, so too are we, presently. It is a total, ingenious reinvention.Can't believe I'm saying this for a third consecutive time but he's essentially presented us with another masterpiece, formed from the hands of a goliath, unstoppable storyteller, operating confidently at the height of his power, showcasing a project that's irrefutably awe inspiring, spinning so many plates in the air & yet miraculously not dropping a single one, pushing each & every creative department involved in the feature's inception to its limit until boundaries are broken & inconceivably transcended. See it on the biggest screen possible (IMAX 3D) & prepare yourself, as if you're like me, you'll quickly be resisting the urge to attend repeat screenings, frequently - merely to absorb it all more thoroughly. I cannot recommend it highly enough. There's so much to process & digest but I seriously adored it.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Good, but not as impactful as the first one","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8745270/?ref_=tt_urv","talking_about_movies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur93996015/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2022","I've waited years for this movie. James Cameron took 13 years to work on this franchise, so that he could make his shots as visually perfect as they can be. The 1st Avatar is one of my all-time favourites. Other than the visuals, that movie had a huge emotional impact on me. So I had a lot of expectations going into this one. I didn't know anything about the plot going in and it's better that way, so I won't go into the details here.So how is the movie? It's definitely a good movie. I don't think it's near as good as the first one. But it's a good movie for sure. The visuals, well they're amazing. Everyone knows that already now. But James Cameron has made a very interesting world here by expanding the Pandora culture. If you don't know already, Avatar 3 was filmed along side Avatar 2 and there are even 2 more films planned afterwards. So you shouldn't expect a concluded story from this one. Cameron has done a good job setting up a large world, some new characters, and unfinished conflicts between them for the future movies. There are also some unanswered questions I'm very curious about. And as I would expect from Cameron, he has directed this movie very well. He has this great ability of making some genuinely emotional scenes. Of course that's also because of the acting which is again great here. There is a very satisfying and well executed action scene towards the end that definitely has a couple of crowd-cheering scene.But I am just a bit disappointed from this movie. Frankly, it's a lot similar to the first one. Not just the story but also the structure. I mean there were many scene-to-scene parallels I could draw from the first one. And this movie just didn't feel that gutsy to me. I mean, definitely, I was on the edge of the seat for most of the time, since there were more characters to care about. But the movie never really showed me some dire consequences. But take the first movie, the scene where the hometree falls, that is one of the best scenes I've seen in cinema. That scene horrified me. Everything about that scene is perfect. That's the level for me, if you want to show something devastating. This movie has a similar scene, but it wasn't of the same scale, and I couldn't really get into this new world, as much as I did in the first movie. Don't get me wrong, this movie is gutsy too. But it's just not as gutsy as the 1st one. Also the pacing didn't seem perfect to me. They went by the first half hour very quickly, and some major developments happened there, so I wish they would've taken some time. Some of the characters from the original don't really seem the same to me. And I understand, it's been 13 years so a character like Jake has more responsibility in this one because of his kids. But Jake just didn't feel like Jake for 3 hours long.Look, you could make the argument that this movie is unoriginal just like the first one. Like, the father-son drama is definitely something similar to what we've seen countless times. But I'm not going to say that because avatar's strength has never been the story. It's the execution, the imaginative world, the emotion, the direction. In the end I would say this is a good movie. Look the first movie is very special to me so it's sort of unfair to compare it to that one. But the similarities in the movies are very evident. I would recommend you to watch it since it's a good movie and the crowd really seemed to enjoy it. I went with a friend and he too walked out satisfied.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The virtuoso director builds on his immense worldbuilding from ""Avatar (2009)"", showing that the past 13 years have been well worth the wait, narrating a dizzying visual epic of otherworldly proportions.We rejoin Jake Sully (now fully in the body of his Na'vi avatar) on the distant planet of ""Pandora"" where he has to comprehend the everchanging dynamics of his growing family while also coming to terms with new threats from human invaders, hell-bent on exploiting the mineral riches of his adopted homeland. Cameron builds on the story arcs of the characters he so intricately introduced in Avatar 1 and gives us a fair bit of new ones, who add to the rich tapestry of deeply relatable and emotional character journeys that we are invited to be a part of.Avatar 2's visual grandeur cannot be put into words, such is the sheer scale and enormity at which Cameron expands his world-building. The CGI and motion capture work that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us seems like child's play when compared to the jaw-dropping sets and stunt sequences that Cameron has dared to conceive in this lodestar of a project that is sure to become the benchmark for all further films in the sci-fi genre. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana deliver immense motion-capture-enhanced performances with Kate Winslet, Stephen Lang and Britain Dalton essaying solid supporting acts.James Cameron seems to revel in the weight of expectations placed on his shoulders by a generation of fans that grew up watching his exploits in ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)"" and ""Titanic (1997)"", and delivers on his promise of expanding on the Avatar Universe. With three more sequels planned in the franchise, one cannot even begin to fathom what the 68-year-old era-defining auteur has in store for us in the coming years. Experience ""Avatar: The Way Of Water"" in a theatre near you as soon as you can and if possible in IMAX! We can't recommend it enough!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The final battle felt like dragging a bit too much.This movie should easily win an Academy Award for visual effects and if there's any justice, they should give Cameron the Oscar for direction that was taken from him for the first movie.I watched the movie in stunning 3D and couldn't tell which parts changed to HFR - it was flawless.I give this movie 8/10 for the visuals and 5.5/10 for the rest.7/10 Go watch it on the big screen in 3D HFR.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

That's the only explanation I can find for this monstrosity. The script was laughably bad, like, bad sitcom kind of bad. I don't know how it makes sense that their kids, who have only grown up around other na'vi and na'vi children, have grown up as bratty, squabbling, western children. There's no culture left in this film, it's so americanised. It makes so little sense. The story, and I use that term in the loosest possible way, it's just a 3hr set-up for other films that is a waste of time and money, frankly. I really tried to care about the characters but they're so flat and cartoonish that I literally had no empathy for any of them, and I cry at adverts you can imagine how low the bar is for me. I know people are at least impressed with the visuals but I wasn't, it was too much, too over-the-top. That was until they got to the water and then it was better but even then there were some pretty rough cgi scenes. The first film was, and is, better in every way for me.

""The forests of Pandora hold many dangers ...........
but the most dangerous thing about Pandora is that ..........
you can grow to love her too much.""That is embarrassingly bad. I mean, when I googled to find that line I discovered there are people who think it's great, but it's just ... not.But it's pretty typical of the bad writing of his film.Way of Water takes up where the last entertaining but forgettable movie left off, with the Na'vi forced to once again confront the evil, violent, resource-scavenging humans.The plotting is weak - the main family moves for reasons that make absolutely zero sense, so everything that unfolds after is the result of sheer stupidity. But then, everyone else makes stupid decisions too, which is the only way this movie keep going (and going, and going, and going - how can a movie with so little story be so loooooooooooong).I suppose if you watched this in 3D in the theater the visuals were so overwhelming that they balanced out the bad storytelling, but I watched it on TV. But I would argue that a movie that's only good in 3D is not a good movie.There are some good things in this movie. Even in 2D the visuals are often stunning and the creature and environmental design are wildly imaginative. I liked the story thread of the girl connecting mystically with her new environment. And the action is well done and builds to big, over-the-top finish (although once again there's lots of stupidity, with some characters seemingly going out of their way to get killed for no good reason).The worst thing about this movie is the Academy embarrassed itself by nominating it for an Oscar for no other reason than it made lots of money.I'm tempted to say, ""if I had to do it over again I would watch it in the theater,"" except would I really pay prohibitive movie prices to watch an overlong, mediocre movie simply for the effects? I don't know.Perfectly watchable and very scenic, but it's a shame that with all that money the producers couldn't be bothered to do the minimum to make a genuinely compelling movie with engaging characters.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar, left an indelible mark on the world of cinema, captivating audiences with its groundbreaking visual effects and immersive storytelling. With the release of Avatar: Way of the Water, the highly anticipated sequel, fans eagerly awaited another exhilarating journey into the fantastical world of Pandora. However, despite the lofty expectations, the film falls short, delivering a lackluster experience that fails to recapture the magic of its predecessor.Plot and Pacing:
One of the major shortcomings of Avatar: Way of the Water lies in its plot and pacing. While the original film showcased a richly developed narrative that seamlessly blended action, romance, and environmental themes, the sequel feels disjointed and haphazard. The story lacks a clear focus, meandering between various subplots that fail to engage or captivate. As a result, the film feels bloated and overly long, dragging the viewer through a series of convoluted twists and turns that ultimately lead to an unsatisfying climax.Character Development:
Another disappointment in Avatar: Way of the Water is the lack of meaningful character development. In the first film, viewers were introduced to relatable and complex characters who underwent personal transformations throughout the story. However, the sequel fails to build upon these foundations, relegating the characters to mere caricatures of their former selves. Their motivations are poorly defined, and their actions lack depth, leaving the audience disconnected from their struggles and triumphs. It is disheartening to witness the regression of beloved characters who were once so integral to the success of the franchise.Visual Effects:
One aspect where Avatar: Way of the Water does excel is in its visual effects. As expected from a James Cameron film, the CGI is top-notch, and the vibrant world of Pandora is brought to life with stunning detail. However, while the visuals are impressive, they alone cannot salvage the film from its narrative shortcomings. It feels as though the focus was placed primarily on the visual spectacle, sacrificing a compelling story in the process. While the eye-catching visuals momentarily capture attention, they ultimately become hollow without a strong and engaging narrative to support them.Environmental Themes:
One of the defining features of the original Avatar was its exploration of important environmental and conservation themes. It served as a cautionary tale about the destructive nature of human greed and the need to protect our planet's fragile ecosystems. Regrettably, Avatar: Way of the Water fails to build upon these themes in a meaningful way. The environmental message is diluted and lacks the impact and urgency that made the first film so thought-provoking. Instead of inspiring audiences to reflect on their relationship with the natural world, the sequel feels like a missed opportunity to continue the conversation about environmental stewardship.Conclusion:
Avatar: Way of the Water ultimately disappoints, failing to recapture the magic of its predecessor. With a disjointed plot, shallow character development, and a diluted environmental message, the film falls short of its lofty expectations. While the visual effects are undoubtedly impressive, they cannot compensate for the lack of a compelling narrative. It is disheartening to witness the decline of a franchise that once held so much promise. Ultimately, Avatar: Way of the Water is an underwhelming and forgettable addition to the Avatar universe.","17 out of 22 found this helpful.

The first Avatar movie was called ""Dances with Thundercats""; pronouncing that faux title makes me laugh every time.Faux title is certainly true, but never doubt James Cameron; even if the story he tells is fairly derivative. All the stories we read and watch in movies is always derived from obscure materials, so why complain about how derivative the story is, if it can be well-told with compelling visual-aural presentation and dialogue to hold our attention?The sequel The Way of Water improves upon the first movie in almost every way. It already establishes the world of Pandora. At first when the movie opens, I wasn't ""impressed"".But when the humans ""arrive"" in ascent from the sky to depict space, it made my jaw drop in amazement, through the clever use of 3D and HFR effects. This is James' vision as announcing his return to film-making after 13 years of absence.James even employs the use of ""reverse POV"" reminiscent of GoPro in at least two scenes that are just as immersive and also emotionally invested in the characters.While it's true the dialogue is sometimes trite, what more do you want from the sequel that tries its hardest to expand the story to go further where we would least expect?This particular movie sort of suffers from the 'sequel syndrome,' that can't be helped, as repeating the story (even that James had to discard the script, which may be Avatar 1.5, after one long year of work, because it doesn't meet his strict expectation since it was more of the same story as deja vu). What lends this movie its ultimate strength is the astonishing and occasionally surrealistic visual effects, better seen with 3D (with or without HFR).One minor quibble I have with the movie, despite its amplified visual presentation as the director intended, is that HFR (high frame rate) is not effective for fast-paced action scenes -- especially in the third act -- that suffers ""fast forward syndrome"" as distracting and therefore confusing. James would be wise to try scaling down to about 30 frames per second for action scenes, or otherwise 48 HFR in some scenes look fast forwarded like on the state of the art VCR playing the videocassette.That complaint aside, the newly expansive story -- even if it repeats itself in some way through the clever yet almost contrived character ""retcon"" -- lends to ample emotional investment in the characters, which is stronger than the first movie. Towards the ending, it leads to the payoff that is rather moving (in particular the new character Kiri with astonishing preternatural power).This fresh ""retcon"" twist belies James Cameron's genius, as not only the master of visual optimization but also experiential (trying as hard as the five credited storytellers could to keep the sequel syndrome at bay) storytelling with appropriate emotional heft, without the risk of contrived manipulation.Go see Avatar: The Way of Water in the best presentation you could, even drive tens of miles farther to see it, whether in 3D regular or IMAX with or without HFR (I suggest without HFR because of fast forward effect during some quick-moving combat scenes), whether in HDR (Dolby Cinema 2D or 3D), whether in 4D, DBOX and ScreenX.These particular presentation choices amplify the moviegoing experience, what it truly means to experience cinema as the filmmakers intend that the streaming and home video technology (even state of the art projector) cannot hold the candle to, with audience participation in their varied reactions such as sound of awe, cheers and even audible cry, that makes it even better.Don't take a compromise like skipping to wait for video to rent (especially since 3D blu-ray video is petering out with the manufacturers officially phasing out 3-D capable Ultra HD TV, which is why I keep my 2015 Sony UHD TV with 3D feature to hold longer) for less.Because Avatar The Way of Water improves upon the original that lends to engrossing story with well-fleshed out characters, even if writing feels a little episodic and a little standard (hence sequel syndrome), with astounding visual effects (like the aforementioned descent from space), in the best presentation such as 3D, it feels like cinema is alive and well, in the era of tiresome ""murky"" VFX-laden superhero movie sludge called capes---.**** out of 4.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

""Forgettable"" would be the category Avatar WotW would fall in. I wouldn't even call it an entertaining movie. Its way too long to be enjoyable to sit through. Lots of people give it a 7, I'm giving it a 6. Because the movie clearly tries to be intense, but falls so disappointingly short. The storyline is so bland and boring. Dialogue is typical action flicky. No wit or smarts or funny banter that great shows written by great writers would exhibit. By 2023's standards that is really, really low, and thats not expecting alot.Perhaps it put too much focus on the visuals of Pandora, which is really stunning. From the ecosystem to the creatures and all their intricate patterns to the badass futuristic tech of the humans.But the formula is not there. Avatar 1 had the same thing but better, and truely I rather just watch a re-screening than the sequel and enjoyed myself more.If you love Avatar, you would be really disappointed in this. I would only recommend this to people who have too much time or just want to see how the next chapter of the story is written and don't mind the disappointment.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The action sequences, emotions, cinematography, score, and so much more came together so incredibly to make a truly memorable movie. In my opinion it far surpassed the original and also sets up sequels really well, as we now know the characters better, and I'm excited to rewatch this before the third movie comes out.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The whale like creatures are so well done, indeed everything is such a craftwork of good (ie well produced and relevant) effects. The world created is amazing and the writer created a real depth, bringing the audience completely into it.The story? Well, it's ok. But the characters are nice, and despite being blue creatures, it's easy to identify with them. I think it was well paced and well balanced. There IS alot of action, but it wasn't bland action, but intriguing and interesting... for example hunting those whale like creatures.Though Avatar 1 was ground breaking, I would credit this as being an achievement in film history in the real depth of the world that you get immersed in, with almost all of it being well mixed makeup/CGI (as good CGI should be, you won't even think about it). This film should be on everyone's watch list. Won't be the best film you'll ever watch, but I'd guess everyone will enjoy it.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

How was my overall experience?Ans. Pretty nice, barring the unsophisticated group of people who sat just behind me, it was all satisfactory. Watching it in 3D does add up a lot to the all-around experience.Q. How does it compare against the Original? Is it better or worse?Ans. Many might disagree, but I would still choose the first part over this sequel. Despite this having an abundance of jaw-dropping visuals and some excellent world-building, the first one delivers a better narrative on the whole.Q. Speaking of Story, does the length of almost three and a half hours becomes overbearing?Ans. At times, yes! Especially in the second act where they have taken an excessive amount of time to build up the world around and under the waters and in there the slower editing does take a toll on its momentum. Now If you are well accustomed to prolonged screenwriting, you would have no issue whatsoever sitting through this whole thing, or else, be prepared, now you can't say, you didn't get your warning.Q. Tell me something about the performances and the characters!Ans. Each one of the actors performed to the very best of their abilities, But for me, it was the kids who had stolen the show! Especially Kiri (voiced by Sigourney Weaver); she was amazing.Q. Lastly, do I recommend this feature?Ans. Yes, absolutely, this is a cinematic marvel, one that is supposed to be witnessed on the biggest screen, one that shouldn't be missed.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was a wild experience as I have never seen such amazing CGI in a film. James Cameron, the director, then announced he was making 3-4 sequels to Avatar which was kind of baffling. 13 years later, we finally get a sequel. Was the sequel worth the wait?Firstly, the visuals of this movie are somehow even more amazing than the first film. The forest of Pandora looks more stunning than it did 13 years ago; the advance in technology is very evident. The scenes in the water look gorgeous and so real that it's hard to believe it is CGI at times. One thing with the first movie was that it felt like live-action people were in a green screen room. Avatar: The Way of Water is mostly CGI with live-action blended in. We see live-action characters move in the same scene as CGI characters and interact with one another like living beings. It didn't give that green-screen feeling, which was awesome. I also love the world-building and design of the world. There are water-based Navi clans with looks and customs that are different from the forest Navi. You can see it in their skin colour and the design of their hands and tails. The sea creatures also have great designs with their own rules and how they operate. It was clear a lot of thought was put into everything.The original 2 main characters, Jake and Neytiri, return from the 1st film but they are not the main focus this time. The main characters are their kids with Sigourney Weaver returning but playing as one of those kid characters instead. I was a little worried as kid characters tend to be annoying but I think the writer did a good job of making the kids not completely annoying. Sigourney is surprisingly convincing as a young kid and I was interested to see more of her character in the future. I think James succeeds in making us care more about these new characters than he did in Avatar 1. Jake, despite not being at the forefront this time, has his character arc. He is no longer the fearless leader he was in the 1st film as he now has 4 kids to take care of. His priority is different and he struggles with that. Stephen Lang also returns as the antagonist, Colonel Miles, again despite dying in the 1st film. He was very one-dimensional in the 1st Avatar but here they do try to give him some more depth which I appreciate.However, Neytiri is unfortunately very sideline in this sequel. She is barely relevant until the end of the movie and even then, she doesn't have any character arc. If anything, I feel like her character somehow feels worse here. One thing I struggled with in the 1st film was remembering names including that of the main characters. Unfortunately, I still have this issue in The Way of Water. This is thanks to the fact that a character's name only ever seems to be mentioned once and never again which makes it difficult to remember anyone. For example, Kate Winslet of Titanic fame is in this movie but I wouldn't be able to tell you what her character's name was for the life of me.In terms of the story, it's very simple and by the book. It is about the kids learning the customs of a clan and struggling to fit in which sounds awfully similar to the 1st film or a high school drama. The plot works fine but it is very bland and predictable. Every cliché and trope you see from a coming-of-age story is here. The movie is also really long with a run time of 192 minutes. I'm not sure the plot justified that run time as there were many moments where a lot doesn't happen and could've been cut to reduce the runtime. James Horner, the original composer of Avatar, passed away and was thus replaced by Simon Franglen. Simon does a serviceable job but the music score is just not very memorable compared to Jame's music score. The best soundtrack in The Way of Water is the ones that were reused.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water is a proper cinematic experience. Yes, the movie's plot and characters aren't that memorable but the visuals are truly amazing. In an era where it feels like we get a lot of poorly made CGI, it is a breath of fresh air to have a movie that has beautiful-looking CGI for what feels like the entire movie! Watching in it cinema with IMAX 3D was a terrific experience and it is the best way to watch Avatar: The Way of Water. I'm thoroughly looking forward to the sequels!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

There are shades of the Abyss, one of my favorite Cameron movies, and the message is an important one. But man, does it take it seriously, and does it ever drag on! There is no reason this story needs over three hours to be told. Even two hours would be stretch for this narrative. And with that, it was hard to really engage or emphasize with the characters. It's a spectacle, but one that only needs one viewing.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie also features some of the most amazing CGI facial expressions I've seen to date. The underwater scenes, which make up the bulk of the film, are nothing short of breathtaking.However, what makes the film fall short as a sequel to Avatar is the narrative structure which feels disjointed. The original Avatar had a fairly basic story but it was well-executed whereas the story in Avatar 2 is punctuated by a constant shift between different characters and subplots. While Avatar 2's story is still engaging on some level, it's not as cohesive as in the original Avatar and if anything, most of the film feels like a setup for future sequels where things will finally wrap up. Regardless, the movie is still worth it for the visual spectacle alone and James Cameron once again cements his status as the King of the Sequels.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story was pretty lame, what happens isn't really the problem, it's more so the script and the actual telling of the story. The whole first half of the movie was summarizing between the end of the first movie until this new story, which was insanely unnecessary.The way they did it, just wasn't very good, not saying the first movie was amazing but it was better told and had a better plot. Nothing really happened until just before the fighting started.

However, the story of this sequel was pretty much a rehash of the story of the 2009 film -- about the abuse and destruction of colonization. It was the story of Pocahontas all over again, for which the first one was already roundly criticized before. As they were in the first film, these unsettling scenes were painful and maddening to watch.Furthermore, they added a prolonged, sadistic and harrowing scene of men ganging down on and killing a giant sea creature. The whole scene was dismal and disgusting in its graphic display of methodical cruelty to animals, reminding viewers of all the unnecessary and wasteful hunting of elephants and rhinoceroses that happens to this day. Seeing the nasty head poacher get his deserved (albeit grisly) comeuppance was a satisfying thrill.There is now a rich aspect of family relationships and adolescent psychology involved in the story giving this more dramatic weight. About the struggles experienced by the middle child, the adopted child, the different child, a child who does not know who his father was, a child whose father people despised, a child pressured with too much expectations. It was a familial conflict that would figure in the climactic confrontation.James Cameron's estimated budget of the whole film passed USD350M, and all the spectacular special effects all that money went to can clearly be seen onscreen. This film is practically an animated film already, with all the motion-capture Na'vi characters there instead of the actual actors. Aside from Edie Falco as the General, the only real human characters we see were those nameless soldiers who get killed in the battles.The biggest innovation in this film was the technology for motion capture for underwater scenes, something that has never been done before. Cameron really went all the way in creating a CGI marine biosphere for these Na'vi creatures to interact with water creatures big and small, sacred and mystical. Seeing the callous ways humans invade and destroy such natural beauty and balance sent out a potent pro-environment message.","19 out of 43 found this helpful.

I mean I still cannot believe it even after coming out from the cinema tonight I cannot believe it. I never liked HFR movies, I always had a soft spot for 3D but whenever I saw a HFR movie it sincerely disappointed me. Here the trick is that the entire movie is in 48 FPS and the calmer scenes have double frames achieving ""24"" FPS rather. Coming back to Pandora in the beginning an as a premise is narratively dull, and borderline cringeworthy sometimes but this is a similar blockbuster to the original Avatar so all the environmentalist and anti colonial themes/narratives will be similarly easy to ingest if rather not pushed full frontally exposed to your face. However building the world and characters around it kicks in with a better swing and swoosh (sploosh rather!?) after the first 1/3-rd of the movie and indeed it really shows the way of water. (seriously chef kiss!) Visuals are stunning again, WETA did an amazing CGI work here. The frames are so detailed and vibrantly vivid I had my jaw dropped.. only the explosions were still a bit cartoony unfortunately but did not distract too much to be honest. I really liked that this movie wasn't only about Jake & Neytiri anymore and had a good setup for plenty of supporting characters, Kiri especially I really liked how they treated her in the script.Could tell all once again what has been told before me and probably will be after, but seriously if you thought Top Gun: Maverick was a magnificent movie sequel (basically retelling the same story in a new cape) you will not be surprised that Avatar: The Way of Water double downs successfully on everything. Seriously, Cameron did it... he really did it... even if it took 13 years for him to do so... Mind-Blown....","14 out of 30 found this helpful.

Re-watched the first one in 3D (as it was meant to be seen) then this sequel. So many unexpected things happened (if you can manage to dodge Internet spoilers), and the story was well done. They take time with storytelling, not the lack of it you see in Marvel movies of today etc.James Cameron's films are always great. Storytelling is very well done despite what other reviewers say (most of them couldn't write a decent sci-fi to save their lives). This one is based on water, the other films will be very different. Can't wait to see.James Cameron has a great interest in oceans and marine life, films telling stories that include marine life in depth is very rare indeed. Planets in our universe or even earth with most of the surface full of water (one of the most abundant substances in the Universe) feels even more rare. When you think about it alien life would naturally most likely occur within water of some kind. Why not tell a story about it.Of all his films The Abyss (1989) was very criticized as others have done with this film. However even today (2023) if you go back and watch The Abyss Directors Cut with James Cameron's original ending its a very good film! It has held up extremely well. Interestingly it has the exact same IMDB rating as this film as of today.Critics are harsh...The Goonies is a great film. Years ago I looked and IMDB had it at 6.1 our of 10. Today its risen to 7.7 out of 10? Hmmm guess some films are like wine, maybe people finally realize their worth after some age. ;)","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I particularly loved the new characters such as Kiri (which i believe it's Pandora's messiah or sort of), even thought the voice of a 70 year old woman is a bit off for a teenager. The production is even more brilliant than the first movie, they did not only create a whole new language with grammar rules but even a sign language, which is a great form of inclusivity.

The Visual Spectacle: Needless to say this film is probably the first one in recent memory that truly blurs the line between what is real and what is not. Enhanced by the amazing 3D, the audience is transported yet again to the lush jungles and oceans of Pandora! You forget that what you are watching was filmed on a production set and believe that what you are seeing was filmed on location!2. Family: The Way of Water has a refreshingly strong theme of family. It is almost as if the film had grown up with the people that saw the first film who by now probably have families of their own and can relate on this theme. Each of Jake's children had their own story to tell and the 3hr running time lended itself well to allow for them to develop their character.3. Environmentalism: Most are aware of Cameron's love for the oceans, and we get to see just how much in this film. From beautiful ocean flora and fauna to heart wrenching scenes inspired by what's happening right here on Earth, Cameron makes us care for this new dimension of Pandora and by extension our own Planet Earth's oceans.I believe these 3 themes are the core pillars of why this film stands above the first film and sets up a whole series of films in the coming years. People who see this in the big screens are sure to keep coming back for more!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

In general, I would suggest watching the first one again to anyone seeing this one, just to jog your memory being that it was 13 years since the last one debuted.

There are noticeable parts that are there for ""the movie to happen"". And once you are done with it, you realize it barely makes a dent in the grand scale of the universe and things barely change.. but now you are knee-deep in characters, interactions, motivations and lore.Personally, I think this is better than the original.. and it does a much better job at restarting an old franchise (than Star Wars' The Force Awakens) by focusing on laying great groundwork and planting the many seeds for what is to come (you can even start to imagine what the next scripts will look like) over telling a grand story from the get go. Having said that.. you barely feel the 3 hours, you forget you are in a theater, and you find yourself breathing and holding your breath with the characters!! Everything they created is used and then some. With impressive layers of immaculate visuals, actions and mesmerizing movements. Excellent performances by everyone, and quite satisfying developments. The phrase ""greater than the sum of its parts"" is quite apt for Avatar 2. So, seeing 5 credited writers is not so shocking to me! Thankfully, much better writers than Cameron alone. And like Maverick, it's a movie that knows what to deliver to its audience and on what makes movies worth seeing.Would easily recommend it! 3D not necessary, as the script and execution are good enough without the gimmick.. but might as well splurge and go to the biggest screen possible and all that.It is a solid 7 in my book (okay story and pacing), but the visuals are too impressive (so 7.5 in my heart).","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

One we already seen a dozen time. It is pochahontas, Danse with wolves or every outcast trying to integrate tribal people while his kind, the evil civilized white want to exterminate them and extract ressources or conquer the lands.Despite that, James Cameron give us a spectacular cinematographic experience. The music, the world building, the culture. Every little details are tought of to completely immerse the audience into Pandora... The story telling is pretty straight forward, we see things coming a mile away. But we are riding along like hypnotized by the world created for Us.12 years later, Cameron did it again. Very predictable script, but it manage to get us enjoy the 3h30 ride and beeing in Awe toward this incredible spectacle. It is more about Jake Sully 'family' this time and once again, they are outcast in a new tribe trying to learn new ways. This add a whole new dimension to this world. By the end, we have a glimpse of what Cameron will be undertaking for the next 4 movies. And if he is doing this right, this could easily become one of the biggest franchise ever. I dont doubt Cameron capacity to take us where he want to go. This director know how to tell a story, even if it is one we have heard before. He is that good.We shall wait and see.I, for one, was glad to come back to Pandora.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I watched it teicw, just so that I could give a balanced review, initially I thought it was terrific, my second viewing exposed some of the film's shortcomings. It's an improvement over the first in terms of CGI and special effects, not that they were bad in the last, but technology has moved on since then, but the plot, that's the issue, it's not as exciting or gripping as it could have been, and it's a little harder to engage and empathise with the characters. It's a little more family drama, as opposed to sweeping Sci Fi epic.Watched 12.12.22

I felt it was too long (like this one) and the story was very basic. This is more of the same. It's clear Cameron loves his creation, but the human characters are weak and evil for the most, while 99 percent of the Navi are noble and good. It's really more of a the evil expanding west and the noble savages, a story that's been done before. The major flaws are; so Earth (which is dying, an old, old trope in SF) has all this technology and they can't find another planet? Humans can't even breath the Pandoran atmosphere, but they're going to invade and transplant humanity? All that tech and they can't terraform mars or venus? Can't find another habitable world? Of course then, there won't be a story. And, if we look at human history, natives with spears and bows and arrows ALWAYS win over technology, right? (See: INDIAN WARS, AMERICAN WEST). So, yes, Pandora looks alive (I didn't see it in 3-D) but the story is weak. I lost a lot of respect for Cameron when he put his weight behind the horrible Terminator: Dark Fate, and this hasn't helped. Likely I won't take the 3 1/2 hours of my life this took to ever watch it again.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is considered as a new beginning for this franchise and Cameron was able to further develop the script and characters and remove the weakness of the first movie. He has also created one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences.Plot-wise, Avatar 2 is just a remake of its sibling. But add 10 years effort of one of the most talented directors, boom, we are pulled into a magic world.Watch it in IMAX 3D, even if it means you must take half a day leave from your work. It provides out of the world experience, literally.Some people forget that movies have to be entertaining too and not just crazy plots. Avatar 2 is entertaining the whole way through and I really recommend seeing this at the movies especially in 3D. I will watch every Avatar James Cameron makes.As James Cameron prepared his sequels to his mega-success Avatar, one of the more intriguing aspects of the production was that Stephen Lang, who played the first film's villain, Colonel Miles Quaritch, would be returning for Avatar: The Way of Water and the rest of the franchise.Review by: Anil Chouhan.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I even stopped watching any movie more than once. But this one ooohhh I've seen it 4 times already in 3 weeks and I still want to watch it again!Everytime I watch it I get transported to Pandora and it's worth every second and penny. No other movie gives me these feelings. Everytime I care more about the characters and I enjoy it more.The first time I was a bit disappointed about it for not having a more complicated plot but then I realized it doesn't need a more complicated story, because that would make it more difficult to just let go and enjoy Pandora's flora and fauna. And yet the story is complex enough. Come on, an entire alien planet full of intelligent species and then their conflict with stupid greedy entitled humans.I'm so tired of human movies. They're all the same. So tiring. I wish there were more films full of imagination with intelligent civilizations living in their home planets and with their own issues way way different than humans in all aspects. I'm tired of horror sci-fi without any science and lots of blood. Tired of apocalyptic movies full of blood. I won't even mention the dumb superhero capitalist films or romcoms. I guess I did. Sorry for the rant.Back to Avatar, AMAZING! I've watched it 4 times and I'll watch it a few dozen times more if I can.Sorry for any typos or mistakes, English is my 3rd language.

It's a shame about this film as the first hosted a great platform however the 2nd certainly fails to deliver.

The attention to detail is incredible, and the world that the movie creates is a sight to behold. The creatures are beautifully crafted, and the landscapes are mesmerizing.The storyline is decent and has a message about the importance of caring for our planet. It's a nice reminder about how humans tend to exploit nature for their gain, and the consequences that come with it. The movie touches on some thought-provoking themes that leave you with much to think about.One minor issue I had with the movie was that it felt a bit long and somewhat exploited. The pacing could have been improved, and some scenes felt like they were there just to extend the runtime. However, this is a minor issue, and it doesn't take away from the overall experience of the movie.Overall, Avatar 2 is a great movie that is worth watching. It's a nice mix of entertainment and awareness and is suitable for the whole family. The stunning visuals, decent storyline, and thought-provoking themes make it an enjoyable experience.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

And this is the best Mr. Cameron had to offer. The way of water might be ground breaking in visual effects, no one is denying that, but imagine what this film could have done with actual screen writers. The director's intentions are noble as he's trying to give a (not so subtle)message in this film, to guard our home. But I would have loved to see the other sides point of view. Why are the Humans so desperate to mine this planet? Considering the technology that was show cased in the film(and the first) you would think we would have discovered more planets than Pandora. Planets that are less trouble and perhaps one that wouldn't cost as many lives. I've already put more thought into this film than the writers have. Despite some negativity J. Cameron has gotten lately, it's hard to argue that he's one of the best Directors of our generation, not to mention he might have the best track record when it comes to sequels. But this film was simply put, disappointing.P. S.

The greatest character of all is the world itself, Pandora is the most memorable locale in movie history and the expansion of the world and it's lore was brilliant. Add to that some of the best action sequences ever made and you've got a landmark moment in movie history. Whatever you do, DON'T see this in 2D because you'll be robbing yourself of one of the greatest cinema experiences you'll ever have.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

Big Jim has yet again managed to defy the haters and critics by constructing a visual masterpiece unlike much anything ever put to screen. The story is definitely not masterpiece material, but it's solid enough to make this a very worthwhile venture back into the world of Pandora.The underwater scenes in particular are a sight to behold and you really can feel the movie magic that Cameron tries to conjure up. He definitely takes a leisurely stroll through the middle third of this film, but it picks up dramatically in the final act. Cameron crafts some of the most visceral and kinetic action scenes that I've ever seen. Yes, the story is a bit hokey, but you know what, it's pretty earnest and works for the most part. My one big issue would be that it's never really explained why the Marines are so hellbent on devoting all this time and money in getting Jake Sully, other than just blanket revenge.The Way of Water is the success that Cameron and the movie industry needed it to be and I for one will happily jump on the next ship heading out to Pandora.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's honestly disappointing how such an expensive movie could not hire decent writers to actually develop a plot and good characters. Some of the acting from the teenagers wasn't that good either.

The film does well to simultaneously make it feel like you've never left Pandora, but also to remind you of the characters and catch you up on the new ones, including Jake Sully (Worthington) and Neytiri (Saldana)'s four kids - eldest son Neteyam (Flatters), Loak (Dalton), Kiri (Weaver) & little Tuk (Bliss). The explanation for Kiri being Grace (Weaver's original character)'s daughter is not clear at all, but Colonel Quaritch (Lang) is back, with a far simpler explanation - he and his marine team were cloned on Earth and sent back in Navi Avatars.Once we re-establish that humans are the worst and still trying to colonise Pandora and exploit it's resources, Sully & Neytiri take their family away from the fighting to the coral atolls/islands of the Metkayina tribe, led by Tonowari (Curtis) & Ronal (Winslet). This creates some interesting dynamics, but also introduces a whole new underwater ecosystem for the camera to explore. Probably the most impressive thing about these films is how Cameron makes everything seem so real and all the creatures plausible - all seeming like slightly different evolutionary branches of Earth's creatures. The 'whales' are particularly remarkable.It's good to see a little comedy thrown in (& Aussies/Kiwis), with Jermaine Clement & Brendan Cowell. However, just when the film seems like it might be a repeat of the first, the second act turns it on it's head and focus on the inter- and intra-family dynamics and has a narrower focus on how the ocean-dwelling Navi interact with their environment. This serves the film well, as rather than try to fight every human colonist and machine, it is more intimate and you get to care for the main characters by the end. Bring on the next 3!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have 30 years of work experience with WDI, working with 3D video projection among other things. For some inexplicable reason, Cameron chose to economize, only presenting action scenes in HFR, and the venue clearly did not have the skills to properly set up their 3D projection equipment. The image quality was terrible!!! The quality of these shortcomings plus the $20 ticket price left me very frustrated. If Cameron cannot do better than this, I will not bother with the sequels.

Acting: 7/10Overall 8/10A workmate said that he was asleep for most of this movie. Everyone else I spoke with however, loved it!It starts with a small recap of the previous movie as it has been a number of years since that installment.The special effects are why this movie works. If it had been a story about conflict between human nations, it would be quite ordinary and could be likened to similar events in other movies. However, this definitely is not. It is very beautiful, scenic and visually disturbing with the ugly side of conflict.Aspects to the story are not very original and a little predictable. But are nonetheless done well and carried by the visual effects.Some of the characters are very memorable with notable acting. But being that alot of the cast are young people, you can expect a few scenes to be a little cringe. Plus the accents are a little strange to listen to. But if that was the intention for alien accents, then well done!If you are fascinated by alien worlds with conflict, then this movie is for you! Otherwise, wait for the small screen and watch it at your leisure! It is a long movie and almost feels like a TV mini series back to back.Enjoy!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

For me, it's a masterpiece and films like this should be seen in the cinema, that's what cinemas are made for. If you have the chance to look at it in Imax, be sure to see it, because it unfolds its full potential. The 3d and cgi is not oppressive like some of the other films here it is very pleasant. What you notice, you really shot under water, you can totally see that in the film. The film is multifaceted and deals with many topics, such as family or how you feel, being an outsider and much more. The film builds up slowly and doesn't change too quickly, you take your time for the individual characters. Thanks to James Cameron for this great film and the 190 minutes fly by, rather not as long as you would imagine. I forgive, a 10/10 because everything fits, I'll watch it again on Wednesday in Imax in 3d. Watch him in the cinema, on the biggest screen your cinema has to offer.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was pretty much what I expected basically carrying on in the same vein as before.....and I had absolutely no problem with that,I was engrossed from start to finish, there was always something to marvel at,on screen. The kids,I thought were great providing numerous 'Newt' moments,(..Cameron fans will know what I mean..),and although the eco messaging was admittedly quite heavy handed any objective observer would have to agree with it...humans have been and continue to be so incredibly destructive to the Natural World.

A new resource built for exploitation for humans to enter into new world. Main characters from before have no real impact in the story except towards the end used for action. Unnecessary filler character called Sypder with no real loyalty or value in the movie. Despicable setup of villan for next movie as well. Unresolved mysterious ""daughter"" to be setup for sequel.

But well at least it's already here, and I am glad I watched another long Avatar film yet surprising underwhelming compared to the first one yet still satisfying to watch.This long satisfying sequel is great but not without shortcomings. I find things here on a smaller scale and less grandeur from the first movie despite showing us great new waters of Pandora. Yet it's story closely follows similar pattern as the first one. Yes, it's a sequel so it should be obviously but they should have made it not so obvious. Sadly it's story it lacks depth than the first one. This is just more of simple revenge story plot line to me and seems to be it will still be for another round.Nonetheless, Avatar Way of Water didn't disappoint us on showing another side of Pandora. It's spectacular looking great seas and underwater world of creatures. And that is why it is still the Avatar movie we all know from the first one.I wish 3 and 4 will be on a as much grandeur as the first one. And a more deeper story rather than a simple revenge story plot line. I really like seeing more of Pandora and their mysterious ways. I'm sure there will be after watching Way of Water, as it seem they are setting up a some strong bases on this sequel that are yet to be explored and explained in the coming sequels.More Avatar movie please...","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The middle part of the story was a bit bland and felt unnecessary.I can't help feeling that the leads of Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana didn't really come across as the heroes of the piece but almost like supporting characters.

But enough about the visuals, there are more of those strengths. As for the music, I miss James Horner, but that doesn't mean I'm dissatisfied, his successor does a respectable job and basically follows similar tones. It's probably the case with the characters that there are a lot of them, but they all work functionally and memorably, that is, with one exception in the form of General Ardmore, she was probably the only one who didn't suit me at all and found me uninteresting, I guess the return of Selfridge would be better. If I had to choose between this or Part 1, in the end I'd probably choose Part 1. Because emotionally it's stronger and generally plays more with emotions, but I can't take points away from the newer one because it's the middle part of the saga and on emotions they usually play the first or last parts, so I have no problem with that here. Of course, James Cameron, as the master of sequels, again did a brilliant job overall as a director. 2. Avatar is a brilliant blockbuster that must be seen by everyone who liked it at least a little. 1.

Movies like this are not ""cinema"", exactly. It's something else. When you can buy tickets for seats that move with the action, it's something else. (like imagine an interactive novel, with surround sound ambient sound effects and piped in scents, to match what you read...it's no longer just literature, it's something else).This is more of a ride and a sensory experience than cinema. In 3D, This feels more like a long DisneyWorld attraction than a movie. The frame rate changes are distracting. Alternating from smooth ""soap opera"" high def video to occasionally looking actually filmic and realistic.Unlike, say, The seventh seal or the godfather, The story and characters here could be adequately summarized in a sentence or two, with little to no finer resolution required. One could make the same argument for the first Star Wars, i suppose.But telling a simple story in an epic way doesn't necessarily diminish the piece. Or does it? In this case the story and characters are not so much archetypes (as in Star Wars) as they are just SO thin and shallow as to be perfunctory, generic and ultimately devoid of what is necessary to be compelling: relatability.Star Wars was thin, to be sure, but the archetypes and story were so classic, and so universal as to be somehow relatable and human, in a way that Avatar isn't.This is a ride, with or without the moving seats. And though it is certainly worth the price of admission, it's lasting effect is precisely as long and deep as the feeling one is left with exiting a disney attraction. It's fun while it lasts, then it all but evaporates as you get in line for the next ride.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

NoThe story is bland and highly repetitive to the first film with more plot holes than a Swiss cheese (don't get me started on Colonel Miles Quaritch's return). There are large drops in frame rates when there's too much CGI.Eight of us (all fans of the first film) went to see it and we spent longer than the film itself discussing all the ""issues"" we had with it afterwards.Watch it?

Visually impeccable and breathtaking for the entire 3+ hour duration of Avatar II. That needs to be said from the jump; cinematically magnificent.I enjoyed the story and the expansion of the world of Pandora. This movie reminded me what had me spellbound 13 years ago when the original movie was released. The magic of the people and the beauty of the place. This film felt like a lot of world building for the future films. It wasn't totally plot heavy, but I felt that was by design.The main thing working against this movie for me was the drug out ending. I didn't feel that this lengthy movie was too stagnant until the last half hour. It felt like it refused to just be over and could've had 20 minutes lopped off the end, if not more.Overall a really great return to this fantasy world. I am invested in where we go from here!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This sequel is again directed, partly written and produced by James Cameron.In the film, Pandora is once again threatened by the Sky People, who have been out for revenge since their last visit and mainly target Jake Sully (Sam Worthington).Jake has to go into hiding with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and their children to protect them and the rest of their Na'vi tribe. For this they seek shelter with the water tribe of the Na'vi. Here they first have to respectfully learn the rules and customs of this tribe, so as not to stand out and not to cause further problems.For this sequel, James Cameron and the other writers have managed to come up with a good and appropriate story to introduce new unknown parts of Pandora. Jake and his family must now learn the new ways of life at the water tribe. Putting workouts back into the movie again can feel a bit repetitive. Most of these workouts are told and learned faster compared to the first movie. The film manages to not come across as long-winded with all kinds of different training sessions for the water tribe. It is sometimes strange to see characters suddenly do their new tricks so quickly and simply, without you as a viewer really seeing how they learned this exactly in the film. James Cameron also has three new Avatar movies planned, but whether this number is really necessary remains the question.For this film, James Cameron also reused some aspects of his earlier directed films such as Aliens and Titanic. For example, the military villains are reminiscent of the military from Aliens and the sinking ships in the water are reminiscent of Titanic.With the first Avatar film, James Cameron managed to change filmmaking techniques in the world of cinema in unique ways. With this sequel thirteen years later, he manages to do this again. In the beginning of this new film, he sticks to the familiar, familiar images and environments from the first film. Once the movie gets to the water and the water tribe, Cameron really knows how to change the movie in his new movie ways. In the thirteen years between the two Avatar films, James Cameron focused on improving certain film techniques, especially film techniques in and under water. For this he even had a new film camera designed and built. For example, he has found ways to record motion capture underwater. Thanks to this method of motion capture, the actors can now also show their emotions and their postures even better underwater. Seeing the film in 3D also makes the underwater scenes more beautiful and shows more credibly the environment and depths of these new underwater areas. This way it sometimes feels as if you as a viewer are also with the characters in the water.Furthermore, James Cameron has chosen to record this new Avatar movie in a higher frame rate. This method works well in the underwater scenes, where the Na'vi swim together and live with the new mysterious sea creatures in Pandora. In scenes from the water, this can come across as a bit strange and it seems as if you accidentally play the film in an accelerated manner.The story this movie focuses a lot on Jake and Neytiri their kids. The young actors who play these roles have such time in the film. Of this new, younger film cast, Britain Dalton knows how to carry the film well as the second son, who tries to be equal like his father and older brother. Kate Winslet has also made a comeback in a Cameron film since Titanic. She knows how to portray her role as a high figure in the water tribe. She also broke Tom Cruise's breath holding record for this role. She managed to hold her breath for more than seven minutes.In this sequel, Sam Worthington now has to play the father of his family in addition to being the leader of his tribe. He manages to juxtapose these two different roles well, but does not really do anything special with them. Zoe Saldana also ends up more on the sidelines in this sequel. The further, returning characters in this sequel like Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang come back in this sequel in a believable and acceptable way. It's just sometimes a bit strange to see Sigourney as an actress in her seventies playing a better-knowing teenager.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

Score (Simon Franglen) remains epic, and the genuine dynamics between the characters of the Sully family lead the viewer to strongly, emotionally invest in them - the performances of the cast, namely Zoe Saldaña, are vital for the film's success.Too bad the recycled, generic narrative doesn't keep up with the creativity, dedication, and innovation levels allocated to the technical elements. Underwhelming to the point of making the three-hour runtime feel heavier than it should, but for fans of the original - which remains supreme - it's far from ruining one of the year's must-see theater experiences.""Rating: B+","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The problem was the lack of a good script. While James Cameron is not the best writer, he at least could present a decent plot for the first part.Here he more emphasized on natrure, lots of characters and... water, his favorite element.But to be honest, the way he presents us his Pandora documentary is just tremendous. I have never ever seen better visual effects in my entire life. This is I think as good as it can get. The characters were absolutely 100% photo realistic. The cinematography is pitch perfect and so is the score.Performance wise it improved a little bit from the first part. I really, really liked Zoe Sladana this time, especially in the second half she performed marvelously. Sure there is still overacting, which was a bothering factor of the first part, but it actually fits her character perfectly. I also like that Sam Worthington took some acting lessons since the first part as his performance had more edge this time and slightly improved. Love the way they brought Sigourney Weaver back and her performance was really great as well. Also Stephan Lang was not as one diemensional as the last time he visited Pandora. I also liked most of the kids. Kate Winslet was sadly underused and there is also part of her storyline that causes some problems with the screenplay, especially at the end. And like her character some come and go without any reason. I guess that will be more concluded in the next installments. Anyway for sure one film to see on the silver screen and a great blockbuster to end the year with. I preferred the first one though.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

A film which provides the viewer with a visual spectacle like no other.Avatar does not have a super complicated or crazy storyline but what it does have is a simple, beautiful story that continues the epic we all first fell in love with back in 2009. Avatar: The Way Of Water follows Jake, Ney'tiri and their family living peacefully on Pandora until the humans return wanting revenge and a place to settle... permanently.When I first watched the original Avatar I always assumed a sequel would have the humans return and go toe to toe with the natives of Pandora again. However while simple and expected it brings with it a absolute bounty of audio and visual beauty that will make you want to rewatch the movie just to take in all the sights and sounds that you missed the first time around.So lets start with storyline, it's simple and easy to predict as already mentioned, but it's also heartwarming and suits the tone and style of the movie perfectly as it focuses more on Jake and Ney'tiri's family then the previous film while still giving the world of Pandora time to shine. I've heard many people say the story was to predictable or boring. I disagree however as I think the storyline does everything it set out to do. Which is bring the world of Pandora back into the spotlight and leave the viewer wanting more at the end.The visuals were just mind blowing, While getting to see the beauty of Pandora's forests and it's creatures again you are also introduced to an entirely new realm, the ocean. The unique plants and animals which live there and the 250 million dollar budget which makes it one of the most visually stunning films of the decade. Not to mention that the daughter of the Chief of the Metkayina reef people is absolutely beautiful. Seriously I'd definitely become a Na'vi like Jake Sully did if she was in the picture haha.Anyway onto the SFX, what can I say beyond it was perfect for the movie. It lent an entire new depth to the film and put the movies massive budget to good use.The acting was superb all around. I have nothing bad to say about any of the acting or voice acting. Those that stood out were Tsireya (The very beautiful daughter of the chief of Metkayina clan), Kiri (Grace's Avatar's daughter?) and Tuk the youngest of Jake's children.Overall what else can I say beyond I am one of the people who absolutely loved the movie and felt that it was an amazing sequel to the original Avatar. Well done to Director and visionary James Cameron on another World Wide blockbuster. 10/10 from me! I can't rate it any lower with how much I enjoyed it. So go ahead watch it in 3D at least or IMAX if you can and enjoy the beauty of the world of Pandora.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Director James Cameron is well known for his massive sci-fi epics and groundbreaking special effects in the spirit of Spielberg and Lucas. But another thing that made him stand out as a blockbuster titan was his talent at making sequels.His previous sequels, Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) helped convince people that sequels can not only be great, but can connect even more deeply to viewers than the OG. The latter was his first film to beat Star Wars as the #1 movie of all time (Titanic and Avatar are the others in case your wondering!😉). So, one of the biggest questions was, how would he follow-up such a mega-hit and how will it compare to his other sequels?The verdict? It's not a ""better movie"", it's the same movie with better stuff in it.It's actually a much more intimate story set on the same grandiose scale as the first one. Avatar centred on the whole of Pandora and protagonist Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) uniting its people against a common foe. This film sees Jake as a father who has been raising his 5 children, now teenagers. When the humans return, and this time stay, he then has to abandon his people and seek asylum to keep his family safe.The first half is the weakest half. We get introduced to the family, a whole bunch of forced callbacks and a big freight train heist with dragons and choppers all at once. The rushed script makes it feel like Cameron fast-forwarding the film to get to the stuff that he wants us to see. But one could say that was true for the first one. Once we arrive at the undersea Na'vi clan, the film really starts going. The rest of the film is basically a repeat of the first Avatar but the action takes a dive to the unexplored depths of Pandora's oceans.Cameron's sequels always follow the template of the original but the thing is, he makes them matter. The family dynamic is one way he adds new urgency to the movie. Each child has their own arc and each are good in their own way, particularly Spider (Jack Champion). Born human and raised by Na'vi, he finds himself torn by his true heritage and his new family, while Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) questions where his true heart lies...A friendship between bullied Lo'ak (Britain Dolton) and an outcast ""Tulkan"" is surprisingly moving and Kiri (a 73-year old Sigourney Weaver) swaps the parental figure role her previous character Grace served in the first. Cameron's mixing of special effects, action and eco-centric story also impacts just as strongly as the first.Finally, it's one of the coolest worlds ever created for film and it's such a delight to explore and experience new stuff in it. There aren't a lot of filmmakers out there bold enough (or crazy enough) to create a fresh new world with story that feels truly universal. But James Cameron is certainly one of them.Maybe this long-awaited return to Pandora is something that movie fans really need right now...","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Whilst it undoubtably looked amazing, it's basic action-adventure plot and colonisation parable was undercooked, and why so many people went to see it so many times is beyond me. That said, I happily plonked my money down for a 3 hour plus sequel to a movie I didn't love and so have many others again. I didn't love this one either, but I'll probably see the third one. Maybe I'm part of the problem?Having lived on Pandora for several years, and started a family, Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) are dismayed when the Earthlings return to the planet and cause devastation. After a year of fighting, Quaritch, (Stephen Lang) restored from a memory back up and given a Navi Avatar body, leads and assault to eliminate Jake, who is leading the resistance. Aware of the threat on his family, Jake convinces them to flee and live with the Metkayina tribes, coastal dwellers who have a strong bond with the local marine life. But Quaritch is persistent and soon takes the war to them.I mean, it's the same film again, same villain, same awkward learning scenes as Jake and his family learn to bond with the wildlife, it's just on water rather than in the air. I didn't hate it though, too much money is spent on it for it not to have a basic level of competence to the storytelling. I didn't even particularly feel that gargantuan running time, there are enough action scenes to keep me entertained throughout. It's biggest selling point is that, even more than the first film, it looks amazing. The CGI work is pretty flawless, and WETA continue to be the SFX house to beat.I can't say that I ever really cared though. The kids, particularly in the conclusion, are just repeatedly captured and that's all they really are, a motivation for Sully to keep fighting and not run again. It's lacking in humour and the pacing feels off, rather than building to heartpumping action scenes and having rest moments, it's rather more a relentless marathon.It's fine. A visual feast but lacking in genuine substance - perfect then that it came out at Christmas.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

James Cameron did a better job directing this movie than the first movie he directed 13 years . The cgi still looks the same as 2009 13 years ago . The story takes place after the humans go back to earth and Jake stays on Pandora to spend his life with Neytiri and raise his family. The kids we're so awesome and the blue reef Navis we're even more cooler . Kate winslet hasn't worked with Cameron since the 90s after playing rose in titanic. But seeing her play a sea Navi was more exciting than titanic 25 years ago . Sigourney weaver did a remarkable job playing graces Navi daughter and I for one found that pretty well done and kinda of emotional . Stephen lang did an even better job playing quaritch in Navi form was absolutely brilliant and a better story for the villain. I have to say way of water was so amazing and more exciting than ever before. The kids were more important to the story than the parents were . Spider who was the coIonels son knew that trusting a bad man was not his place . I hope in the next avatar movie I see Parker and more places to go on Pandora and hopefully Neytiri meets one of her half siblings or cousins and they share the same plot as Jake sully . Or maybe just maybe they'res another family member on Pandora that has the same genes as Jake sully .James Cameron welcome back to Pandora.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

Jake & Neytiri have a family of five children & are raising them in Pandora. When an old foe returns to finish what he started, Jake & Neytiri must join forces with the Na'vi army to protect their family.Avatar: The Way of Water is a mind-blowing film. Director James Cameron always reminds us about the novelty of the theatrical experience & redefines cinema, each time he returns to the director's chair. The visual effects are jaw-dropping & surpasses its 2009 predecessor which is the highest grossing movie of all time. The performance capture is phenomenal & is the highlight. The action set pieces are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. Story wise, Avatar(2009) surpasses this film. The story of this movie is quite basic. That is its only flaw. Sam Worthington is outstanding as Jake. Zoe Saldana is spectacular as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver is awesome as Kiri. Stephen Lang is brilliant as Quaritch. Kate Winslet & Cliff Curtis are excellent as Ronal & Tonowari, respectively. Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, Jack Champion & Bailey Bass are incredible as Neteyam, Lo'ak, Tuk, Spider & Tsireya, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Avatar: The Way of Water is a must watch for Avatar(2009) & James Cameron fans. Watch it on the biggest screen possible & have a whale of a time!","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

The scenery, the machinery, the animals, are all in large part CGI but it's very well done. This part of the movie is on par with the first Avatar. The CGI of the the returning principal characters was a bit off for some reason, especially in scenes with the family group. They often did not look like their former selves. The biggest disappointment was the story itself. To me, it was the same storyline as the first movie except that it occurred in water instead of the forest. Also, the ending was just a setup for Avatar 3. For that much time and money they should have done much better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Directed and co-written by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, it once again offers dazzling visual effects, great use of 3D technology, exciting action scenes... and that's about it.Over ten years after the events of the first film, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) has settled into a peaceful life on Pandora with his Na'vi family, consisting of his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and their four children. However, Jake's idyllic world is soon thrown into jeopardy after a previous threat returns to finish what was started more than a decade ago. With few other options left to explore, Jake decides to seek help from the nearby reef tribe whose very existence revolves around living as one with the aquatic life. As the danger becomes more apparent, Jake's forest dwelling tribe and their marine counterparts must work together to set aside their personal differences before Pandora as they know it is lost forever.James Cameron's multi-million dollar 2009 film ""Avatar"" is quite possibly one of the most enigmatic pieces of media ever released. How can a film that grossed over $2.8 billion at the global box office leave so little impression on pop culture? After more than ten years since its initial release, there are still several people who cannot even remember a single line from the movie or name just three of its many characters. Nevertheless, the general consensus among all of those who saw it agree that the film was a visual treat and featured some jaw-dropping use of 3D. Whether or not the public wanted a sequel (let alone four of them) is a matter of debate but 13 years, a Disney buyout, and a history-changing pandemic later, we finally have ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", a follow-up that does pretty much exactly what the original did but looking much nicer while doing it.Like the original, the plot is basically ""Dances With Wolves"", ""Pocahontas"", and ""FernGully"" set in outer space with blatant pro-environmental, anti-military messages constantly beating us over the head. Although I am fine with the idea of protecting the Earth and are fully aware that the military is capable of some truly awful things, there are better ways of conveying this to us rather than through the shameless guilt tripping that both the original and this sequel has going for it. Before its release, I was hoping this follow-up would at least try something different from its predecessor since a common criticism was that it was ripping off all of the aforementioned movies. But to my disappointment, the writers (all five of them) seem to have taken these complaints in stride because what we have here is a simply carbon copy of the original, only with flashier visual effects.With all of that said, the visuals are absolutely fantastic and clearly this film's saving grace. Right from the very beginning, James Cameron brings us back to the brightly-coloured world of Pandora we remember with stunning environments that actually look like they've been lived in. The forests still brim with that beautiful iridescent light and the CGI wildlife are all flawlessly integrated into this picturesque ecosystem. However, as the title would suggest, the main setting is in the water, which is where the film impresses the most. There's so much beauty to appreciate in the way the water realistically glistens in the sunlight along with witnessing how all the aquatic creatures inhabit this living space. All of this was apparently done by combining groundbreaking CGI with the real on-set locations filmed off the coast of New Zealand. Practically every individual shot of this movie looks like it cost at least $1 million and it certainly shows. This is definitely a movie that needs to been seen at the cinema in 3D, as I imagine watching in on a tiny screen like a phone wouldn't do it justice. In other words, seeing this film in 3D at the cinema is not an option, it is a requirement.Also, for a film that runs for over 3 hours (192 minutes to be precise), there isn't really all that much in it that could be considered ""boring"", at least not by my standards. There's plenty of fast paced action and dazzling visuals to keep the audience occupied that you can forget about the movie's lengthy runtime for the most part. Even some scenes that are obviously intended as filler for the sake of eye candy move at such a reasonable pace that I found them to be forgivable in the long run. It seems that James Cameron was aware that if he was going to make a movie that clocks in at over 3 hours, he should at least make each moment as entertaining as possible to prevent the audience from losing interest. Of course, none of that really matters if you have a weak bladder so I don't recommend drinking too much water before embarking on a viewing.There's not really a whole lot worth mentioning about the characters since they were all generic and bland to begin with. Most of them haven't changed all that much since the first movie, which is surprising considering more than ten years have passed since then. Jake Sully is still the same as when we last saw him, only this time he has a wife and four children, and that's about it. Sam Worthington plays him to the best of his ability, which is a generic protagonist with a good heart. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't feel any emotional connection to the other characters, except for maybe some of the sea life, which resemble real world animals like whales and dolphins. To quote Red Letter Media's Mr. Plinkett; ""The ultimate irony with Avatar is that for all the time and money spent to make this movie in 3D, the story and the characters were still stuck in one dimension.""
Taking into account the sheer scale of its world building and special effects, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an astonishing achievement in visual filmmaking. Like its predecessor, it sets out to be an immersive experience for anyone seeking a brief method of escape from the real world, and on that note I believe it succeeds. Sure, it's easy to pick the film apart for its unoriginal story, forgettable characters, and belated release, but that won't change the fact that it still looks amazing with all of these faults in tow. According to James Cameron, there are three more sequels on the horizon, with each due out once every two years. My only hope is that these ones will feel different, because this franchise can only survive on eye candy for so long before audiences become desensitised. Call me old fashioned, but I'll always prefer a great story over great visuals.I rate it 8/10.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

If there is one blockbuster type movie maker that can always deliver unseen spectacle - its him. And ""Way of Water"" is another proof of that - this movie was incredible in every possible way. If there is a future for huge movie events in theater - this one is the perfect example of it.I won't go into plot but will say that it worked for a sequel - there is a bit of everything, but at its core its a story about family and its connection with nature. The standuot performance to me was Kiri (Sigourney Weaver). She stole every scene she was in. There is a running theme about who her father is, and while there is no answer yet, I think if watched this and previous movies closely and got the overall theme of it, her identity is more then obvious.As for technical stuff - this movie is like no other out there. You have to see it to believe. If the first movie was amazing movie going experience (saw it 3 times back in the day), ""Way of Water"" tops it in every way. The energy of this movie, pacing were superb - during its 3 hours run time never was I bored nor not involved. Music was superb as well.Overall, if you like movies in general, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a must see experience. Watch it on the biggest screen possible and 3D - its the way it meant to be seen. The immersion is like no other. Can't wait for a 3rd movie.

Honestly I was surprised by how sad it was. In contrast with the first one, which also had its sad moments, but still had quite the upbeat tone and ended up on a victory note, this one is just hard to enjoy fully overall and is quite emotionally draining. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, most modern movies are completely emotionally sterile. I personally am very stoic person, but even I barely held it together by the end. Women around me were wiping tears from their 3d glasses. It was brutal.In regards to the world buildup, the cinematography and the action scenes, as usual James Cameron delivers and overdelivers. I wish there was more in-depth self exploration of the feelings of the main characters, there was very little of the poetic self-observation that Jake Sully goes through in the first movie. Here, the emotions and reactions were mostly basic and primal, in response to what was happening. Too much fear, anger and uncertainty. Also, too little of the wonderful personality of Neytiry, who in this one was pushed too close to her primal instincts and emotions. I think there should've have been more quiet happy moments to contrast the ugliness and the threat coming from the human invasion. We barely saw the life of Jake Sully on Pandora after the first movie. There were some scenes but not enough. Overall, it does feel like the first part of two-part movie. Hope the next one gets released sooner and we don't have to wait years.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

The only way to properly watch this is in a theater (preferably Imax) that's well maintained and excellently sound balanced. The water scenes of Wakanda Forever look like amateur hour compared to what James Cameron pulls off here. I'm ready to watch this again already, and in a perfect world, I would be able to grab about 1,000 desktop background screenshots of this stunning cinematography piece of pure art. I could go on for hours... the stars, the bioluminescence, the creatures, the little freckles... and the underwater scenes? Holy batman. I'm a believer! If I never got to watch a movie ever again, I'd be satisfied that my movie going career ended with this movie.It's like the studio spent 1 billion dollars or something. I mean it's crazy.Unfortunately, while they spent billions on cinematography, they must have run out of money and spent what, like, $5,000 on a story/script? I mean... wow it's a bad story. If you think the 7 8 9 of Star Wars was bad.... welp. I mean it's like Hollywood doesn't even try anymore. ""Here is my message to the world, you WILL watch it and my politics/ideology WILL be obvious.""As a logical thinking person it is extraordinarily difficult not to cringe at nearly every turn of the plot. The entire movie start to finish was 110% predictable. It was Avatar 1, but instead of trees, it's water. Its no longer unobtanium version 1.0, its now unobtanium 2.0. Honestly the story is so bad it hurts. I mean just imagine, if there was another story universe where the rebels fought the bad guys who had this huge base and they just barely blew it up.... and now imagine a sequel to that story... where... the bad guys had an even BIGGER base and the rebels just barely managed to blow that one up to....... you get the idea. Zero originality, zero interesting plot lines, zero ""deep feelings"", zero writing quality at all.Fortunately the visuals are so, so amazing that you can genuinely overlook the utterly abysmal story and just enjoy the movie for the visual and audio artwork that it is.Give me Avatar 3...

It's plot and characters are incredibly basic and predictable yet people loved it for its visuals, action and soundtrack. It was the highest bar for VFX. Now in our age of CGI action movies, with stronger plots, does the sequel push the boundary for VFX and CG. The answer is a resounding yes. It's the new gold standard.Avatar: The Way of Water is the best looking film I've ever seen. The CG is flawless, the colours and imagery is so vibrant and imaginative and the soundtrack is wonderful. The cinematography is fantastic and really immerses you into the world of Pandora to a level unmatched by any film. But visuals aren't everything, what about the plot and characters.They're surprisingly alright. While the plot is simple, it contains little of the preachy messaging of the original, although it does contain some notable examples of it in the early minutes. This film is more concerned with expanding the world and the characters. Jake feels more fleshed out here, now having to be a father and Sam Worthington gives a stronger performance than the original. All the new characters are captivating too, all excellently performed and animated, especially Kiri, played by the excellent Sigourney Weaver. Colonel Quaritch, the one note antagonist of the previous film, is overall more threatening and emotive than the original and there is clearly potential to flesh him out further in the third entry.The only issues with this film is that sometimes the dialogue and messaging can be as subtle as a brick and there are some instances of Cameron cheaply manipulating the audience into hating the villains. The pacing could've also been smoother as the intro to this movie rushes through a lot of details and I feel that there must be a director's cut of the film that we're missing. However, this film's third act more than makes up for most shortcomings as it is awesome. Visually stunning with great action choreography and stronger investment in the characters. Cameron still shows he can do action better than the rest.Overall, The Way of Water is miles better than it's predecessor and prices CGI isn't an ugly concept that marvel has made everyone despise. With talent and time it can be used to enhance a film tenfold. While it's far from perfect, this sequel actually made me excited for Cameron's later planned films. It's a visual masterpiece that must be seen to be believed.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

This script is a mish-mash of every sentimental, cliched movie ever made. Seeing the ""humans"" be a$$hats and kill indiscriminately is not my idea of a fun time. This movie got depressing within five minutes and just continued to disappoint as time went on. Geez, it was so sad in places.Also, they stole a plotline from Jupiter Ascending - now that was a great movie - and made it even worse.I'm not sure why Cameron made this... oh, wait... BIG BUCKS.So, this was the third disappointing movie we saw from the Oscar season - Everything, Everywhere was too bizarre to finish watching - yes, it was boring, too.Then we watched that Banshees of Inersherin movie. What a sad, sorry excuse for a film that was. Geez.No one even mentioned the fabulous 5000 Years of Longing movie. Now, that was an awesome film!So, I've listed four films in this, simply to explain what's crap and what's not.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Watching this film is like looking into a dream, the boundary-pushing VFX work Weta digital has done here is leagues above any CGI I have ever seen. The sheer detail in every frame is impeccable, heck, when you can see the detailed pigmentation on a CGI character's skin, you know you're looking at something impressive! Even the water is so beautifully realized, it genuinely feels like you're looking at something very realistic! It is very clear Cameron doesn't accept something unless it looks as real as it possibly can! It's very easy to forget that it's all CGI! I would look at the characters and see them as real beings, completely forgetting they are motion capture characters. That's one of my favourite parts of these films; it really is like James Cameron is taking you along for the ride to experience Pandora- you aren't watching a movie... you are there, and I'm not going to lie, there were times where I even forgot I was in a movie theatre! As far as I was concerned, I was on Pandora!Seeing it in IMAX 3D (and really you haven't seen this movie if you didn't see it in 3D), it feels like you're on the ride at Disney, like you are a part of that world! This has to be among the most visually stunning theatrical experiences I've ever had, right up there with seeing the original ""Avatar"" for the first time in IMAX 3D a few months ago (unfortunately I was too young when it was initially released 13 years ago)! James Cameron has revolutionized VFX again, one upping only himself! The 3D is incredible, the motion capture is next level, you can see so much detail in the emotions, and the overall look and feel of the world (especially the underwater effects) are just remarkable. Even the lighting was spectacular. It's an absolute spectacle and filmmaking achievement. On a technical level, this film is mind blowing; it's absolutely staggering. The amount of visual ingenuity that is constantly on display - it's insane. I genuinely have no clue how they pulled it all off... it's just the magic of cinema. The film provides an immersive experience to be found nowhere else, and truly instills a sense of awe and wonder from beginning to end!Now, if I am being honest, when I first came out of the movie, I only liked, but didn't love it. I was almost caught off guard by the sheer amount of story and spectacle I had just witnessed, I was surprised with how different the movie was from what I expected. But over the past few days, I have found myself unable to stop thinking about it. I want to go back to Pandora; I want to experience this movie again! Much like the first film, this one has captured my imagination, it only took a few days to really sink in and hit me! At this point, James Cameron feels closer to a miracle worker than a moviemaker, and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is yet another wonder that must be seen to be believed. A holy text, an artistic thesis and an environmental plea wrapped in $300M of supreme cinematic spectacle. Nobody is operating on the level of Cameron! The film is a jaw-dropping, astonishing experience that manages to surpass the original in many ways, not just with the technology and visuals, but also in terms of character, themes, and dramatic weight. Personally, I still enjoyed the first one more, but there is no doubt that this long-awaited sequel has one-upped its predecessor in many ways. The main thing that keeps the first one higher in my books is that it tells a complete one off story. In this case, Cameron still tells a complete story, but it also serves as a bit of a reset to tell a larger story across his four film arc. This is like ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" for the ""Avatar"" franchise, and I'm sure this film will only get even better with time as the story further progresses. One of the best things about this movie is that it feels like Cameron is just warming up. He will most likely top this, and that is an extremely exciting idea to think about when considering how good this is!Much like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this sequel is more of an intimate, emotionally-charged epic. Cameron pivots from end-of-world stakes to drama rooted in character and theme, interrogating the fraught bonds between parents and children, or the limits of protecting family or tribe, while also weaving in a strong environmentalism message. It is one of the most universal and compassionate blockbusters of our time. Cameron's entire heart and soul is all over this thing; his love of the ocean, his experiences as a father and son, his continued plea for universality. ""The Way of Water"" is simply an excellent sequel that while an astonishing achievement visually, dives deeper than bigger. Just like the first one, the story is very simple and we've seen stories like it before. But that seems to be the trick of the ""Avatar"" franchise thus far; you tell a very simple story that is appealing to anyone and everyone, something like, in this movie's case, ""protect those you love"", and then you paint that story on a massive canvas of otherworldly places, creatures, and technology that you have never seen before. But the true trick with both films is that Cameron conveys a valuable message about environmentalism within the films, the first being about protecting our forests, and this one being about protecting our oceans. If any young kids can go experience this movie and experience that message and see why it's important while also being entertained then that's a win for the movie! It's what James Cameron is trying to do; make us fall in love with the natural beauty of Pandora, root for the characters to protect it, and then come out of the movie thinking about how we can protect our own planet. I found the film even plays like a nature documentary at times; albeit with CGI alien creatures. ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an awe-inspiring blend between a nature documentary and a blockbuster - a thrilling three-hour-long travelogue through the oceans of Pandora with deep feeling in its foundation and an unspeakably epic third act that will leave you breathless and in tears. It's just so rare to watch a blockbuster that's both formally ambitious and full of authentic emotion.The movie is undeniably beautiful and wondrous, I think I have made that clear. But is it perfect? Frankly, no. I didn't see the ""masterpiece"" that many seem to have seen - to me it was very close (and still excellent), but does have its flaws, primarily with the script. You can't fault this movie on a technological level, from that regard it is perfection, but I did think the script needed some work. I have to also clarify that while it is not the best script ever written, it feels like the type of blockbuster script we would've seen in the 80s and 90s - meaning it is easily better than most written today! First off, as many have always said, Cameron's dialogue is not the greatest. It's better than George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" dialogue, but does still have a bit of awkwardness to it. However that didn't take me out of it too much, I honestly didn't notice it until thinking about it after. But really, my main problem with the film is that I didn't think the 3 hours runtime was justified and I felt the length in some places. This is partially due to both the edit and the script, however I feel like the editing was much more polished overall. The editing here blew me away. Yes, the pacing is flawed but overall pretty good, but I also feel that each shot specifically really gets the chance to breathe, letting you really appreciate the spectacle of it all. It's not pretentious as no shot goes on for too long. It isn't snappy or overly-done, just so miraculous and smooth. So to keep the runtime, I would have stretched out the first act and condensed the 2nd, as it felt like at the beginning we were rushed through tons of very important world-building and exposition, skimming through story I would have liked to see in more detail, only to arrive at the 2nd act and take a bit of a pause to the pace of the film. However, I thought the pacing did work really well for one element; the emotion of the film.This film has much bolder emotional swings than the first did, and I love that it really takes the time to explore the characters and relationships on a deeper level. The first was cool and definitely had emotional weight, but I truly felt a much wider range of emotions while watching this one. But, back to the pacing, I did not feel as emotionally engaged in the first half as I did in the second. There was a lot of bold new story and characters introduced by Cameron early on, so it took awhile to feel out the characters and places, as well as the story as a whole. Not to mention the first act presents a lot of information really fast, it felt like a lot to take in and I wish we could've spent more time in that part of the story instead of using montages to summarize our way through it. Within the first 5 minutes it felt like we were bombarded with a lot of new and insane world building information with only a single line of dialogue or one shot devoted to each item, it almost gave me whiplash with how fast it was going. However, once we got to the midpoint of the film I was in. It worked a lot better as well as hit a lot more emotional beats, as well as featuring phenomenal, giant action in the 3rd act! The movie overall is light on action, but once you get to the 3rd act Cameron reminds us how incompetent 95 percent of the large-scale action we get in theatres is these days... because the action here is absolutely thrilling! It even had some ""Titanic"" elements to the finale... James Cameron seems to love flooding ships and watching characters escape! The film as whole is lighter on action than the first, and when we get it the stakes are not as high as in the first movie, but regardless, when we get the action, it hits hard!","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Amazing special effects, best 3-D ever, but I couldn't care less about a single character and the entire ""story"" (yes, quotes because there barely was one) seemed like a 3-hour Save The Whales campaign. I remember being blown away by the first Avatar movie, but only because it was so immersive and incredible from an effects perspective. We watched it again when it came out on DVD and felt so let down. Without the big screen, big surround sound and 3-D it was just a so-so story with so-so acting. Same today except that now the special effects are so over-the-top that THEY are the stars (and the focus) of this movie. If you love all the new stuff they can do with CGI you may love this, but for me it needed a lot more weight on the story, acting, and characterizations side of the balancing act. If it's just showing off all the cool things you can do it's not a movie, it's just show-and-tell. It also didn't help that no one seems to know how to behave in theaters anymore. Turn off your screens (completely!), stop talking, don't bring toddlers to PG-13 movies, and don't go to the movies if you're hacking up body parts. Silence and respect for your fellow humans have truly become lost art forms. 😢","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is a thoroughly enjoyable action movie with happy and sad moments. It is a movie that forces the audience think more broadly about our environment, and the kind of world we want to leave for future generations... not unlike the original Avatar.

And I'd like to say it was worth it for the rest as well, but Avatar 2 is like a supermodel who didn't go to school. Surface level it's incredible, but peel away one simple layer and there's nothing there besides a mediocre adventure film.Directing, there's no doubt that this is one of the best looking movies of the year. The water simulation is mind blowing, the world design is stunning. The creature design is great. And the directing takes the freedom to showcase it all, more than you'd want at times. Seriously it's just throwing pretty stuff at you over and over and over. You can't keep that up and keep thinking it engrosses people as much as it did at first. It caused me fatigue. Though I'd have loved a bit more creativity directing wise. Editing and pacing was really really good, but still, the movie overstays it's welcome more than I'd accept. This is mainly due to the the first 50% which is arguably entirely forgettable and even as I'm writing this I'm having a hard time to remember anything notable.The story/characters/script. The weakest part of the movie. Absolutely let down by how surface level everything is kept here. The characters lack depth. The story lacks real stakes until the last part of the movie which it then just rushes through. There's is not a second of suspense to find in this movie. The enemies are deeply incompetent, even though they are marines. You have 3 and a half hours to flesh out the family, but they don't even manage to do that well. We get maybe 1 character trait. No depth whatsoever. Jake Sully is entirely simplified, where did his character go? His wife is even worse. Only one of the kids gets some time, even though again that storyline is played so flat. Not once did this movie bring me to tears either, whilst they had so many opportunities, Kiri's storyline could be sadder, Neteyam could've been more heroic, Lo'ak could've been more cruel en vengeful. Tuk could've been more lost and helpless. But instead scenes either don't get their time, not the emotional load.The story is just so weak, especially as this movie really feels like a primer to the next one. Because in this whole movie they held off 1 medium sized ship. ONE ship. We saw the humans build an entire city with thousands of armored troops. This movie never got it's ''death star'' victory. One of the most anticlimactic ''epic'' movies I've ever seen. Even worse is how they prepared the story for the sequels. Come on... I get the reasoning from the character, sure. I accept that. But the character being saved has no value. Just a grunt bad at his job. He's not smart, doesn't have special intel or abilities. Just as useless as the rest that was given some distinctive features but killed off like fodder.Acting is fantastic, really good performances for what was able to be done with the script. Again though no one really stands out in particular.Music is the same we've heard in Avatar, no real innovation or variation there which let me down a bit. And the problem for me was that the theme became tiresome after it being put under the 100th beautiful scene. We get so many visual '''moments'' it becomes cliché.For someone that hooks into movies more that actually tell a story worth caring about, and characters worth caring about this movie failed for me. It's incredibly simple. A really simple, but pretty looking movie. If that is what you want, it's great. But if you want just a little more out of your movie like me then it's not worth the 3 and a half hours.PS wat might help this movie be worth viewing is watching it in the best theater you possibly can. I don't have that, my theater is mediocre with a flat sounding sound system, and it does make it worse as a ''experience'' movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

What has he done. The Way of Water is a cinematic miracle. What he created is something unthinkable, incomprehensible and unimaginable. He delivers a modern day odyssey that left my jaw on the floor for hours. It's Best movie of the year and it's not close. I've never seen something so marvellous put on canvas, never. Nothing comes even close. It's pure enchantment and wonder. It's a movie full of profound significance and narrative intelligence.All actors were terrific. Lo'ak, Kiri and Tsireya are instant new fan favorites. And Quaritch is brilliant. Huge improvement in versatility over the first movie. Cameron knows exactly how to write compelling characters that resonate with the viewer on a profound level. Jake and Neytiri at this point, are so unbelievably honest and real, they really feel like people I've known my whole life.I cared so so much about the whole Sully family, so the movie fulfilled its task in the very best way possible. My personal highlight in the movie is Lo'ak's relationship with the Tulkun Payakan. Their interactions gave me teary eyes time and time again.Overall there is this astonishing beauty and energy overarching the whole movie, even more so than there's already been in the original movie. You can feel with every sense how Cameron poured his heart and soul into every little detail of his whole-cloth reality, with meticulous world-building that is more enveloping than anything I've ever experienced. The marine wildlife and eco systems feel as multilayered and personality-filled as fully fleshed out characters. The camera work is Oscar worthy. Mind blowingly goo. Especially the POV action shots in combination with the HFR made my heart rate go to risky heights and hands sweaty as hell. Cameron never cuts away the action and brute force of a scene. That makes the whole 193 minutes utterly satisfying to watch.And yeah TWOW again proves that Cameron is the MASTER of sequels. The first act may be the best continuation of a story I've ever seen. You're instantly hooked and absorbed by everything that's going on. Jim has come up with a big, exciting and powerful story that touches universal themes, homages his previews works and will be exhilarating to see spanning, developing and unraveling over the next three sequels.TWOW is a never before seen audiovisual miracle - until that crown is passed, inevitably, in December 2025, to Avatar 3.-Update after a few more viewings-
I can't believe how perfect this movie is. I can't stop watching it. The magic doesn't diminish in the slightest. It is almost a meditative experience.And Zoe Saldana owns the the screen every time she's on it. Pure beauty in her appearance and radiation. So genuine and caring. Payakan makes my heart melt. Lo'ak is the perfect character to lay the focus on for the sequels. Stephen Lang also is beautiful. Yeah they're I said it. I loved him. His interactions with Spider. You can feel it. Their Darth Vader-Luke-esque relationship works perfectly for this saga. Sam Worthington also puts in the gravitas effortlessly. I could listen to him all day long. And Sigourney Weaver simply the greatest. The Sully family FEELS so much like a real family. This is maybe the movies biggest accomplishment.Each time I watch it, I am touched by different scenes, and the depth of the direction and meaning of each scene becomes more and more apparent. There is not a single shot that is left to chance. Set ups, foreshadowing, callbacks, everything is connected. Just like the way of water.I bow down to Mr. Cameron, truly Hollywoods biggest dreammaker.","23 out of 57 found this helpful.

It seems to me as tho the one thing, the one goal that this movie was trying very hard to achieve was to be long. It was unnecessarily long, half the movie was nonsense. Somebody was given an assignment and told ""You need to write 2 pages"" and instead of writing a meaningful 2 pages, they decided to overdo it just to kiss someones donut and they ended up with 20 pages of nonsense, pretty much like what I'm doing now in order to reach the characters required to post this piece of ...art.This movie was 50% visuals, 20% kids, 30 minutes on a whale and a brat connecting, 10% your typical villan parents and the rest is villainizing humans and how they'll destroy worlds in the future... so yeah, pretty good movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's bloated, with 3 times as many characters as last time. Also, it's overlong, it could easily be half the length. And considering the 13 year wait, and the fact that apparently the script for the fourth one is ""absolutely bonkers"", it is a let down how similar this is to the original: one or more blue people learning the culture of other blue people, with the threat of the RDA led by Quaritch on the horizon.This features a little moderate to strong language and sci-fi violence.

It is a technical marvel...way ahead of anything that has, thus far, been seen on a movie screen.It's too bad the story (and characters) lag far behind.Taking the audience back to the world of Pandora, AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER treads familiar territory as Director James Cameron returns us to this idyllic planet, with the natives living peacefully, in concert with the land, until the soldiers from Earth show up (again) to strip the planet of it's native contents (again).Cameron (TITANTIC) expands this 3D World, bringing the audience from the trees to the water - and what an expansion this is! It is a BEAUTIFUL film to watch and Cameron (as one would expect) expertly pushes the technological edges of the industry, bringing us stunning visuals underwater. It is this part of the more than 3 hour film that is worth the price of admission alone. It is a feast for the eyes.But what Cameron (and his FOUR writers of the script - never a good sign) fail to do is to add interesting characters and stories to these amazing visuals. It is a pretty straight forward telling of Good (the native peoples) vs. Evil (the invading soldiers from Earth). There is no nuance or subtly whatsoever throughout this film.Back from the first film are Sam Worthington (just as wooden and uninteresting), Zoe Saldana (just as underused) and Stephen Lang (just as one-note as the villain). Obviously, it is just their voices used - for they are all rendered as Pandorans via motion-capture - but they don't have much to do except be one with the nature (the good guys) or destroy nature (the soldiers).Joining the cast - and just as underused - are Cliff Curtis, CCH Pounder and, especially, Kate Winslet. Cameron brings in some really fine performers who have to spout wooden dialogue that would make George Lucas blush - all the while performing in motion capture suits. This movie could have been so much better had Cameron given these actors something better and more interesting to do.The only exception to this is the young actress (so I thought) that portrayed Kiri - who is the daughter of the Sigourney Weaver character from the first film. This Pandoran was born under mysterious circumstances (Virgin birth? Do we have a Messiah?) and is more in tune with the nature of the world they live in. This young actress had the most interesting things to do and she absolutely nailed it, so I should not have been surprised to find out that this ""young actress"" was none other than - Sigourney Weaver.Well done, Cameron and Weaver. You got me on this one.This film (the second in what will be a trilogy - or maybe more) has a run time of over 3 hours - so be warned - but Cameron keeps things moving along at a sprightly pace, never lingering over the clunky dialogue, but stopping to watch the beautiful visuals along the way.AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER is worth watching for the water and the stunning visuals...but not for much else.Letter Grade: B+ (10 for the visuals, 5 for the story)
7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Salute James Cameron, probably the finest film-maker out there who really knows the nuances of storytelling and is a master in using VFX to enhance it. Talking about the story, plot and run-time which everyone is worried about, well, for me, it was like a family union, with so many underlying basic human emotions, but the standout one has to be ""FAMILY IS OUR FORTRESS"". Technically speaking...come on, do I have to talk about it? It's probably the best cinematic experience I have ever had in recent times, sadly there's no IMAX in our Telugu states.

Its a shame that such a visually immersive and brilliant world creation could not compensate the need of an equally great story telling.

to represent significant advancements in the possibilities of special effects, which is just stunning and i just had to write a review as i just came home after seeing it on the big screen.Immersive storytelling, although not ground-breaking, with a message of the meaning of family and the portrayal of a strong father and mother protecting their children combined with amazing 3D effects, that it sometimes feels like you're sitting next to the characters and feel them, which this time add more depth to the story as some might think.As sequel it amazes again with every shot beautifully in perfect CGI but also PG rated as some younger children definitely should wait as this time it is more action and violent packed.Big emotions are just as apparent throughout the movie with Cameron's passionate storytelling pulling on our heartstrings and every scene feels just right from the beginning to the end. The movie could go on for another 30 minutes and still wouldn't be boring in any way.The second movie with the new characters, new tribes and animals surprised me, as it was way better than expected and feels much more evolved than the first movie, which was almost great.This time was stunning
For those who would like to escape again to the wonderful world of pandora and also any other movie lovers, it has to be seen, and not from the comfort of your couch or on your phone in the airplane, but on the biggest * screen you can find!(* IMAX recommended - as you get 25% more screen)","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

There were real things at stake, like a people's home being destroyed and its collective memory being erased. You really felt the terror the Na'vi were experiencing in the face of a horrific genocidal attack. So, while it checked all the boxes for big box office fun it also had an adult theme and message.'Avatar 2' says 'the heck with all that' and tells a less interesting story where the stakes are not as high. It's peppered with teenagers calling each other 'Bro' and behaving according to every cliche the Marvel Universe has shoved down our throat these past years. It's really a kidding movie that bends over backwards to appeal to the early teen market.While the movie is beautiful and engaging at times, it's disappointing because it's James Cameron, one of the all-time greatest creators of action/adventure movies. He shouldn't be kowtowing to a market or be 'trying to remain relevant'' He should be showing the Marvel crowd how it's done.Looking at the credits Cameron teamed with two other writers on this project. They're both writers of many CGI blockbusters. It really shows. 'Avatar' was written by Cameron, alone. It's a very well written and concise movie. 'Avatar 2' feels more like writing by committee and it's very cliche.Seeing as there's already a release date for 'Avatar 3', this is obviously a bridge movie. So, there's a good chance 'Avatar 3' will be better. This one wasn't bad but the writing should've been better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Also he saved the bad guy in the end so I guess 3/4/5 will likely have the same villain. How lucky are we to have probably 9 more hours of blue Stephen Lang leading sociopathic marines through different terrains across Pandora, fighting for different substances worth billions of dollars on earth.

Avatar maintains the same identity, maintains the same structure and the vast majority of its positive and negative points.This story begins in a more exciting way than the first film, with a strong first scene that forces Jake Sully and Neytiri to move from their home. They now have a family - with four children - and that's where Avatar changes the most. This is a movie very much about family. It is no longer about discovering love, but about how to protect and bring out the best in that family. This is a very interesting change and it results because all the young people have very distinct and exciting personalities, often having the most prominence in this film. Don't worry though! The other main themes are still there: colonisation, imperialism, racism, militarism, spirituality and environment.The 2nd act repeats the ""discovery of a new world"" that we saw in the first. Here it is about the aquatic world, which is fantastic, beautiful, and fascinating. However, it's too much. What should have been 20 minutes turns into more than 40 minutes of James Cameron showing off his new toys, asking us ""and this one, huh? Beautiful, right? Perfect, right?"". The plot is forgotten for several minutes and this could have completely gone awry. It doesn't happen because an epic and brutal third act is filled with high stakes, amazing action scenes and enormous tension. The ending convinces even as an open door. Several strong roots are left for the future.Although narratively the film is a little lost at times, its sound is fantastic and visually it's as fascinating as possible. As I'm not even the biggest fan of the technique, I was impressed by what Cameron did at 48fps engaging with very subtle transitions than I expected and a high level of spectacularity. Many will say that it looks like a video game, but I personally loved it. I'm a fan of aquatic films, so it was particularly exciting to see that bright and colourful world that also gives us the fantastic characters that are the tulku (a species of whales). Despite feeling simultaneously like an opening piece and a structural repetition, this is very entertaining, a good time at the cinema and I'm already looking forward to returning to Pandora in 2024.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

I truly believe that he is invested in this film series and can't wait for the next.We are allready booking to watch it again and i hope to bring my grandfather as he loved the original film.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

It feels like a well developed story with Jake's family growing. Hard to believe we started with a paralyzed Marine and now he's a Navi with a family and connects to the World of Pandora. I feel proud to see him in this stage. I seriously can't wait for the rest of the movies to be released. It will, too, be well worth the wait. It almost reminds me of what it's like to read a book and how it was so good, the second book is released with others in waiting. I felt like I was reading an amazing series and I'm only on book 2. I cannot wait to see more of the characters again. The last time I was this excited watching a movie was Endgame. I didn't think I'd feel this way again. I watched it in 3D as well. It's a great movie to put into Sci-fi category. James Cameron's film did not disappoint. I thought it was perfect. The fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat. The calm moments gave me breath of relief, while knowing the anticipation will soon arrive. It gave room for the kids' character development as they adjust to their new home. I really can't wait to see more of the kids. That's something I'd never thought I'd say when I first saw the trailer and realized we may not be with Jake's story anymore. I love this movie and I can't wait to see this on repeat, and the rest of the series to come. Great job, James Cameron.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

The move has so much beauty and color! Do yourself a favor, and DON'T wear glasses that will cut this out!The movie itself is fine. If you're like me, you vaguely remember the first one and remember that it's simple enough to jump right back in - and The Way of Water sticks with the formula that you (vaguely) remember. It's an accessible movie themed around family and home, with some beautiful visuals (again, don't choose 3D over brightness and color) and some forgettable acting (and some distinctly not so good - Spider stands out, but maybe more so because he isn't blue). The plot is unsurprising (there a couple of holes to move it along), the runtime feels a bit padded, and the villain is all talk. But none of that surprises you, probably. You remember Avatar as something that was fun to watch in the theater, and - in that sense - The Way of Water Delivers.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Most of the actors are basically CGI, for the most part it makes you forget it. The scenery becomes a character itself, and well directed by James Cameron. It is pretty epic, like a Lord of The Rings film, it does takes a while to get to the exciting part, like a slow ride getting to its destination.

RECOMMENDEDThe first two things comes in my mind: Positive one, the movie and making takes us to their world and I really lived three hours in their world. Thanks to IMAX and great 3D experience
The negative one: There are lot of moments reiterated from the first part. Lot of scenes looks like first part sequences remade in water world with more technical excellence.I was stunned and had lot of jaw dropping moments in first part. Compared to that one, this one has less. At the same time this is not less in class and mass.The beginning and end has superb action sequences, in between there are more sentiments and taking viewer slowly into the new world from Pandora.See it in Imax with 3d to live their world.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

James Cameron creates a visual spectacle for the eyes to behold. He continues to set the standard when it comes to next generation effects.It was great to see so many of the same characters again, and just how they've grown... or uh, changed.Plot wise, it's nothing innovative. Sky people mostly want revenge, but also to take a major cog out of the Na'vi resistance by eliminating Jake Sully.The transition to water, and all that entails on Pandora made sense as Cameron's facination with the ocean is well documented. He has loads of filmmaking experience with the ocean whether from documentaries, or of course 'Titanic'.Very curious to see what part of Pandora we get to see next.

There seemed to be a lot of 'stuff' happening with no real connection to one another, and all the swimming about got a little boring after a while. It's like they got carried away with what they could do under water, and wanted to do more of it for more of it sake.

If you clearly want an audiovisual spectacle that will dazzle and make your emotions fly, then yes, go ahead and watch it. I lost my bound to gravity because of the feeling I got in the Cinema.If you want a story here, walk away. This is not a great script by any means, while Avatar had a clear theme with many meanings to walk away with, this sequel is not really a story worth watching. I still don't get why Quaritch wants Jake Sully dead (aside from the loss in battle) and all the subplots introduced are not really touched except from the relationship between Payatan and Lo'ak. In honest opinion...there's still hope that the script of the third Avatar movie will deliver answers to me and that the subplots that were not developed will be of more importance later on. I won't even discuss about the lack of meaningful messages, there were some nice ones but let's be real, it's no comparison to Avatar's messages.So, why should you watch this movie? Well, despite of the lacking script and messages, you can get a lot of action and pleasing visuals. This is a chance for you to watch something else instead of a Marvel movie...so take the chance and watch this. Just don't walk in expecting Avatar...the 13 years were apparently not taken into great advantage.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I forgot 3-D was a thing for the last 11 years and that's because James Cameron hadn't made a movie since avatar. It's like being on a star tours ride for three hours and 10 minutes. Now we can sit here and nitpick some of the exposition and development of some of the newer characters but as the ride went we figured all that out and it really didn't take away from the fun and escapism factor. This is a popcorn movie with a heart and all of the agendas are embedded so deeply that it's not offensive. We are all are rooting for Pandora and the Navi people and if that is politically correct, so be it. This was a great continuation of the original story and the motion capture underwater scenes were absolutely breathtaking (pun intended.). When I heard that Kate Winslet held her breath for over six minutes I was even more excited to see this film. This is nowhere near James Cameron's finest work but he should win all the Oscars for a lifetime of great storytelling... he is due!","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Cameron expanded this universe with new sceneries and creatures; he was able to build a brand new world from scratch. I am confident in saying that these movies will hold strong for many, many generations. They used the latest technologies to bring to the audience one of the best visual experiences in the last decades. The different environments, the creatures and the native aliens are just stunning and I do not have anything to remark. I was simply speechless for the whole time. This is a project that involved a lot of resources, but it definitely paid off. This is one of the few films that I was looking forward to watching in the cinema, with a proper sound system. I definitely recommend doing the same, because only in this way you will be able to fully enjoy it. A simple home theater system, for how expensive it could be, it just cannot match the experience.I cannot say that I was particularly impressed by any of the performances, but the general acting level is solid. Unfortunately not all the cast members were up to the task. Spider was pretty annoying and does not add any value to the film. Jack Champion is just really bad in this role. Luckily he is just a side character that has very little screen time. The first and third acts are very similar to the first ""Avatar"" and in my perspective they were very uninspired and predictable. The middle section was the best, and this is where there is the true potential of this movie. The director took the time to develop the lore of this world and its inhabitants. This is my favorite part, as it gives the audience the chance to get familiar with the planet of Pandora. This is definitely a huge recommendation and there is no better way to end this year with this release.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I don't think I will be adding anything new, if I say that it is a cinematic masterpiece and that the real world may start to look little dull even if you are living in Kashmir, because a lot has been said and every word of praise coming out from anybody is well deserved one.However, I do feel that the 3D version could have been a little better. I was expecting more arrow shots from Neytri flying through the screen and hitting me than the invaders (this is something I enjoyed in the first part). Yes, the 3D rain was spectacular and so was the diving session.This had to be a sequel about revenge of the hurt ego of the thrashed invaders and so I was kind of expecting the same kind of storytelling and anything different would have looked completely off hook.

Unfortunately this was not the case with The way of Water.After thirteen years you would think James Cameron will come up with something bigger, something better, something unheard or unseen of before (like he did once jumping sky-high from Terminator to Judgment day) but with Avatar I was mostly hugely disappointed. Although I can't deny that underwater sequences look amazing and at times breathtaking I couldn't really feel anything while watching those. When I watched Avatar I had my eyes wide open, afraid to miss out on something whereas in The Way of Water many scenes are easily skippable.The only thing I didn't like in the first movie is its predictable nature, here James took two steps back and gave us even more things to facepalm while watching: I mean, choosing vengeance as the main topic, without giving the viewer proper motivation for the villain, with no character development whatsoever - the colors may have changed but they still stayed the same.Avatar, with its one dimensional characters at least bothered to show us what those people were there for, what they were trying to achieve, by what merits and how far were they willing to go to get it, accept the consequences etc. The way of Water didn't bother one bit; from the first minutes it showed us who the bad guys are and why. No intrigue, no rational explanation, no nothing. I can go on and on about this movie's bleak and forgettable nature, I just couldn't believe we waited thirteen years to see a bunch of underwater scenes, stitched together with Jake's children and their problems which we didn't even get the resolution of by the end of this three hour motion picture and we hadn't even been given enough reasons why we should bother in the first place.Any movie, sequel or not, must be watched as a standalone piece of cinema, with real, alive characters, their struggles, how they evolve throughout the course of the movie and what do they get out of it in the end. Avatar was a standalone, classic movie. The way of Water tries hard to be one but is really just another continuation no one asked for, with mostly no new information to the universe of Pandora and complete absence of character growth. I will watch the third part when it comes out but James didn't make it any easier to get him and his child out of the pit he'd gotten into with this one.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Cameron spent the last 13 years and an inordinate amount of money making this sequel, and it looks spectacular. And I spent a ridiculous sum to see it on a big screen in 3D, and it was an amazing theater experience. Of course, money can only buy you so much. I knew going in that this movie would likely have the same flaws as the first, so it is hard to complain too much...but the dialogue is sub-par, the movie is too long, there are too many characters, the bad guys are cartoonish, and it still feels like a bad caricature of native cultures at points. But it probably says something that I rarely noticed those flaws. I was too mesmerized by the visuals and action set pieces, which were truly a sight to behold. So yeah: you get what you pay for. I knew what it could/couldn't deliver, and I have no complaints.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has been 13 years since the release of Avatar and while I still love that film and was eager for a sequel, for many years I just didn't believe it was happening. Well, those thoughts can now take a back seat. Avatar: The Way of Water is now playing in theatres and this sequel to the biggest film of all time is the better of the two movies, and as I said, I still love the first. Here's why you should check this one out if you liked the first.Set many years after the events of the first film, Avatar: The Way of Water follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and the family he has created with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Their four kids are just as central to the story of this film as they are. When the ""sky people"" known as humans return for a new reason that I will leave out of this review, Jake and his family flock to a new tribe to request shelter. This is where they meet the Na'vi of the Metkayina Clan of the ocean of Pandora. This group teaches the Sully family how to live, breathe, and thrive underwater. Once the looming threat comes looking for them though, the Metkayina Clan are also caught in the crossfire. I'll hold off on diving in deeper because I don't want to ruin who returns and how it all plays out.Obviously, without question, many people will be going to see this film for the visual feast alone. The visuals in this film put the first film to shame and that film still holds up visually in my opinion. Seeing Avatar: The Way of Water in IMAX 3D was almost too much for my eyes at times. The work here is astonishing to say the least. I will recommend not seeing this film with high frame rate though, which is how I saw it. Most cinema websites will list that as HFR. I truly believe that motion ruins the viewing experience of anything. But yes, this film deserves all the awards when it comes to the visuals, it's simply breathtaking.What I enjoyed most about this film is the fact that there is a lot more world building here and the idea of Eywa was much more interesting here. The character that Sigourney Weaver returns to play, Kiri, has the most fascinating storyline in relation to that. The rest of the Sully family was all enjoyable as well. I really liked Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) because he was an angsty teenager and also just wanted to do the right thing for his family. On top of that, his sequences invoking the ocean and his bond with a whale blew me away. My favourite new character though has to be Spider (Jack Champion). He is the only human hanging out with the Na'vi and his energy made for a very likeable character.In the end, Avatar: The Way of Water is the most beautiful film I've seen in a theatre in years. At over three hours, I didn't mind how the film was paced at all, but my one small complaint is that it treads some of the same story beats of the first film. In many ways, this sequel is just a better version of the first film. James Cameron has proven that he has a bigger story to tell and this film is pretty much the jumping off point. It reintroduces you to all of the characters, introduces new faces, provides some brilliant ideas, and then it all comes to an end. I'm very eager to see where this story goes next. Now playing in theatres, if you liked Avatar back in 2009, I can't recommend Avatar: The Way of Water enough. I loved watching this film so much that I'm just going to give it the highest score I can. It's not my favourite film of all time or anything like that, but it impressed the hell out of me.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The story is banal and fits on a cinema ticket. This time it is set in water, as the title suggests. Those who have seen part 1 don't necessarily have to watch this again, it's almost the same film only with children. Things like this rarely go well, we remember The Mummy ( from 1999). I'm not really looking forward to part 3 at all, because part 2 set the bar so low. It's an underwater documentary with a few explosions and the usual drama-inducing scenes as the standard Hollywood film script dictates. If you haven't succumbed to the schmaltzy-looking CGI adventure after 1h, you might want to pop back in Terminator 2, a much better action film and even with a plot that really moves forward based on Part1.","31 out of 45 found this helpful.

Do not wait to watch it at home. This film is a masterclass in visual storytelling and world building. The first ""Avatar"" was gorgeous to watch, and it just scratched the surface of Pandora. The sequel dives deeper into the world of the Na'vi and introduces countless new layers of breathtaking visuals, especially as the characters learn ""the way of water"".If there was one weakness to the first film, it was a lack of emotional depth and character construction. James Cameron (writer/director) learned his lesson and spends a large portion of this 3-hour runtime developing new characters, especially Jake and Neytiri's kids. The theme of ""Sullys stick together"" is present throughout the film and adds a surprising layer of relatability.For a movie that is 3+ hours long, it does not feel that way for most of the runtime. However, near the 2 ½ hour mark, I was starting to feel restless and ready for the movie to wrap up. Some of the storylines had confusing finales and interestingly, it felt like there were pieces of plot left on the cutting room floor.The set up for the next two ""Avatar"" installments was evident throughout this movie. I am sure that the payoff will be worth it when ""Avatar 3"" and ""Avatar 4"" come out, but for now, these storylines just seem like loose ends. While the film does a good job of introducing new characters, such as Lo'ak, Kiri and Spider, many of the original characters are sidelined.The big question: Is ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" worth the 13-year wait? My answer: Absolutely. I believe that this film is an improvement on the first ""Avatar"" in nearly every way. It is a better story, has a stronger emotional pull and the visuals continue to improve. James Cameron is brilliant for creating this world, and I will go see this movie in theaters at least one more time, if not more, to soak in Pandora and the way of water.Best Character: Lo'ak (but really Neteyam)
Best Scene: Learning ""the way of water""
Best Quote: ""A father protects, it's what gives him meaning"" - Jake
Best Piece of Score: ""Happiness is Simple""One more note: the word ""bro"" was said probably 30 times throughout the film and got old quickly.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

And the questions start within the first 10 minutes.So many amazing possibilities and this was the final result?

It's just that it tries so hard to pit the protagonist against the antagonist that common sense goes out the window and that truly is the only thing that leaves a sour taste in your mouth.However, I'm still curious to see how the next film in the series plugs the plot holes and how the Avatar universe unfolds. I think there's just a small possibility of removing some of the smaller holes but I cannot imagine how they explain an interplanetary organization to waste away so much time and effort when they can just go scorched earth (or rather scorched Pandora) policy.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, it really did look good. Many of the scenes would look right at home in an electronics store, showcasing just how good the pictures are. The problem is that I think that would be the best use for this film.In the first film there were captivating struggles of loyalty and responsibility, and I found myself really invested in the story and in the characters. This time that wasn't the case. I found the whole story to be pretty flat and lacking in any twists or turns, or really anything to make it interesting. Frustratingly that was only compounded by the ridiculous length of the film - it absolutely wasn't worth over 3 hours.Bringing children into it was presumably supposed to show a different side of the characters we'd seen before, and to add more weight to the struggles. However, for me it just didn't work. It was the same stuff again and again, and nothing particularly interesting. There was a lot of interaction without really generating any character depth and so largely seemed pretty pointless. What I really disliked was the voice of the eldest Sully daughter - whilst I understand why they did it, it just wasn't right at all and sounded ridiculous.It was a long time to wait for a sequel that sadly just wasn't really worth it. The first film had a lot of rewatch value and I'll happily watch it many more times yet, but the same can't be said for The Way of Water.For anyone interested in the film I'd highly recommend watching it on the big screen - if it's going to look good it might as well do it properly!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was like watching the first movie all over again, except this time it was done in an alternate universe where everything felt less than the first movie. Don't get me started on that human kid spyder. What the heck was that? His character is so cringe inducing, that I couldn't even stomach a second viewing of the movie when I tried to watch it to see if my opinion could be swayed. It was horribly bad. If this is the direction the Avatar franchise is heading towards, I'm afraid they're dead in the water. They won't get away with mediocrity in the third film like they did with this one.

Not mention jungle density and fire explosive for CGI like that is quite insane rendering CGI.Although the CGI itself is very insane and beautiful, but i see some flaw with too much blurry and quite bit gray-ish in some scene. If there is Blu-Ray version now, i would suggest using monitor over 140 Mhz and with HDR also with some Ray Tracing that would be maxed out the colors.The story quite simple and predictable in some scene, but this story is a bridge for another AVATAR 3.

This is a film that is made for theatrical experience! This is a film that will age well like a fine wine, even in the next 20 years.Remember when you went to an electronic store and you head to the TV section, there are some screens that look profoundly realistic when it moves that it might just pop out of the screen? Yes, imagine watching that for 192 minutes with that frame rate. Everything looks almost real and with the 3D effect, it only adds up insofar it feels practically shot.However, since this might just win the throne for the best visual effects of all time, it comes at a cost, though it is entirely avoidable. The film has plenty of scenes that scream 'flaunting' & 'flexing'. You'll witness scenes that have little to no strong contexts and the only thing those scenes were made are to show how this film has a standard no other films have ever achieved before. It's a bit pathetic but damn, it was enjoyable to watch!Avatar: The Way of Water has a plot that is as par as the standard brought by Avatar 1. It isn't anything special or uniquely different but it is not boring either. However, the message both films want to send out is very transparent. But we can all agree on one thing. The story is not the franchise's strongest asset. The phrase style or I would say, visual over substance is the best way to put it. For instance, during the 45th minute mark or so, there's this 15-minute gap where the story basically turns plateau. It never moves for the sake of feeding the audience with eye-catching visuals. This sacrificial act is uncalled for as this follow up has so much potential to develop the story in a better way. But again, people put way too high expectations for James Cameron.You know that's a James Cameron film when you see one. Other than his trademark of making out-of-the-world blockbuster films, he has his unique ways of tapping into your heart and make you feel a whole spectrum of emotions in his movie; be it sad, happy, angst, anxious, doubts, guilty and the list goes on and on. Similar to Avatar 1, the sequel proves once again that Cameron is talented at telling his story while putting up front the emotional weight as the film goes along.His love towards nature and living things is beyond most humans. Cameron doesn't preach on what he cares but instead, it lets the story moves at its pace and includes the thematic elements on environment, aquatic life and greediness entirely and plays around with them. One thing's for sure though, Leonardo DiCaprio will love this movie for sure. 😉For those of you who want more of Pandora, I'm sorry to tell you that you may be disappointed. Avatar 2 is not a direct sequel and it doesn't want it to be. It sets almost a decade after the event of what happens in the 2009's blockbuster hit. This lies the problem; audience want more of Pandora but Cameron has his ideas on further expanding the world without looking behind at what makes Avatar 1 an outstanding feature. Yes, you get to see Pandora but have little expectations.As told earlier, some scenes are meant to brag about its sheer spectacular that will please the eyes. And bringing up another point, there are also lots of scenes that have jumpy narratives and messy cuts that I found them to be truly annoying. Don't go far, the first 10 minutes will show you how jumpy it is and throughout, they are cuts and splits that can be reorganized and made better. What's the rush, Cameron? You can spend more than 30 minutes flexing on the visuals and yet, the narrative that leads to the answers we've all been dying to know based on the trailer is unclear and lackadaisical.Verdict: Avatar The Way of Water is filled with mesmerizing and never-before-seen visuals accompanied with strong themes that will reflect how greedy and cruel we may (have) become. Yes, James Cameron is the Leonardo da Vinci of our generation and even if the story is nothing exceptional, this film will definitely age like a fine wine.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

If CGI was anything like that of say MCU or DC movies, Avatar-2 would have been just a 5/10 movie. That's how good the CGI looks. But the drama, story, dialogues are, at best, average.The movie could have been easily an 8 or 8.5/10 if the climax was bigger and more engaging. I presume, James Cameroon has held back the big things for the 3rd part. But that's the biggest letdown for this movie as the climax here seems very small, in scale and impact, compared to part 1's.James Cameroon knows how to push the emotional buttons of his audience. For example, no matter how badly people badmouth Titanic, the movie haunts us long after watching it. Avatar-1 too, to a lesser extent, managed to evoke some cathartic emotions in us. But in Way of Water, everything falls flat. I was not emotionally invested at any point. Only that I was wowed by beautiful landscapes and mesmerizing underwater shots. When someone dies, it doesn't hit us at all; when someone wins, it makes us only a little joyous; when someone survives, we don't feel relieved and so on.Despite all that, I was glad I watched it. Because Avatar-2's big screen experience was pretty good and should not be missed.PS: I found IMAX 3d to be not worth it. If I had an option, I would have just watched it on IMAX 2d as 3d makes the screen feel smaller than it actually is, thus somewhat ruining the big screen experience.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But it never gave me a reason to care. It's plot, story and reason for existence was very minimal. And there was nothing to gain for the antagonists or protagonists on both sides. Visually it's something to see. But i was expecting more from a project 10-years in the making. We don't get wonderful, scarce tales like Jurassic Park or The Matrix anymore. The standard has lowered because the culture has weakened, and the culture influences top-tier entertainment. And the vitality and boldness of taking a story somewhere interesting has been lost in mainstream cinema. Avatar 2 is a prime example of that. It's not bad, but I've seen better follow-up chapters in straight-to-dvd disney sequels. The tropes were basic, and storytelling was insignificant. And the movie was also. But I do appreciate and gloat in the visual wonder Cameron gives us. It's not not at the level of the first, nor other blockbusters I've seen in 2022. But it has it's enchantment.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The criticism has thrown James Cameron's effort to merely ""pretendians"", non-native people who when subjected to these traits and with generic native clothing or accessories appear Indigenous.The racist exploration of native people being reflected in the Avatar franchise may have offended indigenous people or Maroi to be particular who remained the center of the sequel but showing the film through the eyes of an alien, Jake Sully who inhabits a new body that mimics the native Navi, the tall blue humanoid species of Pandora, might have been ignorant of the fact that it actually is romanticizing the colonization that is much evident in the first part when the protagonist is sent initially for an imperialist mission.But let's talk purely on story merits. Although there is a deeper plot in the sequel introducing metkayina people of the reef, led by Ronal (Kate Winslet) and Tanowari (Cff Curtis), it lacks the story. Starting with the basic desire and message of the story that while protecting your family, you may lose everything viz, your place, your language, your people, your clan, and even your title, we lose the message on the way.In the first film, the white savior Jake Sully who sided with Navi after falling in love with the native Naytri defended Pandora from the human invaders who wanted their natural resources. They succeeded in defeating the invaders.In the sequel, Jake and Neytiri are living happily with their children and their stepdaughter Kiri and semi-feral human kid Spider when the ""sky people"" of the world reappear and want Jake Sully to be killed if they have any chance of looting and plundering Pandora.Jake Sully takes his family to the far end Metkayina people and soon have to learn the art of surviving deep under the water. The Sully's children and Tanowari Children were spiky and rivalrous in the beginning but then they find a way to be calm after Sully's elder son bonds with the whale-like creature Tulkun, who is abandoned by Metkayina people consider him a destroyer whereas it isn't. He was hit by Captain Mick Scoresby, who is hunting these species.So the film has nothing to do with humane emotions, twists, or surprises and nothing to carry on with the message. There is literally any character arc to be fulfilled or to overcome a misbelief. This misbelief inspires questions that make the story run.The high-tech film is full of CGI characters that mesmerize but they never link with your heart, so we start to care less about them.This flat story comes to the last scene eventually when there is a final fight between the Qatrich army and Metkayina clan along with Sully's family. It is when the underworld whale creature resonates back with fury and destroys the enemy ship and its weapons.Aside from the high-tech art superstructure what is there? Nothing. Yes, you can enjoy the three-hour-long film, if you are more of a video game lover knocking your opponent in a mystic world of unparallel creatures.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So many younger viewers have no understanding of the impact he has made upon action movies. Just watch action movies before the first Terminator move and Aliens. Those 2 movies took action to a much higher level than the movies before. As for understanding the power of the big screen, he's shown himself to be an expert with Titanic and the 2 Avatar movies.

But at least I appreciated the anti-colonial themes. The first Avatar stood up for minorities who were forced to adapt to the ways of the so-called modern people.In this Avatar sequel, the story continues as humans try to take over the planet of the indigenous people.Of particular note are the visuals, especially the ocean scenes are indeed very stunning and beautiful. This movie should be seen in theaters for sure.The story, however, is marred with problems. The beginning jumps years at a time, so it's hard to follow. Until the introduction of the water tribes, which makes things interesting. Them the story becomes unfocused... it dabbles in the mixing (and friction) between the mountain and sea tribes... bullying... humans learning the native culture... humans exploiting the nature... and one messy revenge action sequence that has captures and recaptures, crossing the line of violence, and dotted with juvenile quips... and how every single human and native disappears at the very end, leaving just the protagonist and antagonist to face off conveniently.Again, the water visuals come to the rescue at the end... but alas, I don't think it's enough.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) attack the planet again for colonization. Left with no choice, Jake and his loved ones seek refuge with the Metkayina clan and learn their culture and deep bonding with the sea.James Cameron's vision of creating the Na'vi world is incredible and clap-worthy. The underwater sequences here are breathtakingly beautiful and will leave you spellbound for sure. The near hour climactic fight is another technological advancement for Hollywood and I suspect it will need another Avatar sequel to surpass it.Undoubtedly, The Way of Water is a visual soother. It will make you yearn for more even though the film's runtime exceeds three hours and the basic plot is the conventional ""good aliens vs bad humans"" type. But its ok. And its awesome. Sometimes, great things are inherently simple yet highly effective. Aren't they?!!Regards,

-Not the most award winning, but familiar and just as passionate
-They know how to make cultural expression come to life and sound like a familial tribe that really works
-Worthington is still monotone and stoic, but yet makes it work and keeps the cool soldier/father role works super well for me.-Saldana's ability to sound like an alien tribal cat is impressive, and the raw emotions she rings out are part of the heart ripping moments that will drive a tear
-Weaver has some interesting changes to her voice, able to somewhat mask her voice, but yet adds a familiarity that should give you hints for a twist.-The rest play their parts well and do justice to the Avatar franchise crafting the cultural twist this movie is about.The Pace Mostly
-Uses the three hours quite well to tell a story
-Give you decent amount of information and emersion, but smartly uses time jumps to not get lost.-Handles past and present material very well and manages to keep things easy to follow
-The character stories moving in tandem are again easy to follow and are well-edited to help keep things ingrained.-Moves, but still has the cultural coming of age that works to give you the world building that this series thrives on.-Does well with placement of action, though more is always welcomed, it's placed well to ramp things up and add stakes.The Emotion is Big
-By far made me feel more in my heart than the first one
-Tied to characters and helps elevate the new cast beyond the simple love interests
-Helps establish edge and connection to help care about the characters and their rides and rooting for them to make it through
-Heartbreaking at times, and keeps the established danger that a movie needs to be exciting.-Deeper than the first one and trying to dive further into the minutia that is this series.The Coming Of Age Story At times
-Enjoyed the character development for many of the group, learning more about them and the ties they have to the big picture
-It handles different levels and responsibilities, while giving those quirks to members of the family.-Adds some heat and relationship building that works with the stereotypical interactions that many tribal histories have, alongside learning to establish an interesting dynamic.-Does not magically happen, you see the work and smarter storytelling that does not pull the Hallmark syndrome.-I think is going to be relatable to a lot of people, as the older characters get their own trials to get through, showing attention and care for the series and not just the new generation.The New Cultural Aspect Is Interesting
-Familiar like the first movie, but now moving to a different type of way of life on Pandora
-Not too much of a stretch, a fantastic blend that plays by Pandora's rules, does not break the boundaries, and still is slightly different to work.-Loved the fact that we saw establishments of bonds with nature, the building of family, and touching on cultural qualities without being too in your face.-And works with the story, without getting in the way of the pace for the most part, making for great world building to extend the story.-All while working with the theme of water they promised.The Science
-I'm a sucker for integrating of science to this world and just how amazing they build the world with realistic principles that don't feel too far out there.-The biology and ecology mixing together to make these unique flora and fauna paint a wonderful world to feast your eyes on.The familiarity and anatomy components add that elevated touch, and again makes a platform to once again discover the creativity of the visual department
-The fact it faces modern science vs. Traditional that again plays with the cultures of the two worlds and their approaches to action scenes.The Action To An Extent
-Placed very well, not too much, but also not quickly dropped or skipped out.-They did make sure to give the action it's due time and when the bigger scenes hit, it felt mostly complete and thought out.-The ending fight is big on many levels, and utilizes the world to a great degree that made the first one fun.-Comedic at times to balance out the tones.-A lot more emotional than the first one. Much more justice and character driven punches than the past. One of those emotional stakes moments than straight up combat.The Visuals/Sound Editing
-The best part of this movie, the visuals are gorgeous in how the fiction looks real and moves so well.-Attention to detail in the creatures movement and how lifelike it mirrors the beats they are modeled after, which was incredible to see in how every beast has the lifelike component.-The world is vivid, colorful, but adds so many layers to tell the story, with lighting being a key quality, and yet never gets in the way of seeing the details.-It plays so well with the culture, and the structural architecture is wonderful for how much it pulls the story together.-Sounds add more to the world and don't blow out your eardrums doing it, and I loved that immersion without going deaf.DISLIKES:Over Three Hours Long
-It's long, and at times you might feel it's long if you are seeking more action
-With three more parts coming, why did it need to be that much?-Was there a director's cut coming and if so will it help some of the other limitations?Character Balance Is Not As Level
-The first one did so much with the characters and keeping them integrated, while developing the story.-This film struggles to balance these characters to the same degree and many new people get pushed to the side with favoritism on other characters.-Lots of jumping between the group, with many secondary characters sort of missing that emotional connection to some others meaning weaker relationships.-Planning too much for the other sequels that might transition to more, but in this film is not as deep as I expect.-Zoe Saldana's character is out of it for most of the movie, only really coming back at the end.Predictable for 85%
-Not5 much to go off here, the movie has a lot of foreshadowing that will give off a lot of stuff down the line.-Follows a lot of the formula of the first and that helps further make things easy to guess.Some Very Disturbing/Hard Things to View
-Crosses one of my lines about animals, and even fake still hurts to watch
-The movie crosses dark corners and is going to be a bit tough to see these things come out, especially the depressing moments.-Those with a lot on their mind may be pulled down by these moments and not enjoy the ending's tie up for building to the third movie.-If you can't handle some of the more realistic battle moments, again, this movie is not the one to see.Annoying Character Gimmicks
-How many times do I have to hear, ""I'm good bro?""
-Some of the characters just scream, shrieks, and whining that don't do much
-Others are more about screaming and saying aye yi yi yi, and don't do more than that. It's cultural and tribal fitting in the world, but they don't have other things to balance out.-Other qualities that paint hardened antagonists, but then do little to deliver that punch.Action Is Different
-If you like story based action, this movie works for the emotional component.-However, the fighting flow does not work as well as the first, much more fractured and less integrative of the other contenders
-Takes more of a Rambo approach , which is cool, but again doesn't flow and sort of drags the moment on.-Some abilities are shown than cut short in favor of some drama elements that take away from the action.-A few scenes almost look like fast forward motion when things go heavy.May Have Needed More Time
-The jumps made for some faster story telling elements and we lost details on some elements I would have liked to see.-The character balance could have been solved with more time and we could have gotten a lot more of the integrative nature of the world.-Certain elements would not have felt so rushed, and maybe had more of the organic flow of the first had there again been more time.-Too much in one movie again? I think so.The VERDICT:
James Cameron's latest film is a visual masterpiece and the second bout on Pandora is just as stunning as ever. It's smart world building and storytelling, with great attention to detail on building the world further and honoring the characters that played the first world so well. Action that is placed well dances with drama, integrating many characters to the world and playing that cultural collaboration so well that it's a true science-fiction opera for many to relate to. Though the pace is welcoming to blunt the 3 hour run time, there are times where it seems things got cut, and tried to juggle too much to give the solid character development that the first one did a little better. With more questions answered and news ones arising, this middle movie mostly feels a standalone, but the focus on more movies may have been the thing to limit the movie a bit. Still, it's a film that did its job well and in my opinion worth a trip to the theater, including 3-D showings. My scores are:Action/Adventure: Fantasy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Avatar has always been just a fantasy dream of natives being able to fight off settlers with more advanced tech than them, but I think the audience was expecting a bit more intricacy this time in terms of the plot.

So I was obviously waiting impatiently for over 10 years to see this. The first Avatar was a visual feast with a story that served it well enough to draw us in and make us care once the action (and deeply subversive message) of the third act hit. Now that we're already familiar with Pandora and the characters, I was hoping this one would build upon that story, while also introducing a new villain, raising the stakes, and pushing the subversive message further, but no... that's not what happens. (I won't spoil it, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm referring to here.) This just felt like a lazy script that was thrown together quickly so they could spend the majority of their time on the visual FX, which don't get me wrong, are absolutely jaw-dropping. I gave the film 5/10 almost entirely for that reason.It's worth seeing in the theaters for the visual experience alone, but I'm disappointed because I expected so much more from a master like James Cameron. I was so bored and had such little investment in the characters by the third act that I actually found myself laughing at moments that were supposed to be heartfelt. (""Noooo! She was my soul sister!"")If I wanted a CGI theme park ride with a lazy story, I'd go watch a Marvel movie. You can do better than this, James. I mean, come on, you have to put more in than ""Ok... same basic plot as the first one, but now we're underwater..."" And the dialogue of the teenagers... I get that their father is originally from Earth, but they are growing up in a village on another planet full of those who aren't. They're not going to go around saying ""bro"" every other word. That's just lazy, sloppy writing. I'm really hoping he puts more into the script of the next one, if he really does plan on making more of these.","22 out of 31 found this helpful.

And it's gonna grow.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8747022/?ref_=tt_urv","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24085266/?ref_=tt_urv","20 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water, also known as Avatar 2, is the long-awaited sequel to 2009's technical marvel; now thirteen years later Avatar 2 is FINALLY here, but does it live up to the hype? I think the world is gonna be divided into TWO firmly-defined camps when it comes to Avatar 2: HELLA-YES, or HELLA-NO! This film is definitely gonna be a firm talking point of 2022's sporadic year at the cinema, what with films like Top Gun 2 and The Batman being high-points, but so many duds like Black Adam and Strange World also weighing the year's slate down with... the sheer bulk of delayed releases alone.Avatar 2 continues the first movie's exploration of Pandora, and its got more time to spare (which some of the film's water-scenes could have been trimmed to accommodate a more forgiving runtime) what with this being shot back-to-back with Avatar 3 and 4 (and maybe even some of Avatar 5(and/or 6 too?)?) over the course of half a decade and then some. Clearly this film was no easy breezy task to tackle: and considering these movies cost a collective $1-billion + to make, it's gotta make nigh-HERCULEAN box office returns to justify its existence alone.Anywho, is the story any good, are the characters likeable and is the music good? The answer is yes to all those things, though the screenplay could certainly be stronger next time; the story has more elements of Disney's 1999 Tarzan (at least for me it did) than just straight up FernGully/Pocahontas like the first one. But the Na'vi cultures and characters have more development than the previous film, and it's pretty clear this film is expanding Avatar's Universe significantly. And the music, though somewhat weak at parts, still evokes James Horner's grandiose in spite of his unfortunate 2015-passing. The direction makes you wish James Cameron would do another Alien film, or even direct a Star Wars film with a Lawrence-Kasdan-penned screenplay; but Avatar 2 shows the man's still got a sensibility for cinematic flare and scale.Though the film's certainly not perfect, it's far from fatally flawed either; though if the FOLLOWING sequels have more or less the same structure of story and character-beats we might be in big trouble. For a Part-Two to a long-awaited movie, there's certainly been worse: and the visual effects are of course better than the first movie's effects. There could have been some trimming of what I'll call the 'fish-bonding scenes', but aside from some minor pacing issues, Avatar 2 is ample entertainment for those of us wanting an investing Space Opera (more like Planet Opera) to escape to in these unpredictable times. Plus the whole 'DNA factor' to the story was a refreshingly creative touch and was deeper than the first one's approach).Avatar 2 is a visually stimulating experience that might not be the most demanding story in cinema history, but it's a space-fantasy that gets its job done without being downright hokey or boring. Here's hoping Avatar 3 gets ever crazier/riskier with what's in the pipeline already.4/5 stars. Avatar 2 is perfectly imperfect, and hopefully the world-building will get even deeper next time.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The visuals were stunning, captivating and captured every moment gloriously with Cameron written all over it. James Cameron pulls you down so deep, and sets you so gently adrift, that at times you don't feel like you're watching a movie so much as floating in one. Although the visual effects were something never seen before, there were shortcomings when it came to storytelling.The sequel is just a continuation of surviving in planet Pandora with nothing much to offer storywise regarding Navi's or anything whatsoever, with a bit stretched runtime (which could have used 15-20 mins less). But the super gorgeous, beautifully shot and crafted visuals makes it up for the somewhat weak storyline and the extended runtime is forgotten.To summarise, Avatar: The Way of Water is a clear improvement on its predecessor with regards to its jaw-dropping visuals making this an irresistible return to Pandora, although the story isn't breaking new ground. Let's hope the part 3 will be a total feast in every aspect.My Rating : 8.5/10.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The Sully family is bigger and stronger than ever, and each of Jake's and Neytiri's offspring carry distinct traits. I'm glad Cameron tapped the writing duo of Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver to pen the screenplay alongside him. They're the kind of writers who can handle spectacle while keeping the film's emotional core intact throughout the 185-minute runtime. Sufficient screentime is spent establishing the strengths and weaknesses of the Sullys, while the Metkayina clan who comes to their aid, is painted in broader strokes.Needless to say how incredible the visual effects are here - Weta FX has done a spectacular job coming up with an avant-garde style of motion capture - given that much of the film takes place in and around water. I'm really hoping we get to see some of the sequels in ""glasses-free 3D"", as Cameron remarked. To say that my eyes were overwhelmed by different shades of blue, is an understatement. As the title suggests, the best scenes in the film are the ones underwater. Simon Franglen takes over from (the late) James Horner, and much of his original score is thankfully retained.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

So I didn't rush head first into watching the 2022 sequel ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", on the notion that James Cameron was just doing another copy and paste of another movie as well here in the sequel.Though, I had the opportunity to sit down in 2023 and watch it, and so I did. And I have to admit that the storyline in ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was definitely much, much better than the storyline in the first movie. And I don't think that the storyline in ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", as written by James Cameron, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno, was a rip off of another movie.Something I have to put my finger on in the storyline, however, is how effortlessly and quick the members of the forest Na'vi adapted to and became members of the sea Na'vi, that was a bit anti-climatic and also just seemed to be done that quickly to speed up the storyline. It took away some of the credibility from the storyline in my opinion.They have a great cast ensemble once again for the movie, though I have to say that the return of Stephen Lang as the villain was just somewhat laughable and felt like taking a short cut. The storyline would have benefitted from a new and different villain. And with the likes of Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis on the cast list, you know you're in capable hands.""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was visually impressive. And I mean that in the utmost manner. The attention to detail, the world building and the creature concepts in the movie are just spectacular, breathtaking and colorful to look at. The movie is actually worth watching a second time, just to take in the splendors of the scenery, nature, the creatures, the colors and the entire harmony that they created on Pandora.Running 192 minutes, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" can seem long. But I actually found it to be okay, because there is a lot to take in throughout the movie if you observe the scenery, creatures, colors, etc.""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a movie in a whole different league in comparison to the 2009 movie ""Avatar"".My rating of the storyline itself warrants a six out of ten stars, but the amazing visuals in the movie notches the overall impression up to an eight out of ten stars.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Your movie preferences will decide how you balance those facets and so what you make of the film.The visuals are fabulous. Imagination and technical wizardry combine to create a world of beauty that fills the screen with wonder. Avatar had the same quality of course, but James Cameron is in love with water, as we saw with both The Abyss and Titanic.The script is a bit problematic, with too many lines that ring false. That was true with Avatar too of course. But with both films I was so engrossed in the visual wonder to almost not notice the script.The family dynamic at the core of this film adds emotional weight to the events on screen, creating an additional degree of investment in what happens to the characters. Unfortunately that was punctured somewhat by the overused plot device of a child that keeps ignoring his parents and walking into danger.The first half of the film takes the time to create the world of wonder and the relationships that drive events. The second half is a constant barrage of incredible action and edge of your seat excitement. While the action sequences in Avatar are tremendous, The Way of Water somehow surpasses even that high benchmark.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The story just isn't there. Typically in a good sequel the story is expanded and the protagonist takes on a bigger goal than the original. This movie takes the opposite approach and seems to take on a smaller role than the original while repeating the same themes albeit with the next generation. Whenever there is a major plot event or when someone is in danger you can predict what will happen next. The story isn't bad it just seems like an excuse for the special effects. There is nothing original from a plot stand point, if this was a book or novella I can imagine it being briefly popular with early teen readers.The effects are very good but they aren't ground breaking like the original Avatar. If you have a 4k 70+ in tv it's probably worth watching just to see what special effects can show now a days but I doubt this movie will be remembered in 10 years and it has limited rewatchability. It reminds me of Star Wars episode 1, both in the water scenes and the depth of story. My prediction is that this will settle in the 6.8 range.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"10","/10","There will never be a great Moby Dick movie, but luckily there is Avatar: The Way of Water","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8742886/?ref_=tt_urv","nehpetstephen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0408027/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2022","There have been many attempts to film Herman Melville's Moby-Dick; or, the Whale. Some, like the 1998 tv miniseries with Patrick Stewart, have made a more earnest effort to stay faithful to the source material, but they all are ultimately disappointing because the task itself is a fool's errand. Moby-Dick was a novel written in 1851 American English; a movie--and try to look beyond the obviousness of what I'm saying--can never be a novel written in 1851 American English. A movie made in 2022 can only ever be a movie made in 2022, and so Avatar: The Way of Water--stay with me--may be the closest will we ever get to a spiritual adaptation of Moby-Dick to film that can speak to us in the same way that Melville hoped to speak to his contemporaries.By saying this, I don't mean that this sequel to Avatar is an attempt to adapt Moby-Dick to the big screen, although clearly the mid-film scenes of hunting ""tulkuns"" in order to harvest the extremely valuable liquid inside of them were directly inspired by scenes from that book. What I mean more than that is that The Way of Water has the same feeling, the same composition, and overall some of the same messages as Melville's novel. In crafting Moby-Dick, Melville was able to pull together all the influences that his audience would have been very familiar with: Biblical scripture and Great Awakening oratory, the iambic pentameter of Shakespeare, protoevolutionary scientific literature, bloody adventure tales mythologizing the lucrative whaling industry, anthropological ethnologies, and so on. The chapters are written differently to reflect these different discourses, and often his keen observation treats them with satirical distance, albeit a biting satire that one can easily mistake for sincerity. Cameron would be a fool to incorporate the same influences into his twenty-first century film, so instead he draws from the sources that we are more familiar with: the nature documentary, the ecological disaster film, the militaristic action blockbuster, the coming-of-age, star-crossed romance, and the outsiders/outcasts-banning-together sci-fi parable. In many cases, Cameron has already made masterpieces in these genres, so he's also evoking his own oeuvre. He knows the language of cinema just like Melville knew the language of literature, and he can distill each form to the essences that make them endure. The averted glance of a teenager in love, the horror of a destroyed environment, the thrill of a battle between high-tech machines and oppressed freedom fighters--Cameron has been filming all that for years, and he does so extremely well.Cameron's reckless disregard for conventional storytelling structure also parallels Melville's. Moby-Dick will end a chapter with two gossiping sailors ending their secret conversation because they see the villain approaching with ""something bloody on his mind,"" only to begin the next chapter with thirty pages of taxonomic classification of whale species. Cameron's 192-minute movie likewise will juxtapose an intimate family scene against an abrupt battle sequence; will show us that the villains are inching closer toward having the upper hand only to then linger on children admiring the seascape for fifteen minutes. This was very jarring and off-putting to me at first, but once I learned to embrace the experience as being something beyond my complete comprehension and control, I surrendered to a feeling akin to believing the stories in the Book of Genesis. This was mythic storytelling that was going to place me in vivid moments of an imaginary realm. Unlike the original Avatar, there are no exposition dumps nor any carefully choreographed structure signposting how one scene leads to the next. Instead, when you learn that there is a human fishing crew operating in the oceans of Pandora, you are simply supposed to expect that this world is much larger and more complicated than you initially assumed. The original Avatar seemed small and artificial to me, but this version of Pandora comes across as a vast, immersive, fully realized world with many different people in it.Melville faced technological progress with wonder yet also fear, questioned the power of authority to dangerously oversimplify while nevertheless succumbing to the awe that authority and prowess evokes, and celebrated the differences among individuals, species, and cultures while also embracing their potential to bond together over their similar interests. Melville showed masculinity in all its dangerous, fragile, and inspiring forms. Avatar: The Way of Water does many of the same things in a way that speaks to modern filmgoers.Cameron has made a film that greatly surpasses the original. Just like Melville took the nineteenth-century American novel to its most experimental and essential form, Cameron has given us a film that showcases twenty-first-century filmmaking in its highest and most consummate capacity. This is more of an experience than a mere movie, and it should be experienced under the best possible conditions, i.e. 3D IMAX, by anyone interested in seeing a sci-fi master using cutting edge technology to transcend reality and take us deep into his imaginative dreams.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't know how James Cameron keeps doing this... How much money does he have because just wow. Everything looked so beautiful and eye-catching just like the first movie. Soundtrack was nice and fitting and the action scenes were amazing from start to end. It gave me very similar vibes to the prequel which is a good thing.Now for the bad though. The ending was all over the place, I did not like it. I fell asleep like 3 times because the movie was so long, it could've easily been less than 3 hours and still been good but that is what that is. Also kids in general ruin movies for me. Every time there's a kid and drama revolves around them, it just doesn't entertain me. I would've loved if it kept revolving 'just' around Jake and his gf. But those are just cherry pickings. In general it was almost as good as the prequel in my opinion. Definitely give it a watch.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

However it's not long before the sly people show up again in Pandora.... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: After many years of delays, the long awaited sequel from James ""King of the World"" Cameron is FINALLY released. To be honest, it's been so long (13 years) that I don't remember much of the plot of the original Avatar, but I do recall the immersive viewing experience that it was. For this sequel, it seems that Cameron is concerned that a complex storyline might distract us and hence there is very little plot, basically that forest people becoming sea people are GOOD, and that sky people are BAD. Around that paper-thin premise, Cameron builds a visual spectacle that intends to encompass and overwhelm you, and guess what: Cameron succeeds. Along the way, Cameron liberally borrows from Star Wars (the sky people's main vessel is the ocean-equivalent of the Death Star), and from his own Titanic. Is the movie too long? Frankly yes and the initial 60-75 min. Could've/should've been trimmed quite a bit. But in the end, enjoy it for what it is: a visual experience unlike anything you've ever experienced. And did I tell you that forest people becoming sea people are GOOD? And that sky people are BAD?""Avatar: The Way of Water"" opened last weekend. We saw it on Christmas day. The afternoon/early evening XD 3D screening where we saw it at here in Cincinnati was well attended but nowhere near sold out, somewhat to my surprise. IF you saw the original Avatar and enjoyed it, I'd readily suggest you check out this sequel, and draw your own conclusion.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is more original instead of being a Dances With Wolves rip off but is 30 minutes too long and Sigourney Weaver simply cannot play a teenager even with motion capture.

The way of water has neither. The main story is of a revenge flick with a secondary theme of how we murder animals for profit and for the running time it's not enough. The first movie has clichéd characters but there is enough development of them to keep us interested. Here, the main characters are given nothing to do and the kids who are given the most screen time are a series of clichés. Having said that, the visuals are truly stunning and need to be seen to be believed.

The creatures they create are not as imaginative as Avatar 1, not even to compare Star Wars. The messages brought out are so cliche and shallow to be easily forgotten. I can understand it is an all age friendly movie and they want to deliver some good messages to the children. But it doesn't mean it can be that cliche, see what Pixar can do as children movies maker?Maybe that's the reality of box office, to get a box office success with an average, bland story.

To complain about it drawing on other sequels by have the kids involved was obviously written by someone who probably lives alone or in their mother's basement surrounded by their comic books and He-Man dolls.

I thought the 3D effects in the 1st were great, but the underwater sequences were just next level. It's just astonishing. A visual feast to behold. James Cameron did it again with all the right formulas to make this great. Great character development and a solidly suspenseful and action packed story line. In saying that, the real star is the 3D visual effects. This movie just pops! Comedy, action, and emotion were on point, too. Please see this in 3D at your cinema. It is beautiful!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

From the moment it started up to the end credits I was in awe by how visually pleasing this film was and at times I felt as if I was transported to Pandora itself. The CGI and the performances in the film were what made it worthwhile. Unfortunately, I felt that the movie was let down by the script. In the film, Jake and his family are trying to protect themselves against the humans (sky people) as well as a familiar villain from the first film - sound familiar? It felt like the storyline for this sequel was an exact replica to the first one except this time they've thrown in a few new characters, creatures and scenery on the planet. As much as I loved watching several of the scenes in the film that followed Jake's family and their lives away from their home in the forest it felt like they were just written in the script to keep the audience captivated by the visuals and encourage them to forget that the plot wasn't really going anywhere. I only really felt gripped an hour into the film as nothing in the first half seemed to really be happening. I also think some of the characters could have been written better as many of them I didn't really care about. Regardless of a couple script issues though the film was thoroughly entertaining and awe-inspiring; I admire the people behind the film's ability to bring such a vivid and beautiful fictitious world to life. I'll definitely be treating the upcoming films with the same level of excitement and it's good to hear that there won't be 13 year intervals between each one! My only concern is that they continue to prioritise the 'human VS alien' cliche storyline in the future films that has already been used twice now and hope that they branch off into something a little bit different in terms of the script otherwise people might start losing interest. Overall, decent follow up to the first film: 7/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Everything that James Cameron did in the first film technically, is on a whole different caliber. My primary issue is the same one I had with the original Avatar, and that is the story. It's not bad at all, it's just very surface level. I'm not saying that all stories have to be complex, but when it come to this film it was a clear case of ""Style over Substance."" Avatar The Way of Water was absolutely worth the wait.

The worst part was the terrible writing in this movie which contains many cheesy, lines and superficial, childish dialogue. The unintersting plot didn't justify the movie's three hour duration. I desperately waited for this movie to end. Besides that, the characters were all flat, especially the villain is straight out of a comic book. That would be enough for it to be a bad movie, but no the screenwriters even chose an ending that made the second movie meaningless. The visuals were good but can not make up for the rot that is Avatar. I will definitely not watch any Avatar movie in the future.","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was disappointed by the story in the first film and it's similarities to past films (Pocahontas, Dances with wolves, etc). I never seen a memorable sequel to a story like that. Mr Cameron is responsible for 2 of the 3 best sequels ever made (Aliens and T2, GF2 being the third). If anyone can pulls off a sequel to a familiar story and make it unique and awe inspiring, it's Jim. And he did.Avatar the way of water is a superior film in every way. Right off the bat the effects are superior to the already superior 13 yr old effects from the first. 9 or 10 times during the film I muttered to myself, "" how the hell did they do this?"" A wonderful feeling I haven't felt since Jurassic Park in 1993. I couldn't tell what was real or fake. Just incredible. The motion capture performances are captured so convincingly that I thought I was looking at actors in high quality make-up. Zoe Saldana is a gifted mo-cap actor. A true stand out. This film made the effects in contemporary Marvel or Star Wars movies look silly, amateurish and glaringly inferior.The story is fast paced and engrossing. Three hours felt like an hour and a half. Some similar beats to the first one but an entirely new story. Amazing film.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

The script could be a lot tighter and there's no doubt a bit of bloat, and, along with some plot holes, you do have some character motivations that don't make a ton of sense, but if you grade this film like you would a figure skater, where difficulty of routine and ingenuity is going to increase potential score well beyond that skater that has great technique, but doesn't take risks, then this one is an all timer.Visually, it is simply the best looking computer generated film of all time. Every second, I was in complete awe of the beauty of the dang thing, and the incredible, painstaking attention to detail that made an almost entirely animated world come to life. The water scenes in particular were breathtaking...I felt like a child oohing and aahing at every single image, calling out to daddy James Cameron to ""Do it again dad! Do it again!""And I never tired of it either. One of the weakest moments of the film was when Jake decided the family needed to leave the forest and find a new home, a move that called into question the motivations of all sides of the conflict. I could've easily been sidetracked by this oversight, but it was obvious that Cameron was just looking for any old reason to get the Sullys out of the forest and into the water. Once they do get there, though, this transforms into an hour and a half long hang out movie, where you just spend time with this family as they acquaint themselves with their new surroundings and develop relationships with the Metkayina.I can't even imagine how a pitch like this might go to a Disney exec:""So, i want these characters to just go to some tropical land, ingratiate themselves with the natives, learn their ways and spend a lot of time underwater, where I can showcase this new technology that makes computer generated water look absolutely real. What's that? What's going to happen? Just what I said. They're going to hang out and learn the environment. Yep...for an hour and a half. No sir, nothing is actually going to move the plot of the movie forward during this time. Yes. I'm confident that it will be incredible and people will pay out the nose to watch it in 3D in IMAX. What's that? Why should you trust me on this? Because my name is James Freaking Cameron.""And you know what? I, for one, am here for all of it. I could've handled another two hours of chilling in Hawaii with the Sullys. Could've been content to leave it all there for the rest of the movie tbh, but, you know Cameron had to go ahead and throw it all together with the greatest CGI action finale I've ever seen. The dude is an absolute mensch.The thing that impressed me the most about all of this, was that Cameron has actually...unbelievably...here... right now...in 2022 given us a grand, sprawling epic, with unbelievably well constructed action set pieces and choreography, perfectly integrated with the greatest imaging ever put to celluloid and it's going to make bazillion dollars and it is not rooted in IPs that are more that fifty years old that have been culturally defining, vehicles of nostalgia. He actually created something that is his own, and he's poured almost twenty years of his life into making it something great and he doesn't really care what expectations the pundits and critics and execs (or even public for that matter) are attempting to place on his shoulders. He's just making something that he loves, that includes all of the stuff he's interested in and all the themes he wants to reflect on. It's his movie...and it's a game changer. I can't predict how everyone's going to take it, but man I sure do hope this thing has legs. I hope Cameron keeps getting all the money he needs to finish making this series. I'm in James. IN!!!One more thing: I love that, as it expands in grandeur, it contracts thematically, moving from global issues to family ones. This film is ultimately a reflection on family: what it means to be in one and what our collective responsibilities are to each other. I fell absolutely in love with each of them and can't wait to see where their stories take us in the next few years. The strengths and weakness of each one weave perfectly together and contribute to making the collective strong.""Wherever we go, this family is our fortress. A father protects. It's what gives him meaning.""","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The part when they started to hunt the whales just really made me uncomfortable and then they even show that they killed it for some fluid extracted from the whale's brain. It is totally shameful in my view.The other motivation of this human race is to look for another planet to live. Is this the only way? To kill the entire population of a single planet?

It's a recycled story yes, but there's enough originality paired with much improved CGI and gorgeous visuals and rendering, that the plot and its faults don't really matter.Anyone complaining about it being boring and unoriginal shouldn't have watched it in the first place because it's obviously not meant for the majority of them, because if they weren't impressed in the slightest by the first one, there's no way they'd enjoy this one. So why torture yourself and then spread unnecessary and undeserving hate for the sequel?On top of the stunning effects, there were a lot of cool little things about it. I loved how realistic it was when it came to small details like how bullets shot into water behave, and how Na'vi children raised by a natural Na'vi mother and once-human father behave. Lots of neat little details really help keep the audience's interest.Lot of questions were answered, lots are still a mystery. Smart move. Well done James Cameron.

The glowing water and amazing animals, exhibits how advanced CGI really is. However, the story lacked emotion and was clearly focused on showing the beauty of their Planet and how their society works. I understand that James Cameron wanted this movie to be a tree hugging movie to captivate the audience, making them want to help our planet. Extreme creativity and current world issues don't go hand in hand. Making it so creative (which I love) defeats the purpose of tackling a real problem that Cameron wants us all to contribute to ending. I extremely respect his passion for ending climate change but placing this topic in a Avatar movie doesn't work. James Cameron is clearly very fascinated by technology in filmmaking. This has taken a toll on his love for story telling. The story telling in Avatar: The Way of The Water lacks emotion and just simple captivity. I'm not a massive fan of if 3 hour movies, but a movie of that length needs to captivate the audience and if it doesn't, it just won't entertain the audience.

In all honesty I wasn't overly excited to sit through this 3-hour 12minute of a film. Don't get me wrong, 2009s Avatar blew me away visually when it came out and while the story is fine it didn't leave me clamoring for more with its predictability. I remember figuring out the entire film within the first 15 minutes and was able to recite the accompanying dialogue more often than not. With over a decade to improve technology and film techniques, I expected the visuals to be even more outstanding and worthy of a view. As for the storyline itself I wasn't necessarily ""feeling"" the hype to see the newest film, Avatar: The Way of Water. The vagueness of the trailers kept me on the fence right up to an hour before movie time. Yes, I toyed with the idea of just getting a refund and waiting until I could stream this one at home.Damn glad I didn't.Avatar: The Way of Water is one of those rear sequels that is more of the same in many aspects, yet also manages to be entertainingly different. And better. Yes, much better than the original. I'm not sure how Cameron pulled it off, but he did so beautifully.Much like Avatar, Avatar: The Way of Water is far from subtle or nuanced in its messaging or morality. The plot is straight forward and simple. The good guys are practically saintly, and the bad guys are purely, unabashedly evil. Very black and white, little to no shades of gray. The dialogue can be eye-rolling cheesy and pedestrian. Even some of the acting of a couple of the new characters is weak.Here's the thing......None of those matters.Avatar: The Way of Water works, nonetheless. It's as visually stunning as expected. I ended up seeing it in 3D and WOW. Just W-O-W. There's one underwater sequence alone where I felt completely submerged in the world of Pandora and its sea life and it was worth the price of admission alone. But yes, the visuals are spectacular and hold up throughout the entire film. Slow clap and a chef's kiss for all the artists that once again brought all the colors and textures of Pandora to life. And the underwater scenes? Mind blowing!But TwoW happily delivers more than just pretty pictures.The Soundtrack is as rich and dynamic as the visuals. The action is thrilling to edge of your seat intense. I found myself quite anxious and holding my breath numerous times. The familiar is interwoven with the new world building/expansion seamlessly. The characterization is meatier and makes for a more compelling story. The focus of family kept me fully invested in who these people are and what happens to them (for better or worse). At this point I just have to say, effing kids! Uggh. A phrase that became my personal mantra. There are also some nice surprises to be had not only in the characters that pop up but in the actors behind them.Avatar: The Way of Water is not only worth the 13 year wait, but also definitely worth the trip to your local movie theater. Yes, it's a long film (skip the soda and get an Icee), but it certainly didn't feel like it. My interest never wavered; my eyes never left the screen. I never regretted seeing this one at the theater. Unlike so many of the highly anticipated, hyped films this year, Avatar: The Way of Water actually delivers an amazing, entertaining movie going experience. This is a film meant to be seen on the big screen and should be viewed accordingly. Can't emphasize that enough. Avatar: The Way of Water is good old movie magic and I thank James Cameron for delivering it to us once again. Like the Na'vi, I see you Cameron and your movie is as badass as feral Neytiri.Can't wait to see the next installment in 2024!Until then Avatar: The Way of Water gets a 9.5 from me.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

That being said I believe for the visuals and the world of avatar it is worth a watch but the story was just lacking.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The cgi is gorgeous, especially the underwater scenes. While the story itself is rather simple, and the theme's ultimately boil down to ""family,"" that's honestly all it needed. Im simply stunned James was able to pull this off after 10 years. Now this isn't to say the movie is without flaws. It's a little long, and I personally think shaving 15 minutes off the runtime could've really streamlined it. If you're looking for deep introspective writing and complicated themes, perhaps this film isn't for you. But if you're like me, and are just happy to visit pandora again, this movie will please you greatly.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

In spite, I was looking forward to experiencing the sequel thirteen years later in 2022.The story takes place years after the events of the original Avatar film, where Jake Sully now lives with his family on Pandora. Then, once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, in the form of the evil humans wanting to hunt down Jake, he must work with Neytiri, his four children, and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by Cameron's latest achievement. The expected visual spectacle is definitely in focus and it is astonishing to look at with beautiful cinematography (although not nearly as revolutionary as in 2009).Another strength of the film was the theme of family, which I found quite moving and emotionally charged during several scenes. I found the story to be wonderfully told and well-paced, and although clicking in at well over three hours, I did not find it excessively long. I highly recommend it for its entertainment value and as being a worthy follow-up to the original and in my opinion unbeatable original Avatar film from 2009.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The mechanism of Na'vi tribe is old in the mind of the audience, thus the bonding with spectacular sea animals and the development of it seems another repeated thing. We have been fed a whole lot of under-the-water animal planet scenes, but ironically couldn't see much underwater fighting.The issue is between the 13 years, we have experienced many great epic battles in visually stunning ways such as in ""End Games"", and ""GOT"", the lore of Avatar 2 is just not exciting enough.

Boy was I wrong. Cinematically, this movie was outstanding but there were so many other levels I appreciated it on.1. Family themes. This was the first movie that made me actually emotional/tear up in as long as I can remember. The family story woven throughout was deeply impactful. Much of it relatable, but generally just displaying the complexities of siblings, parents, family of origin issues and so on.2. Nature themes. I'm a huge animal lover, specifically ocean animals so I loved how big a role the whales played in the film. The connection between human/avatar and animal was powerful and the general connection and engagement between the characters and nature was spiritual as well. Love a film that displays the truth of that.3. The film accurately displayed complexities of humanness for lack of a better term. There was a scene towards the end where a character makes a decision that may or may not have been right or ethical etc. But it's honestly how most of us would have responded and I appreciated that.4. It wasn't too long. Was it a long movie? Absolutely yes. But it was all essential and necessary to me. Everything was important and added to the depth of the story.5. Almost non-stop action. Yes, there is a decent chunk in the middle that is slower but 70% of the movie was heart in my throat, high anxiety action with a worthy ending.6. Set up the third movie well. There are a lot to be addressed, left to unravel in the upcoming films and I look forward to seeing how it plays out.All said, this was one of the best movies I've ever seen and I'm glad I got to see it in the cinema.

Avatar 2, thanks to the development of technology and experience, takes the franchise one step ahead and sets yet another benchmark. But it is not the visuals that I am most impressed off. It is the narrative. When the film released and first reviews started coming in it was more of how I expected the film to be received. As ""Chosen One"" narratives usually tend to be, I assumed this film was going to be inferior than its predecessor. My expectations with audience reaction was that it will be considered as ""beautiful visual but weak story"" film but when I saw it I was surprised that its story is solid, perhaps even better than the First in certain aspects .The First was about Sully, the origin of the Hero. It was a classic ""chosen one"" story which is perhaps humanity's greatest story trope when it comes to storytelling albeit most used too. My apprehension with that trope is it doesn't have longevity.With the Second, Cameron very bravely gives us the other take of the ""chosen one"" narrative. Sort of the aftermath. How one can't always be the hero and how one cannot always be the one sacrificing unconditionally. That change in narrative not only brings layer to Sully and Neytiri but is also a breath of fresh air in terms of how Chosen One stories go.The Second one also brings half a dozen new characters and their dynamics into it. It brings more human ideas like family and friendship which were not there as prominent as this one in the First. This is also a positive change in my opinion. It not only increases the stakes but also invests the audience into the characters more which in turn brings much required longevity.Finally, this time Cameron goes further deep into his idea of nature's war with human.

Not just their family, but those humans that had decided to stay on Pandora.Ten years past and the humans are back, and it's in the first minutes of the movie that you immediately see the illusion that is the story that James Cameron tries to sell. Because had they done the smart thing, humanity could've taken Pandora with almost no effort. Everything else about the Na'vi putting up any fight, lies with the incredible convenience they can use any lifeform of Pandora to fight on their side. The story of this movie can be reduced to Cameron taking the occupation of North America by those of the Old World, and adding several convenient fighting options against the invaders.Jake is the family man trying to close the holes in the dam with his fingers. Neytiri is either complaining, angry, complaining and angry, or showing she's no better than those she hates.The journey and fate of their sons and daughters is just too predictable. To the point you get to not even half the movie, that is over three hours long, and you can already accurately guess who's going to make it or not.There's really just one character that holds an interesting mystery. That knowing Cameron and what he did in this movie, we can already guess what the answer to the mystery is. At least I'm almost sure the answer is staring everyone in the face.And of course because new enemies are apparently hard to make, Cameron had to come up with an excuse to bring back the old ones. An excuse that comes into conflict with another new miraculous resource unique to Pandora, as if Unobtanium wasn't enough.The movie is mostly supported by visual effects, that are unsurprisingly some of the best I've seen on any movie. With an adequate but not at all groundbreaking soundtrack.Thirteen years later and to see that story wise this was the best James Cameron could come up with, does show why Cameron said what he said about Terminator: Dark Fate. The story in this movie is nothing new, nothing never seen before, it isn't even that well executed. Considering Jake knew humans would of course come back one day, to see how surprised they were that the humans came back says everything anyone needs to know about this movie.And with the exception of just one character, none of the old and new characters really saves the story of the movie. That I excepted a lot from.Avatar: The Way of Water is a good movie, heavily supported by VFX. But story wise it's no Infinity War or Endgame. And if this is the best Cameron can do story wise, then any future sequel will have very little to stand on.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Rather the movie is shot more consciously & lengthy. Just as all the beings in the first part believe in spirituality of forest is replaced by sea this time. VFX are like God level. The whole series is planned for 5 parts. I expect rest 3 parts to be plotted in different worlds.This series is not just an entertainment, it also conveys a message of divine nature relations with our day to day life. If we observe carefully, it teaches us how to protect & live with our environment, as we loosing our interactions with the spirit of nature in the technology booming world. That's why movie named 'Avatar'
Avatar is a Sanskrit word which doesn't have an exact translation into English. The best I came up with is Shapeshifting or Transforming just as Jake Sully turns into Toruk Makto. Or Avatar also means Incarnation or Descent.🙏","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I kept noticing the massive box office take and realising frankly I didn't want to miss out - I didn't want to miss what could potentially be a visual spectacular on the big screen.Rest assured, it is a visual spectacular. Absolutely astonishing to watch. The best visual effects I've seen.But visuals aside, I thought it was a beautiful, hard-hitting, emotional (if simple) story. That simplicity doesn't detract from the experience in any way. What adds many layers to this simple story are the much deeper and personal characters on display here.I was completely swept up in this simply amazing film.

The Sky People have returned and seem like they're here to stay.It's easily the best film I've seen in IMAX 3D, and the best use of 3D technology I've ever witnessed.After waiting over a decade I didn't think it would captivate me as much as it did, but the sheer beauty of it all, along with a nicely fleshed out plot, has made me eager for more.I disagree with a lot of the reviews on here about a lack of plot and poor script, completely unfounded in my opinion. For a 3+ hour film I didn't once find myself getting bored or hoping for it to end.I know it won't win best picture but it deserves a couple of Oscars at least for sound and visual effects.Highly recommend seeing this film at the cinema, and just appreciate how visually stunning it is!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Seriously, watching this in 3D Imax is a must for everyone. There is not one moment where you go ""that character looks so fake,"" or ""that character moves so fake."" This ain't no ""Black Panther"" type CGI here, this is some real stuff.Unfortunately the story isn't really that good, the acting is good for the most part but there are some ""iffy"" dialogue that could had been cut. Also there are way way too many unneeded subplots that just brings the movie to a halt, mostly involving the kids.Anyways, it is a good film, but the pacing, story, character motivation, and slow padded out middle part brings the score down. I would rather watch this over the first any day of the week, but it still isn't in the top 5 James Cameron movie though.I know people complain about the length, and I did feel it but it has to do with the pacing.

The underwater scenes are so mesmerizing, you might start checking for gills on your neck! But hey, hold up, it's not all smooth sailing in this ocean of CGI wonders.While the movie dives deep into the ocean, the story stays afloat on familiar shores. It's like déjà vu all over again as we see echoes of the first Avatar. The characters, well, some of them are as deep as a puddle, lacking that extra dimension that would make them truly dive-worthy. And let's not forget the sudden shifts in focus that can leave you feeling like you're caught in a rip current.This sequel is like a rollercoaster ride through an underwater world, with highs and lows that'll leave you gasping for air. The pacing can be as choppy as the sea on a stormy day, with some parts feeling like they're treading water for too long. At nearly 3 hours, you might find yourself wishing for a life raft to rescue you from the boredom.In the end, Avatar: The Way of Water is a cool dive into a visually stunning world, but it's not without its rough waters. It's like a treasure chest with some shiny gems but also a few sea cucumbers. With a bit of editing magic, trimming about 20 minutes could turn this voyage from a marathon into a sprint without losing any of its charm.

I wasnt old enough to see both the original Terminators or Aliens in the cinema but all 3 are certainly in my top movies. Titanic certainly is one of those films that will live on long after we are all gone and that how both of these Avatar movies will be remembered. To create firstly an enjoyable yet simple movie but also the hype around a sequel 13 years later proves Camerons place in Hollywood history.This is almost a play by play of the first movie but with the whole family instead of just Jake in the underwater world instead of the trees of the forest but this is one of the most spectacular movies to see in Cinema. I was in awe of the first movie whilst watching it, lately there was a rewatch and you do start to notice some of the limitations of the technology from 2009 whilst watching it in enhanced IMAX, this was the same feeling that i had 13 years ago that i couldnt see any faults in the design or technology. For that i can only herald this as a success. To make your budget back in 3 days... yes thats a success when the budget was over $400 Million.I cannot wait to see if theres a leep forward if we get to see Avatar 4 since 2 and 3 were filmed together back to back so rolled on 2024 when we get to see a conclusion to a trilogy that could go down in history. If the full 5 films get created then this can be placed firmly on the top self of movie franchise for quality over quantity.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

A big bloating carcass of something with incredible potential.The dialogue, of course, is horrendous, if *very slightly* better than the first.The plot and pacing don't make much sense, and leave you confused. The last hour is essentially one drawn out fight scene between two small -time gang leaders and their posses.The characters are one dimensional, with shockingly little growth or development. This, together with the bizarre pacing and plot riddled full of holes, give an impression of randomly interspersed events that don't touch us much as an audience.Any dramatic scenes in the movie, while being no believable due to the horrendous script, are also not given room to breathe and play out. We always see the consequences immediately, and usually because Cameron has them spelled out for us as if the main audience watching was a gaggle of pre-schoolers.Casting: Because of the hackneyed script/director combo, it's difficult to tell when the lack of feeling and one dimensional aspect of the characters is due to poor casting, or bad dialogue. However, none of the actors seem to even make the best with the lines they've been given. The only bright star is Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, who brings life to her role as she did in the first film, even through her stilted lines. The rest are a mix of tolerable and poor casting choice.Message:
James Cameron doesn't believe in subtlety. The picture I get from this film is of a man shouting that machines are bad while nature is good, because he once knew one family who abused technology for agression, and one family that used it for defense. Because of the alternately dragging and rushing plot (like in the iconic J. K. Simmons scene from Whiplash, but this time even a 5 year old could recognize both), I have to fill in guesses about the overall message of the film, as none of it is clear. One gets the impression of severe tunnel vision.Director Cameron has cemented himself as a poor filmmaker whose primary vision has always been and seemingly will remain, visual effects. This he does well, and while it may be enough to do well at the box office, it is certainly not enough to mask the fact that overall, this is a very poorly made film with an incompetent director at the helm. Perhaps he is creating a new frontier of visual effects, but.","9 out of 11 found this helpful.

The world of Na'vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na'vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry.

Until now. Which is not to say that Avatar, Way of Water is a misstep. It's actually a visually ravishing, pretty absorbing 3 and a bit hours journey back into an immaculately realised world he introduced us to in 2009. No, the misstep here is that he's gambled close to 20 years of his life on the assumption that we're as invested in Pandora and the Sully narrative as he is. And I doubt after seeing this, if the lion's share of the public will be as desperate to make the trip back every two years as we were, for instance, to revisit Middle Earth each year over the course of two spectacular fantasy trilogies, or even Hogwarts.It's an enjoyable film, but it left me empty, it left me unfulfilled, uninvested. The excision of the human element, so we now essentially have Navi pitted against Navi, and whilst this allows Cameron to reintroduce old foes, it only serves as to lower the stakes. It reinforced for me the fact that the best adventure stories must be man against beast for us to fully engage, beast against beast doesn't cut it. Alien vs Predator, Kong vs Godzilla anyone? Yeah, who the hell remembers those with any fondness.Anyway, Fox or 20th Century Studios won't be in the least bit worried. They'll recoup the close to 2 billion dollars they've invested in these films several times over, because even this James Cameron is still a horse anyone'd be a halfwit not to back. But this for me, is the first indication that the well is perhaps starting to dry, the sixth sense of picking stories and universes that resonate so compellingly with his public, has begun to desert him. I've never watched a James Cameron film for the first time and forgotten it so damn quickly. I didn't care who lived, I didn't care who died. All I cared for was the visual rapture that was gone the moment I left the cinema. And for me, that just isn't enough. And for a James Cameron movie, that's just about as bad as it gets.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first movie impressed with its graphics, and this movie was no exception, but there is still something to strive for, as not everything is so perfect. It is worth considering that this movie is aimed at a mass audience to try to please everyone, and there will be nothing unusual here. It, like the first movie in principle, can be characterized as a family film in general.What is it about this movie that is so worthy? The universe of avatar increased and gave new adventures. The plot is clear and predictable, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. Of course, the graphics are top notch, but they are not perfect and there are some moments where you could do better. The movie is 3 hours long, but you can sit through it without falling asleep.As for the bad moments, I would call in some way not the most advanced sound. Yes, where it is necessary audio team has tried and you ""don't notice the sound"", but sometimes it felt that it lacked naturalness and completeness of the picture. The sounds are quite ordinary in a bad way for this movie, and there is no wow effect. The plot is primitive, and this movie is more about the beauty of the graphics, the story, and a little action to develop the plot.While the first movie was a novelty, the second, this movie, had a harder time raising the bar. The movie emphasized graphics and universe exploration, but because of that the movie became more family oriented, not taking chances with new ideas and acting in the tried and true ways of making a decent movie to go to. But at the same time, one that won't be anything really new in filmmaking other than graphics to attract viewers. In the end, it's just a passable movie that could be rated 6/10, but I'll add one more for the graphics.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As anticipated, the plot isn't noteworthy or remarkable. The Way of Water isn't a bad experience; the effects are good, production quality is excellent. I'd venture to say that if you enjoyed the first one, you'll probably like this one too. Overall, I was entertained, but there were some drawn-out parts; some trimming (as seen in many current productions) could have enhanced The Way of Water. The novelty seen in films like the original Matrix, Sin City, and Avatar is missing - it's predictable. I must admit, at times I was a bit bored, feeling like I was watching a (well-crafted) video game cinematic. In my view, the media tends to overly praise this work by James Cameron, much like they did with Denis Villeneuve's Dune remake. Eye-catching? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Every year followed had full of buzzes that Avatar 2 was going to be released soon. In fact, Cameron delayed the release at least seven straight times. Maybe that was a trick to make the audience waiting, a clever tool to mint money. But Cameron is definitely not a businessman. The man who has given us gems for the last four decades has literally achieved everything any creative individual would like to have in his kitty. The famous Terminator franchise ( only the first two had the touches of the master craftsman ), True Lies, Titanic, Avatar - he has seen success like none else has ever dreamt of. Be it the box office or the awards show, Cameron has been the cynosure always. Very few people are aware of one of his earlier creations Abyss which made me love the heart behind every Cameron movie. In a nutshell, expectations from Avatar- The Way of Water was sky high in the truest sense.Has Cameron been able to satiate my appetite? I would say, partially. This new Avatar version has everything, from brilliant graphics, unreal action scenes to mesmerizing depiction of a world where we all want to be deported in our wild dreams. Hang on, it is not the end of it. Avatar 2 misses the points where its predecessor had scored from aces. After coming out of the theatre, I must admit that I had moments when I was yawning. I seriously expected so much from Cameron. And may be that expectation is the only thing I am not able to give it a perfect 10 or even 9 or 8. Avatar was created when the term VFX was unheard of. Avatar was an ethereal experience where you became one of the members in Pandora. Unfortunately, the sequel tries too hard to match the quality of its predecessor with so much improved VFX and CGI. But sadly enough, it fails to strike the cords the way that epic did exactly thirteen years back.The ever lovable Jake Sully and Neytiri have now a family and with the desire to protect his family from the wrath of the earthly beings, Sully takes them to an island. How the theme unfolds and whether he is able to protect his family forms the central plot of it. Was I the only one who missed Pandora? Pun intended.There are moments of brilliance in this movie. There are scenes which are going to give you real goosebumps. But those are not perpetual like the original Avatar and you really don't miss the world as you had done after coming out from the theater after watching Avatar thirteen years back. With a runtime of 192 minutes, Avatar 2 at some points make you think, why on earth did Cameron spend so many years for such a poorly edited movie. Had it been crispier, it would have surely left more lasting impressions. But Cameron was so much busy with his penchant for showing the world that he cares for the environment, he missed the moot, the story.Overall, Avatar sequel is an ordinary action film with loads of scenes with unbelievable visual brilliance. But that alone does not make you fall in love with the characters instantaneously as its predecessor did. The character building is pathetic to say the least and apart from the imaginary marine creatures, you really don't feel for any of the characters.Even Spielberg or Nolan had some off days. Cameron would like to forget the memories of Avatar 2 and I am sure an ace creator like him would surely understand his folly and make us enthralled again with the sequel of the Way of Water. Till then he is not the King of the World. Did I miss the point that this movie has so many memories of Titanic ? But Rose even though being present in the cast could not spell a cast like the 1911 tragedy Titanic. If you miss this in the theatres, you are not a fool. But if you do, you are certainly wise in saving money.My rating 6.5 out of 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Surprisingly, I did in fact love returning to Pandora in the initial movie and a part of me remembered why I loved that movie. I fully agree that the Original story has its cliche moments and the story is not exactly original. But the world Cameron built and the visual effects his teams were able to accomplish. The movie really was a spectacle. Personally I think the first has a lot of heart as well.As far as the sequel goes, nothing really surprised me. I was excited to see more of this alien planet and the species who inhabit it. The story of Jake and Natyri**, (guessing on that spelling) and their family is a very easy to understand plot. But for me, it was so refreshing seeing a huge movie have such a down to earth story which pretty much revolves around protecting your family and the problems that trying to do that entail. I will agree with others, their is some campy dialogue, cliche moments, a few poor line deliveries, and an over all unsurprising plot. BUT. Wrapped all together, with heart, overall theme everyone can enjoy, INCREDIBLE actions sequences, and with the greatest visuals I have ever seen on screen, this is one hell of a good time.Go see this with your family over the holidays, or with some friends in order to get away from the family. Hell, go by yourself. I have. Once with friends and again solo because I had to look at this movie again. It really is an experience. 3D or not, see this on an enhanced screen. IMAX/DOLBY or something similar. Seeing this movie is an event and you should treat it like it.I had fun. Because this movie is Fun. Which is what going to the theater is about. FUN.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's clear that most of the reviews of 5/6 when they go on about how great everything is, 'except that they have this bothersome story line about people who seem to have issue with the needless destruction of an ecosystem, and how 'boring' that storyline is'. Meanwhile these same people clearly haven't seen enough story lines where an elite military force kick ass, several times in the same film, or a sports team that wasn't supposed to win, but because their coach somehow defies the odds they not only win, but create a sports dynasty, or another super hero marvel hero story, or a story about a country singer who is battling alcoholism, etc, etc. But god forbid they have another story where the environment is considered beautiful and worth saving against a group of people who are willing to do harm to the local indigenous people to make that happen. Instant 4-5 points off apparently in their opinion. They so can't stand that this is the message that they despite talking about how beautiful it is, how the action sequences are amazing, nope max rating like 5 and below, hmm wonder what their true issue was.Luckily most reviews are not like this, and you can tell the few other reviews that are, cause they literally sound like they were written by the main antagonist in this film, and actually the last film as well. My suggestion is stay clear of those reviews unless of course your political views tend towards 3rd generation 'get some'. Enough said.)Sry for the above, now that it's covered we can actually just review the film...,Main review here:Honestly, this is James Cameron, and he shows in this film that pedigree of a master craftsman at work, and what film making it is, truly if you let yourself trust and go with it. Yes, some of the dialogue isn't Cameron's best work, there are no absolutely masterclass in action dialogue like we got in Aliens, or T2, etc..But despite the criticism that much of the dialogue is 'basic', i mean it does happen to be coming from kids for like 85% of the film. It's definitely good enough for those who can let themselves suspend disbelief and take a 3 hours ride on another planet, with several creatures that absolutely at times are alive. I am namely thinking of one creature, that after you have watched the film you can probably guess. There are scenes with that interaction in the water between that animal, and one of the kids that absolutely made me feel I was there, on another planet, watching this interaction between a boy and another being, from both the performances, and the perfection of the fx, it really does nail that moment perfectly.As a person who has been in the fx industry most of my life, I can say it's one of the best vfx sequences in a film ever done. What it takes to nail it as they did, will absolutely be missed by many people, because the moment is moving, people will not even notice that there is vfx taking up the entire frame. But for those in the industry, getting water and creature interaction, plus a human like main character talking, and interacting in a moving emotional sequence, again all with perfect lighting, atmospherics, reflections caustics, etc etc, all working absolutely flawlessly together at the same time, truly we are starting to pass real milestones with CG effects, now we just need to figure out how to get to that level of vfx consistently....But I suppose that is something you could say with a good deal of certainty, that in any other parts of this film, if there is a moment where you lose yourself in the story, and the action, emotional scene, etc, you can pretty much be assured it was because the vfx were so good, they let you go there, with a completely fictional family/planet created from nothing...It isn't Lawrence of Arabia, but it is a great piece of film making in the sense it's a ride on another world for 3hrs, with a family, that perhaps might not be as complex or have the same originality of dialogue some families might have, but it's definitely at a level enough to give each of the families members an very distinct personality, and as a whole it does feel like a real family, at least it did for me for most of the film.For critic, perhaps there were a few moments where you know the outcome of some action and just want the movie to move a bit faster, but those are rare enough that it doesn't distract from the overall film.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, there are still a few flaws (including the same amount of crash zooms, albeit they did look pretty cool on IMAX) but what most people aren't realizing is that this is just part of the whole story, the setup of you will.Overall, I really loved the film and pray that the sequels hold up (I do believe they need a comparatively stronger storyline to compensate for the lack of technological development of a large margin).

One of the best aspects is the cutting edge visual effects and how they portray the ocean of Pandora. You can tell that the ocean itself is what James Cameron wanted to focus on in this film.I also liked some of the new characters such as Kiri. She is probably the most interesting character in this series so far. There are other new characters but none of them are fleshed out that much.Aside from the new creatures and environments there was some cool new technology not present in the first film.So overall the main thing I disliked about the film was the conflict aspect. It was nothing more than a rehash of the whole ""invaders vs natives"" plotline from the first film that has been done to death already. Also the climax was rather overlong. I still liked it, but if it had focused more on the sci fi aspects such as new creatures, cultures and environments it would have been a lot better.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Aliens was a troup of people rescuing colonists. Terminator 2 was a robot sent back in time to protect a future rebel leader. As with all great movies from James Cameron, the story is secondary to the experience. And wow, what an experience Avatar 2 is. It is visually stunning. The na'vi and the world are so realistic, you actually believe they are real. Cameron has created an entire planet of species and nature and it is all made up, but it looks to real that you might believe it actually exists. The movie is over 3 hours, but you will not be bored.The story is quite simple: men want payback for Avatar 1 and hunt Sully down. He flees with his family to a different place, but you know that the movie will end with a battle. Men are evil, Na'vi are good. But still, as the movie progresses you notice yourself actually rooting for Jake and even more for his kids.The movie actually does make me invest in the characters. I've seen people crying in the theater. Avatar 1 didn't do that, but this ones does. So to all the haters: you are wrong. This movie does not only stand on visuals, but also carries emotions. Despite of a simple story, but so was Titanic. Point is: James Cameron did it again. This is a must see movie!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I understand they did the Motion Capture underwater and it looks pretty smooth but the first Avatar had too many jaw dropping moments which were missing in this one. First Avatar was so good on cinematography and it was so colourful whereas this one was all blue. Story was also not that compelling although introducing new tribe was a good idea. First movie showed the relation with Eva more naturally while the Way of Water was bit more dramatic. Unless they have a good storyline or if they came up with a brand new Pandora they should shelve the idea of making another one. Overall movie is good bit lengthy but not boring.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

With IMAX 3D, it has a visual that will remain on the palate. I don't think anyone other than James would make a movie with that effect again. And if the third sequel comes, we will see it again only from James. He is an artist who is very meticulous and produces magnificent works with his hard work. It hasn't sat idly for 13 years. Sequels aren't usually good. But this is different. This movie puts a thousand on it. With this production, he brought the world of cinema to the throne. It's exciting to see new things. After that we can watch different movies. For those who don't like CGI, there is no PlayStation atmosphere. Completely realistic stunning scenes. It will inspire people and add creativity to creativity. People have thoughts about the story, but full points for the visuals. I think it will still get the highest gross. Congratulations to the director and the entire team. An artistic masterpiece.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Avatar - The Way of Water is one of those movies. Normally big budget mainstream commercial movies are loaded with CGI and we can tell when it's CGI heavy as well. James Cameron is a league of his own when it comes to science fiction action genre movie making. The attention to detail when it comes to character motion and facial capture is magnificent. The underwater scenes mind blowing. It's a long movie yes and probably could have been a bit shorter in its runtime but my teenage daughter, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience and we shall certainly watch the upcoming sequels in the theater 3D 4DX Experience the same way as we did The Way of Water.

It's a fun watch for sure but they missed on a couple things.One thing that really bothered me and correct me if I'm wrong. The cost of the whale brain fluid. 48 million dollars for that vail. Assuming they harvested only one off of that whale, that is a horrible ROI. This is all speculation but here it is.Assuming they're 100 years ahead of us based on their technology, the autonomous building drones, skeletal robotic gear, space travel, etc. It's not SUPER advanced, they're still shooting bullets not lasers. At 100 years, with an average rage of 3-4% inflation: 100 dollars would be worth almost 1,000 usd. Meaning that their 48mil is worth 5 mil to us. Where is the ROI? The cost of the equipment used, the ships, the robotics, the salaries for each person is 10x higher than they would be today. A F-35 raptor (one of our highest tech able to mass produce) is at 80million today. What does that mean for equipment in 100 years?Am I thinking to much into this, yes. They were making such an amazing point to target big pharma, but the number was off.Also monkey boy or whatever wasn't that great of an actor, and was pretty annoying most of
The movie. Also why do all the kids have to tag along to every adventure?","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was the film to see. Everyone was talking about it and it was a resounding financial success and still remains the highest grossing film of all time. I know the original film has it's lovers and detractors. I fall in between. I liked the film but I didn't absolutely love it. I don't re is it it asuch as I do other blockbusters. Even other film by James Cameron like The Terminator or Aliens. But it was visually stunning. The 3D was fantastic. Even in 2p09 I hated 3D but this film was filmed in 3D so i saw it in that format and it was great. The complaints about that film was that it was too familiar a story. It was very familiar. The problem with that is tht it's main character wasn't all that memorable. The visuals made up for the lack of a great main character. Sam Worthington was fine as Sully but it could have been any other actor. Sully is not a really memorable hero The best character from the first film is Neytiri played by Zoe Saldaña.Well 13 years have passed and we finally get Avatar: The Way Of Water. James Cameron promised this film many times but it took a really long time to get it to theaters. This new story revolves around Sully, Neytiri and their lives years after the events of the first film. They have 5 kids and live a peaceful life in Pandora. But of course the the evil humans, Sky People as the Na'vi say are back to colonize their planet. The RDA has advanced the avatar technology to insert human memories of their human counterparts. The company brings back Colonel Miles Quaritch in avatar form to find and kill Sully. A film of this kind is only as good as it's villain and Stephen Lang is as good as the villain here again. The story is similar to the first film and deals with much of the same themes but the film focuses more in Sully's kids. Esoecially the middle son who has problems with being overshadowed by his brother. The film looks truly stunning. The images are more detailed and complex than the first film but the look is very much the se but the improvement in the CGI is totally apparent. All of the visually spendor would not be as good if we as an audience didn't care about the characters. Again, there is nothing new storywise here but their is enough character development to care about Sully's family. One thing I do think is that Neytiri tales a backseat here. She was the best character in the first film. Sully is a weak main character. San Worthington is not given much to do except be the protective fatherThe action is great as always, the last 45 minutes of the film is just non stop action but James Cameron is such a great action director that it is really exciting.Even though this film and it's predecessor are visual marvels I feel the characters needed to be stronger and more memorable.That keeps this film from being truly special but it is a great spectacle to behold.Grade: B.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Can Cameron and his team really keep this franchise interesting enough to justify the many years and resources spent on all the sequels when you not anymore can offer the surprising, spectacular, almost groundbreaking feel that the first one had? The result so far is at least better than I had expected, and the second half is better than in the first movie, but the movie itself wasn't as mind-blowing as the first given we've already been introduced to the world of Pandora. Introducing sealife and underwater scenes helped though.Outstanding visuals, a good enough story (if you're not too fussy about plot-holes), charming enough characters and of course all the not-so-subtle digs at the many nature-threatening industries out there. They also kept some of the excellent melodies of the late James Horner. I think especially the naive dreamers and the young will get really inspired by this movie, and the environmentalists, but people in general too will probably enjoy it.I was almost expecting some hidden product placement of a Colgate toothpaste during the movie considering all the numerous perfect and sympathetic smiles, but couldn't spot any red and white logo anywhere. Plus, maybe the avatars don't actually brush their teeth, given they probably stay away from refined sugar and processed foods? Oh well, so I guess they just tried to give a good feel to the viewers instead (and show how happy and great your teeth become if you live in harmony with nature), and I'd say they weren't completely out of touch with this one. Why not.The weaknesses imo are:I actually liked the fact that the climax wasn't some large-scale invasion battle as opposed to in the first one. This worked fine, and making it about family gave the battle scenes a bit more soul and emotions.I became slightly less skeptical about the Avatar-sequels after seeing this movie, so that's a good sign. And it's one of the few movies where I actually preferred the second half over the first.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I get it, every Avatar is trying to push boundaries of what technology is capable of, but at some point visual details don't matter and have just been done because the budget allowed it. What makes a good movie is not that there is ultra-complex and well done hair-rigs, super realistic water rendering or the best Motion capture animation that could've been made.For me at least, what makes a good movie is the overall artistic value and cultural value it can provide. Not to get into detail, but a lot subplots are not only senseless but also make an already extremly long movie even longer. Do we really need another 15 Minute Fight scene with loud explosions after we just had two? I feel like there was just a lot of potential wasted because someone in a high position decided they need ten subplots that add nothing to the main plot and don't push the story forward, but are just pure entertainment (for me these subplots were rather blunt and senseless therefore not really entertainment but rather a reason to keep me in the cinema seats for longer).I imagine it's very difficult to make a movie with a quarter of a billion dollars without writing and producing it in such a way that it has a certain level of kitsch and predictability for the masses.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I saw it at 15 years old, and was captivated by the stunning world. Now, 13 years later, we finally have the sequel and it is remarkable. Is it a perfect movie? No, it has issues, which I will get into, but dam the good outweighs the bad.The visual effects in this movie.... holey Jesus. For the first half, the effects looked good, not mind blowing, but they were very good, then we got to the water scenes. You thought Aquaman looked good? That has nothing on this. You have never seen a more visually stunning movie than Avatar 2... you haven't, full stop. The effects were so good, that I completely forgot I was watching fully CGI characters. They fit perfectly into this realised world. Even when standing next to human characters, the aliens look flawless. The detail, the emotions they show on screen, just perfect.The story is also fantastic, and those who complained that the first was too similar to Dances with Wolves, will be pleased that this isn't a copy of another movie. This film has a very strong family message, especially the role of a father. Too many films, and TV shows now, show fathers as weak morons... not this movie. Jake is a strong father, who will do anything to protect family 'A father protects, It's what gives him meaning' Is a brilliant line from the movie, and as someone who has children, it hit close to home.I do have some complaints. Too many characters. Avatar 2 shoves dozens of characters in our faces within just the first 30 minutes. It gets jarring, especially when these charcaters are new and have weird names. I struggled to remember any of the new characters, apart from a couple. If they had removed some of them, and revealed the rest until the next movies, the film would have benefitted from it. I also felt like the way they brought back Quaritch was a bit off. It felt shoe-horned in there, despite him being a good villian. My final complaint would be the music. Avatar 1 had one of the best soundtracks to come out of the 2000s. It was fantastic. But with the great James Horner no longer with his, his replacement doesn't live up to his skills. I don't think the music in this film is bad, it just didn't gripe me like the first movie did.All in all, Avatar 2 is a fantastic movie. Despite being over 3 hours long, it didn't feel like it.

Yes, it was formulaic, and the story trope had been told before, in one form or another. But as I remember it back then, in all its 3D glory, it was grand. James Cameron is quite possibly the best director thus far in this century, succeeding Stanley Kubrick as the most visionary. There are others of course but Cameron, like Kubrick, who was a master at his craft, commands his audience's attention. I heard the critics complain The Way of Water was way too long and had a flimsy storyline, but I was thoroughly entertained. I would have loved this movie if it had been a flop but I knew it wouldn't be. James doesn't have flops, (The Abyss, but anyone who is a Cameron fan and saw the movie can tell you it was one of his best). And ask yourself this; how many directors in Hollywood these days, or at any time in the past, have had that kind of track record? Zero. The Way of Water is just as masterful as the first Avatar, if not more so. A heartfelt story of family and the importance of home. My only regret is I didn't pony up and see it in the theater in 3D like the first one. Well done, James Cameron. Well done.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

But there is no way that I was interested enough to even consider watching it again.Very poor writing, 1D characters, predictable, too long. Why are the aliens, basically Indians? Why are the humans thought less invaders only interesting in fighting? Surely they had time and money to get some decent writers to work on this thing.Apparently the story line is the same as the first one, but I forgot what happened in that one. What happened in this one was largely forgettable as well. But at least it looked good.After 13 years it is clear they spent all that time on the visuals and child with a crayon wrote the script during their lunch break.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

To say that the movie is slow.. The purpose of a film is not to always tell you a complete-quick story, it's to entertain you. The visuals of the film are a delight in themselves, I would have loved to see some more of that. Also, I can clearly see the movie developing into a trilogy or a quadogy (if that's a word). So, the movie takes time to familiarize you with the characters of the water and also touches upon the different powers the children of Jake Sully and the water tribes possess and even the animals.I can obviously see it developing into an all out war and each Avatar is basically moving from battle to battle before that happens. If you don't have the patience to frikkin sit through the beautiful developments of various characters and storylines, then you have failed as an audience.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story is so so but visually this is something else, you can really see that Cameron is a lover of the ocean as the underwater scenes are simply stunning. See it for the visuals if nothing else, but you need to see it on a BIG screen.Overall the story carries on from the original, with a slight twist but moves the story from trees to the ocean. The Sully's now have a family so some time is taken up with getting to know them and how they've come to terms with being the slightly different. Similar story to the original but with enough extras to make it worth viewing, especially for the technological advances in the visual department.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well, 2009 was the year I barely started going to cinemas, so I kinda excused it. Now, years later, I found out about Avatar: The Way of Water running in cinemas, and I told myself: I am NOT missing it this time! And as I watched the film this afternoon, I found myself mesmerized and transported to the beautiful world of Pandora, in 3D.Mind you, I watched the film in Hindi as the English version was neither affordable nor playing in 3D. And being a lover of 3D films, I had to make sure I experienced it in this format. This experience, to be honest, was otherworldly. There's NO part in the film where I didn't exclaim ""wow"". Plus, the best and the most unexpected surprise was the frame rate. The action sequences felt outstanding in 48 fps and this was a one-of-its-kind experience. And while I do agree this film did feel long a few times, I also can assure you there's no dull or boring moment present anywhere. The film has a very strong emotional core, due to which there were moments I almost shed a tear.The first two acts of the film move at a casual pace, but without any boredom. We are introduced to a new world of water, which with its stunning picturization holds our attention. The family drama plays out well, and the overall message of togetherness in all circumstances resonates even till the last frame. By the time the final act arrives, the film delivers a heavy dose of explosive action, including moments that will make you cheer with excitement!Avatar: The Way of Water is an epic film both in terms of length and presentation, and I'm glad it's close to 3 hours long, because it's meant first and foremost for the cinemas. And James Cameron and team make sure you have the best time watching it. This sci-fi action epic is a masterpiece and definitely worth a watch. Just buy your tickets and watch it theatrically in 3D already. Enough said.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I've been a fan of every work that Cameron has released but he's so much more than a storyteller. He's an inventor. He's paved the way for so many movies and their effects and has set a standard that other Hollywood elite lately can never hope to meet. I'm so glad he finally was able to release the second movie, since as of now the movie industry is in crisis and we are consistently faced with mediocre work that is mostly bad sequels of original content. Once again - Cameron has worked miracles. The amount of detail and effort that was put into Avatar 2... it's mind blowing. I hear a lot of steam from whiners on the internet who blast it when they haven't even seen it. They are fools. Cameron doesn't just direct - he steers and puts his blood, sweat, and tears into every project. He's the greatest filmmaker to have ever lived. I truly hope we get more content from him over the years. I'm really looking forward to the sequels!And side note - I love how Sigourney Weaver (my favorite actress) was incorporated back into this movie. Fantastic.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

It also tries very hard to show the savagery and raw nature that tribalism brings to the table. All in all it leave the table open and wanting. Hopefully the next movie will better and more polished.

So much so that when you watch a movie, your mind sometimes wonders and thinks about other things. That is not the case here. Well, I was so focused that my mind didn't wonder what was going on; there wasn't a dull moment with the amount of character drama. Jake Sully fully embraces his new life with his wife getting busy and having fourth children, all of which have unique personalities. The youngest son is trying to prove himself and seems to be in trouble no matter what he does. The eldest son is the golden child yet takes up for his younger brother's mistakes. The youngest daughter doesn't seem to be afraid of anything, and the eldest daughter is ""adopted,"" so many answered questions there, and their unofficial child is named ""spider,"" who is human. With the various characters and relationships, the film provides plenty of opportunity for emotional scenes. Featuring neglect, wanting to fit in, and tough sacrifices.The not-so-paradise:
Because this movie is so long, it seems necessary to have various issues simultaneously to avoid repetitiveness and dull moments, yet this also serves as a fault. Because there is so much going on and the film looks beautiful, I needed to hone into the main theme/plot. The plot follows Jake sully migrating his family out of the forest to the Water Na'vi to protect them from the human hunters. This introduction to new species makes me wonder how many variations of Na'vi there are. Compared to the film's other elements, the plot was executed only after being fair. It wasn't overwhelmingly impressive. It's like going to a restaurant, and the waiter brings you a sizzling dish; all eyes are on the presentation, yet the dish's taste doesn't match the display. The plot is similar to the first Avatar with one of the same antagonists.Verdict:
Regardless this is an enjoyable sequel probably even more embraced by die-hard Avatar fans. I didn't expect the same magic. Avatar: The Way of Water separates itself by establishing the necessary variety to the world of Pandora. I am afraid of the potential of a repetitive storyline for future productions. Is it worth the watch? Yes, especially in theaters with some 3D and maybe even D-box features if accessible. I'm still determining if I'll watch it again, but I enjoyed the movie.

Could have been so, so much more.Loved the way the sea people lived, but that's about it. No real heartfelt moments in this forever awaited sequel. Effort was there, but not delivered. Would have been nice to see what actually happened where the first movie ended. I also find the beginning was very weak...Anyway, we waited way too long, like with Frost 2 and it felt flat.

It's an understatement to say how perfectly Cameron has delivered his spectacle. Continuing from where it ended, Jake Sully is now a family man & has continued his war against the Sky people who have returned along with familiar faces. As the battle get intensely personal, Jake chooses a temporary solution to protect his family as that is what a father does. This leads to the introduction of the Reef people & their own Waterworld. How Jake & family fit in the new world, the battle that follows up adds up to the epic tale.Once again Cameron mesmerizes with the underwater sequences which he is an expert at. The characters are again lovable & there is an instant connect to each of their storyline, standing out is Spider. The 3D is crystal clear & honestly gave out never seen before experience once they move in with the Reef people. The runtime shows & that will remain my only complaint if I've to nitpick. It succeeds in building up the story for the sequel.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Let's let the story stand on its own: if you believe it to be epic, I'm pleased for you; if you believe it to be forced, I understand.This isn't your typical review. I truly enjoy a compelling story. On more than one occasion, I can overlook less compelling stories, solely based on the incredible commitment of the cast.This film lost me in the ""too much, too soon,"" category. I respect the untold millions that went into the attempt to recreate water. Why concentrate on the primary ecological environment in which the story was set? Truth is, the water is a character in this film. If we're at the bleeding edge of recreating water as an integral part of any story, we have a long ways to go.It's said that the physics of water were duplicated using the physical laws of fluid dynamics combined with the molecular qualities of water molecules interesting with one another. I'd venture to guess that an attempt was made to introduce a level of randomness to accentuate that which cannot be predicted.Let's cut to the chase: I felt as if I were watching an animated film that, while potentially groundbreaking, did little to recreate water this avid boater and diver has ever seen. I think I would've preferred a modified Unreal Engine 5 model of water physics, as the greatest single issue of the entire film was the obvious uncanny valley water effects. I suppose if one hasn't spent a lifetime immersed in the real deal, then the animated water effects will suffice.Yes. It's petty. But it's a major player in the film, and, as such, it makes the entire film seem as if it should've been presented as animated faire.If you liked the original, then you'd likely appreciate the story. If, like me, you find yourself put off by attempts to create supposedly live-action stories that are heavily dosed with digital characters and environments, you'll likely find your hands reaching for a PS5 controller or tactile keyboard.I understand why ""Hollywood,"" a catch-all term for human actors and salient writers are on strike. In decades to come, the combination of lowered expectations and half-acre buildings of image processing equipment will all but make the actor unnecessary. The writers? Again, in a decade or so, the same formulaic scripts that appeal most to the widest range of viewers, will be easily created by the artifice of advanced digital scriptwriters.There is only one positive side: that being the archival collections of real movies, based on beautifully broken scripts (those that replace logic with the singular emotion of the writer(s); and real, very human actors, those whose reactions might include an incongruous raising of an untimely raising of an eyebrow or other perfectly unpredictable line delivery, physical quirks and other, oh so human traits, will never fully be captured by a digital duplicate.I have no argument with those who love this ""progress,"" but, it is, and always will be, animation to me, and to those of us who instinctively recognize the impossible to emulate reality of legitimate human behaviors and interactions.Like many who study the topic, the ""better"" the digital replacements become - is but three-dimensional animation that fails to evoke the sensation of legitimacy, believability, and empathy. These are the darkest of years in the history of the cinematographic arts.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Which is sort of what happened here with the user reviews. Is it a good movie? It is a fantastic movie, but is it revolutionary like the first one? It definitely is not.Visually it is very impressive I think that just goes without saying. Story wise, it is on the weaker side, though it is by no means, bad. Majority of the screen time is invested in one of two things, a documentary about Pandora's sealife and high school drama surrounding Jake's kids.Colonel Quatrich lacks presence this time around, he hardly did anything or scored a bodycount, for a while I was wondering if he's even meant as the main villain of the movie. The lack of a majorly evil, imposing and convincing antagonist is one of the issues I take. Also Quatrich's team of Navi soldiers contributed next to nothing.The emotional and moral trigger points also lead me to believe the movie was produced for a younger audience. There was almost no screen time on the side of the humans. Why did we, the sky people, also the main villains make some of the decisions we did? What would have helped is a few layers of complexity showing we are not just generic bad guys looking to hurt children for no reason.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The CG is out of this world and a true marvel to look at. The CG was flawless with the exception of two or three shots that didn't look terrible but they didn't look right either. I have no quarrels with that as I am highly sensitive when it comes to looking for bad CG. The main problems of the film are that it tries to do too much with a fairly basic story. I counted eight main characters in this film with an additional five secondary characters. I would say at least three of the main characters were completely unnecessary and should have been cut. Of the thirteen characters maybe only two are static. To have eleven different character arcs in a three hour film done well is nearly impossible and it seems like this story would have been better told as a 10-15 episode show on Disney Plus to really give the characters more development and depth. The action scenes were nice but I don't get much out of action scenes. My favorite films explore characters and themes in deeper ways than this film did. Although this film is not bad by any means and I do recommend people to see this, it did not cross the threshold of a good film in my eyes. A lot of people will disagree with me but when you look past the fancy computer graphics at the end of the day a three hour fifteen minute film with thirteen main and secondary characters simply does not work.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Taking the series to the ocean is such an inspired choice which led to the creation of so many stunning sequences and visuals. From this perspective the film cannot be faulted at all. I'm a big 3D sceptic but this film really does benefit from the technology, particularly the underwater scenes which are just gorgeous.The action set pieces are exceptionally well done. The final act in particular is breathtakingly thrilling and will have you on the edge of your seat. Everything about the action just feels epic.Speaking of epic, Cameron builds out the mythology and history of Pandora, introducing new Na'vi cultures and creatures which is such a treat. You can tell a lot of care has gone into crafting this world and it is reflected on screen as we are given such a rich and well developed experience.What Cameron also does very well is to capture this epic scale while managing to make such an emotional film. Focusing the film on Jake's family led to some truly beautiful moments and really grounded the film, so get ready for an emotional ride.The weak point of this film is definitely the story. It is a fairly straightforward tale of revenge and family, and contains a few narrative missteps that should have been avoided. Some of the dialogue feels a little cringe and cliche, and the story lacks drive and propulsion in its middle third.However, the middle third is perhaps the most beautiful part of the film. The world of Pandora is so majestic, so rich, so well crafted, that I didn't care that the story felt static. I was happy just to be there.I sincerely hope that film gets the love it deserves and Cameron is able to fully realise his vision across multiple films. He has created a special formula here and I for one can't wait for part three, and hopefully many more after that.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Miles was a captivating villian and felt revitalised as an enemy for the region of Pandora and in particular the Sully family.The performances by the cast, including Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, are superb. Only criticism is the length of the film, it could of been delivered in 2/2.5 hours and still keep the dramatic effect and character building.Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for an immersive and thrilling cinematic experience.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

While it does have some redeeming qualities, overall, the movie doesn't quite measure up to the first installment of the franchise.One of the biggest issues with ""Avatar: The Way of the Water"" is its slow pacing. The movie takes its time to set up the story and introduce new characters, but it feels like it takes too long to get to the action. The slow pace makes the movie feel longer than it actually is, and it may test the patience of some viewers.Furthermore, while the first ""Avatar"" movie was groundbreaking in terms of its visual effects and immersive world-building, ""The Way of the Water"" doesn't offer much that's new or exciting in this regard. While the world of Pandora is still stunning, it doesn't feel as fresh or innovative this time around.That being said, there are some positive aspects to the movie. The film still has a strong environmental message, and it's clear that the filmmakers are passionate about this cause. Additionally, the movie does have some memorable action scenes and emotional moments that may resonate with fans of the franchise.Overall, ""Avatar: The Way of the Water"" is a slow and somewhat disappointing sequel that doesn't quite live up to the hype. While it does have some positive aspects, it may leave some viewers feeling underwhelmed and wishing for more. If you're a die-hard ""Avatar"" fan, you may still enjoy it, but for many others, this movie may not be worth the wait.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'll keep it short and sweet to avoid giving any sort of spoiler, but in my opinion it was breathtaking. The storyline, the scenery/CGI, the characters (both old and new) everything gelled. The themes are so pertinent and relevant to our current world issues/challenges, perhaps that's why it packs the emotional punch that it does. I'm so glad that they took their time with this, it just shows how amazing cinema can be if you don't rush it, so much stuff is just rushed through now so that studios can cash in. Another testament to how good this movie is is that my wife didn't glance at her phone once for the whole three hours.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm going to steer clear of any commentary on the themes in the movies, but the words ""ham fisted"" and ""hugely unoriginal"" probably suffice. There are also times when the movie appears about ready to burst into a Disney musical number, and one unintentionally funny line from a whale creature that illicited sniggers and head shakes from the audience. It IS entertaining, and the technical brilliance on display is enough to warrant seeing it at the theater. Yet, this seems to be a series of movies that is trying to be its maker's epic, and to create some kind of legacy.

I mean James could have discuss some deeper topic in this pandora world like the future of humanity or any race who soar up into the space, the space war and the possibilities of establishing a sustainable way of live in our current system. Personal view from me is that since the pandora world has a 'planet brain' , the Eywa play the role of the 'manager' of the planet's life. And that's why the planet can keep an invisible and delicate balance in the world. Is that mean only if human race are ruled by a invisible manager which can invade our brain so that we are able to control our unstoppable growing desire, and obey the nature rule? Who we are if all the animals spirits are connected to the one big brain, the Eywa?In the modern society, all human race are discarding their believes to pursuit the ultimate freedom. People are so separated and have more fights than the last 500years. Can we always blame the disasters and the growing desire while we are so separated when chasing freedom and free spirit? The avatar movies display a utopia for us, but it didn't show how the inner side of the society work in the pandora system, and that's what I was only curious about. Anyways, it's not avatar II, it's just another lion king series but shot in the universe.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I watched it on my 18th birthday with proper 3D and i fell in love both with Na'avi and Pandora.I waited patiently for Avatar 2 and it finally came..First thing is: this movie is beautiful. Seriously. Even Avatar 1 can't compare! The way of the water is REALLY about the water. The name of this movie doesn't lie... I it's beautiful. It's James Camerons love letter to what he loves most I guess.The story however... that is... Uhhhh.. Repetition, that's how i'd describe it. Not even from Avatar 1, which also has plenty of similar, yet slightly changed, events. In Avatar 2 you'll get hit in the face with certain elements repeating over and over again. Because of that you can feel the lenght of this movie. And.. damn I'd love to love this movie but... it's just rose-tinted glass level of good, that might be degraded to just average later.Still, It's a crime to not check it in cinema. The visuals are... Amazing is underselling it, really.However I truly warn all of you guys: If you don't usually watch movies in HFR (high frame rate - alot of frames per second), then (!!!)DO NOT(!!!) pick that option while going to cinema. You'll feel like certain scenes are speed up, like you are watching them on 2x speed. It's nauseating. It definitely impacted negatively my experience while watching.

Although, I never will forgive them for ""unobtainium!"" All these years later, I had no interest in a sequel, and had no interest in the water theme. What JC succeeded in doing was bringing me back to precisely those original feelings of wonder and appreciation. It is so realistic, and the characters so pure, I found myself emotionally invested, and simultaneously soaking in the visual beauty of the movie at all times. It is so immersive. I can't wait to watch it again. I thought to myself that this is what a movie looks like if you have an unlimited budget and all the time in the world to get the little details right.I like this one more than the first. I am so appreciative of JC for working so hard to create such amazing entertainment. I know now to really get excited for the 3rd installment, I know I will love it.I feel that criticism about the story is unfair. Nothing is easier than being a critic. That role is performed by the uncreative types who lack ability and judge others. I say to you critics, get some courage and go try to create something, anything, and see how easy it is! Get an attention span long enough to complete a long term project! JC is likely unleashing the creativity of an army of creative people who have much to be proud of.JC's body of work is amazing: Aliens, The Abyss, Terminators, Titanic, Avatars, etc.Back to the story: I think the formula that JC follows is the time-honored parable, focused on the story of good and evil. This is the way man has communicated for thousands of years, like the old testament. The idea is not to try to create unexpected twists, but to tell, once again, the stories that capture the human experience, teach a lesson, remind us of who we are and where we came from. We endlessly retell stories about serpents, demons, almost as a reminder of the ancient importance of fearing venomous snakes. It is black and white, intentionally simple, but interesting. The method makes no attempt to add character complexity and grays, but keeps it simple, the virtuous underdog against the powerful force of evil.JC uses allegory to remind us of past sins, like killing sperm whales just to get the sperm oil, and waste most of the rest of the animal, skinning bison just for hides, leaving the entire carcass to rot, raping the land, stealing land from primitive indigenous tribal peoples, and in his story, we use up a beautiful natural world needlessly(our current path on earth), and then move on to wipe out another world(Pandora moon). One can imagine that we use up Pandora, and must move on to another Eden to destroy. The Bible's Genesis, Eden, serpent, paradise lost. Or Dances with Wolves retold as a scifi epic. And if this was real, if we really needed to relocate from earth, would we seek to coexist peacefully? Would we ask or just take? These stories are useful to retell. I think we would simply take the world by force. But if fans of Avatar movies had any say in it, I bet they would seek a better way.I recall a friend of mine referring to Avatar as ""nature worship"". I think that JC, in his fictional world, is amplifying the connection that we have but have lost or forgotten, to the natural world, as well as connections that might exist between us with each other, with the past, with the dead, with all life, with the universe, with God?Something that seems to be missed is that as the apex life-form on earth, we have the choice to act with impunity and do whatever we want, or see ourselves as having the burden of responsibility, to flex that apex ability and awareness, to act as protector and caretaker of the planet and the life on it. It is clear that we need to keep telling these stories because of the way we behave, and the irony is that the necessity is for our own preservation, as a sick dying world will kill us with it.Great story, great movie!!If you want a clever spy movie with twists and turns, watch a spy movie. But if you want to see beautifully rendered scifi, of the highest order, with time-honored, simple, powerful story telling, with questionable at times dialogue, ""bro"", then you have come to the right place. I will order my tickets to Avatar 3 in advance!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not because it is not expected, but because it makes no sense. To me personally it looked like someone was tasked to make script and he didn't watch first part. If I write more it will contain spoilers so I won't go further, but honestly, I should have waited for HBO to show it in 2 years, wouldn't miss a thing.

The first one became the highest-grossing movie of all time, and yet it made zero impact on culture what-so-ever. Just think of the momentum and impact movies like Lord of the Rings, Toy Story or even Twilight created. Regardless of whether you like them or not, one has to admit they made it possible that new genres entered the big stage, they created fanbases that span the whole globe and engage people up to today. But Avatar? At least here in Germany, the movie disappeared from the public conscious after it left theaters. It was a simple story, told in a new (at-that-time) interesting visual way. The story was also finished after the first movie. The humans lost, they left. The End.So I was very skeptical why they would do a sequel to the movie. Even people that liked the first one, cannot name any character beside the two mains. And this sequel is so hollow and devout of creativity and logic it is depressing. As I said, the first movie basically told a finished story. Cameron and two (!) other screenwriters had more than 10 years to come up with a new story. And what did they come up with? Humans invade the Navi-Planet. Again. They could have imagined a new, more nuanced villain. No. They bring back the same cartoonlishly evil guy. They could have added depth to Jack and Neytiri. No, they bring in new, underdeveloped characters, while the two mains become empty extras. Just imagine this: they were not even creative enough to give Neytiri an own personal memory with her eldest son, so instead she watches Jack's instead.The script in terms of dialogue and logic is not good. The ""logic"" of the story falls apart while you are watching it unfold. THe dialogue is hollow. Even the music is creatively bankrupt. James Horner, who died in 2015, wrote the music for the first Avatar. And he just copy-pasted the music he wrote for Apocalypto. And this rip-off is again being used here. It is not enough that the movie looks pretty. Many movies do. Yet they go beyond that and try to tell a compelling story. Avatar 2 is so empty, you forget about it in 2 days. Which is good I guess so you can enjoy the next part (should you decide to watch it), which will be the same story again.","57 out of 92 found this helpful.

Movie tickets are expensive. Most of the time, I come out of the theater feeling like I could have waited a few months, rented the movie for a quarter of the price, and had a near-identical experience to the one I just had. But as corny as the oft-repeated promotional line is, it's true. Avatar 2 is what theaters were made for. Say what you want about James Cameron, but that man knows how to put on a show, and the show he puts on is worth every penny.Avatar 2 engaged me so completely that I barely noticed its three-hour runtime until the third act. It's no masterpiece, of course: Cameron's struggles with natural dialogue and compelling storytelling are as evident here as they are in the first film. The cast makes up for it, save Sigourney Weaver, though I don't blame her. A seventy-year old woman playing a child was a dubious move, and though she clearly tries, you feel the effort before you feel the character underneath it.Worthington's performance as a dreadlock-sporting father is damn good. He's more comfortable with the accent this time around. The role he plays demands a certain sensitivity: the Jake Sully in Avatar 2 isn't the bold, plucky youth from the first film. He's older, but not especially wiser; he works desperately to secure his family's safety, but we're given the impression that despite how much he loves his family, he doesn't quite know how to be a father. ""This is a family, not a unit,"" his wife Neytiri tells him after he scolds their son.The story is there, and it's fine. Disappointingly, it follows a similar structure to the first film. We get the fish-out-of-water trope (though a bit more literal this time), the cross-cultural conflict, the nasty humans doing nasty things to get some cool substance, and the chaotic final battle where the degree to which you'll sympathize with either side depends on how effectively the blue people have won you over. Its main difference is in its focus on family. In the first film, Jake was on his own with the Na'vi. In this one, Jake's family has their individual struggles; each of them has to integrate, and some of them find it harder than others.That said, none of them find it so hard that there's any real tension, and that's my main issue with the first half of the film. Cameron has no apparent interest in challenging or hurting his characters until the finale. There is one scene with palpable danger, in which Jake's younger son faces off against a big fish. Apart from that, everything is smooth sailing for these landlubbers. Though the chief's wife warns them that they'll have to work, I don't recall ever seeing them lift a finger.The film's greatest strength, to no one's surprise, is its imagery. Every time I thought I'd hit an upper limit of amazement, Cameron would bust out some movie wizardry and completely shatter my convictions. I love movies like this, movies of pure extravagance and vision. Cameron brings the same love to the oceans that he brought to the forests of Pandora in the first film. His passion for nature (and his surprisingly comparable passion for funky submarines and crab robots) shines through almost every frame, and it's hard not to be swept up in it. I, for one, was enormously entertained.Avatar 2 did lose me towards the end. Its final battle is more brutal and kinetic than its predecessor's, but I don't know if that brutality is earned. In this one, the humans are more helpless, less trained, leading to a series of scenes that's more massacre than fair fight. There are a few moving bits scattered throughout the carnage, but it did sour me a bit on the film. Though Avatar 2 goes out of its way to make you hate its humans, making them comically nasty, it runs into the same problem as its predecessor: as sympathetic as its blue people may be, it's hard to root against the working stiffs.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

He's made hit after hit and having seen the Way of Water, he hasn't lost his touch. I wanted to start with the action scenes, we're not only watching Jake and Neytiri take on the ""sky people"" but they're doing it in a different environment and with a new tribe. The action not only brings the punch but it adds some real drama. Watching the hunting of the whales is pretty heartbreaking and reminds you of the consequences should the Na'vi lose. Watching Neytiri and Jake exact vengeance on their enemies hasn't lost it's impact and how Cameron chooses to capture it provides consistent bang for your buck.You can't talk about Avatar without remembering how astounding the visuals were and in many ways still are. Mind-blowing doesn't begin to describe it and it's the primary reason we still get 3D movies today. The lush jungle environment was colourful and vibrant and the creature design was fantastic. Cameron and his team have plenty of tricks still up their sleeve and the new areas of Pandora hold just as many secrets and cool surprises. Cameron's love of the ocean and ocean creatures is widely known and it's a perfect marriage with the material and visual sensibilities of the Way of Water. The beaches and reefs of Pandora are beautiful and so are the creatures that populate it. The environmental message isn't subtle (it wasn't in the first one either) but it's effective and it's hard not to attach yourself because of how they get you to feel through the Na'vi and their care for their planet. I think with all the new visual splendour packed into this movie, no one will walk away from The Way of Water disappointed with what it had to offer visually, in both regular and 3D screenings.We not only follow Jake and Neytiri but a lot of the film centres around their children and how they adapt to their new way of life. As much as their characters are handled with a lot of care, The Way of Water suffers serving too many plot threads. Each member of the family gets a subplot and only a few of them are actually warranted. I don't know how a movie can be this long and have so little cut out yet somehow things are underdeveloped (more on this later). So while learning the new culture is intriguing and there are plenty of exciting sequences, the character development for many of our central players is both undercooked and overcooked depending on which one you're focusing on. I actually found Quaritch's the most interesting (I was hesitant at Stephen Lang coming back even though he was great in the original but bless him for doing so, he's one of the few performers with a noticeable presence here) in his struggle to make sense of reconciling his old identity with his new form. I appreciate the movie reaching for this epic standing by trying to be all things to all people but it just couldn't stick the landing.Getting to what I didn't like about the movie, there's no getting around how bloated The Way of the Water is. The long run time is laborious and while there's plenty to see, there isn't enough here in the story to justify the length of the film. The first thing The Way of Water needed was a tighter cut and I hate saying that with the evident passion that was involved in making this. I already mentioned the unfocused characters but my next biggest beef is how frenetic and distracted the plot is. Characters like Spider and Quaritch get a lot of screen time in the beginning but are just dropped for large amounts of the movie. There were several times that a thread or a character would be introduced and I started getting into it and then they were just gone for a half hour. While Jake and Neytiri are put on the back burner for their less interesting children, I couldn't help but feel distracted wondering how the larger conflict for Pandora was going. How could our heroes could be helping to shape the outcome with the skills they showed in the first movie? Sure, Quaritch's hunt for Jake is important but the conflict isn't even a central focus for the Metkayina. Shouldn't we be more concerned about the soldiers from Earth killing the indigenous species of Pandora and wholesale stripping of the land for human colonization instead of how the Sully family is integrating into this new tribe? On a more minor note, while I like Sigourney Weaver, choosing her to voice Kiri because of her character's lineage was odd and didn't sound right. I'm not blaming her performance, it was just an odd choice for casting and it did throw me off.This movie would have to be spectacular from every conceivable angle to justify the hype. With how long James Cameron and his team were working on it, the money it likely cost and having to live up to the original's success isn't a fair burden for The Way of Water to have to overcome. I walked away having enjoyed a lot about the Way of Water but it has a lot of problems that drag the grade down. James Cameron deserves a ton of credit for his fortitude but I don't know if Avatar's sequel is going to have the staying power or be remembered as fondly. As a spectacle, I'd absolutely recommend catching it in a theatre. But if you're not as eager to return to see the Na'vi and their world, I don't think you need to run to get to the box office. Hopefully we won't have to wait as long for the 3rd entry and while I'm a little disappointed with the Way of Water, I'm more than ready to see the 3rd adventure in this fledgling franchise.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was and is a top 3 movie of the year, in my opinion, and lives up to every bit of hype and hope created bY the first one. Critics call it shallow, meaningless, or easy to follow, but I would argue a movie that does all the legwork for you so that you can spend the time comparing the feelings and experiences to your own instead of thinking about a plot twist or an unreliable ending is worth all the 3 hours and more. This movie will hurt your heart, make you laugh, and put you in awe of what James Cameron has been working on since the recession.

Story is very fine, very simple. Not a mind-blowing story but not at all bad, the characters and the emotions (anything except script/story is amazing) are great. Everything felt real. But the Main thing is the experience, the visuals, the CGI.Now CGI when I watch it, I can tell out its fake or how it's done, but with Avatar: The Way of Water, I got lost in Pandora, for real. I forgot my mind was halfway focusing, looking for something to tell its fake, Like at the last 30 minutes, I sat there laughing none of this things in this universe, Pandora (earth actually) is real, none of those frames looked out of place, The experience is just ridiculously amazing.I really don't care what people says like this promotes Violence etc, it doesn't, watch the movie first, Humans in the movie are straight up worse in the first place, then story/script, it's something that needs to improve a lot to stand up with its other parts like the CGI, cinematography etc.I don't mind if it doesn't hit 2 Billion box office mark to break even or even 3 Billion for that matter (story was lacking, still waiting for Avatar 3 to see where it leads), because
This is the best and deserved sequel to the Avatar from 2009 (it's story also was simple like this one), the movie that set the benchmark for the future Film Industry and 3D CGI. Going to watch for the 3rd time (noob numbers, I know).I wanted to see Alita 2 so badly, was mad at Cameron for pushing Avatar 2, but watching this changed my mind, Alita can wait, that movie was also visually and script-wise stunning.Watching this just made everything with CGI, cinematography, score etc and the whole film experience (even Wakanda Forever, both of them Disney lmao, anyway Ludwig Score is amazing) look and feel outdated. High-budget (mostly CGI heavy) Movies coming later in 2023 will look and feel amazing, due to this movie's impact.*Spoiler* but that last scene fighting/escaping in a halfway floating ship, that being similar to the Titanic is some James Cameron pun I never thought I would see (just saw in Pitch Meeting lol).","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Like the original, only as a soap opera","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8807121/?ref_=tt_urv","DrTuvok","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur116588890/?ref_=tt_urv","17 January 2023","James Cameron's first film in over a decade probably could probably not help but come across as somewhat disappointing, especially when compared to his previous track record with sequels. The much lauded CGI work is certainly incredible to see, but it lacks the driving intensity of last year's Top Gun: Maverick and really shows that computer effects have their limits: no matter how incredibly real it looks, there's always some degree of unreality. Much of the Avatar: The Way of Water plays like an animated film or cartoon, and the almost complete lack of normal human characters only amplifies this problem.But make no mistake, this is a film that only James Cameron could direct, a potpourri of all his usual ingredients: oceans, environmentalism, guns, romance, cutting edge effects, strong females, etc, all married to a slavish earnestness that sets his vision apart from the snark-fests that usually fill theaters. During the scene when they all swim out to converse with the giant whales it's easy to laugh, but Cameron never makes fun of his own world-that's his greatest strength. Maybe he can go too far in trying to play with the audiences emotions (not only are the whales highly intelligent, they are also deeply emotional and artistic-oh yes, and complete pacifists as well) but the overall effort still benefits from his archetypical storytelling instinct.The battle at the end was a bit of a letdown. Cameron is still an incredible action director; the fight scenes in Avatar 2, despite the constant computer effects, have a physicality that surpasses nearly all modern blockbusters. He knows how to stage violence in a way that feels impactful and weighty, unlike films such as Avengers: Infinity War, where giant machines are made to crush whole digital armies and it barely registers with the viewer. The problem with his climax here has more to do with context and structure. The battle in the first film was clearly a military fight, a legitimate war between the humans and the Navi. In the sequel, the Navi wage epic battle against...a whaling vessel? Sure, it's armed to the teeth and has a squad of undead hostile marines onboard, but its still feels significantly less threatening than the bomber ship in the original. Cameron doesn't help by making it less a battle and more a full-on massacre; the humans don't seem to really get their hits in this time around, and as the violence gets more and more severe, I began to wonder if they really deserved all of it. I kept waiting for some sort of twist to happen, reinforcements to arrive, but no, Cameron instead scales back to focus on his characters.This leads to another problem with the film, which is this shift to character-driven storytelling. The first film, despite all that snarky, parroted criticism of recycled plot elements, worked due to its concise storytelling and linearity. The sequel falls back on a very TV-show style soap opera where the plot is driven by the twisty relationships among the characters. It's too open ended, feels somehow smaller and less important, as if Cameron deliberately shied away from depicting more interesting themes (how does Jake feel leaving his humanity and original home behind?) in favor of 'relatable' family dynamics. Despite what some people think, this focus on 'character' is incredibly easy to do over a long runtime and is also very unremarkable. It's not that the characters in the film are badly written, it's just that the plot never demands anything really interesting from them, in true TV show fashion. At the end of the day all that's left are the effects, straining to add humanity to motion-capture aliens and only partially succeeding.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","354 out of 637 found this helpful.

If you're impressed by the CGI in 2022 that's amazing.The reason they went to the water would was hollow.. the humans aren't just there to destroy Jake. They want the planet.. so I guess a Jake doesn't care about that.I'm hoping some of the side stories will be fleshed out next movie like the daughters powers.The pacing was very slow. 1 fight scene in the beginning and then nothing for an hr or so.Definitely won't watch again but I may go see the 3rd movie cuz improvements could be made.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

When it comes down to the visuals, the viewers are invited for an enormous treat. They are gorgeous, magnificent, and absolutely breathtaking. Everything other than the actual screen simply ceases to exist. You just sit back and enjoy this piece of art.Now let's cover the content; story. It unfolds very peacefully and lets you grasp all the details as it unpacks. All new characters are properly and precisely introduced, and all returning characters' characteristics are built upon making them even stronger, more round. Everyone in this movie creates harmony on screen and a special bond with the viewers. You are literally sucked into Pandora!Moreover, everything is coherently explained. There are no major plotholes; perhaps none at all. It's just so cohesive. Despite the movie being a fantasy/action one, it is not bloated with any unrealistic actions. Everything portrayed is just so life-resembling; no nonsense.Last but definitely not least, the movie's title is just spot on. If you can figure out what it means, it will make a lot more sense.Perfect sequel. Can't wait for the third installment!11/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Additionally, the plot felt repetitive and unoriginal, as it seemed like a copy-paste of the first movie with the discovery of a new part of Pandora. Also very little new things are introduced for a 3 hours long movie, we already discovered the Navi, Pandora, the ability to use Avatars and the bad guys in the first movie. I was disappointed with the movie and don't plan on seeing the next one in theaters. It seems like the franchise should have ended with the first movie, but the filmmakers were more interested in making more money.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie looks very pretty. The CGI work to make not only the Navi, but the entire world look realistic is incredibly impressive. Unfortunately, these fantastic visuals are not presented in any interesting way. The cinematography leaves much to be desired. It is not bad per se, but nothing is done to uplift the incredible CGI work. Once the luster of the visuals fade, there is not much to hold the viewers eye for the rest of the movie. This is also overlooking the strange framerate issues that pop-up throughout the film. These inconsitencies immediately pull you out of the experience.Outside of visuals, Avatar: The Way of Water has little story to justify its runtime. The middle portion of this film needed a weed-whacker to cut away at least 30-minutes, if not more. The characters offer very little to keep the audience interested, and outside of a handful of well acted scenes and emotional moments, there is little fat on this steak.And that this is the movie's biggest flaw. Why, with an over three-hour runtime, does this movie feel so empty? It's because it is. Devling past the surface-level beauty, viewers will find very little to tide them over.","31 out of 47 found this helpful.

And it didn't not disappoint. Jake Sully and Ney'tiri have formed a family and are doing everything to stay together. However, they must leave their home and explore the regions of Pandora. When an ancient threat resurfaces, Jake must fight a difficult war against the humans.It's just gorgeous! Every single scene and frame in the movie is an art piece of itself. Its like a 3 hours tour in a museum. It is too visually appealing that you can just sit there and watch without hearing any word and knowing nothing about the story, especially if it is experienced in 3D. (James Cameron suggests it should be watched in 3D since it was ""conceived as a 3D experience, shot with 3D cameras, and edited especially to be seen in 3D.""Although the visuals were stunning, the movie itself wasn't really that great. With the same antagonist as the last movie and a very similar plot with just some minor changes to the settings and characters, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to keep the audience attached throughout the whole 3 hours runtime. Additionally, there were so many scenes that were just there for us to look at and although those were very beautiful, their abundance can make the movie feel even longer than 3 hours to some people.To conclude, the movie was stunning to look at but visuals don't make up a whole movie.Score:8/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Even the subtitles are insane, they're just floating their in the theater (if you see a 3D version, which you most definitely should be). I saw this in IMAX 3D and the visuals really were mind-blowing. That's about where my praise for this movie ends.The first hour of this movie was actually very intriguing and set up a lot of interesting tropes and plotlines to explore, making it easily the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, once Jake and his family arrive at the water place, it gets pretty boring/repetitive. After Jake's kids gets in trouble for the 10th time, it's just obnoxious and a waste of screenplay (that took THIRTEEN YEAERS).Not only did the movie get kind of boring after the first hour, but all those interesting plotlines and characters set up in the first hour are just wasted. 80% of the new characters introduced are essentially useless and hold no impact on the end/outcome of the movie.There were also just blaring continuity issues (especially with the final battle). Regarding the story and lore, there are lots of questions brought up early on, but none really answered by the end. Also, for my IMAX 3D viewing there were framerate drops throughout the entirety of the movie. 95% of the movie played smoothly at 60fps, but then would randomly dip to like 30fps at parts. Not sure if that's because there was an issue with the transfer, James Cameron didn't finish his movie or if it was just my specific viewing experience.OVERALL, the movie had insane visuals, but with an unfocused scattered story with mostly useless new characters introduced, making it kind of a slog to get through. I know I know: ""Avatar is for the visuals man, uhbubububh"", yeah yeah, but after 13 years, I expect a tighter screenplay than this.6.6/10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

There was just no compelling story and characters to pull me in and get into. It reminded me more of a glorified saturday morning cartoon than a blockbuster movie, but with better graphics. I liked the anti-colonial, environmental theme, but then they went and pushed the patriarchal nuclear family ad nauseam, which was irritating. I found myself pondering why they couldn't do better with the story telling when they had all the resources at their disposal? My guess is that they spent so much money on production that they were risk averse and fell back to following some tired holywood formula. Well, it seems to have worked, because it appears the film is looking to be a big financial success.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first part had a lot of flair for me in all respects. It was something completely new for me and nice to watch and that applies here as well of course. It definitely does, but it doesn't apply as much for me anymore, because the water world, while not bad, doesn't hold a candle to Pandora, which I certainly enjoyed more. I also liked more of the characters because the previous episode was mainly Jake and Neytiri and here they added the kids and they didn't really grab me, or at least not nearly as much as the previous aforementioned pair. Other than that, I enjoyed in the first one how she was Pandora at times and Jake as a person at times, which is no longer the case here. The action was cool, but again I have to mention the previous episode where in my opinion it was better. What didn't please me was the music, because unfortunately it was the same in places and that just reminded me of scenes from the first one, which I liked better. The same music is probably the worst thing about this movie for me because even though some parts were visually nice, they didn't impress me as much because of the music, which was the same. I'm constantly comparing the second movie to the first, but unfortunately I can't help it. The first one won me over, but the second one didn't. I'm not saying it was a bad movie. But unfortunately it appealed to me much, much less than its predecessor. However, it's still nice to look at visually and still offers some good action sequences. For me, a good movie to recommend and maybe even grab you if you love the underwater world and water in general. Personally though, I prefer 2009's Pandora, which charmed me and more importantly it was definitely easier to get the viewer's attention back then as it was something new and came with 3D for the first time. The second one had a harder time and wasn't as successful in my eyes as the first one.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie lived up to the chills I felt watching the trailer, it lived up to the pedestal I had placed it on, it was honestly incredible. The plot of the movie wasn't anything new or really fresh, it was the classic protect the people, protect the family but built on characters I loved from the original Avatar movie whilst introducing new characters I grew to care for. Thankfully there wasn't this strong plot armour I'd initially expected so studios could make more revenue from both the established and newer characters as the movie does show real loss which I felt added to the depth of the story and made it all the more compelling. Hearing so many sequels in the works, I was worried we were entering a ""Marvel-like"" state where it would be built on gimmicks to lure viewers in to bolster James Cameron's box office successes but I'm pleased I was wrong at least in the first sequel. The way new characters were introduced helped me the viewer learn more about this fresh new aquatic Pandora landscape and made things much easier to grasp rather than just being thrown straight in. I felt James Cameron captured the performances of the cast extremely well with Zoe Saldanas' Neytiri being my personal favourite showing great range throughout. The movie certainly isn't perfect but when pitched against other releases this year, it is more certainly a standout and felt very fresh leaving me reeling in anticipation for any further sequels. I do want to mention the score for the movie along with the trailer as it was brilliant and was partnered well with the scenes to give off emotional cues on the severity of what was going on. I'd highly recommend giving this one a watch and would suggest you try to ignore the box office performance and records and give yourself the room to really dive in and let the the film take you to a different world.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Experience it in IMAX 3D. You'd be doing yourself a disservice not to do that. This was built for a very large screen. All of the 3D implementation in this film is not forced and feels very natural, like you're an inhabitant of Pandora as well.James Cameron's beautifully crafted world gets expanded on a ton here. The luscious forests and jungles of the first film are traded in for coral reefs, beaches, and waters teaming with life. Truly incredible visuals that will have you questioning what is CGI and what is real. We've come a long way from the T-1000 in ""Terminator 2.""The plot is nothing spectacular, just kind of run-of-the-mill Cameron stuff. Passable and fine, nothing too amazing but nothing silly, corny, or stupid. I will say that although he doesn't make super well-crafted and thought-provoking stories, what he does best is push technology to its limits and fill the screen with absolutely gorgeous pictures.Cinema is really a three-fold art, in my opinion; the story and script, the characters and acting, and the visuals and effects. Most films struggle achieving greatness in even one of those, and I think it's nearly impossible to find one film that really fills all of those cravings at once. Hence why we have more than one ""greatest film of all time"" and why that can be an argument that stretches on forever with differing opinions on the matter.As for the acting performances, the one that really stood out to me was Zoe Saldaña as the mother, Neytiri. Great stuff here. Most of the other performances are pretty good here. I kind of dislike the whole ""bro"" and ""cuz"" dialogue, it gets kind of annoying and cheesy sounding to me. The family dynamics are all really good to me and if anything the plot is not bad and gets the job done bringing us through the world and seeing its peacefulness and natural beauty and also a great climactic action set piece (that part definitely out stayed its welcome and lasted about twenty minutes longer than it should have if I'm being honest).With all of this praise I'm heaping on, is it perfect? Nah. I will say it's definitely a must-watch at this time of year and serves as an excellent sequel to the first film. The 3D and CGI spectacle of it all will blow you away.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","Cameron in charge","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9645995/?ref_=tt_urv","lor_","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1287548/?ref_=tt_urv","27 February 2024","IMDb is a clearinghouse of controversy about the 2nd Avatar movie by James Cameron -pretty much debating about what the filmmaker chose as his script's main focus and how it measures up with expectations.He has never been one of my favorite filmmakers, as I tend to favor movies about ideas rather than action/SFX. Growing up, my favorite sci-fi movies tended to be ""THX 1138"" (I sat through it at a Philadelphia theater 3 times in a row in first-run), ""Colossus: the Forbin Project"", ""The Andromeda Strain"", ""Silent Running"", etc., not blockbusters.But based on his track record of making movies that were so successful with mass audiences, Cameron is able to command resources not available to many of his peers, I suppose Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott being in the same category. He is also able to decide the direction of his content.So in ""The Way of Water"" he has channeled his obvious interest in environmental causes (even such crusades as quaint but important as the ""Save the Whales"" movement of a generation ago) into a story whose center is focused on the adolescent characters, rather than the first film's romantic leads and militaristic/conqueror villains (though in a supporting role the versatile Edie Falco excels). Coppola did this with ""The Outsiders"", but of course he represents filmmakers who ultimately left the arms race of ""bigger and bigger"" movies (and astronomical budgets) to focus on smaller, personal projects, after the failure of his innovative studio American Zoetrope and later on the flop called ""Godfather 3"".So I can and do admire the craftsmanship, heart and technical innovation of this ""Avatar"" sequel (as well as its amazing attention to detail that big money can buy) without it being among my favorite cinematic experiences. I suspect documentaries could represent Cameron's small-scale outlet in future while completing the rest of the ""Avatar"" sequels, but in a world where spectacular is synonymous with success (even ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" fit this bill), small projects don't seem to count. Hopefully this trend will reverse, perhaps if a budget retrenchment (as occurred in the late '60s) occurs, with the exorbitant spending by competing streaming services, notably Netflix, likely to implode.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Our expectations are so high from the original offering (over a decade ago now) that any sequel was always going to have a major hill to climb.The thing I found most irritating is that Avatar; The Way of Water, almost had it. Was almost a classic sequel but failed by a lack of originality. The makers chose to rehash the original story instead of an actual continuation (an error made by so many sequels e.g. Independance Resurgence, The Magnificent Seven, Disney Star wars and many many others. )Don't get me wrong it is still a good watchable film in it's own right. Certainly better than those i've just mentioned.It's the fact it's so good that left a sour taste, it could have been great - had they chose to take the risk with a genuine sequel.The obvious sequel is the sky people return (which the film does) but instead the humans return and are so much better prepared for opposition with a different strategy e.g. The classic colonisation tactic of divide and conquer - get some tribes on your side and use them to help fight their enemies would have been interesting.Instead the skypeople 'just' arrive (as before) unapposed (as before) build a base (as before) and then have a rather thin link back to family Sully to get back to the 'big battle' scene.Would I buy this ? No (I bought the original avatar film)Would I watch this again ? Unlikely (although I will re-watch the original from time to time)Certainly worth a watch, a solid 7/10 but with a sense of dissappointment of an opportunity lost.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Pocahontas for the first move and now we are at the Moby Dick stage in history.The Science of the show is fine for the most part but then comes the Major Plot hole that no one addresses which is that we cannot breath the air on Pandora!

Both 3D tech as well as the world-building - from the flying mountains to the interconnected ecosystem and Mother Earth / Gaia / Eiwa cross-references. Particularly the fact, that our Earthly ecosystems actually HAVE the similar kind of biosphere interconnections - mushrooms, trees etc. - just a bit more subtle and less VFX. I'd found it awesomely smart to engage kids with those cool dinosaur-esque visuals that they seem to crave these days, all the 3D and computer game plot flow - and in the same time smuggle these important themes from ecology and the human tendencies to destroy the ecosystem that we are all part of.Technically, Way of The Water is still cool as it WAS, but has left the ""nothing new"" aftertaste with me. Despite the need to develop new motion capture for shooting underwater scenes - in the era of CGI, Marvel, sci-fi of whatever scale - it becomes irrelevant to the viewer, if not boring. We have seen so much blinking exploding colorful epic visuals already in the past decade ... that any visual effect evokes just mere ""whatever"".Though, making so long and so expensive movie, with those 13 years waiting time - and having such a poor, generic script, with unbearably generic dialogues and abysmally generic scenes - is almost unforgivable. One more standard Hollywood-esque ""war cry"" or creepy ""Sullies stick together"" scene - and I get serious allergic reaction. Even the military feels ... 1980s.If Avatar ripped off a bit of Aliens music and its immersive experience (descending to a new planet and finding out what is what) ... then Avatar2 goes as far as to rip off the most flat badass ""cool"" dumbness of all the 1980s Action movie cliches ... and a bit of Titanic towards the end. I can't even say if it was an intentional parody, or serious ...well, but the audience was laughing.This was ""traditional family values"" movie in the worst sense, easy-to-sell in Russia, Indonesia or any conservative s***e of our poor planet. Save my family, save good papa, save bro, save wife, save son, save daughter, save bad papa, stick together, you killed my kid and I kill you, roar roar. Disney would blush in embarrassment.I appreciated original Avatar for its real-life analogies - be it local community terrorized by the colonialist exploitative corporation, or even the ""amazed by the ecosystem"" themes ... but these now just merely and poorly echo in the sequel. Yes, there are evil fishermen (a.k.a. Japanese whale-killers, or Chinese elephant killers) and the Earthly re-invasion and take-over of someone else's home infuriates ... but it somehow felt like a poor commentary, failing to achieve more than piss the audience against ""the bad guys"". No subtleties, no psychology, not any more than one-dimensional villains.Even in the large scale ... where does this movie/plot lead to? What is the overall dramatic arc? You destroy that one big bad ship - and what about all those spaceships, the new human colony - the cities and infrastructure they start to build? It's like a ridiculously small battle and victory for the scale of the invasion and expected reprisals. Will the heroic family continue to run? Will they try to establish peace with the invasive human locusts? Did anyone from those who traveled back to Earth report on the absurd injustice of human colonialism, snatching someone else's planet, the genocide committed on Na'vi? Well, but we survived the bathtub battle, yay!Nah, I expected much more for this money and in this era ...","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It has been said before, but the visuals were insanely stunning and Cameron took the time needed to make the viewer familiar with the new environment.I understand that some people were not too happy with the story of the first Avatar, and even though this one isn't perfect either, it is a massive step up. I've read that the actions of the characters are illogical and cheap devices to further the plot, but honestly, I'd disagree. We see the main characters broken down, struggling to make sense in an ever changing world and be confronted with their own mistakes and further marvels that they don't understand.I agree, that some of the smaller arcs very predictable and seen before in action, drama or coming of age movies. But all in all i was honestly surprised by the direction some of the characters were taken.This movie begins to give the torch down from the elder to a younger generation and, even thought a massive climax is missing, it sets up further movies to come beautifully. This is, as we shouldn't forget, part 2 of 5. And I'm all in for more to come.Watch it, enjoy a beautiful story in a fascinating visual setting, and don't overthink every single little detail.

Just like the first one, this movie was either loved or found unnecessary and was not liked at all. Needless to say, some audiences have always seen AVATAR as an uncomplicated, fantasy superhero movie. (Don't get me wrong, I love superhero movies, but usually they're all based on a certain math.) For these people, AVATAR was just about visual effects and action. On the other hand, after reading terrible comments from some of the audience who loved AVATAR, including that this movie spoiled the effect of the first one, the characters were badly written, and all expectations were in vain, I entered the theater and started to watch the movie with a lot of stress.The first impression; Director, not CGIAVATAR: The Way Of Water started with excellent visuals just as everyone expected and as a really big AVATAR fan I had goosebumps staring at the screen. However, the beauty that took my breath away wasn't the CGI (computer-generated images and visual effects) that everyone was talking about. Of course, you won't notice much at first, but especially in the second half of the movie, James Cameron show off with his directing skills. As a man who created the best action and fantasy films since years, I think Cameron showed his best performance in this movie. The point where CGI developed the most for me was the point where it combined with the Motion Capture technology used on the players. With the motion capture used in the first movie, the Navi's, which look a little more like computer game characters, combine with advanced CGI this time and look real as if such a race existed. So much so that this technology has made the facial expressions and identities of the players and thus their performances stand out. This change will make Avatar: The Way Of Water a strong nominee not only for the visual effects awards, but also for the acting awards.MusicThe soundtrack is the crown of a production for me. Soundtracks makes most cinema effective, including movies that seem very simple and do not tell a very moving story. However, music was not among my high expectations in this movie, which I went to watch with the excitement that had accumulated in me for years. The reason for this, of course, was that we lost James Horner, one of the few composers in the world and the creator of the unforgettable music of the first film, in 2015. But I must say that Simon Franglen did a good job in this movie. Even though we often come across a new version of old soundtrack, he brought the emotional intensity of those scenes to the top for me by putting new compositions that he personally composed at the most crucial points of the film. The new The Weeknd song ""Nothing is lost(you give me strength)"" played at the end of the movie was a really good song to end the movie.ScenerioOne of my favorite directors, Cameron is definitely not a strong name in the screenplay. Most of the time, he uses a typical but audience-impacting math that is not too complicated, including the first movie of AVATAR. Cameron came to the fore not with the story he wrote in AVATAR, but with his innovative technology, the world and visual show he designed, So naturally I also expected that from this movie. But when it comes to cinema, I love unexpected surprises, especially a one like this! It was a well-written script, reminiscent of the tempo and integrity of Lord Of The Rings, written in an unhurried formula that made you say ""I would have watched it for another hour"" over the three hours and twenty minutes. It was far from the American clichés you see in many of Cameron's works, it was less predictability, and it was well balanced. The character scripts were pretty good, contrary to what I've seen in many of the reviews, that by the end of the first half of the movie I was already hooked up to all the Sully family members. These intense feelings that the audience feels for the characters become a director's most powerful weapon and so he has you in the palm of his hand. AVATAR: The Way Of Water is a very good example for this. I can't say that Avatar has a structure that makes it feel like it will be a sequel, but this time, Cameron skillfully showed that the movie we watched is part of a great story and an epic production which will go on. When the movie was over, there were many stories left that I was curious about and wanted to watch the rest of. It would certainly not be wrong to say that the script was written much better than the first movie.FeelingAVATAR: The way Of Water, as Cameron say; ""This movie is very personal to me."" It is a film written entirely on the concept of family, in a way that we can summarize with the word. If this concept is valuable to you, I can hardly believe you to be unaffected by this film. The fact that parents would do anything for their children, the fact that an older brother would always take on the responsibility of being the second father in the family, and the efforts of young people who felt inadequate or different to prove themselves were impressively scripted. In the movie, the characters' reactions to situations and their movements were incredibly realistic. That's the strongest feature that separates AVATAR from any superhero movie. No character has artificial perfection. Even the movie's big names made unexpectedly emotional and naive decisions, immersing us in a story that felt very real.Social justice warThe films that deal with the topics that are widely spoken in the society and that takes the trend topic material as their sorce material have become the films that today's art lovers despise as ""box office films"". In fact, it is seen as an effort to achieve a high box office of a poor quality film. Maybe true for some movies, but such a generalization can never be made without really evaluating. James Cameron is a name who likes to include in his films today's problems that many people ignore, such as women's rights, equality, protecting our dying nature. And I think cinema is the right branch of art to present these subjects to the audience by blending them with good stories. Not every art film is one that you leave the cinema without understanding anything. Cinema is a very wide art branch. Just like Cameron did in the first movie, he made public outcries in an artist's manner once again.AVATAR: the way of water is a movie that shows that cinema has no boundaries and that if you are as brave as Cameron, you can become a giant. By taking a very wide narrative and scaling it to an intimate family level, it would certainly have drawn criticism from many viewers anyway. But except the first 45 minutes of a cute family portrait, and the last hour that was wild enough to be considered as PG-13, the middl part had a truly unique narrative, with almost no plot, just dwelling in the world, characters, societal deviations, and certain norms.Unless you're really trying not to like this movie, it will be an enjoyable 3 hours and 20 minutes. Enjoy watching.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are lots of fights, anger and violence in the film. At least, 60-70% of Avatar is fights. I don't think children below 16 years old even accompanied by their parents should be allowed to watch it.I must say that Avatar made an impact on me.

James Cameron proved that creativity cannot be rushed and the end result is in its sequel The Way of Water. With the skills of his tech crew and his direction, he has shown plenty more of what the planet of Pandora has up its sleeve.More than a decade has passed since Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) fought against a human invasion that he once sided with and has transferred his mind permanently into the body of his avatar to become a full-fledged Na'vi to be with his love Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Eventually, he settled down with her and raised a family. However, it is then he learns that the last human colony that was expelled from Pandora have returned with a new group of military along with an old foe he once defeated. Therefore, Jake brings himself to flee with his family from the Omaticaya tribe and move to another tribe known as the Metkayina near the waters of Pandora.Kate Winslet reunites with James Cameron since Titanic which is ironic since her character Ronal in this movie is a skilled free-diver compared to her previous character Rose who feared drowning and sinking in water. Likewise, the newcomers who portray Jake and Neytiri's children and adoptive kids are all unique and stand out well. Anyway, it's good to also see the return of other past cast members like Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel and Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman back along for the ride. Sadly, it would mark the first Avatar film without original composer James Horner. Glad they honored his memory by playing his original orchestral track of ""I See You"" for this sequel. Makes it feel more tranquil in the most calming scenes.I can understand why it took so long for Mr. Cameron to assemble this movie as the tech he was looking for to bring this visual setting to life couldn't be perfected well enough to his liking. Motion capture has become an integral part of this movie's production and I have to say it pays off by bringing this tech underwater. With a runtime of 192 minutes (which tops the original's 162 minutes), I didn't even take notice of how lengthy it was. I was too focused on the new setting and new addition of characters that became part of the story, specifically newcomer Jack Champion as Spider. He sure stood out as an honorary Na'vi who is actually human basically being the Tarzan of Pandora. But learned to adapt and bond alongside them. The climactic ending seems to also pay homage to Titanic as well. Granted, the film's story is not at very high standards compared to Cameron's past hits. However, I liked what I saw overall. With all its epic war sequences, gripping moments, dubious intentions, and conflicts amongst clans and allies. I was on the edge of my seat clutching onto the armrests completely satisfied. Like the first film, the environmental message about respecting the ecosystem was also there. Worth the ticket.The moral: With arduous efforts and great sacrifice, there shall be a just reward.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was lots of beautiful and definitely groundbreaking technical and filmmaking aspects, however the uncomfortable frame rate during the water scenes, including strange out of place poorly made CGI (the initial water attack on Lo'ak), stuck out like a sore thumb. Furthermore, I genuinely started to drift off and asked myself, surely this 3+ hour drag could be an engaging 2 hours epic? The initial anti-imperial, post-colonial, and pro-ecological message of the first movie was powerful and uniquely done. But this just shoved it down your throat without ever taking a more original/changing the angle.Overall, as a fan of the first film, it definitely wasn't worth the 13 year wait. Cameron has to prioritise character development, credible writing, and original story structure, over trying to break the box office and making the big bucks.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Same bad military jarhead guys doing the same bad things to haunt and torture the peaceful natives. This story needs to be told, because militaries and resource hungry countries have always invaded relatively defenseless countries under the guise of saving or helping them, only to steal their resources. But this retelling is almost exactly the same as the last avatar, down to the same bad guy. And the story tellers beat you over the head repeatedly with the family dynamic. So the writing was really lazy and it shows. And the way it ended, I am expecting more of the same from avatar 3.They need new writers with a new dynamic story. Sorry James. It's technologically beautiful but intellectually lame. Go anyway, but don't expect anything different from Avatar 1.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

With that out of the way, the problems start trickling in.On the other hand, there are a couple of things really keeping this movie in muddy waters. It's 3 hours & change which is a bizarre decision by Cameron when you consider the attention span of an average movie goer. The flick does an above average job with its character development but suffers from another mildly dull storyline; which could have been a lot better had it been trimmed shorter.This installment in the Avatar series seems yet again like a played out story. With the effects in mind, this is a great choice for children and young parents.

The first film was a groundbreaking, enthralling cinematic experience in terms of effects, and there is no doubt that this film is even bigger, more beautiful, more breathtaking than the previous film. To set your perspective, you can compare the special effects in recent marvel films with that of this film to see this film is leaps and bounds ahead. But alas, a collection of pretty pictures does not a story make. The story in the first film was thin but simple enough, allowing the audience to empathise and feel for Jack. Here, Jack tacks a backseat as we are introduced to many more characters, and as a result, the audience does not care for Jack as much. The writing is also painfully average, and the dialogue terribly trite. But avatar 2 distinguishes itself from other vapid blockbusters with its groundbreaking effects, despite its lacklustre screenplay riddled with inconsistencies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This aspect of the film has not disappointed audiences.As a massive fan of the first film, I absolutely loved the subtle and not so subtle hints and references to the original. Everything from big plot points to reused shots and lines, it helped include the first film into the rest of the saga. But this strategy is risky for James Cameron.The risk lies in the episodic feeling - it seems as though The Way of Water has been written as if it is an episode of a TV show. Leaving ends untied and not addressing some things leaves the audience confused. Whilst this works well for a TV show, it doesn't work as well for a feature film intended for cinema.The mystery in a TV show increases its bingeability and allows audiences to pick up on subtle hints in one episode which may turn into a big plot point in another episode. It appears that this is also the case for The Way of Water which dropped hints that will most likely carry over to the next few films. It seems clever on paper and, from a business stance, would encourage audiences to continue to watch the coming films. However, it is clear that it has not been received in the intended way.It was a big gamble to write the film in this way and if it had worked, it could have changed a lot in the filmmaking industry. However, it's not a lost cause, the next few films might put The Way of Water into perspective. Only time will tell.Overall, I loved this film. I think that the foreshadowing throughout the film, the references to the original, and the VFX created an incredible experience. I am excited to see what the next few films hold in terms of storyline, but I only wish each film's plot was kept separate.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A father who is very military based and runs his family like that, but will protect them with everything he has. Quaritch was also done much better this time and has more depth than just a mean military man. I am excited to see where his story goes from here.This movie is not perfect by any means. Some cuts can be jarring and the story can be a tad messy but overall it is a HIGHLY enjoyable movie. I actually wish it was longer so less was cut out. I was in awe the entire time and have already seen it twice.Bottom line is main storyline is simple and easy to follow. Action is epic and heart pounding.

But sequel to what I thought was a masterpiece, well no, it's not hitting the spot.Maybe time has moved on and once we have seen it, we've seen it.Perhaps the story doesn't matter and we just want stunning visual effects.It is way too long and could have lost 50 minutes with good storytelling. But, then he couldn't have shown off his fx.What is full of stunning visual effects doesn't make up for far more lost opportunity in storytelling. Getting back the message of harmony, balance and the symbiotic relationship of all life.It doesn't have to be political or dark. But it has to be able to make kids stand up and know that what we are doing to this planet is the same as the sky people are to Pandora.Go see it, expect to miss some for toilet breaks. Get a little bored and then come out feeling OK, you watched a pretty good film.To make 3 possiblly worth it, I'm not so sure.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Some of the destruction scenes were the best I have ever seen. There are slow scenes in between what I just described that serve almost no meaning, and I would say the movie would've left an even better taste in my mouth if could've been trimmed down by 30 minutes. After 2.5 hours I felt the full effect was achieved and I was ready to go. After this mark, all of the plot points and story line are beyond predictable.

Along with this there seems to be weird cuts between standard and higher frame rates which leads to scenes not smoothly flowing and coming across as a cut scene from a game.Overall the film is an experience that is worth taking at least once if only to witness its magical visuals that didn't get old with me during its over three hour run.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm talking about none other than Avatar 2.Now, I know that the first Avatar movie was a box office smash hit, but let me tell you, this sequel falls far short of its predecessor. The plot is lackluster, the pacing is slow, and the visuals are underwhelming compared to the groundbreaking CGI that wowed audiences back in 2009.Sure, some of the action scenes were impressive, but they felt hollow and lacked any real stakes. And the environmental message that was so prevalent in the first movie felt forced and preachy in this one.James Cameron may have spent millions of dollars and years of his life creating this movie, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it feels like a cheap knockoff of the original. The storyline is convoluted and lacks the emotional depth and impact that made the first movie so memorable.And let's not forget about the painful performances from the cast. Even the talented actors who starred in the first movie, like Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, fail to deliver the same level of engagement and excitement that made their characters so beloved in the first place.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water is a movie that falls far short of its hype and expectations. If you're looking for a sequel that will transport you to a world of wonder and awe, then this is not it. But if you're looking for a movie that will leave you feeling more discomfort than a hemorrhoid flare-up, then give it a watch. Just be warned, this movie is a painful reminder of what can happen when a director gets too caught up in their own vision and loses sight of what made their original work so great.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

Characters have little to no depth, they are pure plot devices. Every major event is forseeable and connected by poorly written actions, sparking from ever the same character. On top of that there is no emotion, but an almost violent attempt to force a certain emotion onto you at given plot-points.Given the effort and the names that went into writing the story, this seems almost offensive and as if this movie relies on its impressive visual effects. Which, as mentioned, are convincing. The decision to shoot above 24fps works well when watched in 3D and allows for a very nice expirience. With a run time of over 3 hours however, having to watch this almost repulsive story feels like punishment more than everything else.Personally: a definite waste of money and a clear recommandation to not watch this movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It may have been more exciting.Sure it looks good but sadly the movie felt longer than time between the two films.

I actually have no idea how many are planned or rather will be released! It's been over a decade since the first Avatar came out. Now for those amongst you who are fans of Anime and may have issues with this movie and its title: I am not to blame! I just repeat the title that the movie is given - that does not change the fact that you may feel there is only one Avatar (and it not being this right here).That out of the way (again no pun intended here either), the movie picks up where the first one left off. Imdb apparently has a two page summary from the first movie. I do not think you really need it. When the first one got re-released a couple of moths ago, I thought I would wait until December and watch a double feature ... part 1 and 2 that is ... well I was wrong. I was wrong in the sense that cinemas did not do the double features and me re-watching the first one. Which I already watched twice in cinemas (which is more often than many other movies) ... once in Imax too - the extended version. I wonder if there will be an extended version of this one too ... not like over 3 hours aren't enough already.That all aside and onto the story ... well I won't really reveal anything here - especially because even though I had heard that this tried to put more story into the movie ... well it didn't feel like it. This is as paper thin as the first one. Maybe it does have a bit more story ... but it also has a more than a few repeats too. No pun(s) intended - we get quite a few callbacks and you may wonder if anything has consequences anymore.But you may wonder and say: that all sounds negative. Well I do not know what to tell you. I am just trying to be as real as possible. You are not going to watch this to be blown away by the story ... you will watch it for the visuals ... bro! If you don't get that reference ... bro ... well you clearly haven't watched the movie yet ... bro.The movie has subtitles but it does use the trick we got introduced by 13the Warrior .. the movie with Banderas. Where he learned a new language .. and we as viewers ""learned"" it with him ... and therefor got treated with everyone talking English in the end ... or in the beginning, if you erase the pun I used.Back to the visuals though: this looks and sounds amazing ... bro. Although when I say sounds, you may have issues with some of the dialog. Or the relationships between characters ... or how they act and react to certain things. Or how they treat each other! Like having a prisoner ... but letting them do whatever they want to ... it is mind boggling to say the least.Then there is the cringe factor ... be it certain characters or what they say and do. The question is, do you mind or even care? Because I assume you are here to have fun ... and that is why I rated it so high ... I know for some it is still too low. And it is the same score I gave the first one. Which I also really enjoyed ... for what it is or was ... which does not mean I did not see the flaws or was not aware of them ... I just rated the entertainment and visuals a bit higher ... the amount of craftmanship that went into making the movie ... incredible! Why not enjoy it, even if it has things in it, that make my skin crawl? Be aware of what you are about to watch ... and everything should be alright ... until the next one comes out!","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

This sequel continues in the same traditions as the first movie. It's a visually stunning piece of art with a message that's not properly explored.With otherworldly visuals, Avatar 2 takes audiences into never explored lands in Pandora. The runtime of the movie is long, not unbearably long though as the visual treat is mesmerising enough to ground a viewer; it's ironic that with the lengthy runtime, avatar 2 still feels rushed.The story is thin and the dialogue is poor (the constant use of 'Bro' from the young actors was cringe worthy, and gives off a poor image of what old people think young people sound like); Avatar 2 is heavily centred on family, but even this isn't portrayed properly. Various subplots are raised and tossed carelessly, while the main plot is also rushed through just to get to the big finish. The characters aren't well fleshed or developed properly; some characters are borderline unnecessary.The action scenes are grand and well choreographed, and the final act is heavily influenced by Titanic (a movie also made by James Cameron).In all, Avatar 2 is a visual spectacle with a relatively thin plot that lacks poignancy.6/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Just beautiful scenery, amazing graphics, I emotionally got sucked in to the character development and l loved how character development leads into the next movies. Needless to say you get right sucked into the movie and I was sitting on edge at some points. Amazing job by the cast crew and everyone in between. I held my breath hoping it would live up to the first Avatar and it is most definitely not disappointing.

It was an interesting angle to bring back powered up old villains and introduce a new water clan but it definitely felt like a national geographic feature in parts with the storyline pretty much being look at the pretty animals, mostly for no particular reason. Whilst the film is long by today's standards it didn't feel like a 3 hour movie but you could easily cut an hour and the story wouldn't suffer.Ending felt like a bit of a cop out, would have preferred the sequels to go in a new direction as I felt the next one might suffer from too much repetition.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Smell the smells, taste the ocean, feel the waves and the air of Pandora as you immerse yourself into this magnificent scene. James Cameron has once again delivered an epic experience to the world, thanks to 20th Century Fox and now Disney for trusting in his vision, we have the privilege to say we lived in this era of storytelling.Titanic, Avatar, Alita, Terminator, and now Avatar 2 will be added to the record books. If you are questioning whether to see it, STOP QUESTIONING, and go see it. IMAX 3D is the best format, along with Dolby digital 3D. If you have a 4D theatre that's even better.There's no question that each and every inch of this film was carefully crafted for the audience to enjoy. It's jam packed with awe-inspiring beauty in every frame, heart pounding action scenes, but unfortunately a lacking narrative with a stagnant plot. However, even with these shortfalls, the visuals far make up for it. 10/10.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

And with so much (beautiful) CGI it's now verging on an animated cartoon.This is a 192-minute rehashed Frankensteinian mishmash of Avatar 1, Pocahontas, Blackfish, Dances with Wolves, Titanic and a dash of Greta Thunberg's brand of moralising environmentalism which since 2009 has become done to death, seemingly unbeknownst to Cameron.Furthermore, uncharacteristic terms like ""bro"" and ""dude"" are thrown around by blue aliens in a surprising display of American teenage locker room talk on a (supposedly) far-flung and mysterious exoplanet.All of this is stitched into the sparse and frankly dull story of the Sully Na'vi entourage taking their guerilla refuge in the archipelagic ocean frontier of Pandora.This all transpires after the camo-donning bootcamp-earthling-army-soldiers make a surprise star-warsy comeback, glimpsing best-laid plans for a roughshod off-world colonial resettlement plan (Bridgehead City); and meanwhile deploying a vietnam-esque search and destroy avatar taskforce to take Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) out of the picture.This is headed by the now-blue, ever-macho, and much more lanky ""recombinant"" Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) whose avatar handily retains his signature buzzcut, just so you still know it's him. Other avatars and Na'avi alike blend together into a samey blue background of trilling indigenous shtick and uncanny valley; as if half of them are fresh out of the stupor of a gap-year Ayahuasca ceremony.Sci-fi legend Sigourney Weaver's brilliance is wasted on wide-eyed Kiri, who gawps more than she talks.Quaritch's annoying slightly feral mowgli-like son, known as Miles, or ""Spider,"" (Jack Champion) is one of the only live-action human faces in the film. He possesses an outta pocket knack for giving baddies the slip in multi-million dollar military environs just so the plot can progress. He also growls and hisses occasionally, but otherwise talks normally. Spider has been taken into Jake Sully's obnoxious pretendian Elizabeth-Warren-pretensions. Case in point; Sully smugly referring to humans ""sky people"", when Sully himself was formerly a human.A promising new character emerges in Edie Falco's General Frances Ardmore, but her screen time was brief meaning Quaritch quickly upstages her.Unfortunately, this film didn't make rip-roaring Poseidon waves, rather it mustered a splash in a lukewarm paddling pool. In 2022, with the cultural zeitgeist of 2009 long since shifted, Avatar is a fish out of water.6.4/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's been 13 years since Cameron's groundbreaking Oscar winning sci-fi epic ""Avatar"" was released immersing the viewer for the first time into the unique and beautiful alien world of Pandora. Cameron now takes us back to Pandora with a masterful film that is pure escapism and filled with adventure, suspense, humor, and some truly heartfelt emotionally powerful moments. Set over a decade after the events in the original film, Human turned Na'vi Jake Sully, terrifically played by Sam Worthington, and his Na'vi wife Neytiri, remarkably played by Zoe Saldana, now have a large family, his eldest son Neteyam, younger son Lo'ak, youngest daughter Tuk, and adopted daughter Kiri, which are all marvelously played by Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-LiBliss, and Sigourney Weaver, and a teenage human named Spider, wonderfully played by Jake Champion, who was left as an infant behind because babies cannot be put into cryo-sleep for the 6 year journey back to Earth. Their peaceful and loving lifestyle is shattered when the Earthlings who they call the Star-People arrive and drop from the skies with a massive military force led by General Ardmore, superbly played by Edie Falco, who enlist the help of the clone avatar of the late Colonel Miles Quaritch, sensationally played by Stephen Lang in a scene-stealing performance, which has his personality and all of his memories implanted in it, needless to say this clone avatar Marine with his powerful 12 foot tall Na'vi body intend to hunt down Jake Sully and avenge himself upon the killer of his predecessor, and also put down the hostile resistance for good. Colonel Quaritch and his Marine strike team are hellbent on killing Jake Sully and anybody who helps him. So Sully decides to abdicating his leadership position and leave with his family on a long journey to a tribe of Na'vi that are sea people and follow ""the Way of Water."" Sully and his family seek shelter and are respectfully but half heartedly welcomed by the tribe leaders Tonowari and his pregnant wife Ronal, impressively played by Cliff Curtis and Kate Winslet, what will follow will be the most exciting and jaw-dropping part of this film with extraordinary underwater sequences, heart-pounding battles and an action-packed climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. This film is vastly superior to the original in every way and delivers throughout it's long 192 minutes runtime, and with an estimated budget of $350 million dollars you can see every cent of it on the screen. That cinematic genius James Cameron has done it again pushing the boundaries of cutting-edge technology and brilliantly creating the impossible. The must see film event of the year.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

There was no back story to any of the characters or events and the movie has little connection to the original (which was also a terrible movie).The whole story arc was poorly written and more in line with something a child would write. Why Cameron decided to put so much effort and money in a story that is so flawed and full of plot holes is beyond me.The movie looks good and is selling. Maybe I'm just more of a book guy after all. I thought it was horrible but can't go lower that 6/10 because of visuals that compare to few or even none.Story wise 1/10, Character wise 1/10, Visually 16/10 which gives this my net score of 6/10. I want to go lower but the visuals are just that good so I wont. Will I see it again? Never. Will it be remembered?

If you ever read a Guardian review then do the opposite as it will stand you in good sted.Don't think about it, take your kids, take your family and enjoy a proper blockbuster thrill ride that you won't want to end! Cannot wait for the next one!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Avatar just like everyday life species around us. And we keep on destroy their habitat.I will still giving high ratings because director of this movie nailed the feelings of what will happen if human also be traded like, and the strong bonding of each family members.For the language which is Na'vi language use in water also fabulous. After doing some research, language that used is actually created by Paul Frommer.Last and foremost, still excited to wait the new Avatar.

Other than some intriguing subplots, it's basically the first movie again in a new setting. I have no idea what Cameron spent the last decade of development on these movies doing, because the script is still shallow, the dialogue is still cringey, and the overall quality of the visual effects are somehow a step down from the first film. All that said, Payakan is the G. O. A. T. and his exile is a great injustice. I give The Way of Water a middling 6/10. It's a disappointment for sure, but at the end of the day I don't think Cameron could make a truly bad film if he tried.QyrosMovies.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie is directed and produced by James Cameron, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. The movie stars Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former human who became a blue-skinned humanoid Na'vi after transferring his consciousness to an avatar body. He lives with his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and their children on Pandora, a habitable exomoon that is home to a rich and diverse ecosystem.The movie follows Jake and his family as they explore the oceans of Pandora, where they encounter new cultures and creatures. They also face a new threat from the RDA, a ruthless corporation that wants to exploit Pandora's resources and destroy its environment. Jake must unite the Na'vi clans and fight back against the invaders, who are led by General Ardmore (Edie Falco) and Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a former enemy who was resurrected by the RDA.The movie is a visual spectacle that showcases Cameron's vision and innovation. The movie features stunning underwater scenes that were filmed using performance capture technology, a feat never accomplished before. The movie also boasts impressive production design and visual effects that create a vivid and immersive world of Pandora. The movie also features new music by Simon Franglen, who took over from the late James Horner, as well as original songs by Sia and Jónsi.The movie also tries to deliver a meaningful story that explores the themes of family, identity, and environmentalism. The movie shows how Jake and Neytiri balance their roles as parents and leaders, as well as their connection to nature and their culture. The movie also shows how the RDA represents the greed and destruction of humanity, while the Na'vi represent the harmony and preservation of life. The movie also pays tribute to Cameron's mentor Roger Corman, who has a cameo appearance in the film.However, the movie is not without its flaws. Some of the changes made to the story and the characters may not be consistent or satisfying for fans of the original film. Some of the new scenes and characters feel redundant or irrelevant, while some of the old ones are overshadowed or forgotten for no apparent reason. The movie also suffers from some pacing and editing issues, as well as some clichéd dialogue and humor. Some of the action scenes are too chaotic or repetitive, even for a franchise that relies on spectacle and adventure. Some of the themes and messages are also heavy-handed or preachy, even for a franchise that aims to inspire and educate.Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) is a fun and entertaining sci-fi epic that continues the legacy of its predecessor while adding some new twists and flavors. It may not be perfect or groundbreaking, but it is a worthy addition to the Avatar franchise that will surely amaze fans old and new.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I remember seeing it in 3D back then, and while its story was sometimes conventional, it was a uniquely immersive theatrical experience that genuinely transported the viewer to another world. Given that so much time has passed since the first one, many people raised questions about whether the sequel could deliver not just in visual spectacle, but in telling a more unique and profound story than its predecessor. While James Cameron's technical dedication to his craft is undeniable, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is ultimately a mixed bag.The film is set more than a decade after the first movie, and Jake and Neytiri have kids now. The villainous colonel from the first movie has now been reborn as a ""recombinant,"" and is planning to attack the Na'vi again. Meanwhile, Jake and Neytiri embark on a number of adventures through the oceanside and underwater regions of Pandora. As expected, the film is visually stunning, and the CGI of Pandora looks absolutely exquisite in a premium large format screen. The underwater CGI is incredibly realistic and lifelike, and every shot looks like it was developed by a VFX team working at the absolute highest level. The film's pacing is generally fine, developing the story and relishing in the immersive atmosphere of Pandora before building up to an action-packed final act. However, the film is just simply too long. While long running times can work well if justified by the density of the plot, the story here is largely a retread of the first movie, and its attempts at character development are largely pretty shallow. Here, it seems like an entire hour of the movie could have been cut. It's a bit unfortunate that after so much time, Cameron didn't end up doing much to further develop his characters or make them more engaging and interesting. That said, the unique blockbuster spectacle and technical craftsmanship makes this ""Avatar"" still a unique experience in Dolby or IMAX, although I can't say that I'm super excited for the third one. 6/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema 3D. The Dolby Vision projection (especially the light levels,) Dolby Atmos sound, and rumble were all utilized well. The 3D was generally good, although I found the high frame rate scenes looked quite jarring.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Let me explain. The story goes through a lot to try and build characters. However many parts were slow and dragged on. So overall, the pacing, for me, was just too all over the place.The story seemed inconclusive and messy as well. It tried to build too many characters where I couldn't really connect fully with one. And where the story could have dug deeper to build a solid synopsis, it drifted elsewhere. It tried to do too many things all at once and remained on the surface level of each storyline it pursued.The only good thing I liked where the graphics. It's an eye candy alright.

This 3 hour story should be treated as such. Sink in and get lost in the story. I know the length is a source of contention, but some movies are worth the minutes. Some movies need the minutes. So often I watch an hour and a half long movie and I'm thinking 'what, we've missed so much.' Don't get so caught up in the time. You've likely sat through many 2hr30minutes+ films before. Plus, it's the generation of binging anyway.Maybe it was predictable, maybe it didn't dive real deep (but actually it did ha!), but it was relatable. Family, changes, standing up for good, fighting for good when needed, and a reminder that each life is so important.Also, a reminder that selfishness / over using of resources is such a careless move. It's clear as day when we show it in a fictional story that spans 3 hours, yet it's difficult to understand in lives that last 100 years but are only focused on the next 10 days.Anyway, what it lacks in predictability, it makes up for in beautiful visuals and good acting.I enjoyed! I was amazed by the water ties and loved each character. No character felt like a fill in.I would love to see more from Kiri and more about what happened to the Forest clans. I think there was so strings left untied that may lead to more movies. I'll be buying tickets again.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The scale of the story is confusing. It builds up well initially and then loses track. The writers tried to portray complex father-son relationships but fails horribly. It often feels stupid about the twists and turns in the plot. The movie fails tragically in most parts where lot of the things feel repetitive and does not explore interesting possibilities, keeping audience craving for more.Watching the first movie on IMAX 3D was amazing in 2009. The same visuals does not feel as amazing anymore. I don't care what inventions were made and what amazing technologies were used for filming the movie. It did not work for me. I would have been happier with a better story line.The initial under water sequences were interesting, specially when the sully family trains and tries to adapt to the ""way of water"". But then most of it was unexplored.The character arc of Kiri made no sense. Why din't she have more screen time.Mr. Cameron lost me during the climax. It was messed up. The action sequence were stupid. There were loads of missing details and stupid logic. Some of the emotions were not mature enough, specially the type of death that was portrayed in the climax.I strongly feel James Cameron should have made a teen movie to clear his pallet before making the Avatar 2.","96 out of 164 found this helpful.

We have in the film a group of blue Rastafarians who have a powerful connection with the environment, making them a kind of anarcho-ecologists. Then the problem arises when progress knocks on the doors of a planet that shouts ""Don't touch me!"" Moby Dick and many more movies. The lack of originality is so obvious that it attacks the viewer. Only a couple of sequences are adequately used to convey some sympathy for the film's heroes. In my case, I expected them to be swept away from the first frame while loudly supported ""Team Human. It could have lasted less but Cameon gloated over the possibility of overwhelming us with his idea of an ideal world. As a show it's decent, as a vehicle for educating the masses it just sucks.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I sadly must dissagree. Yes, the effects are amazing, but considering the time-gap the first movie is still just as good in my opinion. Both movies aim to reimagine what's possible at the time when it comes to CGI and MOCAP, and both movies does it well. So well, infact, that you often forget it's not real.But that's where the good things end. I tried not to expect much story-wise as this was not the strong point of the first movie either. But when faced with cliché and predictable one-liners for 3 hours straight it is hard to not be somewhat critical. Should we really just base our opinions on the effects? Should a god film not also teach you something, make you think and make you invested in the characters?I wish I could ignore the weak points, and once again I hope that this movie, just like the first, tries to set the stage for what's coming. I feel like I learned almost nothing new about Pandora, and the humans are villainized to the point of no return. Maybe I will have to watch it again with no sound to enjoy what others feel is worth a perfect score.As a fan of the first movie and the idea of a new, exciting world; ""Avatar: The Way Of Water"" does few things different from what I can already enjoy while diving back home on good old planet earth.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was your average sci-fi blockbuster that lacked a real heart. This sequel is an amazing improvement and the characters and world feel so real, relatable, and loveable.The visuals were absolutely gorgeous. At times you have to remind yourself that you are not physically in Pandora. Personally I agree that 3D is an annoying trend, but this movie was made specifically for it. It quite literally feels as you are walking among the characters, and that adds an intense depth of empathy for the characters.I'm amazed at the complaints toward the plot. Yes, it is rather simple, but its not easily predictable. The characters are realistic and easy to care about- they almost become like family to the viewer over the course of the film. I'm sure parents will resonate with this movie. The action, although perfectly executed, was actually my least favorite part as I much enjoyed the insights of each character and their struggles. Not every story needs a confusing and overly complex plot for the sake of it. This film is a perfect example.The score was corny/repetitive of the old movie at times but beautiful and original for most of the film. It truly captures the emotions at each point.The runtime was fine too- I was repeatedly wishing for it not to end. This movie is so beautiful in every way, and I can't begin to describe how it makes you feel. It can only be experienced in the theater.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

But unfortunately, the film doesn't want to be a marine documentary or an educational film about underwater animation, but a blockbuster that wants to tell us a story. This story is so bad and lazy that I was really horrified. Especially considering that they had 13 years to write a good screenplay. Even without the prequel, the plot would have been bad, but the fact that it is additionally identical to the plot from part 1 really shocked me. Just saying ""Hey look, I can show you the best underwater animations!"" is just not enough in my opinion for a sequel to the most successful movie of all time.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not much but the few interesting aspects were strong. Pandora was something unseen before really coming out of a dream. The principle of avatars was also an interesting idea and well developed. Those two ingredients really made it an original addition to hollywood blockbusters. What is original in this second film? Nothing. More avatars, more pandora. Storyline is flat, and acting is poor. But of course picture and CGI are beautiful. But are CGIs really justify an additional movie? I dont think so. Sometimes it feels too much plastic texture and computer water.

Most of the humans have left and peace has returned to the moon. Chaos erupts once again as a new expedition arrives. They revive the dead soldiers into new Avatars led by the late Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang).James Cameron returns to the world of Avatar after over a decade. The first movie is a technical marvel for its time. He may take a small step further in this sequel, but I've noticed something else. This is fake and my brain will never register it as reality. The superhero action sequences do not make it any more real. It has nothing to do with the technology.The story is not that great in the original or here in the sequel. Cameron is doubling down on the evil corporation and the simple environmental warrior message. The bad guys are literally hunting whales now. The good guys are Pacific islanders. It's all very simplistic and unchallenging.I didn't like Worthington in the first movie, but he doesn't have to be himself here. The Avatar helps. I'm not looking at his wooden acting. Time has also aged him well. He's become a better actor lately. It's fascinating to see these Avatars acting. Some may say that they are overacting. The actors are probably going overboard to emote through the Avatars. It's rather fascinating. This is all pretty good. This franchise will make bank. It's not great story telling, but it's functional. It remains visually stunning.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

So to simply put it, This movie is the Best Visually stunning thing I have ever watched so far. After watching the film I was so much in Awe that I looked for people's reaction online. Many people trash talked about it that this movie has no plot. But what I look in movies like this is how far technology has come. How much beauty out there am I missing out there in the real world? This movie gave me a hard knockout punch and reset my brain to know my priorities. That's what defines a Great Movie to me. Not some action packed kissass plot. I think this was the Grand vision of Mr. Cameron. I have being following him for a while now and I think I know his Vision. I used to wonder why he talks so much about underwater. But after seeing this movie I realized he is a Billion times right. Underwater is way too beautiful. It must be protected from us Human eyes. So if some person talks bad about this movie and discourages more people in watching, then they are indirectly doing goodness to Mr. Cameron Vision. Go ahead. Underwater world is not for all. But I will have this in Bluray 4K and own a copy for sure. Just my little secret. My new stress reliever.I mean come on. If what you really want is a sick plot to thrill, then why would it take 3+ hours runtime to give what you want? Just put some sense into it first and realize that there is never a Great Or Majestic plot for a movie which is 3+ hours long!!If you are planning to watch it, just watch it in 3D and that too only in theaters. Otherwise, you are doing yourself a disservice. After watching it and coming out, think for a minute. Just recall. When was the last time you saw something so beautiful in your life? Don't tell me Avengers Endgame. If still this felt a waste of time, I strongly question your taste and it is very odd.There is no beginning or end to the way of the water.

Not interested in the planet anymore? Excellent execution of a money machine, with little effort however to invest in the story.

The latter I was more impressed with than the former because I did not expect it.I knew that this would be a technical masterpiece, and for the most part it was. However, I had heard that there would be a frame rate increase compared to normal movies. This was music to my ears as watching movies in theatres generally dampens the experience to me because 30fps with motion blur looks like a slideshow during a lot of scenes. I was surprised to see that Avatar did not fix this at all, and when characters were doing anything on land where the camera was panning or a character crossing the screen horizontally it was quite jarring. The future of cinema is 120fps. I have no idea what technical limitations would need to be broken to do that but as audiences who grew up with competent gaming systems and PCs age, they will be less and less accepting of this eye sore.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Second, when there is hardship or loss among the good guys, it simply comes off as arbitrary. Third, the movie does not justify to me why the bad guy does what he does of hunting down the good guys (there's a bit of a story to it, but I just don't feel it).Yes, the themes of family and adjusting to a new home are present. And yes, this is a feel-good movie. But after having just gotten done watching it, it feels the movie was all over the place, the bad guy did not really have a concrete plan and, to the extent that he did have a concrete plan, the movie did not do to justify it. He kept, randomly, taking hostage kids, and doing the consent 'hey, if you want your kids, come alone.' And after that failed, he tried again. In other words, the bad guy is made to be aggressive and dumb.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

James Cameron is the filmmaker who understands what CGI was used for and the way it should properly be used. It something that cant be used to replace the practical but instead a tool for something that goes beyond what would be impossible for a practical effect to acheive.He has created a world out of Computer Imagery that feels completley alive and breathing with scenes underwater shot so well and clearly, you can see why he waited all these years to get it right. I can't wait to see what future film learn from this to make underwater scenes feel less and less of a daunting task and look more streamlined and realistic.It also has a great story about the importance of family and overcoming xenophobia and tribalism, aswell as preserving the beauty of the ocean. The water is so nice, you'll forget it's saltwater.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It would be nicer if the avatar's tone wasn't the same as the human tone. It could have been a different tone. (megatron, bumble bee, guldan etc.) A two-hour movie would have been more satisfying.

Cool special effects, mediocre story and acting, along with the theme, natives and nature are good, military and science is bad. This movie is really for 9-18 year olds, since they're the main focus. As an adult I really struggled to stay interested, and as always the 3D is cool until about 30 minutes in, and then it's the same old same old. The movie is too long, and while some of the CGI is really good, some of it seemed mediocre. Some of the Navi and the sea people looked unnatural. The bad guys looked ridiculous at times, and head shapes of characters ranged from too big to too small for the body. The bad guys are the worst part of the story. It's often lazy writing to bring back same problems just different background. I couldn't understand how someone's vendetta became the main conflict of the story and everyone in the movie was okay with it, and characters on both sides supported it. This one has nothing to do with unobtanium, the driving force for the last film, (stealing from the gold rush). It seemed like it would steal from the American West, and people coming to colonize Pandora just as early pioneers and natives conflicted in American history, but worse it just goes back to the same old players not liking each other. The snarling gets old, and while it has moments. It's not a movie you'll likely want to see more than once.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

CGI and 3D are now common amongst blockbuster movies.The film expands the world of Pandora. With new technology, Cameron is able to show the audience more aspects of the planet. The idea that water connects everything isn't the most innovative, but it works well in this movie.However, the antagonist, Quaritch, still needs a stronger motivation. The pacing at the beginning is rushed, and some action scenes just drag on for too long. But no director can incorporate beautiful visuals with epic action scenes like James Cameron. All the action sequences are epic and stunning.Even though the themes of family and responsibility are suppose to be a big part, it can be too surface level at times. And finally, the film just doesn't work during scenes that are obviously trying to make you cry. It seems like Cameron is more interested in the technology than the actual story. Just like the first ""Avatar"", this is a film that relies on its visuals rather than acting or writing. It's still a nice experience that falls apart for certain parts.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Visuals were good but many scenes were unnecessarily dragged which made it hard to just sit and watch helplessly... What made me wonder most was that Jake comes with the whole tribe to rescue their children but after 1 or 2 minutes of the operation the other warriors disappear and the fight is left a family matter.

This is what you've become)The main ""stars"" said in a video/trailer that this movie is like the first but on steroids, or 100x more intense than the first one... but hey, what else should they say? They gotta promote it, right?Truth is, this is like the first (literally!) but on Alzheimer... or on drugs... Nothing makes sense, nothing matters anymore, like it did so much in the first one... the dialogues are excruciatingly poor, the scenes follow each other without any flow, just thrown there randomly... What happened to you dear James? Did you microdose with something? What the heck, man?!...The first movie was a literal book about how-to-make-a-grand-piece-of-art! Everything mattered, each line of dialogue, each vehicle, each ship, each animal, each character was well-defined, well-played and well-written. Here, aside from copying lines and gestures and even grunts of old characters, none of them matters anymore, there are no real emotions, no spirituality (except for some fake watered-down attempt)... just some good special effects, especially the underwater ones. Scenes don't flow harnoniously anymore, like they did in the first one, they're just thrown there one after another senselessly... like a bad soup or a bland dish made by a bored or angry cook (who got lazy after being given some Michelin stars).But these alone do not make a good movie.The music is inexistent, some rehash of old tunes from the first movie. Nothing carries the scenes, musically.The HFR does this movie even less of a service, since now it feels you're watching a reality show with Navi people, or a poor Navi-tional Geographic documentary...All in all... Hollywood is becoming more and more dumb...

I feel like Mr. Cameron wanted to push people to have a talk about our way of life, how we destroy our planet in the pursuit of a better life, how we are perturbing the balance of life. If we think about it, there are quite a few parallels that can be made about this movie and the way humans are destroying their one and only Planet.As for the special effects of this movie, in the last decade I was with Tony Stark on Titan when he fought Thanos, I saw the incredible visuals of Interstellar, but I really think that neither the whole MCU or any other Movie comes close to the effects of this technological marvel.When I'm thinking of the characters, there is some character development and I think that we are going to see even more of this in the future films, as the children are going to be forced to take on more and more responsibility for the well being of the Na'vi.The cinematography of this movie was impeccable, I don't think that I've seen any new ideas when coming to camera-work but every shot was good. One of the rare occasions when I'm not disposing the fact that I have to wear those 3D glasses.When it comes to the sound, it was good. Maybe I couldn't fully appreciate it because the movie Theater that I was in didn't have the latest audio system there is, but a few scenes still blew me away.As a conclusion I would recommend seeing this Movie, as it will become a piece of the cinema history and if some of those ideas that I've mentioned above can touch new people then it's a win win for everybody. I'm not going to rate it with a 10, because if I'm objective it's not a masterpiece that will change the Cinema industry, but still, it's one of those movies that will be remembered.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Considering the fact that this movie is by no means quick it's a big testimony to how riveting and captivating the movie was. Plot and visuals combined. And I'm saying at the very beginning of my review - I won't be discussing the visuals - I simply can't add a thing to what's been said already.The points I want to make regard the plot, which is much better than other reviewers claim. And the characters. I heard a few say that this movie is very much like the first installment, most of the people saying that spoke about it as a fault - it's not. It's simply the outcome of a single story being continued from the first installment. Think of it as another chapter you read in a book, you don't expect every chapter to turn the story upside-down, in fact you'd be complaining if that would be the case. Thing is, Cameron has already done that with his installments of Terminator (I & II), once you see the two you realize it was a single movie separated into two chapters. That's the reason Cameron didn't want anything to do with the 3rd installment of Terminator - it went against the point his story was making: We make our own destiny and we're strong enough to do it. I don't know yet what's his point this time - I'm not sure if we've seen the end of this story. But I'm definitely going to wait and watch the next installments. He did create an amazing complete world in his mind, and I always love it when an artist creates an entire world for his story.As for the characters created in this movie, unlike the first one no significant character is left undeveloped. Some could use more substance but obviously the movie would end being even longer. Accordingly, the acting was first class. Though I'm still uncertain regarding the fact Sigourney Weaver is playing her 14 years old daughter. I understand the point Cameron is making, and she does it flawlessly but I'm still a bit uneasy about it. The only thing I have against this movie is some things Cameron has left out of his story or spoke too little about. It's not a major issue, and as I already said - the movie was long enough as is, but still a few details are missing for the story to be completely coherent.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Not the plot as it's been done before. There was a reason it was called ""Dancing with Smurfs"" by critics but the story came second to the visuals. And those visuals were stunning. Absolutely stunning. Seeing it on the wide screen, in IMAX 3D no less, and it was nothing short of a spectacle. I walked out of that theater just saying ""wow"". I told people to go see it for the visuals alone. And when I heard they were not only making a sequel but there were three more on the way then I was definitely going to see it.And... I'm underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong. The beautiful scenes and world building is there. It's just the story kinda drags and it suffers from a lot of what the original story suffered from. A lack of real story.In the first one it was the humans come to Pandora to search for Unobtanium, a mineral that is worth billions back home. The Na'vi who are the giant blue bipeds fight back, Jake Sully is the chosen one who winds up joining them and becomes one in the end.This one? It's the same thing. It's literally the same story but with a different coat of paint.Again the vistas and underwater scenes are amazing. Everybody was free-diving for it. So when you see them swimming around, that's the actors swimming in the big pool set while holding their breath.Pandora looks even more beautiful than it did in the first movie but it lacked some of the impact it originally had.And while this one has already broken the $2 billion mark making it another movie by James Cameron that has done so, the third one will need to bring something special to top the amazement we got on seeing the first one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If the movie had been shortened by only 30 seconds, the money not spent on special effects for those 30 seconds would have allowed them to hire a few more writers... for a decade or so.... special effects can fill a screen for 3 hours but that doesn't make a movieHaving said that, it was not a bad movie and is good entertainment much in the same vein as the first movie. The concept is as interesting and it does draw you in and the yes, the special effects do deliver....","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A switch from subtitles to English very early on is crow-barred in which allows us to skip reading but let's the script revert to American English. But the accents are still ""alien"" which makes no sense.Plotwise the film relies on characters from the original, which provides familiarity, whilst introducing new aliens who live near/in the sea.Whilst the underwater scenes are genuinely spellbinding, the attempt to use the next generation as main characters gives a much less serious feel. Characters are introduced with insufficient or confusing explanation.When an alien species youngster asks ""Are we there yet?"" you get the sense of how low the scriptwriters have aimed. Disappointing.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Hi-Tech visuals telling the viewer you're most free when you free yourself from technology. I've determined that life boils down to an experience of many different emotions and that's exactly what this film delivers. It's a masterpiece for that very reason. I found tears streaming down my face throughout the film: Some of joy; Some sorrow; but mostly because of a desire to feel what it's like to really live authentically in this world, and not the mechanized version of how the-powers-that-be want us to live. James Cameron uses this platform to reach out to people who want more out of life with the character named Lo'ak who is the son of Jake Sully. Lo'ak is hard-pressed to ever listen to authority, and instead follows his heart, and makes tough decisions which he is rewarded for in the long run. This is a message from James Cameron to be brave enough to follow what your heart desires and you'll be rewarded in the end even if you have to fight for it. Avatar captures the human experience to a tee in that people develop tunnel vision around their way of life. Whatever way of life you're used to, it's really hard to imagine it any other way and adaptation is typically like pulling teeth! The one exception to this appears to be Jake Sully who shows us that the power of love and wanting safety for your loved ones is enough to adapt, and evolve in an instant. I can't think of a better script than this one. So poetic. So many layers and depth to it. Definitely the best movie I've ever seen. An obvious 10/10.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

For which the pandemic didn't help with that issue either. The film is finally released and I finally got myself to the theater to watch it. Was the wait well worth it? Ehh...kind of. I'm going to get the obvious out of the way. The film looks outstanding, and beautifully articulated. I think everyone who's seen and reviewed this movie has said that. For me only one character stood out which was Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles, he was more or less the main character of the film and got the most screen time of all of the others. He did a good job at making his character feel more complex than the previous film and going a little bit beyond the typical villain characteristics. Along with that, some of the action scenes; especially one with a shark; are great. That too isn't a surprise knowing James Cameron's history with producing great action scenes. Simon Franglen does a good enough job replacing the late James Horner as composer, even though they reuse some of Horner's themes. Sigourney Weaver is good as always with her character distinguishing herself from her previous character from the first film. So all of the positives with this all are pretty unsurprising. But I will always give credit where credit is due. On the other hand, the story suffers so much at the hands of the attention to the visuals it's pretty much nonexistent. In fact, it has a very similar story rhythm of the first film. Absolutely no originality, no reason to get invested, just a frustrating experience sitting there waiting for that feeling the first film gave me. And a lot of that had to do with the story itself. To me, that is the biggest problem, so much it almost saturated the whole experience for me. By far the worst movie James Cameron has made in his impressive filmography, even though this is middle of the road and not an actual bad movie. In the end, I'd say the wait wasn't worth it. The disappointment is heightened because of how long I've waited and anticipated for this movie. Because of this my enthusiasm for the next film has been negatively affected. Overall, I love the visuals, some actions scenes, and Stephen Lang. I don't like the story, and the other characters (Worthington and Saldana are wasted). This sucks because I loved the first film so much and for it to see it fall so far is really disappointing. 7/10 because of the visuals.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The new bastion of advanced technology? The reviver of 3D cinema? I'm not convinced the more than a decade in the making Avatar follow-up The Way of Water is any of those things but what I am certain of it being is a must-see big screen spectacle that may not be the new-age blockbuster masterpiece we all dreamed of but a film worthy of getting off your couch to go and see.Undertaking the mammoth task of creating a lighting in a bottle moment once more following on from his box-office king and technological piece of wizardry that wowed audiences across the globe in 2009, cinematic marvel James Cameron ensures here that his long in the tooth (not always in a justifiable way) H20 themed sequel goes for broke as it reacquaints us with the Sully clan who find themselves in a dangerous battle once more with humankind after a long peaceful period that flowed on from the events of the first blue cats adventure.Digging too deep into this three plus hour epics narrative would only be cause for one feeling bemusement and disappointment in various angles but if audiences are expecting a wonderous return to Pandora they get to explore, feel and live in they're in luck while those buying a ticket purely to see Cameron once more spend the big bucks exploding, crashing and offering up not to subtle environmental/climate change commentary they too will find much to enjoy in a Hollywood blockbuster that revels in what it does, warts and all.There's undoubtedly less jaw on the floor moments in Way of Water when compared to Cameron's initial outing that genuinely did feel like a big screen experience we hadn't partook in before and despite the films runtime Cameron does at times struggle to juggle a plot line that has a few too many major players that don't always feel like they get the screentime or reasons to be a part of this adventure one might've hoped for with even Zoe Saldana's feisty Neytiri shunned to the side for extended periods with much more spotlight given to some of the Sully's offspring such as Sigourney Weaver's somewhat irksome Kiri and Britain Dalton's Lo'Ak, one of the Sully's teenage boys who has inherited much of his parents determined spirit.These are but a few issues with the film that does have a few additional head scratching moments and even more poor scripting moments (cuz, I'm not lying bro) with those that found the first Avatar film grating in a dialogue or character creation sense likely to find Way of the Water even more bothersome, likely hindering any of the joys they would find elsewhere when it comes to the films money shot moments.No matter ones feelings or sentiments towards Cameron's characters, story or themes it would take a reserved mind and a total disbandment of the child-like wonderment in all of us not to be impressed by many of Way of Water's stunningly created set-pieces, world building moments or colourful creatures (the mysterious Payakan is likely to become a fan favourite) and while it's hard to fathom this early on just what Cameron's return to the big screen or blue world means for cinema or the brand as a whole, we can be thankful the bearded master is back providing us with such lavish entertainment once more, even if it may not entirely be up to the standards we've come to expect over a long and prosperous career.Final Say -A must-see big screen experience, Avatar: The Way of Water may not be an all-round success story but its stunning realisation of what makes cinema special and how it can remind its audience of it, provides us with more than evidence enough that Cameron still has what it takes to give us cinematic experiences no one else can.3 1/2 loincloths out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's definitely beautiful... like GORGEOUS! And luckily, at least for me, it seems like the film took a formula from the first film and plopped it in a new environmental context, so the story execution was pretty effective #IfItAintBroke...I will say that because of following a similar formula, there is a ""safeness"" to this story, BUT I think it intentionally sets up something that could really amazing for the third installment.OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: The visual effects and cinematography, thematic followthrough, and Acts Two and ThreeCould've Been Better: A little shift in Spider's storyline to support some character decisions more logically than probably expected.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Traffic also caused me to be a tad bit late so there's that as well. Despite all of these very annoying circumstances, I think I enjoyed the movie more than I expected to. Though personally it felt like more of the same.I fear that if the movie were seen in regular 2D, the ""rollercoaster experience"" that people talk of would completely disappear, and that's unfortunate. I watched the movie in 4DX 3D HFR, which was quite crazy. I felt like I was quite literally falling out of my chair a few times. It was funny but I definitely prefer just regular viewing. I'll definitely be going back to view this one in IMAX 3D to be in the right mindset (and also for the ""Oppenheimer"" trailer lol.)The visuals were great, though. You can tell that people really put effort into the creation of this large world full of different species and vegetation. It was definitely and upgrade from it's predecessor, as well as from most CGI-heavy movies being released during this day and age. I can't wait to see more behind the scenes footage of how they made this film.The way the story went felt similar to me like how ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" brought back that saga into our world. The concept being the same with enhanced visuals and 'better' action sequences. The one thing I did really enjoy was the way Quaritch's story was told and the depth they gave his character - which he was missing in the first one.Despite the movie being over 3 hours long, I felt like our main characters Jake and Neytiri didn't really ""do much"" in this film. Not that it's necessarily bad, since we got to see more of their children and people around them - but it felt odd sometimes. The movie also didn't feel that long in my opinion, so I guess that makes the pacing quite perfect.There aren't any acting standouts for me, except for Zoe Saldana's performances of when she was sad - which I feel like she was quite a lot in this film. I liked Sigourney Weaver's Kiri, though the voice didn't match the body - but I assume there's some genetic mystery which I might've missed in the beginning or is yet to be explained. I also didn't realize until I visited IMDB after the film that Kate Winslet starred in the movie, which was funny.The soundtrack is good at times, mostly rather cliché except for the main theme. The sound design on the other hand is pristine. I think it's fair to say that the film is beautiful but I don't know where the story will go from here other than the bad guys returning to cause more suffering to which the good guys will fight back in a visually stunning battle, only to have the bad guys survive and return in the next film(s) - five more? - for me of the same. I guess we'll see. Solid 7/10 for me though.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Yet another extraordinary blockbuster by Cameron","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8761992/?ref_=tt_urv","Dunkaccino","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur92126044/?ref_=tt_urv","28 December 2022","With The Way of Water, James Cameron has proven that, after all these years, he is still a master of spectacle. After ""Titanic,"" ""Aliens,"" the Terminator movies, and the first Avatar, he has, once again, delivered an extraordinary blockbuster. He is a filmmaker that understands blockbusters are supposed to be something more than explosions and big-name stars.The setup for this sequel involves a simple good vs evil story. The first act is a catch-up of the Jake Sully family's life and an announcement of the return of Stephen Lang's villain. It feels similar to the original Avatar, in terms of tone and style. The same problems (home place being destroyed) cause the Sully family to move to a water village. Once they arrive, the Way of Water enters a new phase, a new era. The characters dive into the sea, as we dive into a brand new setting and characters.I don't need to tell you how good the visuals are, except the underwater sequences are some of the most impressive computer-generated imagery I've ever seen. Cameron knows how to pace a big movie, and here he makes good use of the 192-minute runtime to deliver an exciting journey with one or two ideas about bonding. He also wants you to know how we are destroying our own planet, and how that doesn't bring any good to any side. It's the same message of environmentalism with the first movie, but it is one that we still need after 13 years.The cast is strong: Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana are better than ever as they make strong leads. The heart of the story belongs to their sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, with a powerful brother relationship. Kate Winslet is unrecognizable as a resident of the water village. One of the biggest distractions, however, is Sigourney Weaver's return as Sully's adopted daughter. A teenage girl with the voice of Sigourney Weaver makes an odd character.This is maybe the only time that the uncomfortable 3D glasses are worth wearing. Sure, the picture is dimmer, but Pandora is not a bright place to begin with. The movie is long, but every minute is worth it. In every shot I can tell that James Cameron wishes his work to be seen on the biggest screen, with the biggest crowd. My advice for you is to grant his wish.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The morally grey is where 100% of interesting character development occurs.This is how I see the writer's talking about the outline for the plot: ""let's make everything as simple as possible because the audience is just too stupid to comprehend nuance"". The dialogue was very bad at times and the acting was just as bad but only from one actor in particular. I saw it in 3D and now I know I don't like 3D.Praise:The plot although irritatingly simple it wasn't a complete deal breaker. Family values are so rarely seen on the big screen and that's one reason I rated this movie so high. Another reason is the special effects. Although I didn't like the 3D. Some of the visuals are so goddam beautiful I'm considering watching it again in regular IMAX.Final thoughts:I've seen three movies in the theaters in 15 years including this one and I'm thinking of seeing it again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A good decision as it was all easier to follow. Although this sequel rates a tiny bit lower than it's predecessor I thought the story was better. Again extremely good visual effects, certainly with the water scenes this time, and again magestic creatures that give you that kind of experience that should only be watched on a big screen. After the first three Oscars for the first Avatar this time just one Oscar for Best Achievement In Visual Effects. Deserved again. I guess we get used to great CGI's by now, it's almost normal to witness made up images look so real. And that in just a couple decades, imagine what they will be able to achieve in the future. Only real eyes will realize real lies. That said this second Avatar didn't disappoint at all, on the contrary, it was exactly what I was hoping for. I see they are working on three more Avatars, spaced out in six years. That looks promising and more realistic than thirteen years between two. Looking forward to it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"7","/10","After 3 Hours, I Think My Avatar Has Traveled Every Way of the Water","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8744456/?ref_=tt_urv","Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14280854/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2022","It has been 13 years since the original Avatar became one of the highest grossing movies in history. It was a huge spectacle with a new planet, Pandora; indigenous people, the Na'vi; motion capture performances and a lot of never-before-seen technology. The plot was pretty basic, but the impact of the all the technical impacts made it more than the sum of its parts. Here, we are all these years later and finally the long-awaited sequel has been released. James Cameron has submerged us in the waters of Pandora for the first of many sequels called Avatar: The Way of Water.As a quick refresher, at the end of Avatar, Jake Sully, who was human in Avatar form, becomes part of the Na'vi. He's fallen in love with Neytiri and her people. Years later, we find Jake Sully living a peaceful life with his family in the forests of Pandora, but the threat of the sky people's return looms. Of course, that threat comes to destroy Jake's family's peace. Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home. Blue combat hijinks ensue.Now, everything about this movie screams big screen viewing. We have James Cameron, a long delay since the first movie, awesome tech and CGI, big fight scenes etc. This highly imaginative movie just lacks imagination. Yes, that seems contradictory to state, but it's the best way to describe what's going on here. For such a long delay for this sequel to come, Cameron and crew failed to use those years to expand upon the Avatar universe and tell a more interesting story. While we're dealing with slightly new creatures that live in the water rather than the forest, the plot is basically the same as the original. The real question is whether the new technology that's been developed and utilized in making The Way of Water makes this movie worthwhile. I'm fairly ambivalent about it.On one hand, the spectacle of the effects is truly stunning. The water is so blue and clear. The colors are dazzling. Your eyes can barely keep up because there is something new to see, it seems, in every frame. There are animals that we haven't seen before that dominate the screen. Those animals have personalities of their own. The integration of real human performances with the motion capture performances is pretty seamless as well. There really isn't anything wrong with the look of Avatar: The Way of Water. Also, when the action kicks into high gear 90 minutes into the movie, the tension and momentum take over and make the last 90 minutes sail by.On the other hand, when a movie is 3 hours long, it would be great for it to be at least a little unpredictable. It feels like every beat of the story is either a carbon copy of what happened in the original or it is a predictable extension of what's to come. Furthermore, the obvious environmental theme is not very subtle. It is good that the filmmakers have a point of view and that this crazy, action spectacle has something to say about our world, but does it have to be so obvious? Really, 3 hours to tell this story??? No, sir! Not necessary.Ultimately, the wait for Avatar: The Way of Water was worth it. The technology and effects that are used to bring this movie to life are truly spectacular. The story itself is not as imaginative as the tools used to tell it. Also, you have to sacrifice 3 hours of your day to this. The movie should be seen on the big screen - that's pretty obvious - but an early matinee should suffice. Get a bowl of popcorn and you might need another snack to tide you over.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And I'm sure the next one will be the same.There were some creative ideas but not many new themes and the character arch's were just confusing.It's a shame because there is such potential in the sphere to echo our own destruction of our environment but the fact this whole film revolves around hunting Jake is what was the hardest for me to get my head around. He had no special code or potion or secret, they hunted him just for spite. For three hours.Maybe that does echo our humidity.

But here we are, back on Pandora with a better story, new characters and superior visuals.Avatar: The Way of Water is a successful sequel that levels up on everything that came before it. Once again the story is basic and simple, and while lots of viewers will have issue with this, I found it refreshing because this is the type of movie that I could watch with my entire family, and my wife will get something out of it as well as my kids. And this is really what James Cameron is trying to do, he's targeting a global audience that can transcend gender, age, ethnicity, etc. The fact of the matter is that if ""Aliens"" or ""T2"" came out today people would complain about how simple the story is too.This movie is about the combination of all film elements that entertain and engage an audience. This time around the emotional connection was deeper than the original film, the scenery is beyond incredible, I mean once the movie goes underwater my jaw dropped and was completely mesmerized. And finally the action scenes are superb and in my opinion better than the first film, of course this has never been a weakness of James Cameron.The plot and message of this film, like the original is about the environment and the conservation of nature, but the story is about family and all the issues that come with that. I was lucky to have watched this on IMAX 3D and I would recommend anyone out there to do the same if you can. Finally, I can see what Cameron has in store for this franchise, the world building will continue and the characters are now in place for growth as well as the mythology in Pandora and that one messianic character that is being set. I want more of this world and I hope we get it sooner than later.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Never had I ever seen anything like it as a child, watched the first movie more times than I remember. Young me fell in love with the nature, the beauty, the relations, the interior conflicts within each character. The story might have been simple and straight forward but that's what I loved about it. I loved the relations, the characters, the nature, the conflicts within and outside.I couldn't believe when I walked out of the cinemas that James Cameron managed to capture the same feelings but better and just as uniquely. But the effects made me forget I was a sci-fi movie. I usually love seeing details in VFX and disecting scenes, and often you really notice it. But never have I seen a specticle that compare to this. There is nothing I can complain about, the beauty of the effects are almost to good. I've never been so invested in something that I completely forget it's real. James Cameron and his team made everything feel real. But the previously mentioned criterias for why I loved the first movie were done even better. Kiri's and Lo'ak's journeys throughout the movie are beautiful, I absolutely love what the Writing Team did to them.Before I go to bananas writing over my overly excited self I will conclude shortly why I PERSONALLY think it's a 10/10.Everything I've wanted, simple understandble story/plot, relatble and compelling characters, slow but engaging narrative, a complete unique world with completely unique life, beauty, long gorgeous shots, drawn out beautful scenes that set the tone and feeling of the moment. And atop it all a visual masterpiece beyond previous imagination. Visuals that captures the viewer in the world of Pandora so strongly that you forget you're in a cinema. Visuals so real the the reals thing(humans) feel odd and wrong. Visuals I get sad when I see the real world. Visuals so good it inspires me to help preserve our Pandora.I can go on and on about what makes this movie so great for me. I'm not blind to some of the criticism the movie has faced, but for mre it's all irrellivent to the experience that I wanted and got.Thank you again James.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film itself is a form of Eywa, our mind was the manifestation of the neuron dendrites that embodies every Na'vi people's hair and through it I could feel the Pandora.The connection was so strong and it made me realise that I, so also you, are both the Sky People and Na'vi People at the same time in real. The war between the two people, as shown in the movie, is the hypocrisy that we have been farming in our mind since long time ago. We are destroying our own Pandora, the Earth, like the Sky People with our day to day activities, while at the same time we know it is wrong and have been trying to save it, the Na'vi way.It is the sky people that is winning the war at the moment. It is really necessary that we bring back our Na'vi mindset to a much needed rejuvenation. Or there will be no Pandora left for us. It is your choice now.There were some plot holes in the movie. But nobody or nothing is perfect. I am writing this review to appreciate the visual marvel James has created and the message it is trying to convey to the people on our Pandora, the Earth.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Visually it is absolutely stunning. Here and there the graphics weren't complete though. The blue on the skin, esp on the faces looked painted on in some scenes. Some other underwater scenes seemed rushed, and lacked depth, but over all, that's just a small spot on a visual wonder.That said. I HATED the war part. Can't we get past the humans vs Na'vi people? Can't we get like a true struggle dealing with what's living on the planet itself? And the fact that we are now knowing Quaritch will be in more than just this sequel makes me believe that 2 movies is enough.Yes, there was emotion, I really lived for these characters and I'm actually glad I watched it 2D, cause 3D it would have been way too much tbh, but I really do hope that the future installments will leave this battle behind.And adding to that, I didn't like the 'human' behavior Jake had towards his kids. Esp his sons. It's so extremely American soldiar/warrior stereotype. After living on that planet for so many years, he should have been able to let that go sooner.Finally, Neytiri doesn't get enough quality story time in this movie, as did Kate Winslet. Her role is tiny, didn't really get the point why she was cast, other than her connection to James Cameron. .
Giving this 7/10, it's good, visually stunning, but for me also too disappointing to be up to the standards of the first movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I mean yeah, it's not really original but it wasn't as bad for a movie that has to be good and realatable for the mamority of people. It's a classic action movie story that isn't as bad that it would distract or intimidate. At the other hand the reviews and professionall critics say that the visuals are ""just top noch"" and bassicly the best possible for this period of time. And I really, really have to disagree with that, cause sometimes they just looked as if I was watching a trailer for the next AAA game. I mean most of the time they're fine sure and the flying mountains, the forest and the Navi's aren't the problem. But the underwater creatures are really not that impressiv, especialy when they're big. And I know, water is difficult to animate and I'm not an expert in this at all, but as a viewer I can say that I've seen much better stuff in cinema in the last years.Well the movie wasn't a waste of time or something it was still entertaining to watch and obviously the action scenes are still great, le in pretty much every James Cammeron movie. I just wouldn't advice you expect the movie of the year, if you go to cinema.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The adaptations in the inhabitants due to living in water is minutely created.Contrary to what I had heard, the story has progressed very logically. There are dull moments when the flora and fauna are shown, but they only facilitate the narration.

The pandora alien world was well made and designed.However, the story is generic (revenge/greed/exploitation) and disney-like (family, spiritual, animal relationship/communication, clans). There is nothing fresh in the story telling, just enough excuse to showcase the stunning CGI. It is very focussed on the Pandora beings and the hybrids and their spirituality to their environment, rather than the humans and their futuristic technologies and exploration.As the sequel goes deeper in exploring Pandora, it is more like watching an animation movie than a sci-fi epic film. More family based like Lost In Space and religious/mystic rather than sci-fi.Depending on your expectations and genre preference, you might really like the direction Avatar series is heading, or you might find fall flat. For me, the movie was just MEH.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

These ideas were touched upon in the first movie, but I was disappointed that the movie did not delve into them with the depth that I wanted, and the narrative soon turned to a big budget action flick. This is even worse with this sequel, rehashing the plot, characters, and ideas again without really expanding on the ideas or philosophies being explored. This means that Cameroon just made another big budget flick that wows with its special effects and can be used to test out your new TV. Of course, this makes it a spectacle worth watching just to see the latest technologies and cinematographic quality of Hollywood.In terms of entertainment, the comedy in the movie is filled with overplayed lines that really don't land. The dramatic elements of the narrative, subplots and such are also very cliché. The action, however, is what is intensely captivating and carries this movie. There are multiple scenes that are truly suspenseful and masterfully done. Nonetheless, the movie feels too long for a glorified action flick. Furthermore, it is quite clear from the end that there will probably be an Avatar #3 if not more where they milk the franchise even more. Hopefully, that one will surprise us with the depth that we have been looking for.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A continuation of Jake Sully's story that adds fresh new characters, a new environment, and in all ways enhances the world laid out in the first film, Avatar 2 was well worth the 13 year wait.The film is not without flaw, but these flaws can be easily accepted and moved past in the wake of everything great the film does bring to the table: a visual feast of beautiful shots, incredible special effects, unique and interesting characters, an exciting soundtrack, and an emotional depth on par with the first film.Some of the plot line may seem re-used from the original, a few moments can feel cheesy or predictable at times, and the message on nature conservation is definitely too on-the-nose at times, but the film as a whole more than makes up for those moments with everything it does bring the viewer.Watching in 3D was a visual treat, as the 3D was used to enhance the visuals and add depth to the shots, without overdoing it (nothing flying out of the screen at your head). Perfect use of 3D that never once tired my eyes, even after 3 hours of watching. THIS is exactly how 3D should be used.The 3 hrs 12 min run time flies by and there is never a dull moment. The whole film flows so fluidly that it never really feels too long.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water is an exciting, beautiful return to the incredible spectacle that is Pandora. A perfect balance of exciting and emotional, action-packed and fun, violent but still family friendly. I only wish I could see it for the first time again.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This rituals gave the depth to the first film, with a very unique stunning vibe. We couldn't see this vibe in this movie.Over all, the music score was less than expected.Positively speaking, the art department and the production designer did their job correctly and stepped the game up to a much higher level in comparison with the first movie.

I think the studios have a obligation with the audience of releasing films, specially sequels, with a minimum of quality and not just throwing any garbage knowing that they will make money anyway.The first time I tried to watch it I slept. The second I had to MUTE the film to bare the cringe dialogues, the over emotional music all the time and the nonexistent storyline. The only thing that saves this movie are the underwater visuals and the beautiful new tribe that in a movie like this just felt wasted. Same boring insufferable villain, no new drama introduced just a poor imitation of the first movie problems, no proper character presentation so actually we don't bond with any of them and they seem as a random group of people in.a rave, boring narration with over emotional cringe voice, and you don't just revive the entire first movie as you have the chance to revive the titanic sinking. Boring and plain bad. I'm glad I lost the premiere because it was so fast in my city that lost the dates. Happy because if I had seen in the movie I would probably want my money back despite being for sure overwhelmed by the graphics.","10 out of 13 found this helpful.

An unforgettable experience, nothing like Avatar had ever been done before, in terms of cinematography, visual effects and experience.13 years later, I must admit I did lose my interest for a while but it was instantly reignited when I knew I'll finally watch the sequel after years of postponement and delay. Do I still feel the same way after 13 years, the same fascination my 8 year old self had? No I don't, I FEEL EVEN MORE INTENSE AWE AND FASCINATION. The first film was groundbreaking so we all knew the second film would be too. What the first one did on land, the second one amplified under water, every shot was visually pleasing, serene, calm and immersive. Simultaneously, I was also at the edge of my seat during the action scenes, vocally rooting for the Na'vi. People are quick to shut down the plot of Avatar but this time it fleshed out the characters, had an exhilarating buildup to the climax and a moving end.This is also the first film to ever have underwater motion capture, actors genuinely filmed their scenes underwater, just shows how much dedication, innovation and work was put into this sequel. Avatar is not just a visual innovation, it is a technical one too.Basically, if you're looking for a visual feast to calm your nerves but also keep you up and invested in the character and story, then Avatar: The Way of The Water is a must watch.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The visual effects are undeniably mind-blowing and anyone who says it looks ugly just should not have their opinion taken seriously. Like no wonder the director said he needed 2 billion to break even on this movie's budget; there was just so much investment into making sure it looked spectacular, and it sure did deliver. The story, like the first, however, is where the movie struggles. While the setting and visualization are very original, and are easily the strongest parts, I can't say the same for the story. I've seen stories and tropes like the ones in this movie over and over and over again. It was just not a refreshing watch and besides the visual spectacle, it just wasn't all that engaging for me. The story isn't terrible or offensive or anything, but it's not amazin, just mid. James Cameron and his team did try with this movie. I just really really hope that the future movies will have a better quality story, or I will be having a tough time being invested, as I'm sure many other people will too. I wouldn't take the massive success of this movie to mean that the story can't change. Keep the visuals up though, that's some good stuff.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

James Cameron has not directed any movies since. Way of Water therefore is a sequel 13 years in the making, originally planned for a 2013 release. The result is a film that is ""more"" than the original. It's more beautiful than ever before, there's more and better action, but the story and characters are more bland than in the first.In terms of visual effects, they were as perfect as one could ever ask for. Cameron, perhaps more than any other director, knows how to put on a visual spectacle. With the likes Terminator 2 and Titanic under his belt, he really is the king of visual effects. Avatar: The Way of Water is quite possibly the most impressive visual spectacle in the history of cinema. Everything about Pandora is stunningly beautiful. The familiar ecosystems of the forest and the floating mountains are great, but the reef is mindblowing. No underwater scene ever has come close to the sheer radiance of the Metakayina home. (Cameron really loves water, doesn't he?) The brilliant colors, creatively designed creatures, and each and every little life form make the world of Pandora feel so alive. Seeing this movie in IMAX 3D is quite possibly the best experience I've ever had in a theater. It's hypnotic. In 3D, you don't see Pandora. Pandora comes to you. The action scenes, of which there are much more than before, are also great. The big epic battle is upgraded from the first, with some new ways of fighting added in. Not saying anything about that for spoilers.One interesting aspect of the visuals is the frame rate, which has sequences run at 48 frames per second (most movies are 24). While it may not sound like anything special, it really is. It's difficult to describe, but it's very noticeable. The results of this are mixed. It looks jarring to a certain extent when it's humans on screen, but it flows fluidly when it's scenes with the Na'vi. When it flows well, it really adds to the effect. While Way of Water is not the first film to attempt this, it mostly works, adding another technical feat to Cameron's portfolio. However, not the entire film is 48 fps. This results in some noticeable frame drops, which is not something I ever anticipated saying about a movie. Usually that terminology is reserved for video games.The story is meh, at best. Avatar should really move on from the entire ""humans versus Na'vi"" aspect. In the first movie, the humans are like a window for us viewers, as Earth dwelling humans, to enter the world of the Na'vi. We don't need that anymore. Taking the humans out of the movie will open the door to explore the world of Pandoran culture much better. But instead, Earth and Pandora are still at war, and Colonel Quaritch from the first movie returns as a Na'vi. It is an interesting dynamic that he hates the Na'vi but yet becomes one, which is something that the story does right. And him coming back is dumb to us, but at least it makes sense when it's explained. The dialogue is also an issue, it's really bad. It is disappointing for the story to underwhelm, especially given what we know James Cameron is capable of.The other characters, both old and new, aren't really much to report on. Jake is a strong family patriarch now, which is a natural progression from where he's from. Neytiri really hasn't changed any since the first film, but she's still the same agile fighter that she was before. Spider, a human who wants to be a Na'vi, is a new character that's conceptually interesting, but nothing noteworthy in execution. Neteyam and Lo'ak are a typical big brother little brother duo. Not really much to say. Kiri is an interesting character, but her voice was really weird, because she's canonically 14 years old and being played by a 73-year old actress.And yet, when it focuses on the Na'vi and Eywa, there's a certain comfort in the simplicity of the story and characters. Avatar is not a film in which to be invested in deep lore like Lord of the Rings or even Marvel, but rather a different type of immersion. There are no volumes of Avatar lore, what you see is what there is. There's a certain mysticism to it. The character of Kiri is like the audience that way. She is connected through the water to Eywa, but cannot really explain why. She can feel Ewya's heart, which the audience can too, somehow. And it is indeed mighty. This is the beauty of Avatar; we can connect to its fictional world on an emotional and even spiritual level. This is something that can be said of very few movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes and no. Avatar The Way Of Water is a great sequel to the first. It is about looking for redemption and to be with your family no matter what. It discusses mature themes of hope, pain, and losing all you got. The CGI has massively improved. All the work they put into making the characters more realistic was all worth the job. The main problem I have with this movie is that it is way too long. It does have some fun moments but overall I do think that it could have been narrowed down for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes in this film felt really long. Because of how long the movie is, my rating is lower than it should have been. But to the question of whether you should watch this... If you liked the first one, then sure go for it. If not, maybe skip this one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Avatar has always been about immersion and world building and a light story that doesn't get in the way of said immersion. But a lot of people forget that although characters and story look simple, underneath they have a very important function in that they establish clear goals (similar like Fury Road). Yes, the movie feels very slow in the middle, but I think by taking its time with all the new characters we get a better pay-off for the final act. Most of the story and conflicts are quite predictable, and I wish it would have a little more surprises here or there. But it is undeniably a very good looking movie with a lot of attention to detail. It's truly rare to see carefully crafted images like here.I saw a 3D screening and although not my choice I was impressed with what they have done in terms of depth. The action set pieces are also very well crafted except maybe one (the shark chase was tedious and repetitive). Bringing back the colonel felt a bit cheap at first but it's safe to say that Cameron has something more interesting in store for this character in the next movie. The kids probably too, we spend a lot of time with them and their hardships. I can imagine that this will be paid of in subsequent movies. The other bad guys are unfortunately very bland. Overall the movie has very similar flaws like it's predecessor, so if you don't like the first one this won't be a revelation either. I personally enjoyed it more than the first one because I really can see the hard work put in every frame, and I think the action scenes are better staged and executed. But I would lie if I'd say I wasn't bored at some moments here or there. Overall it was a good IMAX experience but something tells me that it is also a fleeting sensation like the first movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Over three hours long, and boy couldn't I get enough of this flick.Beautifully composed and very atmospheric, the movie pulled me right back into the world of Pandora (which I haven't visited since Avatar hit theatres back in 2009). Watching it in 4DX definitely helped me to sink in deep, and I caught myself thinking that this could go on for another three hours and I wouldn't be mad about it.The story is basic, but it's emotionally grabbing and full of positive messages through and through. The heroes are compelling and likeable, the villains are easy to dislike. The world gets build phenomenally, and the action sequences are intense, but far from overloaded.Visually this is an absolute treat, and the score is subtle but effective.I don't have any profound issues with this movie whatsoever.

Even though the film looks impressive at times, at some point I started to realize that I would rather watch a proper nature documentary. The action scenes are well made in a way where the veteran director seems to take all of his greatest hits compilation. 3 hours of video game footage however does not apparently make for a good or even a decent film.The technical spectical is not enough to save this film from awful writing a script that it has. I wasn't expecting Shakespearean drama, but the story and the characters were even more bland and/or non-existent than in the first film. All of the characters have one single motive and none of them are relatable or even likable. The story itself is an excuse for the mass violent spectacle happening on the screen. Even though the Na'vi are fighting the American imperialists, they seem to have adopted all of their core values: patriarchy, nuclear family, violence as a virtue, chastity of body and having a gun fetish. Their supposed connectness with nature seems more like one what middle class people from the western world experience while on a holiday in a tropical island, than what actual indigenous people have.James Cameron, you can trick me twice but I will not make the same mistake three times and will happily skip the rest of Avatar films.","22 out of 33 found this helpful.

Actually, I must appreciate Cammeron for his directing, VFX, CGI, wonderful shots, he brought the real reef into our big screen. Every Scene is a masterpiece, The actors were able to show their performances, he represented new characters, new part of pandora. But where is the plot, where is the Damn story: James, Just I have been waiting 13 years for no story, no plot, Even the battle scenes were not enough like the first one
The Movie is 3 hours and 12 minutes and I still need more, I wish that this will take the place of the best Sci-fi movie in my heart, but it didn't compete avatar. But let us look at the bright side James showed us the meaningful of family, of being father and mother.Jake sully and netyri was so different from the first part because the just interest in their kids, I guarantee you that you gonna cry hard in the movie in sadness and happiness.My rating is 9/10
just because there was no creative in the story it was like another marvel movie.What are you waiting for, go ahead and watch the movie the Imax or in big screen.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I have literally never seen digital effects that are this convincing and the 3D here outdoes the incredible 3D in the first film. Cameron also seems to have cracked how to use high frame rate footage to enhance action sequences without hurting the rest of the film. It's an astonishing piece of work that really does need to be seen in the theater.From a story and character perspective, this is better than ""Avatar"", but not great. Cameron has a more compelling and multi-layered plot here, and I frequently admired his commitment to old fashioned adventure, but really ... there's not enough here to warrant the really punishingly long runtime. Especially during the climax where it just seemed to refuse to end, I became a bit fed up and wanted out of Cameron's world long before he was prepared to let me go.But ... I enjoyed this and will show up for more of these.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Given the amount of money spent on it, it achieved the tricky task of actually looking cheap at times. This was down to the switching between digital and film media. It made it very disconcerting to watch, like we were watching two completely different films that had been crudely stitched together. Maybe that had something to do with us watching the 2D version? It felt like we were watching a 3D film that had been reverse rendered for 2D - all a bit weird. It's a film that's very pleased with itself - of course it looks beautiful but the aesthetic definitely dominated the story-telling. First hour could have been done in 15 mins - we get it. They're happy then they have to flee to protect their people. The happiness doesn't need an hour to lock-in. Cameron needed a strong presence alongside him to force a tighter edit.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I guess I have watched the first Avatar movie about 5 times after watching it at the cinema all those years ago. I will NOT watch this one again though.I watched Avatar 2 at IMAX full laser screen. I was surprised how the 3D seemed in no way better than the first one .... I actually kept noticing poor sharpness and definition regularly and remembered how in reviews, some people advised to watch in Dolby laser screen, but that option was not around for me. How has it taken 13 years to make this cartoon which seems no better in technological terms than the first one?There where a lot of annoying cliches.... ALOT....and I found myself putting my head in my hands at times or laughing at things that were supposed to be serious and sad, because of the cliche aspect.I almost walked out a few times.....the first half I felt that I was glad to have finally made the choice to watch the movie, but the second half became just overload of explosions and military stuff in a child like way. I'm a 46 year old man and I can watch military movies, explosions etc.....if the movie is good. But when it's full of childish cliches and childish script writing......it's just tiresome and takes a lot of energy from the human body with all the loud explosions and shouting and 3D activity of more explosions etc. I closed my eyes for many minutes on multiple occasions during the second half.I found some of the acting good and certain aspects of the movie or characters very interesting and well done and there were a few valuable life lessons in the story....mainly for children to understand that not following a parents safety advice repeatedly, can have serious repercussions.All in all, because I was tired from a hard physical workout this morning, I feel it was worth going to the cinema to watch this. But still.....something in me also feels I lost an afternoon of life, where I could have been practicing meditation or something. So it's a proverbial strange cup of tea.....a mix of some quality ingredients and some poor and overall it doesen't really work and doesen't really leave one feeling satisfied, especially given what it might have been if a less commercially money orientated Director had been at the helm. The movie really does feel over-ally designed for commercial purposes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Beautiful cgi and cinematography undoubtedly is the wonder of the movie, as for the plot - cliche.The plot almost identically mirrored the original film, where humanity once again brings nothing but destruction wherever it lays their hand. The main essence of the film was family but in a sense it put it in a cliche frame, that was disappointing. Even though I do agree on the importance of family, I excepted better from Jake, not to run and escape the growing problems.When Avatar (2009) was released I was a child and ever since I have been fascinated with the world of Pandora unfolded in the movie. At the time it was nothing like before, nothing I or anyone else had seen. It was truly breathtaking and amazing for its time, still is, yet the sequel has diminished my love for Avatar mainly because of the plot.Even though the screenplay and plot have been highly disappointing, nonetheless I admire the hard work of the technical team of creating Pandora in its full glory.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He and his team have almost 200 minutes, and sure, we get quite a lot: National Geographic nature porn as well as fighting galore. The visuals of Pandora and the new tropical ocean site are really beautiful, of course. Another given is that humans exploit and kill this beautiful nature for profit, which is indeed heart-wrenching.On the other hand, Cameron doesn't use the 3+ hours of runtime in a well-balanced way. So much time, but none spent on character development. Yeah, these are the kids of the great Jake Sully and Neytiri (and I really liked the gifts of Kiri), so we can infer the pressure and the danger, but we don't learn much about their personality-except for being rebellious, stubborn or whatever-to really care. And we only get banal truisms of what family life means. If only Cameron had given us more personal insights and a punch or fireweapon less ...By the way, the computer animation looks pretty realistic, but I'm really not a fan of HFR (high-frequency rate) projections. And some of the camera effects, like small whip pans, didn't work well for me. I would have liked a smoother camera.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

1. Premise is totally absurd- the whole multi billion convoy is just out there for vengeance against Jacksully who is living his life as a family man and not looking for any trouble.2. Characters are totally formulaic/ templatized - a rebel child, a gifted adopted girl, an orphan kid, racist/ bullying teenagers etc.3. Story or the lack of it was devoid of any emotions, twist/ turns plot points4. Really long, unnecessary environment building. Probably the director got indulgent and carried awayOverall, watch it with the expectation that you are going into a 3 hour long amusement park attraction and you may have some fun.

When it first came out I did not want to watch it in case it flopped and most people were saying it was a bit ""Meh"", but one year after its release, I decided to add it to my repertoire out of curiosity. From the first minutes I was captured, unlike that stupid Barbie movie when i was literally bored, dozing on my arm. This movie captured me instantly and kept me glued for its remarkable three HOURS, and it seemed like a breathtaking, marvelling journey through the water. A fabulous job with not too much of the mother earth stuff that turns off a lot of people, but enough to brush aside for me to enjoy it happily and immensely. Definitely worth waiting with interest to see what James' Cameron has next with Avatar 3!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie is ahead of its time. It should have made in 2050. I never felt like its 3 hours movie and my heart keeps on asking more and more. I would recommend to watch it in 2d becoz I feel like 3D glasses will de-saturate the movie. Its like watching life of pie whale scene for 3 hours. Its just spactacular!Dont wait for for it to come on ott platform becoz it wont give you the experience that you will get on Imax.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

About story is below average. The fame of avatar will go down as you start watching movie in theatres. You look at your watch every fifteen minutes when will the movie will end. So basically the Vfx are good but story s**ks. And watching on digital platforms will good as you have option to skip many parts. I will just give six star as for me spending so much money and time is not worth it. So think before you watch.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Action sequence feels the same as the predecessor. But James Cameron hits a home run to the true plot point of the movie, the preservation of our world's oceans.Visually stunning, and worth every single penny and then some. You would do it injustice if you did not watch this in the 4DX experience format; moving/vibrating seats, realistic atmosphere (water jets, air jets, mists, and 3D glasses. It's on a another level. Tickets for that experience costs us $25 a seat (not including concessions). The first Avatar movie took 11 years to develop the tech and finish the movie. It helped produced all the Marvel movies in the 2010s. You can see why Disney bought the rights. It took another 13 years to develop the newest tech (adding onto the previous) to produce this eye candy. You can only imagine all the movies that will come out in the next decade using this technology. Even if you don't think you will like this movie, if you love movies with CGI, come out and support the tech and the new people who developed it.I'm not going to spoil the movie for you but what I will say is that if you don't plan to watch it in theatres with the maximum 4D experience. You will miss out. It won't be the same watching this on your television on later release. Unless you have a home theater with vibrating chair, 3D format, and water/mist jets shooting at you. It's worth it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

To be honest, a day before I watched Avatar 2, I asked myself ""what Hollywood/American movie that could make me cry? Except Titanic, none"", I swear to God, I cried a ""waterfall"" over Avatar 2. For me, this is a family-oriented movie, it shows LOVE in family, teaches respect other cultures, and even appreciates the natures both flora and fauna.

Characters aren't super compelling, but the friction between them feels real. Environments are greatly detailed and immersive. There's a guy in a loincloth the whole time for some reason (?) Action sequences are very engaging. Great 2 hour movie. My biggest complaint is that it's over 3 hours long.The movie reaches a conclusion, then suddenly starts up again for another 20-30 minutes.Then it does it again.And again.For me, each one of these restarts hurts it exponentially more. It was kind of like approaching the end of a fun amusement park ride, decelerating to the exit point, satisfied and ready to get off to go do something else, but it suddenly speeds down another stretch of track. Again and again. Eventually I got sick of it.And while I wasn't safety harnessed in the theater seat and could have left anytime, I don't think movies are made to be left in the middle of. I want to see the conclusion that the movie reaches. In this case, it was too many conclusions and far too long to get throught them all. I hope the rest of the planned series avoids that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But not all promises were fulfilled.First, James Cameron did a great technical job again. The graphics and effects are still the best in industry. The 3D effect still looks impressive. And of course the main problem is still in story and setting.World of Pandora looks too unrealistic. It's like a little distorted version of Earth. Na'vi are just bigger humans with almost the same structure as Earth's humans. Animals and plants are just little changed versions of Earth's ones. The theme of intelligent planet is poorly covered. We have a strange version of the Noosphere.The movie still has a very simple plot. We have a conflict between ultra-green aborigines and ultra-military humans. I wish the plot had more mature anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism ideas.Finally, Avatar: The Way of Water is still a great winter blockbuster because of impressive graphics and effects. But the plot might be more mature and more realistic.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Avatar in 2009 too became one of its kind. But Avatar :The Way of the Water, not sure it really make some difference.There were 5 brains invested in the story department. But one integral part missing in the movie was a story. The special effects were very realistic and outstanding. But seriously, for a layman the effects seen in the 2009 version and this sequel is not really different or great, its all the same. It was same old illumintaed algae, sea.shells, underwater creatures, terrains all the same. To an extend, felt like watching underwater edition of Planet Earth documentary.Ok, now what about a sensible story? The theme is very very weak. The story never justifies all those spectacular special effects. There is nothing to hook you to the plot. Its too shallow. Even a 3 year old can predict what is going to happen. There is a huge disconnect between the story and audience. The movie doesn't converse with audience's mind. Personally did not digest the idea of hunting an ex-marine who has already left the field and living a life minding his own business. There is no strong motivation for a revenge. There was not a single moment in the movie where I could say 'Wow this is awesome'I would say, James Cameron should not end his iife hanging behind this Avatar series. He should realise that Avatar is already achieved what it could've achieved and nothing interesting is going to come out from this Blue Men Group. The more he churn out of the same, people will get bored. He should invest his time and energy for his quest for special effects in meaningful movies. I would love to see more iconic movies from Director James Cameron, and definitely not more of the blue people tragedies.","16 out of 23 found this helpful.

The underwater scenes were like diving in Tahiti. The whale was amazing and I was glad to see the communication between people and sea creatures. But the characters are very stereotyped, so the women are mostly fearful and the men are largely courageous. Two thirds of the film is fighting, which was a major turnoff. That conflict could have been cut by an hour. It looks like the target audience was teen boys. And it isn't as good as the first Avatar, which focused on an environmental message and not on violence.

Making it the main element of a movie results (at least to me) in a underwhelming experience.Without a story you simply get a compilation of some really great super realistic VFX shots stretched over 190 minutes. Maybe Cameron could have planned only two sequels instead of four and focused more on the plot developement.

What does a film look like when a creator is given unlimited time and money to make their movie? Avatar: The Way of Water, is the long awaited sequel to the highest grossing movie of all-time. With a film so big, a review can be summed up pretty simply: If you liked the first one, you'll like this one.The movie follows all the basic plot points of the original. Just replace the theme of saving the rainforest with saving the whales.Let's talk about what this one does better than the first. There isn't the tired cliché of the liar reveal, ""at first I was trying to trick you, but then I fell in love."" That stuff is replaced with different clichés, but at least that one is gone. The way the big bad guys attack our heroes is far more visually interesting. As opposed to just missiles and explosions, this time they use little submarines, crab robots, spears, it is a far more complex process. Also, the whales are more interesting than the trees. The whales are more expressive, engaging and feel more like legitimate characters as opposed to simple McGuffins.On the negative side, this film is longer than the first, and it does feel longer as well. A lot of the movie is just absorbing the world and feeling the vibes. There is a lot of wasted time in the movie. Some of the material is introducing dangling plot threads to be resolved in later sequels. The movie repeats a lot of the same beats of the original. Same villain, same evil humans wanting to harvest natural resources, and even the same fish out of water, (or in water) story. The main villain's whole motivation is one word ""revenge"". The teen angst of the children and bullies to the newcomers are frustrating to watch. And there are some character decisions towards the end that make absolutely no sense.But, if I am going to mark down the movie for repeating the bad, I should still give credit to the movie for repeating what works. The visuals are still a sight to be seen. Every scene is filmed with 3D in mind and it is glorious. Just when you think the 3D visuals are getting stale, the movie heads under water and it starts really looking spectacular. Along with the visuals, the action is very well handled. Let nom man say that James Cameron can't do action.It is more of the same, and a little bit better. I just wish a greater portion of the effort put into the visuals and action would have went into a novel story and compelling characters.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Avatar: The Way of Water - Non-Spoiler Review.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8741486/?ref_=tt_urv","andywheeler-11072","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68979220/?ref_=tt_urv","17 December 2022","This isn't so much of a review but more of my overall thoughts about the film. I don't want to review it and add plot points. Best to go in blind and enjoy the spectacle.So, we've been waiting 13 years for this film and was it worth the wait? In my opinion, 100% YES!This is a James Cameron flex of the highest order. First of all, let me get all gooey-eyed about the visuals. In a world where CGI is the mainstream, and we've seen so much done in Marvel and DC movies, James Cameron has delivered a masterclass in eye-popping visuals that will leave your jaw on the floor. It is the most incredible eye candy I've ever seen on screen. The 3D is used so expertly here that you are sucked into the world of Pandora and the Navi. Overall, there are only two words that I can use, and they are ""F@cking Beautiful!"" Prepare to have your eyeballs massaged with the most incredible-looking visuals put to film.We all knew it would look good, but the billion-dollar question is, is the story good enough to go beyond the delicious visuals and add some gravitas to this already stunning-looking movie?Again, for me, the answer is YES!I've purposely not read any reviews for the film, but I am aware of a few negative reviews doing the rounds, and I'm scratching my head, trying to understand where this negativity comes from. I can't understand it.This film focuses so much more on family, and anyone with a family they love will get it. It's an emotionally charged rollercoaster ride, and the stakes are high. It's not very often I get super emotional with films, but when the credits rolled, I had to sit there for five minutes to compose myself. I was, essentially, an absolute emotional wreck, and that tells me all I need to know about how good I felt the story was. Cameron is a masterful director, and he pulled me in hook, line and sinker. I felt totally connected with the characters, why Jake was doing what he was doing for his family and the story's overall arc.This film is 3 hours long, and I wasn't bored for one second; I was that into it, although I feel that 15 mins could have been trimmed from the middle act; that's my only major nitpicking.The final hour is Cameron flexing his action movie muscle to the maximum. It's glorious, and we see a side to Neytiri that left me with my mouth open wide. It's both emotional and mind-blowing. That's all I'll say about that. I loved all the characters, and the new water tribe of the Navi are really cool. I particularly enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's role as Kiri, who delivers a memorable part of the film; again, I don't want to spoil it, but I thought it was such an incredible moment.If Avatar was Ridley Scott's Alien, then The Way of Water is Aliens.I loved this film, and I'll be thinking about it for days. 10/10.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

But then literally half of the movie is lost in an incredibly dull and boring battles between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"", which is so against the point made by Pandora's people during the entire movie.I just ask myself why it is so. I believe that the producers of the movie planned to spend so much money that they believed that by turning it into an action movie would have assured success. But honestly, I think they missed their chance. A lot of people went to see it, sure, but how many will see the follow up? So many, like me, were so bored by the story that they will not.

During one of his binges, he stumbles into a bar where Lady Gaga's character, Ally, is performing. Instantly drawn to her talent, he invites her on stage to perform one of her original songs. The chemistry between the two is electric, and they quickly form a deep connection.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So the story is literally same as avatar 1 which was fantastic and ahead of its time and now comes its successor avatar 2 with same storyline and an improved CG. In this movie the visuals act as a foundation while the story is created in a way to support these visuals and not vice versa. At some point I was feeling the duration of the movie where it felt like watching a Documentary of sea animals on an alien planet. JC is a great director and has proved he can do what he sets to do but this movie was just hiding behind the mind-blowing visuals while the story and screenplay kind of felt flat.

Before I watched it, I expected to see a larger and more complex movie. But in reality, I saw a family. And a few lines touched my heart. Director James Cameron skillfully placed them in various scenes without making me feel out of place. The plot of Avatar 2 focuses on the Sully family, whose experiences run through the whole film. I was moved by this movie, but I also felt some dissatisfaction: some parts of the second act in the ocean clan seemed to have a limited budget, rendering not detailed enough, maybe it had something to do with the pandemic; the plot was mainly driven by the reckless second son Lo'ak, while the eldest son Neteyam did not become more three-dimensional as the film time extended, there were only a few small segments that let us glimpse his personality. I didn't want Neteyam to die at the end, even though death on Pandora didn't mean losing, but it was still a sad thing for Jake and Neytiri to lose their son and for Tuktirey (Tuk) and Lo'ak to lose their eldest brother. It still lingered in my mind after watching it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's been 13 years since we all fell in love with the magical land of Pandora. Is the sequel worth watching? In a word, YES! In this story, Jake Sully lives with his wife and children on Pandora. Here is the description of the story from the studio: Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started in the last film, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'avi race to protect their home.THINGS I LIKED:
I had the great pleasure of attending a press screening last night. A free movie ticket is always nice, but I also got free popcorn and one of those reclining seats that lift your legs like a Lay-Z-Boy chair. So nice!All of the planned Avatar movies together are expected to cost over $1 billion. Rumor has it that they're being filmed back-to-back so that we don't have to wait as long this time! James Cameron is currently saying there will be three Avatar movies.The special effects are UNBELIEVABLE. Stunning! Gorgeous! Incredible! This absolutely must be seen on the biggest screen can you find or afford. IMAX with 3D! Everything is bigger than life, yet the smallest tear is so detailed and emotionally powerful.Critics and audiences have already been tossing around the word ""experience"" and I absolutely agree. This isn't just a movie but an experience. It's probably the most immersive movie I've ever seen. You FEEL like you're in Pandora. You can practically feel the water on your skin and wind in your hair. With my 3D glasses on, I honestly thought for a second that I was going to get wet during the rain scenes! When the huge creatures or watercraft fall down, you FEEL the heft of their weight and power. I remember after the first Avatar movie came out that people were watching it over and over until they became depressed that they had to live in our world and not on Pandora. Yes, that was an actual thing! A dear friend of mine became so obsessed with Avatar that he began blogging and posting so many comments on Disney's forum that the company took notice and later invited him to become a Disney Imagineer. True story!There has been a lot of talk about the frame rate that was utilized in the making of the movie. The industry standard is 24 frames per second. I got to see the movie in 3D which was really immersive and awesome. James Cameron decided that only certain scenes would use the HFR technology.Kate Winslet did all of her own underwater stunts herself. She broke Tom Cruise's record for filming underwater at 7 minutes and 14 seconds.The musical score was composed by Simon Franglen after James Horner's death in 2015.So much action.I love that the forest Na'avi look just a little bit different from the water Na'avi so you can tell who is who. Plus, it shows a type of evolution in the species that is fascinating.The imagination and creativity of the designs are ridiculously impressive. I heard someone say how amazing it was that actual humans thought of all of these creative things in the movie!I was worried about a movie that would take over 3 hours, but I admit that the time went by super fast.We all know Director James Cameron does an outstanding job creating epic moments whose scale is massive and mind-boggling, but he equally zooms into a tiny detail like a close-up of people holding hands that gives you all the feels in a grand and intimate way.Everything looks so real and seamless between the humans and the other creatures that share space on Pandora. You instantly believe it all.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I admit I was surprised that the director would basically rehash the same story from the first movie. The villain is the same. The learning curve is the same. The bullying element is the same. Some of the same characters from the first movie come back again even though they had died. What's so wrong with adding new characters to the story? I wouldn't have minded that a bit. I understand though. There were certain plot points that the director wanted to make.There isn't as much humor in the sequel as there was in the original Avatar movie.NO SPOILERS: Some characters were indistinguishable from others.That sweeping musical score from the first Avatar just didn't come back in full force like it did in the first movie.There is a birth that simply has no explanation. Will it be explained in the next sequel?We don't quite understand why the humans make the choices they do. You're embarrassed to be a human by the end of the movie, just like in the first movie. I assume we're going to get more information in future sequels.As beautiful as the movie is, I thought the poster didn't capture its essence at all.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Partial nudity
Strong violence with various weapons (some with blood)
Profanity, including 1 F-bomb
Intense action
People and creatures die
Men hunt and kill creatures
Destruction
We see a bloodied arm rip in half.!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Sure, everyone MUST see this movie in IMAX 3D, it's absolutely breathtaking and is perfection on the SFX and visuals, but for thirteen years we waited for this movie and the story couldn't have been written just a little better? Then again, let's be real, we all go and watch Avatar for the visuals and not the plot regardless, but I do think this one takes away from the special effects. I just wanted the characters to shut up and actually get back in the water so many occasions, but overall, it's definitely worth the watch for what James Cameron accomplishes in the water.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Very few films accurately depict young people well, but this movie did an amazing job. The young characters really steal the show and drive the emotion of the film.I can understand why so many people in these comments compare it to Nat Geo or a documentary. The wildlife was filmed beautifully, but so many vieres have become used to Marvel Comic book films and modern Star Wars films. If there isn't action or a one-liner every 30 seconds, a viewer gets bored. There is a lot more to this film than action, however, and I think the beauty of the family bond and the bond with rhe wildlife makes the impact of the action that much more meaningful and emotional later in the film.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Absolutely awesome. But everyone already knew that. This movie was shot using the Sony Venice 6.5K-Resolution IMAX digital camera with a production budget of almost $300 million.SQ. I had to increase my master volume by about 8dB. After that the ATMOS soundtrack was very good. There were some good overhead sound effects, but I didn't think there were any incredible standout scenes. Bass seemed very good. Just very good overall, but not REFERENCE DEMO in my book. Absolutely nothing compared to ""Moonfall"".So maybe Cameron or his team has something to learn here. Cameron is great with the video, but not as awesome with the ATMOS.The movie/plot/writing: not as good as Avatar-1 IMO. Very basic story like everyone already said. It is a good movie IMO, but not THAT great. Nothing compared to ""Edge of Tomorrow"" IMO.So, after seeing this movie and looking back, I don't see how this movie made $2.3 BILLIONS! :eek: :DJames Cameron must know some magic.Box Office:
Titanic: $2.25 Billion
Avatar 1: $2.92 Billion
Avatar 2: $2.30 Billion.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

As the first avatar the 3D is very well done. But I'm definitely not a fan of the high frame rate. I knew this beforehand but still gave it a shot since I wanted to experience the movie how the director intended to show it.The high frame rate makes the scenes look like a game and a lot less like a movie. Also some camera movements feel too gamy. Usually the wide shots with a quick zoom-in do that. Not a fan of it.Not all the scenes are in high frame rate. I definitely liked those better. Unfortunately you can also notice the difference between HFR and non-HFR in the grading (colors) of the movie. The HFR scenes seem like showing too much contrast.Other then disliking the HFR I think it was a great movie. Specially if you appreciate the visually stunning world that has been created. The movie became more pleasant the moment the water world was introduced. It also pulled away my attention from the game like feeling a bit. I also liked the story although a bit thin. It's more about the experience and about family. I wish James Cameron would remove the gamy feeling of the movie for the upcoming sequels because I'm definitely still a fan of Avatar!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Different movies should be viewed in a variety of ways. With Avatar WoW, anyone can emotionally involve themselves in the simplicities of the story by reflecting on our own lives. You want to learn how to breathe underwater, appreciate the beauty of the world around you, and never stick together with loved ones.The first act moves at a breathtaking pace in which you cannot wait to get to the shores of a new clan of Na'vi called the Metkayina clan. Once there, you don't want to leave. By the time the 3rd act comes, you understand why you cannot run from the threat of our main antagonist. And by the time the main action set piece of the film arrives, it's driven by the characters and plot that was built-up by the filmmaking as well as your personal connection to the themes.While it may not win an academy award for best script, it shouldn't. It's not that type of movie-going experience. It does deserve strong accolades at awards shows.

Obviously the wait was a long one. 13 years made the expectation larger.So I had to watch ""The way of Water"" in 3D, and so I did. But almost a damp squib. The visuals were absolutely amazing. No one can use technology as good as Cameron. But 13 years of development in technology didn't really show. Rather I would say, Avatar-1 was as good.The script was not anything close to Avatar-1. It was just an okay script. But the story telling was not good enough. The story focused heavily on the children. But the movie could not establish a relationship of the audience with those children. This is where Avatar-1 scores well. The audience connected with jake and his narratives 13 years ago. But this one fails to establish any such connection.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

-The graphics.It has simply not been done before. 3 hours of awe, you have a hard time getting used to the scenery and the levels of details. All that combined with a feeling of incredible scenographic smoothness (parts of the movie are in 48fps instead of the usual 24fps cinema standard) which I loved! The smoothness of each body movement or splash of water gives you the chills imagining how long it must have taken the animators to perfect.The creativity of the underwater life is very pleasant to discover as well. Creativity on the graphics definitely not lacking throughout the entire movie.On the harsher side, there are some details of the movie I'd really like to be made clear which I will not spoil.I personally didn't see the 3 hours pass, and that's a good sign on its own.

I am convinced that James didn't have a Shooting script. He just turned on the camera, filmed a few motion captures, then put in an insane amount of CGI.The characters are devoid of emotion, motive, and charisma, giving them all the same personality as a plank of wood. They are empty vessels for James to use as a megaphone to spread his environmental concerns. Honestly, why not just make a documentary like blue planet and call it a day, or a dozen years in his case. Why waste so much of his and the audience's time and money to say the same thing that's been said multiple times in a much better way(Wall-E).The story is simple and predictable yet still could've worked had the runtime been shorter, like a lot shorter - you could cut an hour and a half of this and it wouldn't make the slightest difference in terms of continuity. Scenes that should have ended kept going on for minutes. And some of the sub plots are of the same quality as a soap opera.And at last, The Dialogue. Movies these days don't seem to care about good dialogue, and sadly the audience don't seem to care about it either. A dialogue should firstly and most importantly be interesting. Exposition and escalation (driving the plot forward) are useless instruments if the audience isn't invested in what the characters are saying. The whole movie feels like it was written by a pretentious art student who has no knowledge of how interactive speaking works. It also doesn't help that the actors are terrible, delivering each line without emotion or charisma. They all sound like characters from a very bad video game.","24 out of 37 found this helpful.

He is back and is back with another spectacle that will blow your mind ...In Avatar 2, Jake has moved on with his new lease of life in Pandora and is living happily with Neytiri. However, his happiness is short-lived as the new threat enforce into their world and he must work with Na'vi race to protect their world.To refresh your memory, James Cameron is probably the most bold and visionary director we could have seen in our lifetime. He created a human cyborg covered with tissue and skin in the Terminator franchise (1984) followed by a stunning sequel in 1991 which again was ahead of its time owing to its jaw-dropping CGI. He went deep sea-diving with The Abyss (1989) followed by hardcore action flick, True Lies (1994) and took us back to the most unfortunate incident told beautifully in Titanic (1997). With Avatar (2009), he created a gorgeous world of Pandora which was very well received even though the story was just fine. Similarly, the sequel has all the film-making style of Cameron which boast off quality work and you will be able to view in each and every frame of Avatar : The Way Of Water.Overall, James Cameron does justice to his fans and audience who waited for 13 years to witness the sequel which is grandeur and better than the first one. Do watch it in theaters to enjoy the experience.Follow me on Filmychowk in Instagram.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I would recommend anyone to watch it just for the visuals because they are worth seeing at least once in one's lifetime. The crew spent over a year to develop the revolutionary underwater motion capture and it just paid off. Besides the visuals the movie excelled in its great cast and acting performances especially by Kate Winslet, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver (as Kiri). I am not going to lie, the plot left a lot to be desired. It was nothing special, it was simple and predictable. But there was really no need for that. Everything else made up for it. Another thing that needs to be highlighted is James Cameron's ability to keep a good pacing despite the exaggerated length of the movie. Just like Titanic and the first Avatar, you won't notice how long it takes because of the stunning visuals and storytelling. Definitely a must-see.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's been around almost 20 years so most people have heard of it by now. I found myself wishing this sort of visual technology could be applied to a virtual world like that. The detail, the beauty, and the movement is all just perfect. If you can't sit back and enjoy this movie, I don't know what to tell you.And back to the story.

The surprise of villain redemed once he realizes that his world is not all black and white, but let's say more full of different shades of grey, or in this case blue.

But the most annoying thing about Avatar is still the blatant copying/stealing from cultures like native Americans, Maori , African tribes/cultures, etc. It makes absolutely no sense that extraterrestrials like the Na'vi would act, do, sound and say anything that's similar to humans. It's silly that they actually just lifted things from different cultures to create a nonsensical patchwork instead of creating a unique world. I'm not questioning the logic in a fictional movie. I'm just pointing out how lazy and unimaginative the writers and the director must be.You feel me, ""cuz""?","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

He just reheated the film with another location and new characters. It is a film with a childish action but it does not reach the level of the first Avatar. There is no way. The sound, the story of the characters, looks as if they were written in a hurry on the bus, on the way to the filming studios. The film lasts far too long for such an action, it was practically stretched to the maximum. I expected more from Cameron for a film of this scope, especially since he waited 13 years for this. Indeed, the CGI effects exceeded expectations. Film seen in the IMax 3D cinema hall. If the first Avatar convinced me so much that I saw it countless times, the second part disappointed me so much that I won't see it again.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

Yes, as a lot of people point out the story is not exceptional. However, it is also not as bad as people make it seem. I hate when the story only works because of plot holes when characters do completely unreasonable things or extremely unlikely events occuring. The way of water had minor plot holes or unlikely events that didn't change the story. For example in the first movie, we see how difficult it is to teach the Na'vi english, but now suddenly even the remotest tribes all speak english.Maybe it is on purpose because otherwise we would read a lot of subtitles, which i wouldn't mind.No major plotholes make it 6+ at least. The story also has drama, tension and emotion but no exceptional depth that makes you think for days. Storywise it's between 7 and 8 but closer to 7 for me.Now the good part: The visuals. Usually I wouldnt watch a movie just for the visuals, but im planning to go to cinema again. The 3D is top notch (also the directing, to have different depths in the image), the animation of the landscape and animals is breathtaking.Its common to pay money for a zoo or aquarium, or for a trip to other countries with amazing landscapes. And when you later watch the fotos on your smartphone, they are no comparison to the experience you had when being there.This movie comes close. You see spaceships, beautiful landscapes and animals. One really emerges into the world of pandora like in the first movie. It is an experience no other movie gets close.Combined with the good but not exceptional story, its a must see.A 10 has to be perfect and perfect is almost impossible. Avatar - the way of the water is a 9/10 in my book.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

There are a enough movies out there that are based on true stories or politicized garbage.Go to the theater sit down and let this movie take you on a journey.

The choice was, to watch Avatar or The Book of Eli. I asked the cinema person what I should see on arrival and they literally printed off a ticket for Avatar without saying much else. I saw it in 3D and I remember walking out of the cinema, calling my wife (I was working away from home), and said to her ""You NEED to see this movie"".I came home, I immediately took her to see the movie and she loved it. We have watched it so many times since.Fast forward 13 years later for the sequel. I was excited, and I went myself again as my wife was watching our baby. I anticipated coming out the cinema and phoning / texting my wife saying ""You NEED to see this"", but I didn't.The sequel is too long, and it has been said that James Cameron even cut out scenes because there were too many gun scenes. Had he left them in, how long would it have been?There was no story to this movie, unlike the first movie. It was ""Let's go to this planet and kill Jake Sully"" was the theme. The storyline was not interesting, I was clock watching all the way through it.

The great visuals and soundtrack added a lot to the action sequences which were enjoyable and made for a great spectacle.The world of pandora is vibrant and alive, in ways the pandora shown in this movie is better than what is seen in the first film since it keeps aspects of the original but also adds to it too. The world feels lived in, with different animals and also a different race of Navi who have been evolutionarily adapted to their enivronment. This adds to the intrest of the world greatly, especially knowing that this likely means there are different groups of Navi with their own culture and adaptations to their way of life, in this case, their way of water.The story is much like the 2009 Avatar film, it involves humans vs the alien race of the Navi, in The Way of Water, a similar story takes place, with Sam Worthington reprasing his role as Jake Sully, however, Sully now has four children resulting in him being less reckless and more concerned with proetecting his family and his sons, who are eager to prove themsleves to him and their peers. This is somewhat fustrating to watch as it feels like the story tellers delyaing the inevitable battle that will take place, in a way creating fasle conflict that is not needed.A problem that can be felt from the film is how it aims to do too much which perhaps stops the film from honing its core postive aspects. Becasue there are many new characters that are introduced a lot of time is needed to focus and flesh out the fresh faces while also focusing on the old ones too. This is to the detriment of the film as this contributes to the over three hour run time. The issue with the film being so long is the fact that it has many scenes that are unneeded and could have been removed in the edit. The story does have some apsects that are intriguing with some genuinely emotional moments, it is for the most part somewhat hollow though, but at times it does raise the question of imperialism, particuarly America's part in the world, not being limited to its past treatment of native Americans but also its conflicts in recent memory such as vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq.The Way of Water feels a lot like the first Avatar film in terms of the quality of the visuals, the sound design and soundtrack as well as the story. Its not much better or worse than the first film. I can confidently say that if you liked and still like and enjoy thr first film, it is highley likely that you will enjoy this one too. The experience is much the same and should feel like treading down a simialr road. I would however, say that this film felt a little better, perhaps becasue there are less human scenes, which often felt like the worst parts of the first film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Avatar II had a lot to live up to before it was ever even conceived. That said, James Cameron and all of the thousands of dedicated hard working people who worked together to make 'this' happen, out did themselves. Not in the sense of Avatar II being better than the first, but in moving the story forward in ways that keep the original Avatar audience and newcomers involved. We saw this in 3D. Please do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to do so as well. Every scene, every movement, every second is beautifully breathtaking. I am as impressed with the quality of every shot as I am with the progression and growth of our beloved characters. Job well done.

What happened to Unobtainium? I guess they obtained it. Why are they fighting? Revenge seems to be the only reason. Jake Sully must work with his Na'Vi family to save them. To do this they decide to hide with the Metkayina, the water people. This leads to almost a soap opera section where the family, especially the children, try to fit in. Later on we get introduced to the tulkun, intelligent friendly whales like creatures. In effect it becomes a save the whales section. Now the overall effect is not bad. It could be shorter and tell the same story. When you're in a cinema with recliners you get a small number of people moving past you to and from comfort breaks which is a bit distracting. The ending seems unsatisfactory. Perhaps they want an Avatar 3? Overall a good.brilliant vibrant film with some stupendous fight scenes. The plot is slender but adequate so I class it as pleasant, watchable but not great.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have a big movie collection, and been a movie fan my whole life.This was absolutely spectacular. I liked the first Avatar, but I loved this. I rarely go to the cinema, but I would go always if there were actually more movies like this, in 3D Imax with stunning visuals. I'm excited that now this has been made, the others moviemakers must follow/adapt seeing how amazing this is. The only concern is if there is enough geniuses to make movies like this.Brilliant. Never gave 10/10 rating to any movie so far, but for the whole experience everything combined (story+visuals+3d+imax+cinema big screen), I've never watched something as good. Story is simple, but IMO beautiful. Doesn't need to be complex for this type of movie. 3 hours never went by so fast! Connection to and message about earth, spirituality, and what our reality is (with industrialisation and money grabbing) is amazingly transmitted through the characters' emotions.PS. Seeing this or the the first Avatar in 3D vs 2D makes a whole lot of difference. Always do 3D and Imax!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But not just wildlife, human tech is (mostly) equally well designed, with an attention to minute details and usage. Everything looks grand, and bringing more avatar characters on screen feels more immersive than before. Additional nod to the water tribe evolutionary traits - it's subtle but effective environmental adaptations, great idea.Fights and chases are also amazing, even when it's just a rehash of the previous stunts - they're dynamic, gripping, frightening and overwhelming. Very well done.With all that meticulous and thoughtful world design, it's almost shocking how unfitting and grotesquely generic the characters are. Jake Sully is a horrible father, which is justified by a philosophical ""A father protects. It's what gives him meaning."" - except the way it's done in the movie, it makes a disgusting role model and a whole bunch of daddy issues coming forward. Kids are like taken of some generic teenage show (the constant ""bro"" thing, ugh!). Same villain that somehow lost the tenacity and iron spite of his previous self.The story is very straightforward, with a predictable amount of holes awful decisions - it's not much t o say about, especially given its unfinished nature in anticipation of future chapters. It's OK.Overall, I think it's worth watching - not just because it's a long-awaited project, but because it's really a spectacle. I'll watch it again, I'm sure. And I'll go see the next movie when it's released. I just wish they'd put more thoughts in the character design next time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

First time round I found it quite overwhelming and missed the finer details of the film, but seeing it a second time I thought it was absolutely fantastic and equally (if not more) emotional. I love how James Cameron is holding up a mirror to humanity about what we have done to our own planet. I went the second time with my family and they all loved it. All the new characters that have been introduced are so likeable and give Avatar a fresh new feel. Beautiful VFX, excellent acting, emotional story...I can't wait to return to Pandora!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The often terrible and cringeable dialogue and the fact it is over-long.What I want to touch on is the tech.I watched the film at 3D IMAX as this was the best option available to me. I expected to be wowed, and for the most part I was.The introduction of the water world, in particular, was stunning and incredible immersive. It was great to see 3D relevant once again and put to such good use.However, it wasn't far into the film when I started to notice something familiar. Certain scenes looked less natural and more like video game graphics or even like TV picture quality when you rev up motion smoothing. And these scenes kept coming. Particularly during battle passages or fast moving chase or flight scenes. But they would be interwoven with normal looking content.I remembered reading somewhere ages ago that Cameron wanted to experiment with filming at faster frame-rates, so I put it down to that and tried to re-engage.But, between this frame-rate business (which didn't bother my wife) and the plot and character issues, I can't, in good conscience give this film more than a 6.When I got home I did a little searching online and sure enough, there it is and very obvious. Cameron decided to film the action sequences and more at 48 fps, which is twice the cinema camera tradition of 24 fps. This is what creates this effect that, to me, is closer to a video game experience in style. For me it does not make, particularly the forest scenes look more realistic, but quite the opposite. I really don't like it.However, and as I said, my wife didn't notice it and wasn't therefore bothered by it. Maybe I'm sensitive to it, but there you go.As most have said, there are some stunning visuals. And I would agree. I would also agree that most of these won't have the same impact on the small screen. But personally I think a good small screen will be enough for me for any further sequels.I do wish Cameron would consider the writing and characterisation a little more, before seemingly obsessing about technological leaps and frame rates. It's a shame, it's such a beautiful world. But is just not enough.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A visual and auditory experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8738900/?ref_=tt_urv","dmansel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123353548/?ref_=tt_urv","16 December 2022","At its heart, The Way of the Water is about the indominable strength of a family's will. Jake Sully does everything in this film in service of his family, even when questioned by Naeytiri. Even having been integrated into the Na'vi culture for over ten years, Sully pushes back against the culture and traditions, to Neytiri's anger and dismay. In an era where sequels have to mean bigger, because bigger means better, the common pitfall is adding in explosions and more characters to either kill or be killed, and while there is some of that here in this film, Cameron still keeps his focus narrow. For all its bluster, it's digital wonderance, and bloated runtime, The Way of the Water is simply a tale of a man who wants to keep his loved ones safe.That said, while Cameron and his team have created one of the great cinematic experiences of the year, the movie isn't without fault. From a writing perspective, Cameron may be at his weakest: Way of the Water's overall story isn't as strong or impactful as Avatar, the first act is a rough reintroduction to Pandora, and James Cameron, the man who made the idea of the space Marine so incredibly cool, fills these particular Marines with the cringiest, hammiest dialogue. Whether that's purposeful or not is certainly something to consider; in Aliens we get a squad of shit-talking, ass-kicking, overly macho (or overly compensating) characters who, while mostly one note and underdeveloped, are still memorable for their interactions with each other. Here in this movie, we get a gang of douchebags, simps to Colonel Quarich's petty quest for vengeance against Jake Sully. Whether or not Cameron is attempting to deconstruct the myth he himself helped create in Aliens is unclear. What's clear is his writing of their dialogue consists of little more than chuckling at Quaritch's evil schemes and telling hostages to hold still.The first 30-40 minutes of Way of the Water may be its roughest patch. The story is juggling reintroducing characters while giving appropriate due to the new faces in the franchise, attempting to simultaneously remind of you where things ended in Avatar, what's transpired over the past decade plus, and set up the new central conflict of the film (which, honestly, is just the exact same one from before, but this time it's personal). This leads to clunky editing, hopping between stories in an unwieldy fashion that feels more like an unsuccessful exposition dump than a setting of the board. Once the pieces are in play, however, the film settles into itself, and the audience can buckle in for a hell of a ride.Except, there's act two, which could be one of the most divisive elements of the film. Once the Sullys have left the skies and taken to the oceans, the narrative shift from Jake and Neytiri protecting the family to the Sully children learning to integrate into a new society and acclimate to the ocean becomes the story's main conceit. If the pacing of the first act is janky, the pacing of the second act almost slows to a halt. Not to say that's completely a negative, however, this is where Cameron relaxes and proceeds to flex on moviegoers with the reason the sequel took so long: the water scenes in this movie are amongst some of the most beautiful he's ever crafted. The entire act exists almost solely on vibes: lots of pondering shots filled with gorgeous digital landscapes and extended underwater sequences take full advantage of the 3D and IMAX screens, inviting those in the seats to come along the journey. Occasionally Cameron will remember to insert a bit of plot to keep the narrative thrust alive, but he also know where his strength lie with the first movie and that's in creating a world people would visit if it were possible. He replicates that feeling in the second act to astonishing results, at the detriment of the storytelling.The third act is pure, unadulterated, uncut raw James Cameron: pulse pounding action, small beats that further develop the characters, and spectacle as far as the eye can see. Overall, the film is a triumph, and while there's parts that don't work as well as others, and some characters that don't work well at all, the idiom that has been kicked around Hollywood for years continues to ring true in 2022: don't bet against James Cameron.Sam Worthington reprises his role as Jake Sully, physically damaged former Marine turned native in the first film. As the face of a franchise, Worthington is less than ideal; his lack of any sort of charm or charisma hampers the character from being beloved, but his talents are serviceable. Luckily, no one goes to an Avatar movie to see Sam Worthington, and what he does in this film is exactly what he did in the first; he hits his marks, he says his lines, and we proceed on to the next scene. While it's not necessary to be a ruggedly handsome man exuding waves of charisma to lead a franchise (it certainly helps, though), Worthington has never really fit the leading man type. Still, he provides enough to be passable and will likely continue to return to the role for as long as he's needed.Zoe Saldana has far less to do here than she did before. Previously, Saldana is Sully's (and the viewer's) guide into the Na'vi and their foreign ways. She's a necessary component needed for Sully's eventual transition, and by film's end the journey's she's taken to learning to trust humans again, or at least a handful of them, makes for a good character arc. In Way of the Water, Sully has been fully integrated into the culture for years, therefore diminishing her role as guide. This time around, Neytiri is a (mostly) supportive wife, relegated to spending large swaths of the movie either fearing for her children's safety or simply not on screen. It's the final showdown where Neytiri really gets her chance to shine and shine she does. Saldana, no stranger to action scenes, throws herself fully into the mix, with an outstanding fight scene that reminds moviegoers never to mess with a mother's children.Stephen Lang returns as Colonel Miles Quaritch, one of the better gleeful villains of past years. A cliche spewing, cigar chomping, walking ball of buzzcut testosterone in the first film, Lang is very obviously having a blast playing the film's central antagonist. He returns with the same attitude here, with a bit of a harder edge, determined to kill Jake Sully for his crimes against humanity. Quaritch is a gun-toting military enthusiast's wet dream, and while that type of person inherently comes with their own toxicity, the absolute joy with which Lang plays the character makes him one of my recent favorite villains. Thanks in large part to Cameron's writing and Lang's acting, Quaritch is a character that people can love to hate.While there's other characters introduced in the film, to include all of the Sully children, as well Cliff Curtis and Kate Winslet as ruling family of the reef people, and Spider, a character that doesn't quite fully work, the relationship between Jake Sully, Neytiri, and Quaritch really is the reason for the season. Even though Cameron laces the film with those themes of family togetherness and fighting for survival, it's the round two grudge match between the three that provides the thrust for the action in this large budget adventure. The movie's ending will guarantee something of a round three, possibly the final word on settling the score for good. Thanks to all three actors (mainly Lang and Saldana), the story is primed and the stage is set for a Rocky/Apollo Creed level matchup.Avatar: Way of the Water brings writer/director/producer James Cameron back to the director's seat, helming his first narrative feature since the Avatar 13 years prior. This go round Cameron chooses to focus on the family dynamic. In this, Cameron as a writer excels: the Sully family feels like a family almost any of us can relate to: rebellion teenagers, smaller children still encountering the wonders that Pandora holds, the outcast different child, all these elements are in play and Cameron uses these elements to set up a number of storylines and situations. From a directing standpoint, Cameron, cinematographer Russell Carpenter, and the rest of the cast flex their skills in recreating (and then enriching) the world that so many people fell in love with back in 2009. The attention to detail and the creature work is astounding, and even with a second act that drags the pacing of the entire film down, no fault can be blamed on the experience that Cameron wanted to convey; through both Lo'ak and Kiri the audience is able to enter another unturned stone of Pandora, its oceans. It took Weta FX a year and a half to develop a motion capture system that could blend with filming underwater; the result of their efforts is easily one of the best visual events of the year. These are the reasons Cameron took so long before filming the first movie and filming this one, it's clear that he wants the audience to feel as much as the characters of the story do and in this he succeeded in spades.Overall, while the stakes of Way of the Water aren't as high as its predecessor, the grandeur of storytelling is. James Cameron leaves it all on the screen, providing a visual and auditory experience that reminds moviegoers of the art of blockbuster.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I don't believe I've ever seen CGI look this good, so good in fact that it puts many other modern movie blockbusters to shame. The action scenes do not disappoint and are surprisingly pretty brutal. As far as the story, I found it to be a little refreshing to see more personality in the characters and it was nice to have that family dynamic between Jake, Neytiri, and their children. Colonel Quaritch also has a bit more dimension to his character and will likely continue to be explored in future films. My biggest gripe is that the story feels a bit too thin for a movie this long. Some noticeable plot holes can be a bit jarring. Some problems also carry over from the first film to this, like the heavy handed environmental messages and the lack of nuance which prevents potential interesting ideas from being explored that could add depth to the story. As the credits rolled, I found this film to be an improvement, not a massive one, but an improvement. Final verdict: 7/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was Christmas Eve, with a rare fall of snow and rush hour traffic through the Christmas holidays in town. So, the first movie has a special place in my heart, despite its flaws. I never understood the hate the first movie received over the years. It is one thing to have an opinion, but what I find odd is every criticism people had for that film can apply to any other movie, yet Avatar somehow got it the worst. Due to it being popular, maybe?Anywhere, I was ten years when it came out, and now (as I am writing this) I am 23 years old. During that time, I finished Primary school, High school, college, and University and survived a global pandemic. So, it has been a while, and a lot has happened. This review is as late as the sequel, so it seems fitting.But how was it? I thought it was solid.Jim Cameron did it again!It is a long movie, clocking in at 3-hour-and-12-minutes, and while watching, I did feel the runtime a bit, but with a man like Jim Cameron behind the camera, he guides you through the scenes visually, with a flow in pacing, coming from a veteran of his craft.A character like Jake Sully has more to him compared to the first, with him having to raise a family and keeping his children in check. He uses his past military experience to its benefit by ordering his kids around and showing them tough love. Sam Worthington was good in this, and it helped that he has got something to work with, in terms of his character and emotional drive.Zoe Saldana is fantastic as always, even though she cries a lot in the movie.Stephen Lang is back as the villain (they explain how), and his character is a massive improvement here. Instead of being a generic evil military who is hard as nails; however, for the sequel, they take an interesting approach to the character where the actor has more to work with, like Worthington.On the other hand, the visual effects and the 3D are standouts here. Some of the best CGI ever? The water looked so realistic it puts other water effects to shame, looking at you Aquaman and The Little Mermaid remake. The world-building was compelling, and the camera work was off the charts. I don't like 3D for movies, but here it is phenomenal, especially in the underwater scenes.Although, it does take a while to get going, as I struggled to connect with it at the start. The score was not as impactful or epic since James Horner (RIP) didn't compose the score. Some of the writing was not great, especially one scene involving bullies that was so bad. Not all the emotional scenes worked for me, and it did feel manipulative.Even with those problems that I had with the movie, I understand why this movie did so well at the box office, not because of its ground-breaking story-line or characters; no, because it follows a basic theme about family, and the movie is the perfect escapism to another world that audiences have been waiting for. It's a movie that promises you an experience, a spectacle you cannot miss! It was easy enough to connect with audiences and make them revisit this world.I am more interested in Avatar 3 now than I was before.Never bet against Cameron boys.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This film defines the very essence of the Avatar franchise: Family, love, hate, exploitation... humanity.Avatar: The Way of Water is touching on every level and sets an example for the ability of modern filmmaking in the digital space. It defines the essence of what it means to be human, just as the first movie did.This is, hands down, the most BEAUTIFUL movie I have ever seen, and I will be watching it again.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Like the original this film is breathtaking to look at, and since I love the sea I was perhaps more astounded by this imagery than last time. Unfortunately the story is weaker this time around, and harder to justify since I'm one of the few who liked the original's plot. Neytiri is also sidelined in this film, which I found disappointing since she was a standout in the first.Jake Sully now has a family with Neytiri, two son's and two daughter's; followed by an adopted son. The family dynamic is the core strength of this film, however the children themselves are a mixed bag. The story relies so much on them getting into trouble that it becomes annoying, however there are some scenes which ALMOST make you forgive them for this.The action and effects are just as amazing as the original's, but unfortunately this film is still very much the same as the first. I wanted to feel what I felt during the original, but unfortunately I didn't, and even though I wasn't bored, I wasn't as invested either. If the third film does happen, I hope there's changes made to make it more engaging.This film is longer than the first however it's not noticeable, all though five or ten minutes extra would've pushed it. There are quite a few scenes which I disliked in the movie, like a certain pregnant Navi riding off into battle, but overall I liked it; however I can't say I'm enthusiastic about another one.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Having read numerous reviews saying how disappointing it was.Various critics marked the film down due to having ""no story"", ""bad acting"", ""slow paced"" etc etc.This is utter nonsense!The film was, of course, visually stunning! Everything was vibrant, scenes alive with colour.You 'felt' the alienness of it all.Yes, the story was quite simple. It picks up where the first film left off. The Sky People are back for vengeance and more!Does it really need more plot than that!Of course not!This is not Shakespeare folks!It's pure imaginative fantasy with plenty of action to keep you entertained for 3 hours and 12 minutes - which, by the way, seemed like half the time.And as for the so-called slow moments...
Well actually, thats where there was more of a story - if you have the eyes to see it.How the Na'vi have that symbiotic connection to the whole of the planet and how it's crucial to their survival.How the invading humans have no understanding, or empathy of that connection, which incidentally is worth more than any mineral or whatever they can harvest for profit... if only they had the eyes and the common sense to see it.Fact. It is actually another form of the Gaia Principle many believe in on our Earth, as proposed by James Lovelock back in 1972, suggesting that:
""living organisms on our planet interact with their surrounding inorganic environment to form a synergetic and self-regulating system that created, and ultimately maintains, the climate and biochemical conditions that make life on Earth possible"".Now that's what I call a story!Back to the film...
The CGI is fantastic!The action is breathtaking!The acting and story is absolutely fine for this genre of movie.James Cameron also has a bit of fun here and there referencing his previous movies. And why not?Go see this movie.Watch with uncritical eyes.Enjoy the exhilarating ride.After all.... Thats what movies are for!!!!","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

It was kind of passed through and didn't develop the rest of the movie well. Story, again, the thing that keeps Avatars from being among the best was lacking and they tried to do too much different things and the same things as last time. Does anyone stand up to the script writers or just cower and go with the flow. Hopefully the next ones are better but my guess is no. Really, though, they had all the same comments about the bad story from the first one so they should have hit this one out of the park.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie is pretty long with over 3 hours run-time, but honestly, it didn't feel like that and there was no reason to feel bored. The weakest part is again the script, which is far from being original and having had 5 authors named for it surely didn't help. Also borderline pesky was Sam Worthington rambling on and on about family values with a lot of repeat. The movie paints again the story of greedy corprorates invading a paradise like moon.

I watched ""Aliens"" well over 100 times and this is not hyperbole. It was the quintessential movie that threw everything at the screen and dared you to compare it to the more bleak predecessor. It couldn't be compared, because that's who he is. Having dropped him from my list of directors I'd be first in line to see after the meandering ""Titanic"" I finally watched a more modern Cameron.The problem with him is he isn't necessarily full human. He is a replica of one. Knows the emotional beats because that's what the template wants him to do. Otherwise, he is buried under the technology that he wants to break in future projects. He doesn't care about people. They are obvious caricatures of what people are suppose to be. Witness the failed Edward Furlong interacting with a Terminator. Absolutely cringey today. Or the cold lack of intimacy between Jack and Rose in ""Titanic"". The corny lines don't stop. But NO ONE tells Iron Jim.He also has a great impression of caring about humanity. He doesn't care. He does know he's suppose to, because his generation (boomer) requires that he does. It's an arrogance that permeates his movies. This is no different. It is a practically perfect rendition of feelings and relationships foisted upon blue people (Native Americans or Maori folk). In this, it is about whaling. Or whatever they're called here. Having spent decades going deep deep DEEP into the sea, Cameron is determined to lecture us on how we are destroying HIS planet.So we get ""Avatar"". The next installment of how humans suck and things that look like humans don't. What is the real lesson here? Family (go ""Fast And Furious""!). They say it ""Sullys stick together"" Eye roll. And it's not like I don't like schmaltz. In fact I love it. It's that Cameron is horrible at it. The world he builds doesn't necessarily require that he pile it on so thick. And there are moments where we see what he is setting up for, when it comes to one of the sons. Without giving too much away.Avatar is a fantastic world built on great imagination. But I can't imagine Cameron telling it around a fire with that must zest. Without the bells and whistles of painfully aware computer graphics, the story is bits and pieces of better movies. Sometimes better versions of his OWN movies. And it boils back down to the basics again. Why are the humans who've ruined their own planet spending so much more time and corporate cash to terraform another one? If you want, you could see it as what LV-426 was prior to colonization of terraformers In ""Aliens"" Another perspective told from the xenomorphs point of view. Ugh.The movie is engaging in its visuals. Late afternoon warm environments make you feel like when ""Far Cry"" games start to lean towards dawn. The beauty is constructed through far off water lands or deep jungles. It's a place many humans WOULD want to inhabit. But not many would survive.I do applaud Cameron for attempting to get closer to humanity. He has moments between children and parents that ring rather true. Though with the impending doom of invaders, we know the story won't spend much time in tranquility.Overall, the movie isn't bad, it just was un-necessary if only to show you the possibilities of computer generated worlds.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

LUCKILY I WAS WRONG. The animation is extraordinary, perfected and nothing like the first. Sure, it last for 3 hours and 12 minutes, but it is so freaking good and exciting that you won't even notice if you have to pee. This is my 2nd time watching it in the cinema, and I would definitely recommend. Hands down the best movie made in 2022. YOU ARE BRILLIANT JAMES CAMERON AND WE LOVE YOU! The long wait was worth it in the end, and know that all of your fans will fight to make sure all future movies is going to be as popular as this one. Looking forward to the next movie already!!UPDATE:
I went to see it in 4XD when I was seeing it for the third and last time in cinemas. Absolutely amazing. I see people who rate this movie 1, that is not possible and makes me mad. Alone the visuals of the movie is 5. Yes, I can agree that some of the scenes need some work when it comes to dialogues but name a movie that doesn't? Still, this movie makes you feel like you are on Pandora. I will say, if you are going to watch it I would recommend 3D or 4XD. Be prepared for laughing as well as crying. For the ones stupid enough to not get the message: EARTH IS PANDORA. That is the reason he used a ""tulkun"" because we are killing animals very similar to this creature. And for the people who are just missing a part of the brain; spider could not be put in a cryo because babies can't survive in one. The plot is somewhat repeated but at the same time no. What is not repeated in Lord of the rings? Harry Potter? Characters and storylines are meant to be repeated in small doses to make a successful film in my opinion. After all, life is repeating itself every day.Please read the meaning and make sure you understand the first movie before you rate this a 1. Because it really does not deserve that and I think you know that too. Don't drag a film down in the mud when you don't know anything about it. Make James Cameron proud.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This film expands the world spectacularly panning out across the Navi species into other races, other tribes and the seascape. Where the first film had an intimate feel as if we were peering into the lives of a forgotten lost tribe, this film feels more like following the epic journey of a family across the world. Acting, special effects, the story and the score all build to give some spectacular and emotive scenes. The scenes of struggle in the water were very visceral for me I was gasping for air alongside the characters - the feeling of fear in the water is captured very well. The colouring and clarity of the world is magnificent and the addition of the bioluminesce effects in the water were magical for me.Unfortunately the pacing felt off to me. The first part was fairly rushed diving straight from birth of first child to rebellious teenagers needing firm guidance. I didn't engage with the story till quite far into the film for this reason. When connections start forming in the new tribe is when I started to care about the family. Then action scenes towards the end of the film feel much too long and drawn out, especially with the addition of irrational moments just to prolong action. It sometimes felt like spectacle for spectacles sake and I started thinking about how much money the studio would like to squeeze out of the series.I think the editing was a bit off too. The transitions and cuts were jarring at times bordering on feeling amateur. These moments disengaged me from the experience and the flow of the story felt interrupted too. There were random black cuts where I actually thought wtf!The script and moments between the adolescents of the movie were off putting at times too. I understand the decision to make them very human in behaviour and speech, so that we as the audience would quickly understand their various characters (rebellious, good child, innocent, hippy etc) but occasionally I found it all a bit annoying or over the top. I found myself thinking they were intentionally using some of the MCU tricks to tap into that market.The stereotyped caricatures and over played dynamics also got tiring quickly - they felt like lazy storytelling rather than connecting to essential things in the human experience. The bad guy losing all sanity in the name of revenge actually made him lose his edge for me. Hero - family that are amazing at everything also got tiring quickly. And the scenes depicting the resource abuse and hunting were a tad too gratuitous for me - over painting the bad guys as evil.There are real moments of emotion however which redeem the film. The parents discussing how to bring up their children, people connecting over shared experiences, loss and the struggle of families against the world. The acting was always top notch imo even if the script or story wasn't quite there. The stunning landscapes and beautiful score heightened these moments wonderfully.Where Romantic love, colonial-evils and connection with nature where the main themes of the first film - these themes are carried on but wrapped in new themes - strength of family and strengths of community (both navi and natural). By the end I felt I'd been on an epic emotional journey. And seen lots and lots of water.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The youngest hadn't experienced 3D before and gasped when the opening scene started; reaching out his hand as the images came towards us. Many others in the cinema had the same reaction and there were quite a few ooohs and aaaahhhs. We all 100% loved it!!!! It didn't feel like a 3 hour movie and the middle section of the plot - learning about the way of water - was truly a glorious experience. (I've read that some thought it too long and unnecessary - However I absolutely loved it and it gave an insight into the kids lives) We go to the movies to be entertained and to enjoy a well told story. And James Cameron has definitely done that. I went back on my own to watch it a second time (without the 3D glasses) and picked up a few little things that I must have missed in the first viewing. This wasn't a bad thing - I'm just pointing out that in a cinema full of people of all ages your eyes can be distracted sometimes. I think I enjoyed the second viewing even more. I shouted myself to a Gold Class screening, reclined back and just let the movie wash over me. There's so much to take in that I'm really looking forward to watching it a third time on the small screen at home. Seeing it in VMax on the BIG screen is something you need to experience, however sometimes your eyes can't take in the full scene, so watching it at home in the comfort of your living room or media room is going to be special as well.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Meh. The film was certainly very pretty. The story was ok, though a bit disjointed in places. Perhaps a ten year production cycle makes it difficult to maintain continuity.But the main thing is that I didn't really care about these characters. The mother cried all the time. Hard to like a character that's always crying. The father comes up with the brilliant plan to run and hide instead of standing and fighting for what's right. Hard to like someone who runs and hides. The kids, and the villians, and essentially all the other characters were frankly not that easy to distinguish. Everyone is blue CGI.Pick a film at random. Unforgiven by Clint Eastwood. At no point in the movie did I have difficulty distinguishing between Clint, Morgan Freeman, the girl that provides the inciting incident, or any other characters in the movie. It's always clear who is who and what they are feeling.Blue cgi characters in Avatar are certainly the most realistic that I've seen. But frankly they all look a bit the same after a while. Combine this with them being shot underwater or in endless eclipses, it starts to be a noticeable issue.The first movie was all about ""unobtainium"". People came to take the mineral because it was valuable. In this movie, we don't mention that at all. But then they seem to remember that they need some reason for people to come to Pandora. So they mention that they can get this immortality serum from the whales on Pandora. Then they never mention it again.This movie is largely about the powers that be launching a jihad against Jake, the hero from the last movie. Ok. I understand that if he's been trouble to them in the past, they'd want revenge. But now he's hiding in the forest. Not making any trouble. And now you've found out that you can live forever by harvesting whales. Is it really reasonable to commit the equivalent of an aircraft carrier's worth of resources to find a guy who was a problem 14 years ago?Many people are killed attempting to get him. He's not even doing anything. Just hiding out. It's not like he's Bin Laden plotting another attack. He's literally just a has been who is hiding in the forest raising a family.So I couldn't really understand the motivations of the villains either.Pretty movie. That's for sure. Hard to distinguish the characters, harder to like the characters, and I didn't even really dislike the villains. So why am I watching? To see blue people swim in blue water?FOR THREE HOURS?Seriously, cut a full hour at least out of this thing.Pass.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

On the one hand the film includes a delicate fusion in the messy plot, but it defends itself among others, by specific, technological approach to acting, in which you can feel the craftsmanship of some actors' experience. However, most importantly, ""The Way of Water"" is about plotting history with a visual layer that is turbo-delightful, appears to be an epochal achievement in cinematography in terms of the technologies used in the film and the immersion of such a work by the viewer. Really, my dears, it is impossible to assess ""The Way of Water"" fully objectively; Cameron knew what he was doing and how he was doing it. He knew that it would not satisfy all recipients, so he focused on combining a powerful graphic stimulus with the most advanced graphics engine and setting, accompanied by wonderful music with a typical action plot, which, however, does not lack a note of individual and community drama.Sorry for my not good understood English. :)","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

A movie that will make you appreciate your kids (if you have one). This is a movie that even my 7 year old was interested in. I was actually surprised. I love the animals in it. The CGI and animations that they did, hands down, still mesmerizing. The first Avatar was really good, I watched it toooo many times. Usually, a sequel movie does not do justice or a not needed film.

"7","/10","Patriarchal Stories and Matriarchal Worship, Cameron's Self Contradictions and Divisions","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8932126/?ref_=tt_urv","YimingSong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163372345/?ref_=tt_urv","16 March 2023","In his obsession with nature, Cameron glimpses the matriarchal attributes of nature and the plundering of nature by humans, which is one of the central themes of his films.He used many symbols to build the visual world of Avatar, such as the sky people spaceship that resembles male genitalia and the countless caves and circular designs of the Avatar world to symbolize matriarchal nature.But the two themes expressed in his films are self-contradictory and contradictory.Perhaps it is his gender privilege that prevents him from confronting the fact that in a patriarchal society, men plunder women's wombs through the institution of marriage, just as sky people loot the wombs of natural mothers through technology, both of which are the same.So Jake Sully, the father in his film, seems out of place in the whole matriarchal nature created by Cameron.While Jake, the father, is in the primary position, holding the baby in his hands, his wife Neytiri, who has just given birth, is submissively in the secondary role; the ritual is the worship of the fertility of the goddess ""mother Eva,"" this scene is an important image that contradicts the main idea of Cameron's film.Or rather, the ancient goddess again comes to man's dream world through symbols. Still, she can only exist in a nebulous dream world, either as a symbol of the goddess mother Eva, a dead female scientist, or a non-human animal Tulkun, the man once again found the goddess of nature who rules life and death. Still, he can not link her to the enslaved wife and daughter.Perhaps Cameron perceives his self-contradiction, or the fear caused by the contradiction between the two, anxiety brought about by the separation of the two powers of the female characters ruling fertility and death, so that the woman heading life away from violence (the power of death), and the woman leading violence away from fertility, can be very clearly perceived, where the female characters, all must choose, it is evident that the fertility goddesses The female characters who decide the power of death, the commander-in-chief of the Sky People Command, and the occasional woman who doesn't know her name (although these goddesses of death are suspected of deliberately good European and American feminism to make up the numbers).Of course, Cameron also thought of a way to solve the relationship between the mother and violence, the mother is the archer, but she stays away from violence most of the time; she is forbidden to initiate violence for herself, but she still plays the meek wife in daily life, taking care of the man, as well as cooking for the man, bandaging. Hence, the mother is usually away from the violence of the Virgin, and only in exceptional circumstances is she allowed to use violence, that is, the son and husband Threatened. The advancement of the feminist movement allowed women to be empowered, but only if that empowerment was only for the allegiance of the patriarchal family.Why? Because once the mother is free to use violence like the father, the father's position of absolute power is threatened, and the father's legitimate existence is inevitably questioned. In Cameron's film, the father's power comes only from death, and he must infinitely magnify the power of men's death to retain the legitimacy of men in power.When the ancient goddess reappears, she is the warmth of new life and brutal death. For a baby, to be looked at and loved by its mother is living, and to be ignored and neglected by its mother is dead, the first power structure experienced by human beings.No matter how Cameron sings the praises of the patriarchal family, this is also a time when the patriarchal family is disintegrating, and the patriarchal family under the marriage system is gradually deteriorating.In the matriarchal and patriarchal family, the empowerment of the man in the family cannot be accomplished without the woman joining the marriage. The confrontation between matriarchal and patriarchal power is between these two kinds of families: mothers and wives.A wife is not a mother; a mother does not become a wife; it is a two-choice problem for women, a wife who surrogates children for her husband and a mother who chooses genes for her children.Natural mothers are brutal and cold, do not create offspring for any male, and look coldly at the male competition; the weak die, and the decisive win, mothers always choose the winner, even if they choose the same winner, but it does not mean that the mother will become a wife, the winner is always changing, and the mother's choice is constantly changing.The people who enslave their mothers will be enslaved; totalitarianism is birthed in patriarchy. This is man's punishment for turning mothers into wives, but it is not the only punishment nor the heaviest.Humans have already lost their mothers, so every child has a lifelong lack of so-called sweet drama in the male lead, unconditional love, and attention to the heroine of the male information to provide shelter and security for women. Are they the real man? In nature, only the mother is unconditional love and shelter existence humans look for love as children look for their mothers.The role of the father in the patriarchal family is to imitate the missing mother, but it is not like men to be mothers; sexuality is the final point of their reproduction; they are born unable to link with their babies, they are frightened, widowed, frequent cheaters, rely on authority to maintain legitimacy (like the awkward father in Avatar), but they are also missing mothers, people look to their wives, to their husbands, even People look to their wives, to their husbands, and even to their children and those in power for motherly love. Still, the traces of mothers have long disappeared into history, and love has become control, kidnapping, and deprivation.For too long, humanity has been without mothers, and wives who are disappointed in their husbands are even raising their children as their mothers, demanding attention, motherhood, and shelter from them.We all hope that Eva, the mother goddess, will return to earth, she is as we imagine, powerful, warm, cruel, breeding life, but she also brings death, although at this time she is still far away, all the children lacking a mother are longing for her.Until then, humans can only become their mothers.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

While personally enjoying the forest setting more, The Way of Water does its best to introduce a new culture and ethnic tribe of Pandora to viewers to make the film experience memorable.At times, the film seems more focused on the visuals than delivering a plot that holds up to the spectacle placed in front of viewers. Many of the sequences starring Spider don't entirely fit the narrative of his lived experience for 3/4ths of the film; however, there is enough there to not detract from the story too much.Some narrative points played too much on typical tropes that felt to be exact replicas of humanity -- placed on the Na'Vi, in what feels to be slightly uncreative for a culture far separate from that on Earth.While The Way of Water isn't the film it could have been, it remains an entertaining watch that does provide moments of water and intrigue as to what the future of the franchise may hold.Real Score: 7.2.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The rule is ""The movie must be limited to 2:15."" This movie was about 3:05.This is a really good movie, I mean, there is no comparison between this and your everyday garden variety movie. This is amazing stuff, and must be really good on a large screen. I can't imagine how amazing it must've been in 3D. I saw it on a 60"" TV on HBO.There are drawbacks, as many other reviewers have noted. I was shocked when I realized they brought back the same villain that the first movie so tediously defeated in a 45 minute fight scene. The ignorant white republican coffee drinkin' military guy. He is their Darth Vader, their bogey man, and will appear in every movie I guess as the villain. He's so utterly cliche it's ridiculous. I was also shocked to realize this had a very similar plot to the first, wow, what a major mistake by Mr Cameron. Bring in new aliens, maybe non-earthlings, create an entirely new conflict for new reasons. Give white americans a break maybe?It's quite offensive that all the bad guys were all white americans. Out of about 100 bad guys shown, 99 were white, and 1 was asian. And not just a little bad. I mean evil, ignorant, insensitive, all the while, once again casually drinkin' their mornin' joe. What would happen if the 'good guys' were this ""non-diverse""? The street style dialogue of the Navi kids, which many complain about them using the word 'bro' a lot, was apparently intentional to represent them abstractly as people of color. So the white americans were completely evil, unemotional, insensitive, and out to get the POC.So while there are major flaws that are disappointing, and really surprising that Mr Cameron could be that inane, the movie STILL overcomes them to be an absolutely great movie. I thought it was much better than the first one. It could've been one of the all time best movies ever made though with more common sense writing.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was a big fan of the first movie and loved that visually stunning material was shared with an excellent script that had many parallels. The new edition was a pale shadow of the original. I was underwhelmed by the visuals but that could be because I was watching this in a regular theater and not 3D. I was most disappointed by lack of story (soul) of this movie. Editing was rather poor too with scenes being excessively long. Old characters were stale and new characters were not developed at all. Didn't really form bond with any new characters. It looked like producer and directors were thinking of something else while they made this movie. I understand that there might be more sequels but this edition in itself is not worth the time and the money.","31 out of 50 found this helpful.

Although I see so many reviews on here saying that the Plot and story brings the movie down. I strongly disagree, the plot setup is the only thing weighing this movie down from being almost perfect. The setup feels too similar to the original and a little random/unnecessary. The movie makes up for its mediocre plot with some fantastic story telling, emotion, and action. I never would have thought that people in motion capture suits being turned into blue people could capture and make me feel so much emotion for fictional characters. Every hit that the Na'vi took I could feel, every lost warrior was a blow and tug on my heart strings, which had gotten connected to these characters after the hefty run time we spent with them. So glad this movie did as good as the original because this is one of few times a year I would count going to the theaters an ""experience"".","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

For a long time, I thought this movie would never come out since it's been delayed so many times. Now that it has, I can definitely say it's a sequel to Avatar in the sense that it's more of the same from before. That's not necessarily a bad thing depending on your opinion of the original. If you're someone who liked or loved the first Avatar, you'll really enjoy Way of Water. Even people who just thought Avatar was okay I would say give this a chance, because in many ways it's an improvement over the first. However, many of the issue with that film are present here. If you're someone who really didn't like Avatar then you shouldn't bother with this, as this won't change your mind.Now, I'm someone who's a big fan of James Cameron's early work. The Terminator is great. Terminator 2 and Aliens are among my favorite movies of all time. I enjoy True Lies. The Abyss is okay. Those films prove that Cameron can write a great script and memorable characters if he wants to. Then we get to Titanic, which is a mixed bag for me. I enjoy the second half when the ship is sinking. However, the first half I find to be pretty slow, and I've seen better romances. The original Avatar is a movie I did not like at first. I never got into the immense hype the film had when it came out.After watching it again recently, I can say it's definitely not a bad movie. I had more fun with it than I thought I would. It's a mediocre film elevated my amazing visuals. I still think the film was overhyped and did not deserve to be the highest grossing film ever. But this was when Cameron clearly stopped caring about storytelling as much, and focused everything on the visuals, which is a shame. This film follows suit on that for the most part.The effects are still stunning, even more so than the original. What this film does better than the first is that it barely focused on the humans. Avatar gave half the focus to the Navi and half the focus on the human side, whilst Way of Water focuses primarily on Jake and his family on the Navi side. So, we get more exploration of Pandora in this one. I imagine someone who really got into the visuals and worldbuilding of the first film will probably enjoy this one even more. The action scenes are also impressive, as expected from a Cameron film.I will even say the characters are improved in this film, if only slightly. Aside from Neytiri, there was no one I really cared about in the original that much. Here I actually like Jake. I got into his character arc of him being a soldier coming into conflict with him no being a father trying to keep his family safe. Even the main villain is more fun to watch in this. He as a bit of depth to him here, rather than just being a one note villain. It's not much, but it's at least something.The biggest issues from the original have not gone away though. The film is extremely long. It's significantly longer than the first, which is already bloated. For such a simple story, there is no reason for the film to be as long as it is. I felt the length in places, particularly the third act. The final battle, while well-executed, does drag on too long. It's every bit as preachy and heavy-handed as the first.It's the same story of Navi versus humans. I would have preferred there be no humans at all in this. I would have liked a movie where it's just Jake and his family exploring Pandora. The main threat should have been a rival tribe or a natural disaster. Nature can be just as destructive as humanity. The humans could have made a return in the third film. That's just me though. As it is, it's still enjoyable enough, as the humans are less of a focus in this.Overall, like I said, if you go into the first Avatar then there's no reason not to check this out if you haven't already. I will say it is better than the first, despite being more bloated. I'd give the first film a 6 out of 10. This one I'd give a 6.5, rounded up to 7 for IMDB. I just hope that Cameron can channel his old self and make a great story, as well as a visual spectacle, in the inevitable third movie. I'm pretty sure Avatar 3 will happen even if this film doesn't do well, since Cameron supposedly filmed Avatar 2 & 3 (and possibly Avatar 4) all back-to-back.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unfortunately although the visuals and plot of the movie was actually pretty good, it did indeed have its flaws.Flaws:
The movie didn't continue on from where the first Avatar ended. I expected that it would show the end scene of the first movie and it continue from there. It didn't so I was left confused as to what was happening on screen. For this reason reason it felt like a stand alone film rather than a sequel with its own plot.Another flaw was that the film focused only on the Avatars and not the humans. I know for many that's good and what people only want to see but as the first film showed humans entering the machine and turning into Avatars, to not see that AT ALL in the second one was pretty odd. It was like they completey disregarded that idea.Overall it's worth the watch as it is a film that is better experienced in the cinema than at home however just don't go with high hopes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Set over a decade after the events of the first film, the story follows Jake Sully, who is now the Chief of the Omaticaya Clan, living peacefully with his family on Pandora. However, their tranquility is disrupted when humans return to the planet with a vengeful mission to colonize it once again, led by Colonel Quaritch, who has been cloned into a Na'vi body. Jake must lead a guerrilla operation against the RDA to protect Pandora and his family, including Spider, the son of Quaritch who was born on Pandora. The family eventually seeks refuge with the Metkayina, a clan adapted to the aquatic habitat of Pandora, where they face new challenges and adventures.The film is a captivating and visually stunning experience, with breathtaking underwater sequences that showcase the beauty of Pandora's oceans. The story is a thrilling continuation of the first film, with well-developed characters and a strong message of environmentalism and the importance of protecting our planet. The themes of family, loyalty, and the bond between humans and nature are also explored in a touching and emotional way.The performances of the cast are outstanding, with Sam Worthington reprising his role as Jake Sully, bringing depth and nuance to his character. Zoe Saldana shines once again as Neytiri, Jake's fierce warrior princess companion, and newcomer Jamie Flatters delivers a strong performance as Spider. The film also features an impressive ensemble cast, including Sigourney Weaver, who returns as Grace Augustine, and Kate Winslet, who plays a new character, Ronal, the wife of the Metkayina clan chief.Overall, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a visually stunning, emotionally engaging, and thought-provoking film that lives up to the expectations set by the first movie. It is a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates epic sci-fi adventures with heart and soul.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is the same level as the first movie, it's almost impossible to choose between them... But if I had to, I would choose this one. Why?About 80% of the whole movie is almost the same as its predecessor's. Humans are bad again, Pandora is beautiful and stunning again, the whole plot is nothing very complex again, dialogues are not that well-written and some of them are cheesy AGAIN. So, what are the differences?First of all,here are much more characters here and I like them more. The main character and the main villain change only slightly, but I still aprecciate that. All the children here are possibly the most complex characters and their journeys are really engaging.Second of all, there are a few really moving moments and they hit me much harder than any scene like that in the first ""Avatar"".But the most important difference and the biggest advantage of this movie is learning about a new culture and that's fascinating. I know we got this in the first one, but here it's explored in much better and complex way. At least in my opinion.All that sea animals and everything we know about them... I loved it immediately and I won't stop soon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What stories can be told no that were unimaginable before! This film will have you in awe for its entire run time. This is not without its flaws.Although visually stunning the story seems very safe which is typical for a block buster of this budget. This choice is understandable but it does hold it back from being on my best of all time list.Accompanying the stunning effects in this film, Cameron utilizes HFR for about 95% of the film. This adds to the moving going experience and shows you can tell a story on the big screen at a frame rate higher than 24 fps. However the change from HFR back to 24 fps is very jarring and pulled me straight out of the immersion the film does so well. Changing frame rate is nothing new to film but this time it is done poorly. 24 fps in action and dialogue and vice versa. There is no reason to change this much other than to make certain shots look more traditionally cinematic. I hope for the future films Cameron swings for the fences and keeps the HFR for the entire film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Whilst at their new settlement they learn the ways of the water which will help them as the human aggressors approach.As with 'Avatar' Cameron has produced another stunningly beautiful epic full of the most glorious ideas as the family learn about life in the sea. Clearly this film carries a very heartfelt eco message and it is unlikely that you'll come out of seeing this unmoved by its ideas and spectacle. It could, I think be argued that it it is a little too long with sometimes too much time devoted to blue people smiling at glowing fish etc and the principal villain Quaritch, growling about Sully a bit too much. That said it's a glorious piece of cinema, which I saw in IMAX 3D and which I would encourage you to do, with the last 45 minutes being one of the most exciting pieces of film you'll have seen on a screen for some time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The basic premise of the story sounds so basic, but the visual treat and direction of this movie are so well executed.Direction: James Cameron knows directing a story in such a way that people will love to see the journey of each character and the way he creates a beautiful world around the characters.Writing: Another reason Avatar 2 is a well-made movie is that the director is also a writer of this epic. When any writer directs his project, he knows what he wants. Pandora's future is Amazing.Cinematography: Soul of the project. Avatar is always well known for its visual effects, even its CGI or Motion Capture. I can understand how challenging it is to visualize the scripts and shoot raw footage with perfect lights and frames. So hats off to this department.Music and sound design: so soothing. So beautiful. The pandora theme or when the characters dive into the water for the first time or when the battle begins. You pick up any scene and it's so well-created sound effects. So good.VFX: Perfect Perfect Perfect. Who am I even to talk about this?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You're expecting to be wowed like the first time, but it came out short in many ways. It doesn't feel like a roller coaster ride like the first movie and lacks of emotional depth. There are quite a few new characters in this movie so I feel less attached to any of them. They are fun to watch but failed to connect at an emotional level. I guess it's because the character did not seem to develop much as a people of Pandora. Hopefully the next one could live up to the expectations. Perhaps it is still to early to judge. Let wait until the whole franchise roll down it's curtain.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It seems they worked really hard on showing the audience how much they've improved the cgi, but in the process forgot to work on the story.I left the theatre shaking my head knowing that no matter how pedestrian the storyline was, people will be impressed at the graphics and it will sell millions of tickets anyway, leading Cameron to believe he did a stellar job. Then he will unleash the more Avatars on us.The first movie is remembered fondly because none of us had seen anything like it before. Nowadays we aren't as dazzled by cgi because it's everywhere, and a movie needs a good plot as well to stand the test of time. I think this will go down in history as a successful movie, but not one you need to see more than once.","32 out of 52 found this helpful.

We waited. Yeah, I don't believe it either, but I saw Avatar: The Way of Water in the cinema, and after 13 years, James Cameron brings us a sequel to the most successful film of all time. And here are my thoughts, there are plenty of them. I'll start with by far the best part of the entire film, and that is without a doubt the visual aspect of the film - CGI. The visual effects are possibly the best I've ever seen in a movie. The water that is found in this film in a really big way is photorealistic but in a newsy way. Even on CGI characters, it looks perfect and I wondered how Cameron could do it again. It can be seen that he really wants to be the best in this and he is succeeding. Sure, the movie apparently cost almost half a billion dollars, even if it looks bad, but Cameron squeezed the money 180% and it shows in every money shot. The whole movie is one big highlight visual. Admirable and groundbreaking. Those fish and all kinds of monsters in that sea looked absolutely wonderful, and about the second third of the film shows us all of it in full splendor. All those animals, plants, and sky - beauty. And this admiration of the world really does not get tired, because Cameron staged the film in a really exemplary way. The 192 minutes went by pretty much painlessly and I didn't feel that at any point the film suffered from a lack of fun. But for that, I think that the film suffers a lot in one thing, and that's exactly why it's not full fire from me this time - the script and the plot itself. I really don't want to claim that the film has the same story as in the unit, but - it actually does. And unfortunately, I also have the feeling that nothing extra was resolved in this movie, or I didn't feel any great catharsis after watching the movie. Don't get me wrong, the third act is fun and even Neytiri herself goes full-Rambo-mode here, I enjoyed it immensely, but the events leading up to it seemed generic to me, and from the script, I really feel that it is outdated in terms of originality and innovation. We've seen this before and I understand that the visual side has moved on and that Avatar got a sequel, but this type of scenario can no longer work at the top level. Jake and his family are in danger, and Quaritch threatens to kill the descendants in one piece, the least interesting of them, Neteyam, dies at the end, and after Jake vs. Quaritch wins Jake. Great, but Spider saves Quaritch and we get him in the top three?! I needed something more. Quaritch is a black-and-white villain who logically came back, but here Cameron should have killed him, which makes the movie feel slightly anti-climactic and unnecessary. And why Spider saved him at the end makes a bit of sense, he's his father, and blah blah, but it absolutely doesn't work for the movie. The resulting experience was still extremely positive and I'm really looking forward to the third, but I won't forgive Cameron there. He knows, how to shot a movie with such quality and create new technologies whenever he wants, but the pen has probably stopped writing properly on paper, it needs to be replaced quickly because I also want a luxurious story in such a luxurious coat. Otherwise, the idea of another tribe is great and I'm glad that I want to learn more about that world. Lo'ak grew on me and I hope he gets the most space from the children in the next films (and replaces Jake?). But what concerns the action scenes, the camera, the shooting, the pace - there Cameron is still different. In these ways, it is the king and will remain the king, but again - I want a better story. But I'm still glad I saw the movie in 3D, even though I felt a bit like the edges of the screen were darkened by my glasses, which created the effect of making the screen feel smaller. By that I mean, feel free to go for 3D, it's great, but I don't think you can go wrong with 2D. I'm looking forward to it anyway, these are movie events that are still saving cinemas, so all credit to Cameron. It doesn't shoot much, but when it does, everyone goes to it. Just don't let the paper rustle like that next time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was enthralled and captivated by the ocean wonders, I just wish the movie had featured more of it as it did with the jungle flora and fauna from the first movie.The CGI is at times exceptional and then at other times adequate.

That being said, it's not the exciting romp its predecessor was.We spend entirely too much time being introduced to the water, its elements, and inhabitants without a lot of action. Edge of your seat action is critical to maintaining audience interest. Long dull periods lead to boredom and inattentiveness. In the first movie, we met the forest animals as they were introduced in action scenes. That is not the case here, and the movie is about twenty-minutes too long because of this waste of time.The script suffers because of this doldrum, too. It lacks in these dull times, though it is strong and vibrant when things are moving along.A movie with those issues would normally have failed. But this one gains from the incredible cast that delivers lines and action in believable fashion and the stunning visuals and computer generated graphics.Overall, it's a good pic, worth seeing.

Clearly they set this up for Avatar 3, when they should have just joined the obvious next movie to this one. What idiots decided to make it all all about the special effects, put lots of focus on the kids, and turn it into a franchise. The biggest stupidity - and there was a lot - was when they all attacked the bad 'Sky People' ship, and then all of a sudden, all the others disappeared and it was Sully and his wife and their kids against all the bad guys.

Its kind of a drag in the end.Overall it is justitied as this is 2nd part and need to keep it low instead of hype in the end.

With barely a passable script and some hammy acting, Avatar relied heavily on its groundbreaking visuals. Yet over a decade later, only being able to see it streaming on the small screen, it really seems to have lost all of its luster. It leaves me wondering what made this such a big deal in the first place that it broke box office records again and again?Enter Avatar 2. After waiting a few weeks for the crowds to die down, I finally got to see it. Now suddenly I'm reminded (at least I think I'm reminded) of what made the first one so impressive. Was I being to harsh on that landmark spectacle? Did I just need to see it again in IMAX 3D? While I won't be clamoring to see the original in the same format just to answer these questions, I will say that the sequel does take away that feeling of 'meh' for the franchise.Even in the same format I don't think the first Avatar looked as crisp and detailed. And somehow the rendering of the alien faces is much more developed as I found the character's expressions much more sympathetic than they were the first time around. Certainly Sam Worthington doesn't inspire as many groans as his acting did before. Dare I say I actually like his character now.At three hours long, it can certainly be said that the plot is a little overwrought, especially towards the end. And there's little to suggest that the other planned sequels will be able to take off in any meaningful way... yet despite that lack of depth, there is still an emotional core to this movie rooted in the family dynamics of its characters. At times it can tug on the heartstrings forcing you to shed a tear.All the conceptuality in this film was given to the art design and I must say I was quite surprised by how much I found interesting. Just some of the sets, creatures and technical concepts I found to be very creative. Even with the sound off, Avatar 2 could command your attention. It remains to be seen, if this will still be interesting a year from now streaming on Disney+.Whereas the first film was the pioneer, the second one treads that same path much easier and so has the benefit of looking better and feeling better. Yet as sequels go, this could easily have been the last Avatar movie and no one would be upset. There are no loose ends, there is no suspense about what will happen next in the story. Without some greater purpose, (we will have to wait for 3 and 4 brings to the table) Avatar 2 is certainly no Empire Strikes Back, but then again Avatar 1 was hardly A New Hope either.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This visual aspect is not something merely technical, but it's integral for the experience. The feel of immersion, as well as the magnificent direction from James Cameron, is what conveys emotions and stakes to the movie. The plot is simple, it has some defects more than the first one, but I found myself immersed in it and very engaged. I totally forgot that I was in the theatre and this helped me a lot to experience a wide range of emotions from fear to excitement, from sadness to wonder. So the movie was a blast for me.However ""The Way of Water"" is not perfect, and in general I preferred the first Avatar. This is because especially in the final act there are few issues in terms of plot and stakes. I won't say precisely those problems not to spoil anything, but as far as stakes it is probably an issue of having to deal with other three sequels. This is the main reason why I think the first one is a better movie. Indeed it was intended to be very close, eventually a single movie and all the plot lines were closed and contained in the movie. Avatar 2 has a satisfactory conclusion, but there are few arcs that are still totally open and we'll need more movies to see them closed. Furthermore the final battle is much smaller in scope than the one in the first movie. It's great, fun and enjoyable but clearly a mega battle couldn't have been done here because then what would you do in the third one? Or in the fourth? Some progression in scope is needed, and I felt the limitation in ""The Way of Water"".In conclusion ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a fantastic cinematic experience that you should do. Do yourself a favor and watch it in the best theatre you know, possibly in 3D because is majestic. There are some problems in the plot, but they don't ruin the overall experience and they show the saga nature of this production. And as far as that I can't wait to see how this generational saga that James Cameron is trying to create will continue. I am totally on board!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When the first Avatar film was released in 2009, I was like 2 years old by then. But growing up, I repeatedly watched that film and it became one of my greatest favorites. For the longest time, I have been wondering when will there be a sequel to the film. But months ago, as I heard the sequel, I was very very excited. I really looked forward into the film.REVIEW:
Last night (Dec. 17, 2022), we watched the film, and my jolly it was my first time to see the IMAX cinema full (which unusually there are like few people). This was truly an exciting thing for me.I personally rate this as 9/10. The graphics and the immersion of the story is so great. But when it comes to the story, the story here does not always really catch up to my attention, unlike the first Avatar, but still the story is nice. So for me, its still a must to watch the film :-))( RECOMENDATION: Watch it on IMAX )","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There's an impressive restraint shown regarding the dizzying and nonsensical action sequences that are characteristic of many blockbusters now. The whole middle hour I remember there being almost nothing of the sort. There are even some half-hearted attempts at characterization, mainly regarding Sully's kids and how they adjust to their new oceanic home after escaping danger in their forest.The story is very standard and of course the runtime is far too long, with the movie becoming a slog by the time the extended third act climax comes around. But the film managed to provide a lot of goodwill for me in the form of all the stunning aquatic visuals and imagery that is honestly the selling point of this sequel, much of which is shown in that comparatively laid back middle hour.As both a big science fiction fan and someone who loves the sea and practically feels a kind of spiritual connection to it sometimes, I felt like James Cameron's self-indulgent but technologically brilliant depiction of Pandora and all the sea life was highly enjoyable in a kind of sci-fi nature documentary way. It brought me back to the kind of awe I felt snorkeling at the Great Barrier Reef and other places on the Australian coast. I still don't really understand the whole Avatar phenomenon, but both movies are well designed and very immersive experiences to be sure.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You can say the story was awesome and visual effects were so cool but for me I saw it like james wants to show us the importance of nature in our lives. And in AVATAR 2 (2022) he showed us the new world that lies in the ocean and the harsh reality of Human Beings, as we are hunting innocent animals for food and benefit, we are the real monster here. This is what I like the most about both the movies, you can't argue about the visuals and cinematography. James is a gem, people can say it is a long or sometimes a stretch but it is what it is I like you must see this in a theatre it is a life time experience.

However, a regenerated Captain Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his team have resurfaced, and are able to emulate the Na, vi people, and mount another attack on Pandora. Quaritch's son, Spider is captured, compromising Jake and his family, and forcing them to retreat to a new home, with a new breed of people, where loyalties are tested, an ultimate battle looms.A sequel to Avatar, James Cameron's million dollar, box office smashing epic, had a ring of inevitability about it from the start. Even if it did take over ten years to arrive, unlike Cameron's other multi million, box office breaking hit Titanic, it wasn't built within the framework of a true story, with events already panned out, and so a follow up was set in the wings, however flimsy and loose the story may feel, a sequel being a commercial investment after all. And while he's spared nothing on the effects, he's also gone all out with the length, at a whopping three hours and ten minutes (approximately.) The words 'excessive' and 'indulgent' spring to mind.The main selling point is of course the effects, so you'll get the best experience with either an IMAX presentation, or, like I did, a 3D showing. On this very basic level, it's a treat, an absolute visual spectacular, with sweeping cinematography, lavish set design and colourful costumes, certainly a pleasing assault on the senses. But much like the original in many ways, the dialogue and story are pretty threadbare, and without much beneath the surface. Yes, there are the themes from the original about tolerance, and accepting others, and while they have a point, none of it is moving or stirring enough to really generate the feelings it should. And, stretching at over three hours, it starts to become a strain.It could be argued that the wonder and spectacle of the effects is enough in itself to make it a masterpiece, but you can't ignore the fundamentals. As mind blowing as it is, you could get the same effect from a theme park ride. Need a bit more from a film. ***","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Especially the water,it is so clear and bright and you can't imagine that it is CGI. I thought i was watching a documentary like Planet Earth because that's so real and it seemed that Cameron really came to Pandora and filmed it face to face.But I have to say that the film is not perfect. The biggest weak point is its storyline as it is in a traditional story structure about family. That's very normal and didn't show something new. Moreover,I don't think Spider is shaped well as his motives are not very credible.But the defects cannot obscure the virtues. Just do not wait and buy tickets. Don't think too much and enjoy the beauty of Pandora.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is of great visual richness. But I must admit that as I feared, James Cameron was overwhelmed by his project (since the 1st but even more here). The dramatization is marred by many illogical scriptwriting choices. The film therefore has flaws but because of the three qualities I mentioned (especially the first two which are of paramount importance given the current global context), it remains a film to see absolutely, to respect and even to admire. It's really immersive. Brief! This film confirms what I have understood for a few years: science fiction films (of a certain type) are much more difficult to make than one would think and require the skills belonging to the field of genius.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I wasn't disappointed, and in IMAX.

To be honest, even though the expectations for this movie are huge, I have to say, the 2009 version is better. It's true, unrelated to expectations.The interesting point of Avatar is the psychological process between Jake the human and Jake ""Navi"", a disabled person standing between two worlds and a war, an invasion. Now, when there is no longer Jake the human, the two worlds, humans and Navi no longer have that interesting link, the character Spider definitely is not attractive enough compared to Jake the human. I feel like he's more like Tarzan.However, I was once again impressed with the song in the movie, the sound, all the sounds created in the movie are really golden. The sound of spaceship engines, the sound of arrows firing, the sounds created in the action scenes... wow. I also quite enjoyed the action scenes. They are designed to be dramatic and realistic. Combined with the theme of the environment and the sea, along with the visual effects at the best level, it's an irresistible combo. Although a bit disappointed in the music, the melodies are not too special, but the audience's enjoyment is definitely at a high level.I will not comment on the creation of Navi people living in the sea, as well as the setting design, production design, costumes, fishing villages, animals... because this is definitely a must well done thing based on the money spent making the movie. And based on the emotions of part 1, I feel quite sorry for Avatar 2022.The movie is about the ocean, but after 3 hours, we only see the water on the surface, a few animals and plants, nothing else. Remember that on Earth, the sea is a place full of creatures and strange things, and this is Pandora, a planet. A PLANET. They should be more prepared after 13 years. I feel that the sea in Pandora is just as deep as a great pool on Earth.Family seems to be the central theme in this story, and I enjoyed the controversy between the two Sully brothers, but the interactions between the other characters were rather superficial, meager, if not say boring. The story unfolds in a straight line, too predictable. The final action scene is unnecessarily stretched, though the purpose is to enhance the role of the younger generation, but it loses its surprise and drama.In particular, the film tells the story of aliens on an alien planet, but the way of talking, behaving, facial expressions, emotions... among alien ""creatures"" is not unlike humans, they speak more English than Navi language. I didn't feel the excitement of an extraterrestrial social environment. This has lost the audience's wait. The characters are like humans wearing Navi skins.Part 1, we feel that the people who have the right to own a Navi body are scientists, with the genome that has been studied and cultured for many years, accompanied by the practice of language, the adapted, at a great price and now, the villains Navi come from nowhere. Wtf Quaritch was a good villain in part 1, naturally in part 2 he was ruined.Maybe Eywa is the only ""alien"" thing that completes the mission.I don't know if James Cameron's 4-5 movies filmmaking is quality-effective, as I just know, they created the word ""trilogy"" mean on its own, but I wouldn't want to think about Avatar as a promotional film to collect money at all. Like ""Thor 2"" or ""Ant-man 2, 3"" Marvels ""making money"" things.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And the most important part is the visuals. The visuals are ""fantastic, fabulous, fascinating, freaking awesome"".

The combination of HFR and IMAX 3D is amazing, but some may not like it. For me the whole movie could have been in the HFR mode as the changes between regular 24fps and HFR can be seen. But it does pay off hugely in any of those spectacular scenes helping you to make out all details and enjoy the visual accomplishments. You literally feel like you are under water sometimes. Yes, it does has flaws, for some many and for others few. But, all I want to say: thank you, James Cameron and team. Thank you, you did it again and made the young boy in me feel alive again.

There is a familial twist which is a trope that lost all it's usability due to it's overuse in the star wars franchise and I hated it. Additionally there are hints at another kind of 'chosen one' trope to come in the sequels which honestly just feels boring at this point. Over the top bullies who are eventually won around, feuding wives, a love interest spawned from a fleeting glance on first meeting, misunderstood outcasts forming unlikely friendships and yet another uber-valuable and ultra-rare resource which can only be found and harvested on pandora - honestly it's all there.The climax is let down by the fact that a whole bunch of characters who could have made the climax much less perilous and much easier to traverse, just kind of vanished, almost as if the writers forgot they were there.Having said all of that, it is worth re-affirming that visually, this is spectacular and that alone is worth the watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Plenty of action all reminiscent of the old westerns turned on their head. Bad white guys pursuing good Indians. The Indian mythology wears a bit thin. As does the bad humans theme.

It's eye candy that rings hollow.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Seems to have a target for Youth and adults with Avatar children engaged. The story could be better with a few more sun plots added. Seems to get a little stale and confusing in the middle, but picks up in the end.But there is a lot of fighting and graphic violence at times which could have been reduced. . Similar to the first Avatar movie. Probably could trim the film back by 15 - 30 minutes without losing content.Overall it's still a great movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Avatar 2 has the EXACT same plot as the first one, so if you thought this was bad, you must of thought the same for the first Avatar.Avatar 2 does indeed have the same plot as before - except now it's in water - but that is okay because it was a good story to begin with. On top of that, it's worth seeing this movie just for the CGI. Animals and Na'vi move through water almost like you're watching BBC Earth. It makes the recent Aquaman movie laughable. At slightly over three hours, the action does die down at times but I found I didn't really care because the movie was focused on character development and cultural understandings. That with the CGI illustrates how much detail James Cameron puts into the movie.Overall, there is plot and it is good, but it is the same as the first movie. Still worth it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Fleshing out the world in an interesting way and sending us on a sweeping journey through it and its creatures. The Metkayina, and the rest of the oceanic tribes for that matter, felt real and their separate cultures had weight and depth. James Cameron really thought everything through when he was creating this tribe. Visually the film is a marvel so I won't spend too much time on that. All I'll say is once I left the theater I could've sworn the movie looked more real than real life. I know that sounds cliche but it's the truth, it's so beautiful that I feel kind of depressed I can't actually visit Pandora. The story is a huge improvement from the original in every regard. It's still relatively simple but it's done so incredibly well it will most likely have you an emotional mess during the film. This is an emotional film, I didn't cry when Hometree was destroyed in the original but when a certain moment happened in this film I almost broke down at how it was executed. You really care for the characters of the film by the end, the standouts were Kiri and Lo'ak which in my mind stole the show in many regards. James Cameron knows how to make likable child characters in his films and for a younger viewer like myself that is so refreshing.I will never not be amazed that Sigourney Weaver is playing a 14-year-old Na'vi child at 70+ years old, and it never feels weird or fake, that is the power of the technology of this film. It's incredible that we have come this far in film technically yet it's always in service of the actors. The action in this film is top-tier James Cameron, the last hour will have you finding yourself struggling to breathe; that's how good the action in the finale is. Also, I was not expecting the film to be as brutal as it was, maybe it's because I've been exposed too much to ""Marvel"" brutality in PG-13 movies that I forgot that PG-13 movies can actually get pretty brutal if done correctly. One more topic I want to touch upon before I wrap up is some of the cons of the film as even though I love this film it does have a few minor flaws. Firstly, some of the dialogue isn't the best, not all of it just in a few areas. There would be one to two moments where I would say ""hmm...the wording/dialogue could've been enhanced."" Secondly, although I personally wouldn't change it, the second act is a bit on the lengthy side. Even though I love the elements they have in the second act they could've definitely tightened it as I was wondering when we were going to get back to the main conflict. Once again, I loved what they did with that time. Other than that no other complaints with the film really.Avatar: The Way of Water is a film I think we all need right now. In an age of superhero films/tv shows being flashed in front of us almost every day, it's nice to escape to the unknown regions of Pandora for three hours and witness the journey and growth of the Sully family. Like I said in the beginning, this film is what the Star Wars sequel trilogy should've felt like and I fully stand by that. This film is epic in every sense of the word. The Way of Water is on a smaller scale compared to the first, however, it feels even bigger than the first. I'm someone who really likes the original Avatar, now I'm kind of afraid to return to that film after watching this. James Cameron has somehow done it again, he has made a sequel that manages to top the first one in every sense of the word. He has captured the lightning that even I have to admit was somewhat missing from the original Avatar. Bravo James, Bravo.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Way of Water knows why we love Avatar and deepens the lore of Pandora. Like Avatar (2009), The Way of Water tells an unoriginal story in a solid way and in doing so, provides a framework for absolutely mind-blowing visuals to give life to the Na'vi and Eywa. Pandora is the protagonist and Cameron clearly agrees. If you didn't like the plot of the original, you won't find much redemption here but if you want to learn more about this world, you'll get your money's worth. Watching it in 3D finally made me realize what I missed out on in 2009. I can now unequivocally confirm that if you haven't seen The Way of Water in 3D, you haven't seen the film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The storyline does contain a few twists but the general feeling is that it is too aligned to general superhero movies. Not necessarily bad, but pretty unexciting. But again, the visuals make the movie above average and worth a watch. I'd probably ask for a shortened version before watching it again though. Even as the film runs over three hours, there are holes and unfinished parts that you start wondering about after the movie ended. However, this movie is definitely worth watching and preferably on a cinema to get the most out of all effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I suggest this as a movie which can be watch with the family and friends all together. I loved the theme of avatar since I watched Avatar first movie. Its simple & in my point when taking it as a content it's 'damages cause by humans to the nature' like vice. So I think it's a nice and great idea which is spreading through this movie in such a time which nature and the animals are harmed. But on the other way I think this movie takes some boring time in middle of the movie like a boring teledrama. Also I think it will be disappointing if avatar 3 comes with usual manner like a tele cast. I hope it will be a explotion in the industry like avatar 1. And I don't think this movie series want to continue because its nice more if it comes to an end. Anyway this movie is really good and kindly remind all of these thoughts not harm to anyone. Thank you 🙏","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This time, we delve deeper, literally, into the breathtaking underwater realms as Jake Sully and Neytiri navigate new challenges alongside their growing family.Visually, the film is a feast for the senses. Cameron, a maestro of cinematic spectacle, crafts stunning underwater sequences that transport you to a world alive with vibrant colors and awe-inspiring creatures. Bioluminescent fish dance through coral reefs, colossal aquatic leviathans glide with grace, and the sheer scale of Pandora's oceans leaves you breathless. It's a testament to cutting-edge technology and Cameron's vision.However, while the visuals are undeniably impressive, the narrative treads familiar waters. The core themes of environmentalism and colonialism, while relevant, are revisited without offering much new ground. The plot, though engaging, follows a predictable trajectory, relying on familiar beats and archetypes. Character development, especially for the new generation, feels somewhat underdeveloped, leaving you wanting more emotional depth.Despite these shortcomings, The Way of Water offers a solid cinematic experience. The action sequences are thrilling, the world-building captivating, and the message of protecting our planet resonates. It's a film that entertains, visually astounds, and encourages reflection.So, is it worth diving in? If you're looking for a visually stunning spectacle that reignites your love for Pandora, then absolutely!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes the visuals are awesome. I think most people will know that about the film and don't need a review to let them know that. Visually it did feel like I was there on Pandora. Although I will say that the 3D.. while technically very good.. just in some ways makes it feel less immersive. I feel like my eyes are being closed off and I can't see around me. Like I have blinders on. Seeing a huge IMAX screen feels more immersive to me.. but I'm getting off track.To me this really felt like a redo of the first movie. I did appreciate the extra work they put in the further develop the relationships and to give the kids some personality. But the story still felt pretty flat, predicable, and tired to me. A mostly re-telling of the story from the first movie. I had hoped for more on the story and script side. I was disappointed there.The actors all seemed to do a good job and they were compelling. I think Zoe Saldana really was better than most of the other actors she was working with.Overall I was disappointed and had expected more from the story and the experience on a personal level. From what I read about all the work they did on the script.. I had hoped it would have done more with it. The reasons that all the fighting was going on.. just didn't seem motivated or make much sense. The movie just wanted action and fighting it seems. Oh well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

1) Stunning Visuals.2) Excellent choreography and Direction.3) Bgm is good.HERE WE GO:::: Negatives.1) Big Red flag- long runtime
2) I am shocked to say, bad Screenplay.3) First half was supposed to be slow because of new characters and new world building arc, totally understandable, but SECOND HALF WAS EXHAUSTING.4) Story lacks in setting up any goal for the film. I felt like story is not moving forward, and at the end of film, it ends where it starts only with some minor progress.5) Bad Character development, couldn't connect much.6) Felt forced while bringing the dead characters back, and movie has no purpose or goal.7) Movie has no Antagonist or Protogonist, atleast Jack sully was not a hero for me in this movie.8) Not a single over the Top scene, since it's James Cameron movie I expected too much.No new creatures were shown apart from what shown in the Trailer.9) The visuals underwater felt normal and not revolutionary, overrated. This movie could have made in 1 year.10) Bad dialogues, lacks humour, and doesn't keep intact to any characters.11) Action scenes are just okay and not over the top.

The new creature and environment designs are absolutely stunning, and every single organism is so beautifully animated and looks so real.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The whole time i was watching never once was i brought back to reality from the cgi not looking realistic, James did a great job building this world and universe that you want to get stuck in and live in even making you feel connected with the animals.The fact that this movie and the previous both were sort of a wake up call for what we humans are doing to our planet by showing humans do the same to another is impressive there was peace when it was just the navi on screen and as soon as the humans appeared there was an instant tension.And the story as a continuation from the first i thought was good, it left alot to be added on to, new relationships and new possibilities i only hope that miles wont be the antagonist for a third movie and that the story will change and evolve otherwise it will just get repetitive, also i hope we wont have to wait another 20 years for the next.All in all its an amazing movie that everyone should see, dont be afraid of the 3 hours run time!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first time was a large curved screen, and both my wife and I came out just plain saying ""Wow!"" A few days later I went and saw it again, this time on 3D IMAX, and I have to say my mind was utterly blown by the experience! James Cameron is kind of famous for inventing new tech that makes his movie incredible. For example, he sponsored the invention of new kinds of diving gear to make The Abyss, tech that was so good that the mainstream diving industry adopted the designs (I am a former scuba instructor and we all talked about his amazing inventions). He also was one of the first directors to adopt the newer forms of 3D for his original Avatar movie n 2009. Well let me say that the advancements forward since 2009 in 3D have never been show in as utterly spectacular a light as in ""Avatar: The Way Of The Water."" No matter that I had just seen the film a few days prior. No matter that the film is about 3 hours long. The 3D IMAX experience was Soooo Good that I felt like I was watching a Whole New Movie! And in fact I was so completely enthralled and blown away by how gorgeous this film is in 3D IMAX that it did not even feel like 3 hours at all. To call this film in 3D IMAX ""Amazing"" would be a gross understatement. This is Fantasy Film Making at its absolute finest. Give yourself a real treat and see this movie. And if you can, give yourself a serious gift and see it in 3D IMAX. That 3D IMAX ticket cost me $25 and it was Worth Every Penny!!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I half suspected that and therefore wasn't too pressed about waiting for the sequel. But something's got to change for the next, third, installment.The cgi was good, but like with the first movie it is overdone in a way that makes me as a viewer not really feel at home. It's too colorful, too fantastical and just too much. It's be nice with a break now and then. Not everything has to shine, glow and sparkle every single second.It's 2023 and much has changed and evolved with cgi. Thus, the story has to be better. Avatar can't ride on cgi alone.I'm not Maori but feel offended how parts of their culture was appropriated in the film. Cameron and company must do better if they want to build a believable alien world.I enjoyed parts of it but it left much to be desired unfortunately. I get why these films are successful but it is mind boggling that they reach such astronomical box office numbers.I really hope the next installments are more interesting.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

So when my friends asked me to watch the sequel, I went in with basically no expectations. And oh, I never thought i would completely fall in love with the universe of Pandora.It´s a fact that the script is predictable, but for me this movie serves much more as a build up for the next ones than a movie with a beginning and an end. Even though his script isn't so strong, It fully serves its purpose to introduce us to the land of the Metkayina and their costumes, while having a lot of action and emotion.Now talking about the strong aspect of Avatar 2, which is basically everything else. The visuals of the movie are astonishing, with a so sublime use of the 3D and CGI technologies, that created an experience that i never saw on cinema before.I could talk about the beautiful environments, the perfect setting of the sea, social causes addressed in the movie, but that wouldn´t be enough to describe what i felt during that 3 hours. Avatar 2 is not only a movie, is a beautiful expression of love and care about cinema in general, if you are going expecting a perfect story with lots of action, that´s probaly not the movie for you, but maybe the next ones could be!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is a review coming from one of James Cameron's biggest fans. And I have to say, it's weird not knowing how I feel about a James Cameron film when my entire film school journey has been me solely idolizing his craft and declaring him to be superior to Spielberg and Scorsese to a room full of film snobs at Columbia College.I saw the first Avatar over five times in theater. I own three different versions of the film (the bare bones version that was released), the special edition, and then the 3D version. I have all the toys from the first film, still factory sealed because I believed this was the future of franchise films. So, I was more than ready for Avatar: The Way of Water. Almost too ready, so I tampered my expectations.At this point, saying that Avatar: The Way of Water is a technological masterpiece is like constantly saying Jordan is the greatest NBA player ever. Everyone gets that. So, on pure visual spectacle, James Cameron proves once again that no one is on his level. You will find yourself in awe of the hair fibers on someone's arms. When it comes to action scenes, no one frames shots better or knows how to exploit the full width of the frame to tell an amazing visual story. This film is the standard for CGI.But what matters, at the end of the day, is story. And this is where Avatar: The Way of Water falls flat. It's Dances With Wolves, and it feels just as dated. The performances never feel like the actors created a new culture to explore, they feel like actors imagining what it would be like to be Native American and it feels weird at times. Fresh off the heels of Wakanda Forever's deep cultural dive, this feels dated by comparison. This film also exhausts too many moments showing off how awesome the CGI is in multiple scenes where the characters marvel at the world they live in. When you already live on the most beautiful planet in the world, it's fascinating to see the Na'vi still in awe. But in fairness, we live on a beautiful planet and we're still in awe at times too.I say all of that to say, this is not a bad film. This is a film worth seeing in theaters. This is a film I'm grateful for because it advances the medium light years ahead in only the way James Cameron can. But for the first time in my 30+ years of James Cameron fandom, I found myself wishing my favorite director/writer had let someone else write the story because this is a franchise that can be so much more than what was given. And perhaps in the sequels, it will prove to be just that. But for now, this film proves what we already knew about James Cameron and also reveals that his style of storytelling is not as timeless as I would want it to be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The visuals are INSANE! There is no shred of doubt that a masterpiece has been created. Is it a flawless film? By no means. The writing as cliche as the first film, but it still manages to engage and keep you hooked right till the end. There's a point in the film in the first third where the protagonist makes a questionable decision to move his family that makes no sense. But if you let that slide, there's a plethora of action sequences and heart wrenching drama awaiting.The CGI, the performance capture, the cinematography and all the detail over and under the water is just impeccable. There is not one pixel that has been left neglected. I forgot within seconds that most of what I was watching was computer generated and the whole deal seems plausible just like watching a nature documentary. Especially watching the film in 3D on a Dolby screen is extremely immersive. I found myself holding my breath whenever the action went underwater. And what marvelous action it is! And I'm not just talking about the fight sequences. Every time the characters go underwater it feels like an adventure that kept me on the edge of my seat. The score has been bettered from the first film by Simon Franglen. It still uses some of the motifs from the first film but felt more engaging. The editing was a bit off on two occassions when ""Tsireya"" played by Bailey Bass speaks which was really weird and it made me question whether there was some censorship involved. The bluray release will tell.Overall I really loved the movie and will try to catch it a few more times while it's still running on the big screen.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's been over a decade since the release of the original, so the initial ""magic"" of the first Avatar film has definitely waned. Also, with the current political climate, as is the case with a lot of TV shows and movies that have released recently, I was afraid that modern narratives and political issues would be apparent. However, thankfully, The Way of Water was devoid of this. It appears that James Cameron went into this production simply wanting to make a decent film and, in my opinion, that's what he did. Now, the movie is long (over three hours), but afterwards I noticed that I never felt bored, nor was I looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end. I was generally entertained from start to finish. The story was well-written, the acting was good, and the special effects were (as one would expect) spectacular. Of course there are some drawbacks. Being 3+ hours long, there is definitely some fat that could have been trimmed. The cast is just a bit bloated as well. It's hard to keep up with all of the characters and the various storylines as the narrative jumps around. However, these are minor complaints. Most of the characters were well-developed and I found myself empathizing when tragedy struck. Overall, I'd give this film a 7.5/10. I genuinely left the theater interested to see where the franchise would go next.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure, everyone is entitled to their opinion, although it seems a lot of people need to realign their expectations before seeing it. This is an extremely watchable, highly enjoyable film. Great to see avatar back on the big screen with both old & new characters involved 13 years on from the first.People don't go to see a film like avatar for ridiculous plot depths with crazy twists and turns throughout the duration. They are there to see a visually stunning epic that pushes the boundaries of cinematography and CGI to create an unrivalled pictorial experience for the viewer. Like the first film, the second one does just that.There is still more than enough content in the storyline, and the 3 hours seemed to absolutely fly by, which is always a promising sign. Happy scenes, emotional scenes as well as epic battles are included as in the original.As someone who doesn't go to the cinema much these days (mostly due to the lack of quality film releases), I can safely say that this was a trip I thoroughly enjoyed.Don't be a hater. Avatar is awesome.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They both were examples of a noble primitive race under fire by cruel invading colonists. The Tulkun (whales) were the Tatonka (buffalo.)The big difference was the endings. In Dances with Wolves, the Native Americans can be seen being marginalized and we know that there is no hope for their old way of life. In Avatar the struggle continues. We know from the first movie that the invaders can be defeated. We will have to wait another 13 years to find out.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The magic of the world building that i felt in avatar was repeated again in avatar: the way of water. Technicaly this movie cannot be any more better, it's just amazing. The performances by all the actors were good. The movie takes lot of time to establish the new water world wich we are introduced in this movie. The underwater sequences were just awsome. The action sequences were also nice, especially the last one hour. Only James Cameron can have such amazing vision of visuals and the way he builds the world and makes his audience just fall in love with that world makes me speechless.One issue I have with the movie is that they used the same antagonist as the first movie and that felt kind of a bit repetative. Some emotional plots work, especially as that of how the sky people use the fish in the ocean. Apart from that the other emotional plots did not seem to work much effectively.I am really curious to know how James Cameron is going to develop this world and what he has in his pocket for the coming installments.Definitely a theater watch experience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Unbelievable visuals, great characters and worldbuilding brought down by the most mediocre cliché ridden plot imaginable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8970265/?ref_=tt_urv","hvozdikmilan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur92531726/?ref_=tt_urv","3 April 2023","As said in the title, the movie's visuals, world-building, and cinematography are top-notch. Fauna and flora feel alive and believable like nothing I've seen before. If the whole movie was just Sully family diving with super-intelligent whales for three hours, I'd be there for it. I watched the movie in two sittings, 2 hours at first, and it captivated me so much I had a vivid dream in this world involving some semblance of movie characters. But after I woke up I was sad because ""the plot"", if it can be called that, I was dreaming was much better than what was expecting me in the last hour of the movie. It maybe did not make any sense, but at least it was something new and it didn't repeat again and again.The characters are fine and likable, but how they are used to progress the plot was pulling me out of the experience immensely. Every little plot point is obvious from setup, cliché and often also stupid. The most interesting twist in the movie is when they reuse the same cliché the second and third time instead of going for another one. And when they get you to think something cliché is going to happen so you look for signs of it coming and you can't see any, so you have a bit of a hope you might be wrong, but no, it just happens anyway, it just doesn't make any sense of top of that (Speaking of the bullet wound starting to bleed after minutes of swimming just when everyone notices it, not a bit sooner).I honestly can't understand how this plot got to the final movie in this form. They had so much time to think something up and this is what they came up with. I'm baffled. It brings the whole experience down.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Knowing there will be at least three more boring movies the franchise will release over the next few years just to appease Cameron's narcissism. It's a story filled with cliched tropes and regurgitated plot lines. You might as well watch it with the sound off. Does the movie really need to be 3-plus hours long? No, it doesn't. Perhaps Disney chose to combine films #2 and #3 and will do the same for films #4 and #5 -- and films #6 and #7 -- because they know nobody wants to watch seven Avatar sequels.

Jake Sully and Neytiri have four children, and the three oldest are undeniably teenagers.The Sky People return and make it known that Jake Sully is their number one Most Wanted. Jake convinces Neytiri that they need to leave the forest and go ask for sanctuary and refuge from a Na'vi sea clan called the Metkayina.Avatar: The Way of Water is the first look at the sea clans. I rewatched the first Avatar movie, and the only other clans pictured were the horse clans of the plains and the ikran people of the Eastern sea. The Metkayina have a more greenish skin tone, sea green eyes, webbing on their hands, and thicker tails. They hunt using spears rather than bows and arrows.It's entertaining witnessing Jake and his family learn to adapt to new creatures, their new environment, and even learn a new way to breathe, as they need to be able to stay submerged under water longer than they ever have before.It's tempting to think of the Avatar movies as animated movies, but they're largely, especially this one, motion capture movies. The actors are actually performing most of the actions seen on screen. They trained with free divers and learned to hold their breath underwater for long periods of time so they could shoot whole scenes without needing a breath. Kate Winslet apparently held her breath for at least seven minutes and 15 seconds. It's especially impressive that Sigourney Weaver, who is in her early 70s, performed the motion capture for a character who is a teenage girl.A couple of fun notes about the casting: the actor who plays the Metkayina chief or olo'eyktan is Cliff Curtis, who was in Whale Rider; the marine biologist is played by Jemaine Clement, who voiced the giant crab Tamatoa in Moana; and the new general commander of Pandora is played by Edie Falco, Mrs. Soprano herself.Avatar: The Way of Water prominently features Jake and Neytiri's children. One of the words spoken most often is ""bro"", ostensibly to remind you that the main characters are teenagers, and said so often that when a ""cuz"" or two is thrown in there, you feel irrationally relieved. It also illustrates how this movie is all about family. It depicts not only the Sully family, but also the extended family the Metkayina have with the majestic tulkuns, mighty whale-like creatures. It's about being the black sheep not only of your immediate family but also of an entire clan, or in Kiri's and Spider's cases, of an entire species.The visual images are gorgeous, the music is epic and moving, but the real heart of this film is how vividly it depicts the complex and challenging relationships we have with our parents, our siblings, our peers, and our rivals.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The underwater scenes are unparalleled in cinema history and you just wonder how they pulled this off. The concept of family takes the center stage, Jake's children are the focal point of the story and all are developed brilliantly. But there are many faults, the story is paper thin, some dialogues are generic, feels rushed in many places, abrupt cuts between scenes, the ending feels inconclusive.

While 13 years is a long time to wait for a sequel nowadays, it's amazing how the breathtaking experience of seeing 'Avatar: The Way of Water' triggers the same sensory overload experienced when watching its predecessor for the first time.Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as the original, but 'Water' is well worth a watch thanks to the way it advances the story, introducing us to new characters, reuniting us with old friends and foes, and exploring many more wonders that the planet has to offer. Of course, the star of the show is the CGI, which is unparalleled. Even though there are a few scenes that look like they could have used a bit more work, it's hard to complain about the eye candy that the entire film is.While this alone makes 'Water' seeing, there are still some weak spots, including the dialogue. Some lines feel extremely forced and cliched enough to make George Lucas blush, but again, a masterful script is not expected here. There's also a feeling of less attachment to the main characters, even though the inverse should be what you'd naturally expect. Still, the story is well set up to continue into the coming sequels.In short, 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is one of the few follow-up entries in a franchise that has the power to grow its audience due to its ultra high quality production value.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's not a story about people with extraordinary powers, or with convoluted plot twists, but a powerful story of a father and a mother that are trying to protect their family. This story allows us to see more of the fantastic world of Pandora, the various people living on it, the landscapes, some of the mysteries, and when the movie ends, it's like you are leaving some friends, and wish you could revisit them later.This is the first movie I've seen twice in a row at a movie theater, and my daughter even saw it three times! I was at first not a big fan of 3D cinema, but here the result is flawless. I felt it was a kind of once-in-a-while opportunity, and I can but only recommend to see it in a movie theater as well.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie is not the movie of a generation. No, it's the movie of a lifetime. Nothing could have prepared me for this beauty, James Cameron and his team have been filming for the past decade.Cameron called this the 'Manhattan Project' and he was totally correct, this blew me away about as hard as getting hit by an bomb would.The movie is 192 minutes, but no time was wasted. In all honesty I didn't feel the Lenny at all. The movie had a grip on me so firm that I properly could watch another hour and not get tired of it. I enjoyed every second. The movie is highly action-packed from the beginning.The visual effect is as close to perfect as can be. It's better than any other $100 million+ movie released so far, and will properly keep that title for a while. The 3D effects is simple stunning and we fall in love with exploring the waterline of Pandora.The movie has just a few little corny dialogs in the beginning. But they're overwhelmed by the a beautiful story and the best visual effects I have seen so far. It's an absolute must-watch in cinemas. It great to finally as a blockbuster like this. It has been quite a while since the last.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Performances :
James Cameron is known for getting the optimum out of his cast and crew. All the actors came up with brilliant performances. Jakes Sully standout by showing variations in expressions and emotions. He maintained the same intensity to make an impact. Zoe Saldana, Clif Curtiss, and Kate Winslet blended with him to elevate the scenes with their performances. The actors who played the roles of their children brought in good emotions to complete the story.Technical values :
Technically, Avatar-The Way of Water is outstanding. Right from VFX to graphics work everything looks captivating. The 3D effects are stunning and they are not just for the sack of publicity. Each 3D shot has proper research and reason.The Pandora world created is just amazing and is presented superbly deep underwater. Technical brilliance is visible in each and every shot throughout the film.The background score composed by Simon Franglen is arresting and elevates the mood of the film nicely. The photography work by Russell Carpenter is nice. His work registers despite the film having more graphics.The collective editing work done by Stephen E. Rivkin, David Brenner, John Refoua and James Cameron is effective. The production design is stunning and so is the case with the production values Lightstorm Entertainment and TSG Entertainment. For the audience who are watching the Telugu version, the Telugu dialogues written by Srinivas Avasarala elevate the emotional depth of the film decently.The second installment from the creative genius James Cameron's cinematic universe, Avatar has high making standards. Alongside the magical setup and fictional premise created, Avatar-The Way of Water addresses elements like social equality, civilization and takes a strong anti-military stand.The underlying theme of the film that showcases parents protecting their children and vice versa is conveyed beautifully during the ending portions. On the flip side, the main drawbacks of the film are the thin storyline and lengthy runtime. To summarize, Avatar 2 is a greater cinematic experience that deserves to be watched on Imax 3D screen to witness the grandeur.Highlights :
James Cameron Direction
Spectacular Visual Effects
Stunning Production Design
Terrific Cinematography
Climax Sequences.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

You can't tell me otherwise. If you are in the theatre just for the thrills, you might find it boring cos it took it's time to develop the characters down to the animals and also the state of things in every environment the main characters found themselves. As soon as it got you immersed into their planet, it let rip with the thrills and boy!! It was always a sight to behold. Half of the things I thought were unnecessary, eventually played out to ensure that the movie despite being a fantasy of the highest order, played out naturally and as understandable as possible. This is nothing short of a classic. This is infact, everything Black Adam needed to be a monster hit. Top notch character development!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The Avatar films have been ones that I see for the visuals themselves and not the actual story and once again, the visuals are absolutely incredible. I'm glad that Cameron decided to hold off on making this movie until the technology was there because it really shows but it can be weird at times. Whenever the characters go underwater, it feels like the film was shot on the world's best IPhone. I mean that as both a positive and negative. The visuals look amazing but the frame rate is different and makes it feel weird. As beautiful as the underwater scenes are, it can be jarring when we go back to the surface as the frame rate is different. As with the first Avatar as well, the story is okay. In fact, the story is a little bit worse here as it feels like a 2 hour movie stretched to 3. The characters and acting are kind of all over the place here quality wise. Some of the acting is good like Zoe Saldaña and Kate Winslet but other actors like Sam Worthington aren't doing a great job but Sam Worthington's character is great here but Kate Winslet's doesn't feel important (for now). While the story is just okay, I'm not going to an Avatar movie for the story and I'm going for the visuals and since the visuals are so good then I feel satisfied with the movie. If James Cameron keeps making visually spectacular movies then I'll keep showing up. If you enjoyed the first Avatar or want a visually breathtaking movie then I would definitely check this out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Its like every other story of its kind. Just better CGI. But the movie had all the right characters and formula you could love the CGI and give a pass to a story you have heard before When the movie started I got slapped with a cliche in the first 5 minutes and then it just went up from their . I swear most of the movie I thought I somehow had passed out for 5 minutes several times and I was missing parts of the story. Again these are things you start noticing when the story isnt moving and the CGI is not as good as last time. I mean how did they do it? Do worse with everything? Oh, and now there not strip mining, there killing sentient Whales. When I realized what they were doing I fell out of my chair laughing. Humans are just the absolute worse.

A lot of reviews online will tell you that this movie misses a great plot but that's something the upcoming movies will have in the future. Trust me.The title of the movie simply says it all. ""The Way of Water"" is not something you should avoid when watching. This film was released only to make viewers revisit the planet of Pandora and experience its beautiful biomes after a long time, nearly 13 years. The ""stale"" story was supposed to show the new never seen before islandic tribes. The movie's main intent was not to lead the other upcoming films of the series but to show how extravagant life could be.Needless to say but it is evident that Cameron and his team have worked brilliantly to make this masterpiece. The film follows great CGI effects just like the first one did and manages to add more depth in many scenes with new graphical engineering. Would watch it for the first time again anytime if I had the chance.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The amount of time it took to create the 3D visuals made this movie mind-blowing. This movie has incredible effects. It was beautiful to see a film where the visuals took up most of the time. James Cameron utilized his position as director to elevate the performers' performances and increase the tension between the characters. The script, which James Cameron wrote, was astounding because it gave each character a chance to shine. James Cameron created this atmosphere in a mysterious universe far from the present. They had much more advanced military and technological capabilities than we do. It was exciting to see the actors perform; they all did a fantastic job. Because they visited many locations, the story's narrative was exciting and thrilling. They discovered additional opportunities to learn new skills and connect with others of like species. When Jake and Neytiri's family had disagreements with the light blue species, it caused tension. A few hilarious scenes in the movie had me laughing out loud and kept me watching.

What a wonderful world pandora has become and we the audience get this satisfying experience of being in it for three hours. I might say don't opt for an extra large Pepsi like I did or else you will miss out on a few scenes. The characters are on point with their scripts and I believe each one fit perfectly in the plot. I was hooked with the visuals it was like nonstop bliss coming out of the screen so mesmerizing. I didn't want to leave my seat watching this film and I believe you won't want to leave either after seeing so many things put together so well in this film. This visual masterpiece deserves a second viewing just to awe the greatness James Cameron has done with the Avatar universe!!

Now with four children and their human friend ""Spider"" (Jack Champion - remember Johnny Sheffield?), they are living life to the full. Until, that is, one night they see a new star in the sky. Star? Well, no - it's the ships announcing the return of the human beings, this time even more bent on the conquest of their planet now that the Earth is finally on it's knees. Armed to the hilt with the latest technology and weaponry, and commanded by the essence of the departed ""Col. Quaritch"" - who also now leads a squad of Na'vi-esque avatars of his own - things look ominous for the ""Sully"" family. Realising that they are front and centre for their persecutors, they relocate to (saddle themselves on) a remote, water-based community where they hope, rather unrealistically, to be able to sit it out... This is undoubtedly a beautiful piece of cinema to watch. 3D and IMAX with a classily crafted score from Simon Franglen and a message that trumpets the cruciality of the symbiotic relationships between all creatures that live on a world where co-operation and understanding are vital to the survival of all. Thing is, though, that all of that glorious cinematography starts to get just a bit repetitive after about an hour and the middle portion of this really does drag. Indeed, were this to have been a long ""Blue Planet"" style documentary alerting us to the dangers of mankind's rampant abuse of resources with scant regard to the implications for any other species, then I would have enjoyed it better in three parts with Sir David Attenborough's mellifluous narration. It isn't though, and the story is stretched so terribly thinly that - sorry, sacrilege I know - I was actually bored a bit. It does pick up for the last forty minutes or so as the denouement provides for loads of action-packed pyrotechnics but to be honest, I had sort of lost interest by that point. Certainly, it is a great looking film that offers us food for thought, but as a story - I thought it weak, predictable and at times it does just a little too much of it's own recycling. Indeed - had their children actually done what they were told in the first place, there might not have been much of a story at all! Essential on a big screen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Don't understand the people who hated it, if they know what the first film was like. To each his own! Avatar 2 had a lot of heartfelt moments, some of the best, if not THE best graphics of any film in decades, and great action scenes as well! There weren't huge plot twists, or the best humor of all time, but I thought the family story and spectacle more than made up for that. The film looked best on Dolby Cinema 3d, and I also watched it on Imax at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. I'll def watch it again! So far I've seen it three times.I am a James Cameron fan, and just rewatched True Lies, and def the humor hits better in that film than in Avatar 2, and you can see in Avatar that the family dynamic has become much more the focus of the story, along w/ making the next generation the focus. I think they did that more successfully than in Top Gun Maverick (which I loved overall), but felt the young pilots were mediocre characters. In Avatar, upon multiple viewings, I really came to like the character of teenage Sigourney Weaver (this is not a spoiler, as it's out there everywhere).Don't miss this film in 3d in the theaters, as you don't know when there will be a chance to catch it again.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Pleased to say that the visuals on this sequel are just as stunning if not more so but there is an over reliance on these to carry the lengthy 3 and a bit hour runtime because the storyline is somewhat lacking. Can't help feeling that there should have been a better story to tell here other than the basic 'find Jake Sully' story we have here given the potential of the world of Pandora. Having said that, the action scenes are once again jaw dropping - watched it in 3D and sometimes it was difficult to decide what to look at! Some of the dialogue is a bit dodgy too (would Jake's kids who grew up on Pandora really be talking like that?!).

This may have been a 3 hour movie but it didn't feel that long at all, constantly showcasing more and more of Pandora and the family dynamic was entirely captivating and left you speechless.Having more emotional weight in this film than the last due to Jake going from single young jarhead to a family man who is protecting his home. There are some more graphic scenes (bring kids, not children) which is needed to show more weight on what is to come.Lastly the graphics alone are mindboggling... It actually looked so real it actually shook everyone watching the film from what I saw. The entire movie is a visual masterpiece whether on land or in the water, but the close ups are so real it feels like they are right Infront of you!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Excellent movie. 10/10 . It is impossible to give this movie anything lower than a 9. If you have, you're the problem and you need to assess your entire life. It's visually stunning, plot is solid, acting is great. It makes the world they're in seems like real life. James Cameron is the director of the Century in my opinion. He just doesn't throw a movie together. You can tell he puts his heart and soul into it, hence why it took so long to make. This is one of the few directors that can put u in a 3 hour + movie, and when it finishes, u want more. Keeps u interested throughout. Best movie I've seen in a while, way better than these newer marvel and DC movies.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

If yoy are looking for something something amazing you may be disappointed because the story the suspense the action that all is missing just the visuals. We can't say in Cameron disappointed us because as expected and and as Avatar is known for is basically for graphics. And in the first movie at least much of the story line suspense, a bit of action sequences which were much better than the second one. So if you have never been to any aquatic life like Andamans in our country this movie might be a chance to that view.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think this notably improved on the first film. I cared a lot more about Jake, his family, and for the characters. It's easier to relate to Jake when you see how he's motivated to care for his family. He's fighting for them. The story writing felt much more polished and not as predictable as the first film. The characters felt more real and less a parody.However the plots and characters don't make this film great, it's the breathtaking visuals and filmmaking. The world of Pandora. The special effects are incredible, they feel so real because James Cameron has elevated the visual capabilities of filming, literally helping invent the cameras needed to make this happen. The water scenes are some of the best underwater shots I've seen in film. The best way to watch is to just sit back and soak up the incredible world James Cameron created.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Overall, an improvement in terms of the technical aspects and the acting, but overall just feels like the same movie as the first as the story coupled with the very long runtime make the movie pretty hard to watch towards the end (though it is still a decent watch in terms of how pretty the world they created was).Pretty Good Direction (Does a very good job at helping build the world and moving the story forward (plus helping create the action and suspense); does do a better job this time in getting more from his actors, but nothing seems very innovative since the last movie), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Decent from Sam Worthington (While there were similar flaws to the previous performance, he did improve a lot and shows a bit more experience this time around), Pretty Good from Zoe Saldaña, Pretty Good from Sigourney Weaver, Pretty Good from Stephen Lang (Kinda just plays the same character as last time and just goes off of the same villain trope that is pretty standard), Pretty Good from Kate Winslet, Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Bad to Pretty Bad Story (It honestly feels like the same story as the last movie and suffers from the same flaws as well; moreover, the movie just tries to fit in so much plot that the final part of the story just becomes boring considering how long the movie is), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (The dialogue does improve a bit and does not feel as forced as last time (but still very similar to other Sci-Fi movies); the allegory for the story is literally the same as last time but it is just something else that is being exploited (once again exploiting natives for their resources and not caring about the humanity trope)), Good Score (Has some iconic elements to it and builds on the previous score), Great Cinematography (It is easier to tell now what is done using cinematography and it is very well done (even though most of the movie is CGI)), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Incredible Visual Effects (Even though it might become dated like the last movie, currently it was very stunning how pretty the movie was and how the use of CGI made this world not only above land but below it), Plot Structure was the same but dragged out more, Pacing was not the issue as it never felt super slow (but there is just so much plot that it drags for the final third of the movie to where it just gets really boring), Climax was good as it is the most action packed part of the movie, Tone tries to be a mix of sci-fi and colonization movies but ends up being very bland overall, This movie looks very good now but may turn out to be dated like the previous film (so it is hard to tell how it will hold up over time)","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

He didn't come with any new concepts too. How the way of water is replaced by way for forest? The answer is he just replaced forest with water and rest 90% is copied from 1st part. It missed a lot of things: twists, turn of events, emotional scenes, good fighting scenes. We expect ""story"" as hero from big directors like James, Nolan.

There is simply nothing in cinematography that even remotely compares to Avatar and no grade other than 10/10 can be justified.Way of the water has it all: breath-taking visuals, a captivating story, excellent acting, fantasy, love and tragedy. An emotional rollercoaster and a cinematic experience unlike any other.All I can say is that each of these movies are a gift and it is a privilege to be alive to watch them.

I keep asking myself why did it need to be so painfully long - is it just to try and stand out?

The world is in fact clearly depicted to immerse the viewer in it: filled with colours, lights, creatures and sounds, lulling the viewer in a continuous dance between scenes of dialogue (24 fps) and adventure (48 fps).Pandora is once again endangered and the movie is ultimately centered around a new concept: to save life, you need to love life. Humans clearly become the new enemy: a monster moved by arrogance and pride, who claims all with no knowledge of it; a creature able to create great beauty and destroy it at the same time.Which side are we on?

I also think Kiri is one of the best characters added to this, and using Sigweay for both is a masterclass decision from Cameron.I didn't like the fact that Qualritch was still kwpt alive since now it feels like Avatar 3 might again center around the same characters.Still, I'm excited to watch the next Avatar.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Visual effects production is highly situational, meaning there's a lot of different approaches to the art of a successful vfx shot. This is the first training I have ever seen that acknowledges this right up front, and then proceeds, with numerous examples, to walk the viewer through a number of approaches and techniques to achieving a certain effect. Showing what doesn't work often has more educational value than just showing what does. This training excels at this throughout the course. The viewer is left with a very good understanding of what is possible, and a sense of the best approach to tackle a particular challenge.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

They abandon their original audiences in fear of not being relevant enough. They think they have to pander to bros so they rewrite themselves to include the bro lingo and introduce and advance the new generation of characters. In just that way, the Jedi were discarded in The Force Awakens, for example. We know how that new trilogy played out.Avatar: The Way of Water is no exception. It abandons you, the viewer of Avatar 2009, as it abandons the forest and relocates to the sea. It does try to enchant you though, with new creatures and bodies, new ways of life, new reincarnations. And so the patchwork begins. You see the story of the Croods, prodigal sons, whale hunting, fallen heroes, sinking ships. The problem is that you have seen it all before and with a more profound effect.Will Avatar 3 find its grandeur? Remains to be seen, hopefully sooner than in another decade.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It continues the story from the first film. The film is a must-see because it is a visual masterpiece. The story is illogical in some parts but overall it is ok. Sometimes the scenes were long winded and didn't have much value to the story a shortening of a few scenes wouldn't be bad.The world (Pandora) is presented in great detail. You learn more about the planet and the creatures that live there.

Same crap different day....same confused confrontations without any real substance. There was opportunity to pull out something stunning but instead we had the same rehash the marketing people believe will pull in the $$. We had plenty of spiritual inspiration mixed with a bit of Whale Rider and The Titanic. In fact some scenes I almost thought I was watching The Titanic. Just felt this was a script that would have worked 20yrs ago but spiritual awareness has shifted...the inspiration mixed with what marketing thinks will sell has ended up as something that just lacks / contradicts / leaks like a sieve. Hopefully Avatar 3 keeps pace with where the globe is at with intelligence...we are well beyond being spoon fed outdated ideals...masculinity has shifted beyond the 'kill zone' - gender isn't defined by physicality. Spiritual divinity is balancing divine feminine with divine masculine...balancing nurture with action / feeling with practicality. Avatar 2 needed to incorporate an evolving global understanding...keep pace with the audience which involves more creative and risk confidence in the script. Sadly the script doesn't keep pace with the visual capabilities. Let's hope Avatar 3 doesn't get lost in delays with production and keeps pace.... I suspect it might need a storyline rewrite otherwise it might be like watching a 50yr old sitcom.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Like the previous one, the effects offer a visual spectacle, the family that Jake has built during his stay in Pandora is finally known, he brings back the antagonist of the previous film making it clear that the story cannot be continued without him and He even focuses more on one of the Na'vi tribes to learn more about this universe. It's quite an enjoyable movie and shows that Avatar has much more to offer. It may not feel as epic in the last moments of the film as the previous one, but it is a good sequel that begins to extend this universe created by James Cameron, which is undoubtedly destined to become one of his best creations. Leaving some loose ends and unknowns to be resolved in another installment, Avatar: The Way Of Water is undoubtedly a spectacular sequel and the best thing to say goodbye to 2022.

He loves cartoons. This is a great example of a cartoon here. It's not our favorite genre. He's put together a catalog of family cartoon clichés for young and old. It's just missing two elements not usually found in family cartoons: dirt and sexuality. The film is reminiscent of some of James Cameron's past films: Abyss of course, Titanic, even Aliens. The western is also invited with the train attack. Our answer is yes: it's a James Cameron film.The film is predictable, full of déjà vu, clichés and clichés, like the pearls of a necklace strung one by one. The villains aren't very bad. And they're very predictable. On the other hand, the script manages its multitude of characters perfectly. It's not a choral film, but it's as good as one.It has to be said that this cartoon is a beautiful picture book. Free of dirt and grime, but damaged by humans. Admittedly, the whale images are sublime. Admittedly, the ecological message is sympathetic.It's sometimes difficult to recognize a character because they look so much alike, whether on land or at sea. The sheer number of characters makes certain scenes difficult to read. In keeping with the franchise, James Cameron didn't pull any punches with so many characters. But this opens up a multitude of possibilities for sequels. In fact, it's a film series (not to say a TV series), with three or four episodes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Blue man's kids befriend whales and whales and blue men come together to give the American military yet another crushing defeat.Each character has a different English accent. The Carribean accent, a Scottish accent, and even a spun out wook accent.This flick has decent visual effects but nothing like the first one. The plot is bland and much of the movie consists of typical drawn out shoot-em-up scenes. The movie goes back and forth between nature and fight, nature and fight, nature and fight. The nature scenes are almost identical to the first Avatar except they happen underwater and not in the forest. The plot point about killing the big whale things and harvesting their brain pee that makes humans almost immortal was glossed over but should have been expanded. Even if this plot line is a direct rip off from the book ""The People in the Trees"", it would have been more interesting than the battle scenes with the military wannabe tough guys.There is also a scene at the end in which James Cameron tries to give homage to Titanic, but even that scene felt like an unoriginal regurgitation of an iconic movie moment from 1997.This occurs at least ten years after the events of the first movie yet the American military is still full of idiots that have made no headway into diplomatic relations with the blue people. I guess the failure of the American military is probably the most realistic thing in the plot!The 3D effects are similar to what we saw 13 years ago. You'd think that there would be a marked and noticeable improvement in this technology in 2022.It could have easily been two hours. No need for extended and boring battle scenes that add nothing to the plot or the 3D viewing experience. I can't believe James Cameron is turning this into a franchise. What's the third one going to be about? Jake Sully moves his family to the mountains and the film will be filled with trying to tame enormous moose like creatures?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

On my 2nd viewing tho, the movie got even better for me.Ok let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first. The Visuals - y'all know already this is a gorgeous looking movie. Anything I say will not justify how good each and every frame of this movie looks.Any scene that showed the underwater lands of Pandora looked unlike anything I have seen before. There are legit some shots in this film that I have no idea how they achieved, I didn't knew a shot that complex was achieveable even with morden technology, don't wanna think about the render times it's scaring me. From a visual standpoint, it's flawless. But this is the obvious stuff.What I wanna talk about is the plot. It's not the plot that I expected. Now that I have seen the movie 2 times, I realise that the story itself is actually really on a small scale. It is a very personal self contained story painted on the biggest canvas humanity has ever seen. The best way I can explain it without spoiling stuff, from a story stand point it felt like I was watching a really good episode of TV show.A majority of this film is all world building and honestly the story of this movie can be easily shown in like 2h 20 mins. There is about 30-40 mins that could be cut as they don't contribute anything to the story but I am glad they weren't because I will take all the time James Cameron allows me to stay in the world of Pandora.A major negetive I had with the first Avatar was everytime the movie focused on the humans, it got boring. But to my relief 90 percent of this film is blue people. There are barely any humans and there wasn't a point where I got bored, the pacing was better than its predecessor. The last 1 hour of this movie is absolute insanity, that's the only way I can describe it.Overall, the first time you watch this movie its an experience and it should be inside a movie theatre. Watching it on a small screen will absolutely not give you the same ""eyegasm"". From a visual standpoint it's flawless, but from a story standpoint it has its flaws but still it's an enjoyable ride. What it lacks in story, it makes over in ten folds with the visuals.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This wasn't the case, as soon as the movie started I was involved. The special effects and visuals are breath taking, and the store pulls you in. Seeing it on the big screen it really felt like I was inside the movie. The coral reefs were stunning, the sea life was beautiful. There was one scene in particular though where I kept my eyes closed, and I cried like a baby, a long with many other audience members. If it had gone on any longer I fear I would have walked out. A movie hasn't brought out so many emotions in me, in a long time. I'm glad I stayed till the end.

The visuals and under water componets of it were stunning. James Cameron does a great job. It makes you feel like you should live in Pandora for a while at least.The starts a few years after the invasion attempt. The sky people are looking for a place to settle instead of a mine. They are building their own civilization in Pandora. They create new avatars like the last time so that they can reach the island where the lead actor stays. Wheter they catch hold of them or not is the story.The movie seemed long on cards. I was shocked to see that the movie was over 3 hours. But in reality, it didn't seem too long. James Cameron does a great job in making that seem short by taking us into the world and giving us a great experience.For a while, I felt like we humans are no good. We just ruin all the beautiful things given to us for our greedy needs. The director did make it more clear in a scened where the humans hunt animals for no good. After all, we just want our lives to last longer. We don't care about the other lives on the planet. In one particular scene, there would be a long expanation on how they hunt. I was totally disgusted seeing that.The movie moves at a good pace and makes us feel like we are a part of it. I really liked the portions that showed the relationsips between humans and the animals. All that was fantastic.The climax was a little dissapointing though. Expected great things to happen. But they didn't. At the end, the crew just dissappears and is seen no where.All in all, one can watch the movie just for the visuals. One more pearl from the cameras of James Cameroon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And while I agree with some other reviewers that Avatar 2 is perhaps not as riveting a bit of storytelling as the first film, and also perhaps not as innovative, it's still a brilliant outing. If only because of the utterly beautiful world that Cameron has created, which for me inspired moments of genuine awe. Gorgeous bit of filmmaking.It works dramatically, although perhaps not as well as the first film, but you have to admire the ambition of making film that's entirely done in CG, and while it feels very animated, it's also very much alive, and certainly the greatest exposition of computerised filmmaking I've ever seen. Every one of the 350 million dollars is on screen I feel, and the entire film is pervaded by quality work and genuine creativity. It isn't a work of art as a whole (although some of the underwater life scenes do approach art), but superb watching, and as an audience member, I'm grateful that Camerons exist, and are funded as well as he is!Kudos to the Hollywood system as well, pulling off something of this magnitude and risk. Terrific - do go watch in the cinemas and support filmmaking guys!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

written in cooperation with Josh Friedman, Amanda Silver, Rickiem Jaff and Shane Salerno.Whole plot twist was really interesting and gripping. People who landed on Pandora brought
Sully's family trouble, during avatar's life changes many surprising moments in the film
occurred. Special effects were on a high level, obviously, most of them were made by the
use of a computer, but it conveyed spectator captivating feelings. Even special effects make
the film a worthwhile watch. Justifiably first part of the film is a box-office success. Music
was also an important part, it put viewers in a proper mood and made an action more
exciting. Actor skills were hilarious, their acting was compelling and professional. Zoe
Saldana did a very good job as the mother Neytiri. Avatar 2 is a breathtaking and compelling
story about family love and strength. I definitely recommend this film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The D-Box was a nice massage, but not sure it adds to the movie experience.Before coming hear, we read many many many reviews which praised the visuals but didn't like the story much. I beg to differ on the latter.The visuals (in 3D) were stunning, in my opinion, just as the original Avatar movie was. I first saw the original Avatar in at the theatre in 3D as well, which was probably my first (or one of my first) 3D movie experience(s), and, hands down, was visually beautiful with a very powerful message to us and our fellow earthlings and possible/future other fellow universe inhabitants.This one, however, was great. If I am honest I liked it even a little more than the original (although that one was ground-breaking in many ways for its time).My daughter and both enjoyed this new one a lot. I think it had just the right amount of emotion, message, action etc.NOT FOR CHILDREN: VIOLENCE,

The first film was a visual spectacle, with good performances and a simple, and at times silly, screenplay. The trailer for this movie promises more of that and that is exactly what the movie delivers - over 3 hours of excellent visual candy in a bed of Cameron's environmentalist misanthropist propaganda.The story is fairly simple, but its primary function is to bring us into a new pretty environment. As the subtitle of the movie suggests, most of the story plays out in a water world, which brings with it a whole new bunch of things for visual artists to show off.While the story is generally fine, I must mention one thing about the overall theme of the film. In our modern times, there is a tendency in the more politically active circles to berate and thereby alienate members of the public who don't follow the same beliefs. In that light, the anti-human message presented by Avatar to the audience is curious.In the first film, the humans were squarely the bad guys, as they were destroying and killing because of some exotic material they were mining. In the new Avatar, the story makes it clear that humans are fighting for survival. Along with a few other events, this made me increasingly side with the humans, but the film very clearly wants to tell you that white man is evil and slaughters them in large numbers, even when the humans are just going about their business. You know, Mr. Cameron, it is a little strange to expect your audience to see your movie but then also tell them how much they suck. I don't care so much. After all, this is just a silly action-adventure cartoon, but I thought I'd point it out.A few characters who died in the first movie are brought back from the dead through awkwardly shoed in sci-fi magic. I thought the acting in the first film was good, so it makes sense to bring those actors back. I wish there was a less awkward way of doing it.Avatar: The Way of Water is meant to be seen in 3D on a large screen. Unfortunately, this fact greatly diminishes the movie's value once that thing arrives into your living room, unless you have a massive home cinema installation. If you see it properly and you go in expecting nothing more than cool visuals, you won't be disappointed.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Humans came back to the planet to exact revenge, not on the aliens, but singularly on Jake - a childish and irrational cause.

The cinematography and breathtaking visuals make 3 hours feel like 3 minutes. To be clear, it is the sheer awe created by the scenery and action that drives this movie, and not the story. The story is predictable and definitely plays second fiddle to the world of pandora and it's people. The action scenes are fantastic and exciting. It may be because the actors are portrayed as aliens, but the acting definitely feels real, and I was drawn in by their emotions and communication. It's hard not to feel for the Navi and their biosphere. Overall, a groundbreaking movie that builds off the first in a meaningful way.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I honestly can't believe that we actually waited 13 years for this disappointing sequel. Although I knew for sure before watching it last night that it wouldn't dethrone the first part as the highest grossing movie of all time, or even reach its level of artistic dramatic content.Avatar: The Way of Water is without any doubts one of the most visually stunning movies you'll ever see on the big screen, with breathtaking scenes that will leave you in disbelief, but the poor narrative made me feel like I was watching some episodes from National Geographic. One thing I learned over the years is that beautiful visuals don't necessarily make a good movie, but rather it enhances the viewer's experience to get the maximum of feelings that the director wants to convey. Unlike the first part, this one has nothing to add the whole avatar story in terms of plot and dramatic emotions, it was nothing but an action film that can even be merged with the first one without even noticing. Even though the first one has a sequence of abrupt events in the first hour, but they actually served the plot that revolves around the human conflict in deciding what's right and wrong. And how can the moral code of someone plays a pivotal role in serious decisions to make.Is it all bad? Absolutely not, Avatar 2 has some great battle scenes in the water world with all its beautiful creatures, but that's it. Just a shallow beauty with no substance at all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As fortune would have it, I was able to reunite the fam to see this this stunningly brilliant masterpiece. My son is now rd 22 years old and very cynical on modern Cinema, he tells me all the time "" it's almost all junk nowadays,"" and ""why can't they just make a well written movie instead of pushing an agenda?!"" or ""it's all pretty much garbage dad,"" the last five movies we seen with the exclusion of maverick, big Dude absolutely despise most modern Cinema, he said, thankfully, a new avatar is damn near perfect, and not once was this film trying to push the message.""Carpe Diem.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Watched it Imax 3D and turned out we enjoyed the visuals, storyline, acting and all the actions. While some reviews did point some repeats from original Avatar, hey that is why it is a sequel. The movie was entertaining throughout, did not feel like 3 hours and had to say the new characters introduced did a good job. The storyline is simple, but to me it does a good job. Good values about family and these days movies focused on too much complicated stories it was too much; so Avatar 2 keep it simple (which maybe disappoint some viewers) and we family of elementary kids really enjoy. No LGBT message, no awkward scenes, no stupid jokes, very little f word (that seems normalcy in many movies nowadays), just good CGI, great values movie.

So why do people come here to complain that they are getting a sequel to AVATAR?This film is not unlike the first. You can expect stunning visuals that carry you through the majority of the film. Those visuals are the film and they are meant to submerge you into this fascinating alien world. It's awe inspiring and beautiful.The script/story is basically the secondary focus and while a lot of people say it's subpar, poorly written, cliché stuff, I like it. It's my belief that with everything there is to explore and intrigue the viewer, there's meant to be a bond made and longing to protect this ethereal environment develops. Personally, I don't find much fault in the script. It's simplistic, not hard to follow and doesn't take away from the beauty of the film.Haters are gonna hate though. I just find it funny how many people want to come here to gripe, complain and offer their harsh criticisms. Especially those who are saying they weren't impressed with the first film yet decided to watch the sequel and now want to complain about it.If you liked the first Avatar, you'll likely enjoy this.

The movie was gorgeous no doubt about it but if I'd seen this movie in a format other than imax 3d I would have hated it.Outside of the lack of plot, the only thing that I didn't like in this movie was Kiri's voice (the teenaged female Avatar). It was very obvious the character was voiced by a much older actor both in sound and phrasings. It was jarring when she spoke and I felt uncomfortable just thinking about this actor and the child actors together especially those scenes with Spyder.

It's really everything other moviegoers have already said in their reviews. A film that prioritizes the visual spectacle, sacrificing the quality and depth of the story.Unfortunately, the same premise as the first film is repeated, but in another environment. Even this time it looks a little more simplified, but more branched, in favor of the number of new characters. The Sully kids are very poorly written, because they're kind of silly and irritating. There were at least two love stories that never came to fruition, wasting the adolescent sentimental factor of the plot. Neytiri is left aside, downplaying a character who could have been key. The resurrections and the birth of one of the children are magically imposed without explanation, and they don't finish working even under the logic of the Avatar universe.But let's stop hammering the movie, because there are also good things. Best of all is the atmosphere and the world that Cameron presents to us. Since the first film, the natural CGI world has been spectacular. Definitely the best visual effects of the year. Textures, lighting, contrasts, physical factors, kinetics, anatomy, vehicles, robots. All is of very high quality. Another notable point, and which by now is already a James Cameron hallmark, is the action. There are very good air and sea sequences, both with animals and vehicles.In general terms, despite the story, the film is entertaining, has a high visual impact thanks to its aesthetics and meticulous detail by its director. The best CGI of the year surrounds an overly basic story. Definitely the high rating comes from its technical aspects.Recommended for lovers of fantasy, science fiction and for being part of the filmography of the great James Cameron.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Highly recommend there; it's not a crowded room though I don't care about 4D seats. They move, have some mild air jets, and that's it. More important is the high framerate that gives the 3D effect a much sharper look. I'm not sure if my session was a fixed framerate or variable; if it was variable, I didn´t notice. I was fully immersed in the movie.Again, this Avatar's gimmick is the projection room's technology. The first Avatar debuted in 3D in theaters, and this second Avatar perfects it. That's the gist of it and why you want to watch it in a good IMAX 3D theater. CGI finally reached true photorealism, which doesn't feel like cheap videogame cut scenes. Yes, it has an artificial tint, but it's not a cheap experience. You know it was expensive.Because of audio and visual production value alone, this movie is a 10/10. But the story leaves a lot to be desired, and it is not even a 4/10. So I will average it to a fair 7/10 experience.The acting and the casting were spot-on. Every actor brought their A-game to this movie, especially if you consider that everybody had to act under very annoying motion capture suits all the time. Remarkably, they were all able to do it. Even more so, considering that they had several stunt people acting in the underwater sequences. I was very captivated by the performances. Sigourney Weaver deserves extra kudos for perfectly portraying a 14-year-old troubled teenager. I didn´t know it was her today. I really thought it was a very talented young actress playing Kiri.I don't have any complaints about the actors and stunt people. The same goes for the audio effects and soundtrack. Combined with the CGI visuals, they complemented each other to a beautiful underwater ballet. As I said, the production values alone are worth the value of admission.My only complaint is the screenwriting. It was comparably very weak, full of plot holes and easy shortcuts. The first Avatar is yet another version of the Pocahontas story. Evil greedy colonizers bully the poor native Navis and destroy the ecosystem. And again, those same evil colonizers are back. Worse, they are all portrayed as comically stupid and very unbelievable. People are not evil just for the sake of being evil or just blindly going after easy cash. Well, yeah, there are scammers like that. But 2 movies in, any futuristic government would have played the diplomacy card by now, especially now that Jake Sully and his crew are fully embedded within the Navi community. Really, a few Zoom meetings would have avoided a lot of headaches. The expensive headache, I should add. The economics of the whole invasion makes no sense whatsoever. And yes, costly endeavors do take economics into consideration.It feels cheap when every evil character is yet another Coyote after Road Runner.Even though the world-building clearly had a lot of attention, the screenwriting broke the experience again. When Jake Sully and his family had to flee to the sea community, the sea aliens were depicted as a bunch of a-holes and bullies. The entire 2nd act is the concept of forest Navis having to adapt to life underwater. And the sea people are harsh, like, ""hey guys, don't bully those forest monkeys too much. Yes, they are weak and useless, and babies have better water skills, but let's be nice with them"". They literally say it like that. The bullying is relentless, so you assume that, yeah, it makes sense. As a human being, I would struggle to hold my breath underwater for several minutes.So there is this sequence of montages of the Sully family struggling and learning to live there. But then we move to the evil crew looking for them, realizing that only a little time has passed. Days, maybe a few weeks. I was expecting something like ""a few months later,"" at the very least. But then, all of a sudden, the forest family is super comfy underwater. What gives? Wasn´t it super tricky? Are all of them coincidentally gifted? That broke the story for me.The 3rd act makes no sense whatsoever. Without giving a lot of spoilers, the sea aliens are very inconsistent. They have absolutely no murder code. Not even for revenge. But then the evil people kill their relatives, and everybody is like, ""they have to die today."" Didn't you outcast your own because he took revenge on the murderers of his kids? All of a sudden, it's allowed?? And when we reach the final battle, it's only the Sully family against the evil guys, and everybody of the sea people disappears? It could be more consistent.The writing is very shallow, most of the characters are very shallow, and the evil colonizers are Coyote-level stupid. The acting tries its best. I'm amazed they could play convincing characters with this level of poor writing. Seriously.I also understand that they wanted to put Sully as a supporting character this time and his kids in the forefront. It does work as the kids are very well played. But the way they put Sully and Neytiri aside felt like character assassination. Compare them in both movies; it's unjustifiable. Again, the way they did it is bad writing. So the conclusion is that the Achilles' hill of this movie is the writing. Hollywood is in dire need of better screenwriters.I think Avatar is a movie worth watching in theaters because of its unique 3D experience, but no one will call it a masterpiece for its writing. There are kids' movies with a better plot.The only reason Avatar's box office surpasses Top Gun is because of that unique 3D experience. But Top Gun is a superior movie overall, no doubt about that. The incentive is that watching Avatar on a smartphone is a waste of time, it is all about blue people under blue water. It would just be a blue mess in a tiny screen. It requires IMAX.So yeah, 7 out of 10 is very generous.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So even these 13 years of excruciating wait and several release reschedules couldn't separate The Way of Water from its predecessor for me. This will undoubtedly create a bias, and people who saw TWoW without seeing the original film might view it differently. Still, it is a sequel, and I am evaluating it as one.First, the good stuff. The film is absolutely gorgeous! Moving from land to sea gave Cameron the opportunity to put his imagination to work and use his obvious love for the marine world to create a vibrant and mesmerising underwater universe. The original Avatar made many of us shed tears of pure joy and fall deeply in love with the living and breathing world of Pandora, and I couldn't deny TWoW a few deserved tears of bliss from just letting myself be immersed.And this is where the problems begin. If The Way of Water was a BBC documentary, I'd give it a solid 10 for showing the beauty of this dream planet. But the first film was so much more than that. Its plot might be predictable, but it had genuine characters, believable drama of their interaction, ups and downs that took us through the whole gamut of emotions, from absolute happiness of a childhood dream coming true to anger and rage of witnessing cruelty and atrocities beyond redemption and forgiveness.And this is exactly where TWoW feels surprisingly detached. At first, it's not even clear why, as the film clearly tries to play a very similar tune to its predecessor's. If you watch the sequel when your memory of the original Avatar is still fresh, you'll notice those reflections immediately, from iconic moments like freestyle flight sequences or merry interactions with harmless but whimsical wildlife, to the soundtrack fragments and even catchphrases like ""You're not in Kansas anymore"".But something's still missing. And, in my opinion, it's the characters' relatability. The first Avatar showed us an alien world full of alien creatures, but we saw it from humans' perspective, even if those humans were acting through their Pandora-verse counterparts. Jake Sully, Dr Augustine and others, they were still embedded in the reality that we recognise as ours, and this created a much deeper sense of compassion, empathy and even tragedy when you could see a person twisted and pulled apart by his physical nature and emotions and feelings stuck somewhere between the two worlds.In TWoW though, (almost) all characters are alien. Not just because they are tall and blue, but because they belong to Pandora now. The tie is severed, and no amount of adopted human weapons and gadgetry can change that. They frolic underwater or partake in the communal drama, but it's no longer an ""us and them"" type of story, it's mostly just ""them"". The filmmakers try to bypass this alienation by legitimising English as the default language, but instead of making things better it just blurs away the contrast between humans and Na'vi even more, akin to that old movie tradition of making the characters speak the same language regardless of their origin, something that modern filmmaking tries to stay away from to make the diversity more pronounced.Moving from the forest environment to the water one doesn't help either. We humans are mostly land species. Polynesian fishermen tribes might disagree, but I'm not sure if there's an IMAX theatre anywhere near their villages. And those who can appreciate Cameron's new work probably found sounds of a rainforest more soothing and whale songs in a distance. Which makes TWoW even more of a ""peculiar customs of a far-away land's dwellers"", that is, even less relatable. The final battle scene does attempt to bring back our engagement, borrowing from other cult stories such as Moby Dick or even self-citing Titanic or Aliens, but this feels so artificial and contrived that I couldn't help but cringe a little.I am sure that Cameron was aware of this obvious distance between the story and the viewer, so several characters were introduced in attempt to bridge it. Kiri, a female nod to the immaculate conception story, will probably play a more central role in the upcoming sequels, but at the moment is hardly more than a confused ugly duckling picked at by its tribe. And a reincarnation of Quaritch, a bit of a soot and tar caricature of a villain whom the story tries to imbue with an inner complexity but so far uses as a mere tool to create something that resembles a conflict to propel the story forward. Maybe the investment will pay off in the future, but so far these characters are seriously inconsistent, underdeveloped and, to be honest, quite flat.And finally there's Spider. The only human that makes sense and makes a difference this time. A boy who's almost like a wayward tree spirit that just hangs around for some reason, he's the only link connecting ""us"" to ""them"" that seems to work. His actions are erratic, motivations unclear, but most of us can relate to this semi-feral boisterous and fiercely loyal kid. Spider is the kind of sidekick that enables the protagonist and makes him or her believable, and, if not for him, I'm afraid we'd be completely lost in the world of TWoW without a reliable interpreter.There's more to be said about certain story inconsistencies that are too apparent in this film, regardless of your willingness to suspend disbelief. But that's mostly nitpicking compared to the main issue I have with TWoW. Which is that, unlike its predecessor, the film didn't take me on a magical ride that would be worth waiting loyally for more than a decade to see the next chapter. Luckily, we don't have to do this kind of waiting anymore. So, while I'm not astonished in awe of what I've seen, there is still hope that there will be more in stock for Cameron than pretty luminescent imagery and self-repetition.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Unparalleled visuals, flawed storyline","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8747097/?ref_=tt_urv","garg4269","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10467824/?ref_=tt_urv","20 December 2022","For a film that had 13 years in the waiting, Avatar: The way of water is visually satisfying, but nothing more.Given that it follows after Avatar, which was arguably the most awaited movie of its time and was also the highest grosser for 13 years (discounting the brief period that it was temporarily dethroned by Avengers: Endgame), the expectations were obviously through the roof for this sequel, and it delivered. Well, almost did. Well, at least in some departments.First, let talk about the positives:
Visuals: If Avatar told us what 3D is, the way of water reminds us how powerful CGI, motion-capture, creative imagination, vivid colorful canvases are at creating breathtaking visuals. The movie, especially the ocean scenes are unparalleled in cinema history, and probably will remain so until Avatar 3. You lose yourself in the flora and fauna of Pandora and don't want to go back to the real world.Character development: This is a big improvement since the first movie. There are tons of new characters, and this time the characters are more fleshed out and little more human and relatable. Though this improvement is limited to the Sully family and Colonel Quaritch.Now, let's talk about the negatives:
Storyline: The story is flawed to say the least. All the characters motivations in this movie are either stupid or downright absurd. RDA's motivation to send a new mission to Pandora isn't Unobtainium anymore, but revenge for Quaritch. Seriously? Jake's motivation to join the sea clan. First, what convinces him that Quaritch won't just kill the Omatikaya people, and second Jake's just involving the Metakayina people in his war unnecessarily, signing their death warrants.If I had to guess.. the only real motivation is Cameron's incessant urge to cash in Avatar's success and his obsession with the ocean.Duration: The movie clocks in at 3 hrs 12 minutes, and yet the story is wafer-thin. For all the hullabaloo about it, the ocean first features in the movie 45 minutes in. There is one particular scene which goes on for 30-40 minutes and story barely moves forward; not saying it isn't beautiful, it's serene, it's pristine, it's like poetry in 3D. The final battle also drags on for about an hour, and yets feels repetitive, reminiscent of so many yesteryear movies like Titanic, Apocalypse now etc. Many a times, the movie feels like a documentary about how beautiful and varied ocean life is.Underused characters: Apart from the Sullys and Quaritch are underused. Tonowari, Ronal and the sea clan are inexplicably missing from the final battle, which goes on for almost an hour. In the bad guys, it's Quaritch all the way, others are just there to make up numbers. General Ardmore is introduced as if she is going to be an important character, but disappears completely pretty soon.My favorite characters from this movie were Kiri and Lo'ak. Spider is another important character to look out for, I have a strong feeling that he'll turn villain in movie 3 or 4.I had a lot more to write about it, but most people won't read this far anyhow. I'd summarize it by saying that Avatar: The way of water is a worthy sequel, if a sequel was really required. I also think that this might just break Avatar's box office collection, though it's a tall mountain to be scaled.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Is there no pride at all from the producers down to the directors, writers(?) and even actors to stop delivering such plotless, ridiculous storytelling failures? Even if they know they will make a lot of money anyway, how can they keep delivering such snore fests and missing the opportunity for timeless flicks that will be praised and remember forever? Is there no self respect anymore? This pathetic film is just another addition to the countless forgettable (and very expensive) movies that are being made. The sad truth is that this is the norm. Like a scam, always betraying high expectations while a lot of peple getting rich in the process. Who cares?The incredible thing is not just being unable to deliver a great story but not even a decent one, like a 5 or 6. Most of them, like this forgettable mess, are no more than a 2.What is clear that the vast majority of great movies have already been made. Look back and dig them up folks!Here is the reality check to really lower your expectations for future big releases.What is really annoying with Avatar 2, is the missing opportunity to make history, given the excellent first movie, a rare and surprising achievement.What a huge dissapointment!I guess that as long as people keep flocking to theaters and paying for these soulless films, they will be keep being made and delivered ""to a theater nearer you"". Maybe well deserved.So think about next time you are about to hand out your hard earned money to this money making machine industry called Hollywood.This is why I did not pay for this and watched it on a long haul flight, expecting to be bad. Oh dear, why I even thought maybe just this one time it would have been otherwise?","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

Colonel Quaritch who now has avatar body and mission to come after Jake Sully to destroy him.Sadly story execution is not done well. The length of the film is bit exhausting. The effects of the film is good but gives vibe of gameplay more than a film in today's time. Music and story highlights of the first film is used mostly which seems bit repetitive.

I disagree with the opinion the plot is just a repeat of the first. It is a continuation & expansion of the first. It's the next stage in the war for Pandora. It has emotional weight. Tears welled in my eyes during some of the visceral, brilliantly constructed scenes where the family is fighting for survival. There are environmental and spiritual themes which give it substance.

Everything is tuned to become a quite complex thread where story lines, acting, photography, special effects, sound and music all have the same importance and exposure.Considering the length it took to produce a much improved follow up to the initial Avatar, it is incredible how everyone involved has managed to keep so alert to avoid any mistake. A recurrent problem when working for a very long time to the same project.Presumably the project vision of the Director must have provided always the right direction.It is well worth going to watch the 3D version although in some screenings a 4 Extreme show is offered and I guess that it is not going to disappoint.I enjoyed every moment of the fully immersive experience of Avatar, The Way of Water and although there are stories on a much smaller scale which will be able to transport you in fantastic worlds, if there is a title which will stay in the story of cinema as what such experience is , a journey in a story which will make you forget about everything else in a theatre with strangers, it will be Avatar, The Way of Water.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Cameron delivers a very simple rethread of the first one that hopefully will result in something wonderful down the pipeline because clearly this movie serves almost no purpose but to re-introduce the characters that the next three movies are going to revolve around.These characters range from a death flag collector to Quaritch, who was foreseeably brought back to life when Cameron revealed that humans have achieved a tangible pathway to eternal life. It makes you wonder why, after achieving this monumental milestone, they have any problems with the amorphous ""dying Earth"" problem. Come on. You figured out consciousness copying and cloning, but you can't terraform any other planet but Pandora? Well, it's world-building stuff.Regardless, whatever Quaritch is going through is certainly the most interesting part of the movie. Neytiri gets completely shafted until the end, and Jake just spins around with his character, learning what he should have known at the end of the first one. Actually, the way this movie reestablishes Jake sometimes makes you forget he was a human at some point. He makes very stupid decisions to move the plot along, no doubt. He was always privy to what humans were planning for Pandora, so his flight from his tribe is such a poor justification because there is no way he would ever think this would keep him or his tribe safe. Nonetheless, it is worth considering that the ""government's"" plan for Pandora is just so nebulously evil, which makes it entirely possible that they would go to the extent of resurrecting an entire squad of Avatars for the sole purpose of collecting one scalp.On the other hand, as much as Kiri strives to be a very likeable character, I don't think Sigourney Weaver was the right choice. It is a coin flip between her sounding vaguely like a teenager and a complete raspy grandmother, and this is undoubtedly going to get worse in the subsequent movies. And by God, if these allusions to Spider being attracted to her are not just in my head, this is going to get very awkward.Oh yeah, and the visuals. Do I really need to say anything? Although one thing I must groan about is the Metkayina cultural ""allusions,"" if Omatikaya were vaguely a melting pot of native aspects mixed together to create their own identity, then Teal Navi are so unambiguously aping Polynesians that it's downright embarrassing in some scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The sound effects below the surface of the water are far from the crackling sounds in the air. This could be experienced by anyone who has ever dived into the sea. The ""Sky People"" are mostly at the peak of their power, because that is their job: to take over Pandora in order to drain its rich resources. But the natives of Pandora, this is their home. However, you will see in the movie only children and adults who are also mostly at the peak of their power, healthy and powerful. Nowhere in the movie you will see elderly natives, like pensioners among the human race. That does not exist in Pandora (at least, it was not been seen yet). It's all shiny and beautiful. The great visual effects masked all of that very well. The mass fight scenes are truly phenomenal, but to me as a viewer who knows the basic laws of physics, it seems unreal that the large animals ridden by the natives of Pandora can so easily avoid bursts of fire by simply maneuvering left and right.A female general who tortures members of her own race for giving away valuable information? I don't think so.This does not mean that the movie is bad. On the contrary. But from Mr. Cameroon and the rest of the team, I really expected a better story.If you want to check out how far the visual effects have come since the first Avatar, and/or you're in the mood to be glued to your seat for 3+ hours, I recommend watching this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The acting is as great as one would expect, given how the first film debuted, but the fault lies in the fact the film focuses almost solely on Jake Sully and family, with very little in the development of supporting characters; Norm (Joel David Moore) and Max (Dileep Patel) have cameos, rather than fleshed out roles, and Colonel Quaritch's team of mercenaries are as forgettable as the new general. The script is decent, but does leave some important plot holes open that will hopefully be addressed in the future releases.Worth a watch!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

To my dismay it seemed that the film's strengths were it's visuals and special effects, and it's weaknesses was it's story.However, going in with this expectation I was pleasantly surprised. My experience was actually the opposite. While the visuals were beautiful, I felt somewhat underwhelmed with my experience compared to what many people were raving on about. While the visuals are exactly what I'd expect from a AAA film, it wasn't the level of realism I'd come to imagine when reading of people having an 'absolutely blown away' experience.Instead, I was quite pleasantly surprised by the story & it's themes. What some people have described as tropey and simplistic plot writing, I saw as a refreshing call-back to themes that I realised I hadn't seen in recent film. Sure the main story was itself simple in a way, yet throughout the over 3 hours of run time there are many many moments of unique, emotional moments and smart thematic intent. By the end of the film I actually found myself quite connected to some of the characters.If you like me were considering missing on this film on the assumption that it would be ""all fluff and no filler"", I'd encourage you to reconsider. I think some people may be sleeping on some of the complexity of story-telling that James Cameron achieved in this film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This film would have probably have been rated R if it came out a few years ago, and I'm not complaining! Seriously though, i was surprised so much blood and gore (and female nipples) could still get a PG-13 rating.One thing that also surprised me, was that even at 3+ hours, it didn't feel too long or bloated. The pacing and character arcs were excellent, and i got emotional a few times, and by the end was in tears. I think personal life experience will factor greatly into how each person responds to the film, and if you've experienced loss of a close friend or family member, it just hits much harder.It's probably important to watch the first film before this one if you haven't, since there's many call backs to various plot points of the first film. The graphics are obviously very impressive, especially when you realize that probably 80-90% of the shots/scenes are 100% CGI. Rendering and simulation technology sure has improved dramatically in past few years. The cinematography is outstanding, as is the music and every other part of the production. The acting is also excellent good, and i personally think every role was perfectly cast. The story to me wasn't as superficial or shallow as some early critics had suggested. I assume they went in jaded and determined to hate the film or had some preconceived notions about what to expect. I went in with minimal expectations and was blown away. I'll definitely be watching this film again!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Avatar: The Way of Water is nothing more than eye-candy for the less discriminating. Let me be clear, I am not denigrating anyone who likes this movie but for me it is nothing more than a recapitulation of the first film ramped up by a factor of 10. Sure it introduces other pieces of the ecology of Pandora, but I was already bored out of my mind within the first 25 minutes of the film with more than 2 1/2 hours to go.Sure it picks up some years after the first film but even the visuals for me, while quite beautiful in some instances are totally illogical and the physics of it do not make any sense. Some scenes seem to exist merely for the visuals and impart little to the story. Those scenes just come across as unnecessary. Which inflates the film beyond its capacity to sustain it. It is a clear case of a one cubic meter container trying to contain 110 cubic meters of nonsense.Somewhere slogging around in this conceptual mess may lurk an actual good film, but what I saw was not only boring beyond belief, but it took ages to get to any real substance. This is not good filmmaking or storytelling. Mr. Cameron needs to take his hands off the film during the editing process, something he is clearly unable to do given the length of this film (and there are two more to follow?).The story was slight to start with and like a bad writer he continues to flog at a slim ecological disaster scenario without really offering up any new take on it. Come on James!I realize I am jus one viewer and my opinion is just that and will probably have no resonance with the masses, but this is not a 7 Star movie by any critical standard at my disposal. While I enjoyed the first film somewhat, this and subsequent films set on Pandora should be a big miss for anyone looking for logic, good storytelling, and true emotional involvement.Nice try, but I expect more from my movie experience than this delivers.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

I was agreeably surprised by the movie. I went in there with low expectations. My husband and I watched it in 3D, last night on a cold and rainy new year's eve. I hadn't been much impressed by the first Avatar movie. I must say I was wrong and will rewatch with new eyes.The agent Jake Sully must protect his family from the human soldiers. They take refuge in a far away village of fisher-avatars and must learn a way of living in order to integrate and start over. The story line is ok. Few sub stories give a break on the ongoing forever chasing between the relentless colonel and one desperate Jake who wants to protect his family above everything.I was captivated by the parts where the protagonists learn their way underwater, the discovery of the wonders mother nature offers, the magic interaction with the sea, specially between the kids and the water. The 3D was beautifully done. I could almost feel the water around me.. the movie reminded me of Life of Pi. I felt overwhelmed by emotions so much the movie perfectly conveyed the need for loving and respecting our planet and all its magnificent creatures. I saw the movie as an hymn to nature. The message is stop the savage destruction of our planet, human greed is the cause of our fatality. Open your eyes to our world, listen to the suffering of planet Earth and its mighty creatures. In short, the story itself was second to me. I just felt compelled by the beauty of our planet. What James Cameron tried to say is save our beautiful Earth. Thank you for this magnificent voyage and Happy New Year to everyone on Earth, may it bring you every joy!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Lets find out.Avatar The Way Of Water is a staggering piece of visceral filmmaking on both a visual level as well as an emotion level. Yes, the story is simple but that is not a negative as it will connect to more people from various classes of the society. The structure and world building is better that first part.Now coming to the visuals. We I went for the re-release of Avatar a couple of months back and believe me when I say that film still looks better than any other staple blockbuster that hollywood keeps churning out . And at the end of that film they showed an extended footage of Avatar the way of water , that blew everyones mind by how staggering it looked . The difference was staggering . (Please note : I went for IMAX for the re-release)
we knew going into this that this will be something special but boy oh boy I wan not prepared for this . The eyes. The skin textures , the underwater sequences look so so so (I cannot stress it enough TBH) real , so gorgeous and the 3D is so immersive , it almost feels like I was inside of an marine aquarium. It still staggers me how cameron & co made this so realistic. The HFR which shifts from standard 24 fps to 48 fps adds a whole level of smoothness and immersion.Now coming to the overall screenplay, I loved it . The emotions feels earned, there are scenes involving Nyeteri and kiri are brilliant ,Sam Worthington again wins in his act as jake but the biggest winner is Loak. The emotional beats that he has with a tulkun are some of the most touching scenes in the film.If you thought that the last complete hour of Avengers Endgame was bonkers , wait till you watch this .The last entire hour is like a recollection of Jim Cameron's greatest hits. Scenes of Aliens , TItanic and even Godfather are reminiscent in this .Another thing to note if you are going for an IMAX screening, The entire movie has been shot in the 1:85 full IMAX ratio which is the most immersive moviegoing experience IMO.They don't make films like this anymore , they just don't. This is why we go to the cinemas. James Cameron is one of the dying breed of filmmakers (along with Spielberg and Nolan) who makes films for the big screen for the EXPERIENCE.Watch this biggest and best screen you could find , preferably IMAX or Dolby Cinema. ITS ALL WORTH IT and trust me I am not even overselling this stuff.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first movie was revolutionary in so many ways and especially the visual aspects with beautiful CGI and graphics. This is the only thing that got better.The story felt too much the same, it was predictable and I felt like a monkey could guess what was gonna occur. With magical visuals it felt like I was watching the nature documentary ""Our Planet"" combined with the movie ""Free Willy"" and ofcourse the first ""Avatar"". The movie was also very slow at times and some scenes did not necessary to the story.For what I do like about Avatar The Way of Water is the nostalgic feeling about seeing the visuals, exploring Pandora, the returning characters and music (themes, hymns). Without giving away too much I feel like after all these years and the HUGE budget, James Cameron should have gotten more out of this. I am not saying it is a bad movie, because it is good but it is not that good. I am really hoping that this was a build up for the upcoming movies.Final rating: 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Almost a year after its release and without seeing it in the cinema, is it still that good? I think the best way to determine this is to compare it to the previous one.The first film doesn't necessarily need to be seen in the cinema to be as good. The previous one has a much better pace, it seems that the story here is conducted in a much slower way, which ends up becoming very tiring. The story is not complex at all, perhaps it is even simpler than the previous one. There isn't a huge plot development here, even though they try to explore more cultural issues in this universe. In a way, these moments are very interesting, however, when we focus on the villain the story seems to get lost a lot. The villain is very dull and everything around him is poorly developed, even the reason he is the film's villain. The previously introduced characters are better and the new characters are interesting.Visually Avatar 2 is a spectacle. There is no film that is as good in terms of visual effects as this one. The CGI is perfect and James Cameron knows how to use it very well. Even watching it on television it is possible to notice every magical detail in every scene. The only problem with not being in the cinema is precisely not being able to be as connected with the plot, so it is possible to notice several problems in the story and especially in the pacing.Even with any problems that Avatar 2 faces, it remains a good film, but it suffers from the lack of a story that justifies its length, or at least a rhythm that drives this story better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The creatures and environments are all unique and detailed, and it's clear that a lot of thought and effort went into creating this world.However, one minor issue I had with the film was its pacing at times.

This guy knows how to make movies for the big screen. He's the master of commercial cinema. And Avatar 2 is just another testimony of his greatness.One of the most beautiful films you'll ever get to watch on the big screen. Filled with jaw dropping visuals. It's a visual masterpiece. I was in absolute awe of every scene in the seas. It's hard to believe that everything here has been created by CGI.Avatar 2, in typical Cameron style, overtakes its predecessor in terms of visuals, plot, and characters. The writing is not that great, but still an improvement over the original. Felt more connected with the characters, whereas in the first film, I didn't care about a single character. Even though we don't see any of the actors on screen, the whole cast really did a good job, especially Zoe Saldana. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Cameron's storytelling doesn't let the 3 hour runtime feel like a drag, even with a mediocre plot. In fact, a lot of the scenes that doesn't hold much importance, were my favourite scenes because of how gorgeous it looked. I wouldn't have minded if he made a 3 hour film with only those underwater scenes.Avatar 2 is a cinematic experience that will stay with me for a long time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

For my humble concept, he more than fulfilled them. The level of realism in animation that #JamesCameron reaches in this new installment is almost disturbing. Looks like we're watching a #NatGeo docuseries. On a technical level, I have no doubt that she will win all the #Oscars where she is nominated. In the part that has to do with history there is nothing different. For some that is the mole. The story is light, critics say. Well, I don't know, maybe. But perhaps Cameron thinks that there is no need to complicate and give more depth and too many twists to the central message, which has been present since the saga shocked the world 13 years ago. The main predator of our planet is us, the human race, and it does not seem that this is going to change with the technological advance; quite the opposite. The path we are following will lead us to what, the day we have sufficient technological capacity to reach other planets, we will do it with violence. But it always have been like that. The story in terms of narrative is weak, it is not at the level of the cinematic experience, but the latter makes the former completely forget, so much so that its 3 hours 15 mins are not felt. It's certainly worth watching, and if it's in 3D, it'll add an added twist to the experience.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

By all means, the team behind Avatar 2 are probably among the best in business, but now the general impression might be a warning of what this venue is developing into with AI taking over. No wonder the Hollywood actors are on strike, and maybe the CGI crews also soon. However, sound engineering will hopefully still remain an artform. So, what with plot creation and story writing? James Cameron brought in some writers younger than himself, Amanda Silver (60) and Rick Jaffa (only 58), perhaps so he didn't have to pretend to catch up with a younger audience to secure the franchise running. But this is supposed to be for kids of all ages, or timeless. However, somewhere in the writing they managed to shallow out the magic from the original, and much of the dialogue is not too engaging. In total, it's a mixed bag, but regardless I automatically tried to catch my breath in the final. Wazzup, Bro? I think it's that way.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure, they were able to film underwater and all that, but being aware of that doesn't really make the film fantastic for me, as the viewer. The picture is beautiful, and that's all I care. And well, if I forget the fact that some ultra-modern technology was used to make this movie, the only thing I get is... a beautiful picture. Nothing more.The story is mediocre and very Hollywoodesque. The script is full of commonplaces, which completely ruined the experience for me. It's a beautiful CGI movie, but being from the generation who saw all Lord of the Rings' movies in theatres I'm not easily impressed (talking about grandious movies with beautiful new worlds and engaging stories).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first movie is one of my favourites.I really really liked this film.Quaritch was incredible. Probs my favourite part of the movie was his brilliant villainous portrayal. But blue 😂
Next. This movie is stunning. That's it. That's all I have to say about the visuals. But definitely go see in cinemas.I feel like the movie was mainly about jakes children, making great character development. But I wanted more jake and neytiri.The first act felt a bit slow but brought us back into this beautiful world well with a good back story.The subtle details on each avatar and in the world is another perfect addition. Such as the physical advantages and disadvantages between different biome avatars. But the final act oh my... is great !Now to be critical (although I don't have much bad to say about this film):
There were some plot holes which didn't make sense and were skipped over. Some annoying characters and unoriginal scenes but Yh. Not much.Brilliant film.9/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

All the fantasy elements are still there, but the music seems a lot more grand and over the top this time around. In fact, I really liked all the musical themes, from intense epic songs to light ethnic music.The underwater scenes were exquisite and well-shot. Living in a marine city with the biggest aquarium in Texas, I'm used to seeing marine mammals swimming around and how beautiful they can look. Avatar 2 really did a great job showing off the marine life. Pure beauty.On top of that, there's a lot of emotion and relationships going on here. Loneliness, fitting in, approval, old bonds. It's all there. Just great writing.Only downside is that it's very slow burn and drags a short story out over three hours. Also, normally a story should skip back and forth between two or three different sub plots or characters. This movie doesn't show other sub plots for like an entire hour, focusing too long on the main plot. So it felt a little uneven in that sense. But overall, very minor issues, imo.All in all, I think part 2 is better than part 1. And in some ways, the underwater scenes made it feel more like Titanic than Avatar 1. I highly enjoyed this movie and recommend it. 9 of 10 stars. Absolutely superb (just like Cameron's other major work)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film in general is pretty lighthearted and funny, but there is some tense scenes with some intense action. The storyline was very simple, but in my opinion that's not a bad thing. The story compliments the image shown on the screen. The picture does more than a thousand words. The 3D felt a lot better utilized compared to the first Avatar. The HFR made it everything feels more alive, it made you feel like you were right there. If I had to summarize my thoughts on it... It's a simple movie where the picture does a lot of the talking.I saw I on the world's tallest IMAX in Pooler GA (3D HFR). For those that haven't seen it, I definitely recommend watching it in 3D HFR if it's available to you.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I've said it a thousand times before: Never doubt him!Avatar The Way of Water is how you do EPIC blockbuster-ing!Emotional, visceral and as big as films get!Go see it and experience something you have never seen before on the biggest screen you can possibly find...I am relieved and happy to say that Avatar The Way of Water is worth the 13 year wait!I can remember seeing the first film all the way back in 2009, and I was honestly blown away by it!I was 12 years old when I saw the first film and now I'm 25 seeing the second film, let that sink in...
I can remember thinking that it was the coolest thing I had ever seen!I honestly had never seen anything quite like it before?To be honest, at the time, I don't think anyone had!But I never once thought that their would be a sequel 13 years later...
Avatar The Way of Water is truly phenomenal!Bigger, surprisingly better and more emotional than the first...
This sequel is to no one's surprise; visually breathtaking, visceral and incredibly engrossing!The story, the spectacle, the spirituality, the sheer beauty...
This is filmmaking and storytelling at it's very best!To no one's surprise, Avatar The Way of Water pushes CGI and visual storytelling to new places we've never seen before onscreen, and uses the word 'Family' more than any Fast and Furious film...
While some of the new characters are underutilised, Pandora is once again the star of the show.It's miraculously realised, the underwater stuff is just glorious and the final act is full of mind blowing action!James Cameron's level of perfectionism translates to the audience; the details of every frame are precise and I can't help but wonder how on Earth he has done that?With every pulse and vibration from the active non-stop pictures onscreen, to every thump of heartbeat and every resurfacing bubble of air, and from every fall of raindrops and rumbles of thunder to the crashes of waves and splashes of wings and tails, The Way of Water reveals a triumphant return to Pandora, but this time Pandora is way more blue and beautiful...Overall, James Cameron has once again crafted a visual masterpiece, with the most impressive CGI I have ever seen!The dense foliage of Pandora's lush jungles and the hyper realistic water effects are honestly a sight to behold.I found myself gawking at the insane level of detail in every single frame, and I could not believe my eyes...
The work that went into the characters though, is what truly blew my mind!The expressiveness in their eyes, the subtle details in their skin and the way they move for CG characters that felt as real as any of the human actors in the film...
This is arguably the definitive theatrical experience of 2022!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Direction was amazing. Action sequences were well shot much better than the first one. VFX, CGI & BGM were bang one. I felt as if I was right there in Pandora with those Navis. I loved the characters of Kiri & Spider.-ves : The length of the film was a major negative or turn off for me in this movie. I felt as they were just trying to drag things. Especially those repeated sequences of Little Sully with that Tulkun. 30-35 mins of the movie can be easily chopped. Screenplay was way too slow considering it's a 2022 movie. Next thing is introducing lot of new characters. Although I loved some of those characters, but its shifts our entire focus from the main protagonist, Jake Sully. Unlike the first part, Jake Sully has just been limited to the Climax of the film. That took the main focus of the audience away from Sully. Moreover, in the first part, whenever Col. Miles Quaritch came on screen, he had his own aura which always felt dreadful. But in this sequel, that has not been the case. As a result, we don't feel that tension & rivalry during the final faceoff. Moreover, another thing which I heavily criticized in Jurassic Park : Dominion was that the movie had no proper ending. Same is the case with this film. At the end, things went back to Ground Zero. So it felt like I just wasted 3hrs 10mins on watching a motion ride having no proper ending. I know that they are keeping some things for the upcoming instalments of Avatar, but still they could have tried to make its end a bit meaningful. For Example, killing Colonel & bringing a new Villain who's more powerful etc. Like Marvel maybe. I do not know, that my own opinion however you can differ.To conclude, I would say go and watch it as you could only enjoy it in a theatre. Witness the glory of Navis but don't forget that this movie requires a lot of patience especially during 1hr to 2hr time slot.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It would have been better to change the name of the movie to ""Avatar's Children"". The story was disjointed and in some scenes, the lack of connection of the story process was felt. In the end, there was no satisfying good and evil battle that would satisfy the viewer at the end of 3 hours story. During the battle, the tribes that accompanied ""Jake"" suddenly disappeared from the story. Maybe ""Cameron's"" decision for the future sequels caused this weakness or number of the screenwriters. Anyway, as a fan of Avatar, I was not satisfied with this story and I hope that it will be compensated in the future sequels.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

If filmmaking is all about wide shots and technological achievement then yes it is the greatest movie of all time. Unfortunately, some people enjoy deeper movies, with strong narratives, great performances, deep themes. Avatar 2 offers none of that. James Cameron has once again achieved something unparalleled: another 3h+ movie with absolutely nothing of substance. Nothing. It's the same terrible outcome the first one offered wrapped in the most beautiful package. It's enough for some but I'd like to think those with a little more intellectual curiosity will see right through the joke this movie is: Dances with Wolves in Outer Space Part II, Dumber Edition.","206 out of 413 found this helpful.

They way that James Cameron is able to incorporate the look of the water in to the beauty of the surrounding ecosystem really is what diversifies the film. There is no film that matches the realism other then the first avatar. Once again Cameron has broke through in cinema photography and will pioneer this new race in cgi expansion. If the films keep progressing at this rate, and they do all 5, this could be the greatest film collection of all time. Yes, that includes beating the likes of Star Wars, Godfather, and the MCU.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I really don't understand what the critics who are putting this movie down are on about - the experience was true escapism and you can see how and where James Cameron spent his billions in production as each and every scene was flawless with great attention to detail. This is one of those movies you have to see on a giant screen, ideally IMAX and 3D. Like the firsts movie this one is likely to appeal to a global audience and it has a general moral storyline that makes it a family movie. Definitely recommended!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

So this time, I definitely wanted to see this one with better technology to see if they could top the first. They do a great good with these graphics. I don't always do 3D movies because they aren't worth it but Avatar 2 definitely is! I must admit at first I didn't wanna sit in the movies for 3hrs +. Let me tell you, I didn't feel the time as much as I thought so that's a plus! This CGI is top notch. Everything looks so real and it makes for a great watch.BUT I gotta say cuz I know most of you won't...I am sick of ""Hollywood"" using all these colonizers to play/represent indigenous people!! Sure a tribe MAY....hug may...btw be mixed, but come on man. The whole movie takes place in a world where the people are blue but the underlying idea that it's some indigenous colored ppl and somehow a white guy and his mixed kids are the star of the show. It's disgusting. And I shouldn't have to mention the fact that this is what the colonizers do all over the world.Also, how is Neytiri's hair braided (& most of her kids) but Sully's hair locs...🤔😐 She looks like she got a wig on and he got the natural locs 🤦🏾make it make sense. And to Zoe Saldana, skip part 3 cuz they only gonna have you crying & screaming the whole movie.In the end, this was a good movie to watch. It has more explicit language than before so be careful with small kids. It really doesn't need 3 hours to tell this story but it's at least beautiful to watch. As a black man...the storyline is some BS tho. We don't need a white savior.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A pretty animation and a visual spectacle for sure, but unbelievably bloated and littered with questionable choices...
To enjoy this movie would require that one throws all logic out the window, and despite such a long runtime, a coherent plot and character development are still virtually nonexistent.When all is said and done, this was +3 hours of my life that I will never get back.On a more positive note, once this comes out on DVD, I'd definitely recommend playing it in the background of a house party. Just drink every time one of the kids say ""bro"", and you're gonna have a lot of fun (before passing out drunk by the time the movie is over !)

Actors did a fantastic job. He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2: ~ The story is paper-thin.

I liked the visuals of this movie. There was feeling of immersion, feeling like you were there. Sometimes the frame rate was too low, images seemed jittery. Visual quality was excellent, with sharp images.Story:
Story was very predictable. It is classic good vs evil characters. Original inhabitants vs conquerors. There was nothing unique about that. Fortunately some characters had somewhat interesting side stories. They could have made the Na'vi slightly more interesting. Now they felt a bit too human.Sound and music:
Sound was good, and also the music helped to make the scenes more interesting.Acting:
Acting was nothing special. I don't think this would win any awards for acting. The thing with the Avatars / Na'vi is that you do not relate to them that much.Length:
The movie was engaging for most of its 3 hour length. At the end I started watching my clock.I give 7 because of the visuals and technology of the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But now that I have seen the spectacle itself I can happily say it is a perfect sequel to the 2009 Original film, and is as good as, if not better then most of the monster blockbusters dropped at our cinemas doorsteps this year.The movies first hour truely pulls you back into the stunning world of pandora and gets you up to date on the story and what has occurred between the events of the first movie and the events of the way of water. Once again James Cameron has upped his game and made the most remarkable visual masterpiece known to date, and has shown that the ten year development for the necessary technology required for this movie was 100% worth it.The Second hour of the film is really my only criticism, though it involved some of my favourite scenes. While I don't think the story dragged that much at all with it's huge 3 hours and 12 minutes run time, the middle of the movie did have alot of filler and events that I feel could've been cut down or even montaged in a way, saving the film from plenty of entertaining but somewhat unnecessary plot. But the two reasons I'm still hanging on board with the described by some 'excruciating' run time is due to the character development and beautiful world building in many key story moments.Now the final hour of the film is probably the most entertaining and probably one of the best 'wrap up's' to a movie I've ever seen. The final act was gut wrenching and emotional and performances by Zoe Zaldana and other actors and actresses truely stood out to me and even made me tear up at a point. I will not get into detail but the the final 'conflict' of this movie was truely a wonder.In conclusion Avatar: The Way of Water is probably the best follow up to the 2009 movie that I could ask for, and I am upset to see people online claiming they 'won't see this movie' or 'want it to flop', as a movie like this truely needs to break the box office charts. I was truely mesmerised by my experience and I know many others where to! And I am excited to see where the next 3 to however many sequels James Cameron has pinned to his wall play out, including the next generation game that reaches platforms supposedly early to late next year!I give Avatar: The Way of Water (9/10) stars

I didn't think any of the actors were phoning it in, and even the younger ones did a good job. This movie's visuals basically blow away any other's in the past 5 years, which is impressive. With all of the films using The Volume at Lucasfilm and Marvel, it was nice to see VFX/CGI that didn't look like a PlayStation 2 quality background or PlayStation 2 characters. The social messaging in the film was there, but it didn't beat a person over the head. It definitely should be watched on the Big Screen.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I didn't saw this movie in 3D and still I felt I was in Pandora. Without giving away anything this story is so simple and yet so original, you care for all the characters old and new, you even care about the villain. James Cameron in my opinion delivered once again a great sequel just like he did with Aliens and Terminator Judgement Day completing his holy Trinity of the best sequels I've seen.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters are more fleshed out, the visuals are a triumph and the ""experience"" factor is there. He managed to recapture the feeling that you're watching a leap in technological film making again. In that sense, it's definitely not one to be skipped. Especially because it's just a ton of fun to watch. Much more so than the first one, in fact.The issues lie in both the runtime (the first two acts do drag, storywise, no matter how much visual wonderment is thrown onscreen to distract you from it) as well as the script itself. A lot of the lines are as cringe inducing as ever and this is what was sacrificed in favour of spectacle. At one point I referred to it as Michael Bay's Avatar. It's definitely an exaggeration to characterise the entire film this way but there are times where it's absolutely the case.I went into it thinking that if I don't enjoy it more than the first, I won't care about the next installment and I'm glad that it was good enough for me to look forward to Avatar 3. So long as the writing and pace are improved, this franchise has the potential to actually develop a loyal fandom rather than just being something we marvel at from time to time only to quickly move on.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The way the water and the animals are done is the best thing I have seen in cinema for effects. The plot was a generic story with the bad guy wanting to have revenge but it's own unique twist wich makes it great. You feel like the bad guy is the same villain but a different view on life. The only problem is the watch time. You don't go to avatar to see the story or character development ( even though it's great) you go to see the effects and 3hrs of effects was not what I had in mind. The reviews also said there was to many characters but my only problem was that 2 brothers were looked to alike. Great movie overall.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But by half way through you kind of remember their roles rather than their names.If you liked the first one then you will probably like this although it's less about discovering a new species and more meeting a new tribe and bonding.Glad I didn't see it at the cinema as its very long and maybe not interesting enough to sit watching without the comforts of home.I would say over all 7 out of 10, looks amazing but due to lack of story and reliance on first films continuity, it's one for the fans of the first rather than the casual viewer.I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't re-watch it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

-1 Quiet long and all events happening at once :- The movie starts same as the 1st movie start they learn to ride new creature and adapt with new nature and just on plot building that takes atleast 1 hours which feel good in theaters but you will not find that fond and glamour while watching in tv this is truly meant for cinema movie-2 CGI technical expect :- they said that is movie took a decade to make part two but this movie had cgi just compared to any other marvel movie the goosebumps of making this long and 2 billion dollar budget that's a huge budget so I expected something really big cgi which I have never seen before , but the cgi is just a lil bit better than marvel movies but it took so long and this much budget I think that was my disappointment factor.Recommending:- But I would recommend you to watch this as the facial expressions feel really real and feel like they really hired blue aliens to act in this. I liked the face expressions even my father thought for once that they painted humans face and body blue to act on this movie cause the face expression and emotion felt so common like human emotions-3. Only for big screens:- I don't know wheter this point is right or wrong but I would still try to explain you as much as possible I think you won't like this movie to watch on you home tv until and unless you have 3d tv or home theater system cause the movie has large whale like creature, sealife, big ocean, luminous creature and different thing which you will like only in 3d or big tv which is crystal clear and 4K cause I really loved it then only you would love to watch it twice or thrice personally I watch movie twice in theater in IMAX 3D .I experienced the movie twice in IMAX 3D that why I would say it is experiencing movie which you can watch more than once but only in large and humongous theather or on Tv with atleast 70 inches display and home theater.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

One feels that 3 hour 12 minutes run time could be one reason for it to sag at many points but then there was the same director's Titanic at 3 hour 14 minutes which had a captivating story and which was hugely entertaining and absorbing. Compared to this movie, the earlier ""Avatar"" at 2hr 45 mins was well made and universally liked by audiences This movie needed to be trimmed by at least 30 minutes but I find writer cum directorJames Cameron listed as one of the 4 editors, so probably this was difficult. However every James Cameron movie is always a path breaker and a cause for celebration due to it's scale and presentation including this one minus its shortcomings.If someone were to give an example to show that high class production design, mesmerizing spectacle and jaw dropping special effects by themselves ( minus a strong story , dialogue) cannot make a riveting movie , then this would be it. Not possible that an intelligent director likeJames Cameron is not aware of this aspect. The plot struggles to get on the rails for the first one hour and the last one hour is one long extended adventure on the sea. The pace is slow in most places and emotions of the characters ( though understated ) keep running high. There is some amazing underwater cinematography but then again the excess of blue hues ( blue water, blue men, women, children) becomes jarring after some time. The adventures of the sky people in the earlier version were better than the reef people here. The scenes here were predictable and clichéd too and so was the action which was highly familiar..","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Isn't Jakes avatar 50% human and 50% real na'vi? So if he and Neytiri have kids (a real na'vi) wouldn't there be a chance for the kids to also have 4 fingers?I'm sure the 5 fingers made up to see the difference from the avatars and the na'vi and to see who's a halfblood or not. But wouldn't it be more realistic if a child from Jake had one hand with 5 fingers and one hand with 4?Watching Avatar: the way of water in 3D with High Frame Rate was so fun.

This was just a poor excuse for some legendary Cameron aggrandising; essentially just a vanity project. To be honest I had such a hard time telling who's who because none of the characters really stood out, they were all just this big blue (or turquoise) blob. I know people only watch this movie for the spectacle and the eye-candy, and that's all it is. However, not even the visuals were that great - I was expecting to be absolutely blown away, but they were just OK. The creature designs were also nothing special to be honest - for example there's these creatures called Tulkuns that are essentially humpback whales with a few more fins. The action set pieces aren't anything to write home about neither. Promises so much but delivers very little.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

The ocean creatures look like a giant killer whale (befriended by son Lo'ak Sully), stunningly beautiful luminous sea anemone, jellyfish, starfish, glofishes and flying fishes!Of course, soon the baddies are out to kill all, while the 'whale' seeks revenge for its family wiped out by these people. Sadly the story reminded me of another intelligent killer whale story called the 'Orca' (1977). I give the story 6/10 ratings. VFX 3D effects, sets and photography 9/10. Average 7.5/10. Watch this on the big screen to see a giant whale leaping out of the screen and crashing down! In real life, whales are also killed with explosive harpoons and their oil was used in cosmetics (now banned). David Attenborough would love this movie. Save our planet from extinction.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can only imagine that in 2D or on TV, this would be a steaming pile of turgid nonsense, but on the big screen in 3D, there's little time to get bored as you get lost in the amazing - honestly amazing - visuals. Unfortunately, that's all it really has going for it. It's a nonsensical movie really, nothing of what happens makes any sense or progresses the Avatar universe in any meaningful way. I'll watch the sequels but, like the first, this was a one-time only viewing for me. I'd love for James Cameron to have a fraction of the budgets he has and look back to Terminator/Aliens for some new ideas about plots & characters.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well, I was highly impressed by this movie that talks so much about life and death. The central theme captures human life very very easily in simple words, they are repeated throughout the movie and it's the eternal truth. Our bodies are made of water, we are formed from water and develop in our mothers wombs from water, not technically but you get the point. The focus on this movie is based around central themes of family and how water is an important part of our life. This movie will signify that tenfold. Hats off to James Cameron for providing us yet another classic. This is equally good as the original Avatar, 13 years later.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now I will say this off the bat, it's not a perfect movie but it's not bad at all. People giving it a 3 or 4 I can't agree with that score for this. A lot of people were saying this was better than the original and I'm kind of split. I think this was an improvement over the first in some aspects (there's a certain instant that took some balls to do that happened st the end of the film instead of being totally predictable, not spoiling it) and I was shocked at how incredible the cgi was. I shouldn't be but James Cameron and his crew always creates beautiful cgi amd scenery, It's genuinely incredible how good it is. Now let's get into the plot.It's been over 10-15 years I believe since the humans left pandora and now they have returned to kill Jake sully. Now Jake sully is the leader of the Omatikaya na'vi and has a family now to care for, so when they attack him they leave the Omatikaya clan and go into hiding with the water tribe na'vi. He and his family have to learn and adapt to the changes and the ways of the water while the RDA and the rest of the humans chase down sully. I won't go into to much detail because a lot of it if it can go into spoiler territory. Like seriously a lot happens in this movie. It was a very enjoyable movie and it felt shorter than 3 hours while watching it. The action and cinematics are insanely good. The actings good. But the story is the same through out and it doesn't really twist or change like the original. Though I do feel this movie was better than the first I still think both story's are decent Great moments aside. Definitely an enjoyable movie that's worth seeing. It's not the best movie of 2022 but it's still quite good and worth the watch. I'm really excited for the third movie of the series in 2024.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The beauty of Avatar was that feeling of what that wild but authentic living, interconnected with nature and community, real bonding, real values. Avatar 2 was so low-consciousness; the opposite of the brave and high-ideal vision of the original Avatar. Honestly, there was nothing to take in in Avatar 2. Just things blowing up, events that meant nothing, completely unnecessary conversations, no real, advanced ethics and nothing inspiring at all. In fact, it felt like an assault to the energy of the first Avatar, as if the world which touched and uplifted us so was being severely downgraded to an unoriginal, mundane, and pitiful version of human characters, relationships and communal living. A shame.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

When the first avatar came out the visuals were unprecedented and James Cameron set the standard on that front; it was hard to imagine he'd repeat that feat but he has. Everything is bigger and better, you can see that it was all put together to look cool because almost every scene was visually captivating. As a result of that the story isn't mind blowing or on par as the visual effects. It was also the first time since covid I watched a movie with a mask on and 3d glasses together and I get why people who wear glasses complain about them fogging up.I loved that it still had social and cultural commentary just like the first which was 'inspired' by the conflicts between natives and European military groups in South America during colonial times. Everything the first movie did well, this went 3 steps further. I loved the children's characters arcs, and to a lesser extent the history with the main antagonist despite being unimaginative villain. They must really love Stephen Lang to keep refusing to let him die. Spider felt like a late addition, didn't care as much for him even though his character was meant to play an integral part it always felt he was an afterthought when he showed up, underdeveloped.I am a die hard avatar fan but I do still see flaws, and I preface this with that the visuals made up and make the flaws seem more minor for me. As I said everything the first movie did well is done even better; same can be said for it's shortcomings. Story and characters are underdeveloped and that coupled with how cliche they are doesn't bode well, so for the many of those who didn't like the first avatar for such reasons won't be impressed with way of the water. And of course it's a ridiculously long as well but I enjoyed every minute of it. Plot wise it could literally be an hour shorter but why, I wouldn't want that, I wanna awe at pandora as long as I can, and even though the pacing isn't as good as the first I was still at the edge of my seat for all of it. It just happened that the plot was pretty lazily written. However with three more movies lined up in the making, they really need to step it up in the writing department, can't keep leaning on the visuals. Acting was great from everyone but the chemistry between characters could be written better to actually exuberate the emotions; the only reason I knew the characters cared for each other is it's narrated to us that they're family.Everything the first movie did well, The Way of Water did better, and everything that was underwhelming about the first was once again repeated. James Cameron only worked on avatar's strengths so despite being bigger and better, the movie still is more of the same. Felt like style over substance but the style was enough for me to overlook what it lacked.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Despite the blue faces, the emotions & expressions of the avatars were vivid & clearly understandable, which is further proof of how emotions are the binding force, the common ground among all species.The film reminds me of a beauty fairytale in which the childish elements have been replaced by real-world problems like greed, betrayal, racial differences, death, and war over resources. It depicts human greed, our encroachment over the land of others & how war causes devasting loss to both sides, all while maintaining an aesthetically appealing backdrop. Looking forward to watching the sequel in 3D!I watched the first movie to remind myself of the story line before seeing this one.It was fantastic and the 3d was just mind blowing.

I love Avatar. I love Pandora. I have watched the first movie countless times and waited so long for the sequal. Maybe I had my expectations too high because Cameron is known to produce very good sequals (e.g. Terminator, Aliens, etc.), which is kinda rare talent.The Way of Water has mesmerizing visuals, and Cameron uses 3D to good effect as always.Unfortunately, the new characters are boring. Each of the kids fills a very typical role, and they have a typical teenager trouble with their parents, Jake and Ney'tiri. Quaritch is the most interesting one here, but even that is still under development.The original was much better polished as a stand-alone movie.

Sometimes divisive with critics but always pushing forward, Cameron has often dragged the cinema kicking and screaming into the age of digital wizardry. His contributions to the medium have been rewarded by audiences repeatedly, adored by a burgeoning demographic in the eighties and frequently breaking box office records since releasing Titanic in 1997. But lo! Avatar: The Way of Water may buck the trend - rather than gross the GDP of Suriname, the film may only gross the GDP of Belize - a pittance.The film follows the continuing lives of Jake Sully and Neytiri. When marines return to seek revenge and use Pandora as a second Earth, the couple must flee from their forest home and into the water of a coastal tribe. There, they must learn to adapt to their new home as Colonel Miles Quaritch, cloned and in an avatar body, searches for their whereabouts.Avatar 2 is an impressively large and extraordinarily long film, but there is one constant which is unwaveringly distracting - the high frame rate. Talented filmmakers like Cameron, Ang Lee, and Peter Jackson, occasionally allow hubris to misguide them in their quest for innovation and cutting-edge superficialities.To this end, all three are desperately trying to incorporate a higher frame rate into their films, which is said to make look film more ""realistic,"" a supposition I've never understood. How does an artificially inflated frame rate, the most standardized metric in art, look more natural to viewers who are accustomed, throughout their entire lives, to the previous standard? I humbly speak for the film-going public when I answer, ""it does not.""
Avatar 2 further innovates by switching between (perceived) twenty-four and forty-eight frames per second. Although audiences are gifted less high frame rate, the technique only further distracts, as the film schizophrenically cuts between expected motion and horribly smooth action. It's also bound to greatly confuse those who notice the difference but aren't in the loop as to why or how. If the practice, inconceivably, becomes the standard, I may never see another blockbuster. Death to high frame rates!Any given viewer's reaction to Avatar 2 will largely depend on their opinion pertaining to the state of filmmaking currently, relating to its trajectory since the release of the previous installment. Those pining for the days of practical effects and tangible sets having nothing to look forward to, but those accustomed to CGI spectacles will be comfortably pleased.Avatar 2's effects are not dated, bland, or indulgent; most of the CGI is beautifully textured and necessary for the film's sweeping camerawork and general scope. The problem is that the underlying failures of computer-generated imagery are stalwart: the characters and objects are weightless, and the physics remain uncanny, even if the aesthetics are often breathtaking.In 2009, the ambition of rendering the majority of a live action film in a computer (one which looked magnitudes more convincing than even the most impressive CGI of the time) was daring enough to justify a tradeoff in verisimilitude. The first film became the highest grossing film of all time (no, not adjusted for inflation) because general audiences had never seen such expansive use of CGI outside of a Star Wars prequel.Now...it's all they know. Viewers will see CGI landscapes and effects in at least two trailers immediately preceding the film (Quantumania and Guardians of the Galaxy 3) which are just as colorful, creative, expansive, and busy. They might be cheaper, not as luxuriously rendered or detailed, but the novelty is long dead.Pre-armed with knowledge of the industry over a decade, and the alarming gap between the two films, it's reasonable to assume Cameron would ration considerable time, energy, and attention to his script - he has not. Motivations, character development, and structure are still laughably childish and thin; despite the 195-minute runtime, the film is largely uneventful. Obviously, Cameron's M. O. this time around is showing off the technological progress and giving audiences a 2001-esque peak into his imagined world, but it's not creative or unique enough to warrant the length or simplicity.Filling the void when spectacle fizzles is grating ""character work"" mostly centering around the offspring of our previous protagonists, Jake and Neytiri. The children are seen as outsiders to the new tribe and are challenged to fit in for the sake of peace and harmony, a plotline which derivatively borrows from the first film, itself an already-tired Dances with Wolves retread.This desolate, barren story soil could be given fresh nutrients with intriguing characters or complex dynamics; instead, Cameron bashes his audiences over the head with one of the most well-trodden and insipid themes of the modern age. It's amusing: a character from a preceding Shazam trailer mockingly references the Fast and Furious films and their shallow fixation on ""family,"" which is followed by Avatar 2's three-hour opus to the word. There's probably some dystopian subtext to the recent fetishization of familial love, but the surface-level triteness alone signals a need for a new dead horse to brutalize.Additionally, the dialogue is laughably blunt, a painful mix of direct verbalizations of feelings and irrelevant, throwaway banter, all articulated by way of grade-school-curriculum diction. The first fifteen minutes are also dedicated to narrated exposition, so rushed and pandering that Rise of Skywalker is blushing in the corner. If, as some have said, the first Avatar gained no cultural traction because it simply lacked a story and characters worth remembering, Avatar 2 will suffer the same relative obscurity. I hope the international grosses are worth all the monosyllables.The performances are dutiful but unremarkable. Unlike the original, there's seldom a scene with real humans in the film, so the motion capture is forced to do the heavy lifting. Actors become voice actors, and only Zoe Saldana musters genuine feeling without being seen.To be fair to Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, and Cliff Curtis, the characterizations are too stiff and flat for any detailed emotion. Similarly, Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, Jack Champion, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, and Duane Evans Jr. Work admirably as the scuffling youngsters.Avatar 2 is exactly what audiences hope it won't be: a retelling of the original film in a different location, excruciatingly predictable and free of any character, thematic, or intellectual intrigue. Every story element and conservational ideal has been done before, and better.However, this was also true of the original; it will be interesting to see if the technological promise and spectacle of the sequel are enough to lure audiences into theaters like they were a decade and change ago. Personally, the film evoked no particular emotion, but it did put me in the mood for Planet Earth. At least David Attenborough provides narration for subjects who can't already talk.","45 out of 82 found this helpful.

Can't wait for the third movie. It's amazing how they did this movie. I watched it yesterday in 3D.

Revolving around the Sully family, and their struggle against the ""sky people,"" it never stops to surprise its audience with almost believable visual effects. Now, sometimes over the duration of the movie, you may feel that a three hour stretch is a technology overkill, and that it's too much ""family,"" but if you're solely going out with the objective of a visual spectacle, you won't be disappointed. The plot, though not the best it could've been (sloppy at times), works out pretty well as a whole.The first Avatar was a revolution, and hence, any comparison between the two is unfair. Individually, the second part surely is an amusement. As such, if you're up for an impactful fantasy experience, be sure to watch it!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Extraordinary visuals make up for the weak story. As far as visuals are concerned, this is the best the world has ever seen. I was in Pandora. I went underwater. Everything was so real that I felt like I was beside jake sully all the time. Also the sound department did a fantastic job. When it comes to story, I'm disappointed. Avatar 1 has a very regular story, but the best thing was the script had zero loose ends. Every minute detail of the story was perfectly written. But I felt Avatar 2 story is outright failure. It had so many similarities with part 1 that i felt i was rewatching it again. Just like Avatar 1, the last hour is completely filled with action. But i was not emotionally connected to it. Every scene just happens as you expect it to happen. Dialogues in this film are as bad as they were in first part. I don't know why but, Pandora kids calling each other bro sounded so cringe and artificial to me. Don't expect much from the story, just enjoy the visuals in the best theatre possible.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This sequel, though in this too they've broken records in terms of graphics, is not such a great, unique story to watch. The expectations were really very high with the storyline but they ( the creators) just couldn't match up to them.But i think the only downgrade in this film that is weak storyline is because they've tried to continue the story further to make the rest of the sequels and to connect them. Hopefully sequels will have a real good storyline.I'll have to admit this film is by far the best family movie to watch.

I've said it a thousand times before: Never doubt him! ...""
is how you do EPIC blockbuster-ing!Emotional, visceral and as big as films get!Go see it and experience something you have never seen before on the biggest screen you can possibly find...I am relieved and happy to say that Avatar The Way of Water is worth the 13 year wait!I can remember seeing the first film all the way back in 2009, and I was honestly blown away by it!I was 12 years old when I saw the first film and now I'm 25 seeing the second film, let that sink in...
I can remember thinking that it was the coolest thing I had ever seen!I honestly had never seen anything quite like it before?To be honest, at the time, I don't think anyone had!But I never once thought that their would be a sequel 13 years later...
Avatar The Way of Water is truly phenomenal!Bigger, surprisingly better and more emotional than the first...
This sequel is to no one's surprise; visually breathtaking, visceral and incredibly engrossing!The story, the spectacle, the spirituality, the sheer beauty...
This is filmmaking and storytelling at it's very best!To no one's surprise, Avatar The Way of Water pushes CGI and visual storytelling to new places we've never seen before onscreen, and uses the word 'Family' more than any Fast and Furious film...
While some of the new characters are underutilised, Pandora is once again the star of the show.It's miraculously realised, the underwater stuff is just glorious and the final act is full of mind blowing action!James Cameron's level of perfectionism translates to the audience; the details of every frame are precise and I can't help but wonder how on Earth he has done that?With every pulse and vibration from the active non-stop pictures onscreen, to every thump of heartbeat and every resurfacing bubble of air, and from every fall of raindrops and rumbles of thunder to the crashes of waves and splashes of wings and tails, The Way of Water reveals a triumphant return to Pandora, but this time Pandora is way more blue and beautiful...Overall, James Cameron has once again crafted a visual masterpiece, with the most impressive CGI I have ever seen!The dense foliage of Pandora's lush jungles and the hyper realistic water effects are honestly a sight to behold.I found myself gawking at the insane level of detail in every single frame, and I could not believe my eyes...
The work that went into the characters though, is what truly blew my mind!The expressiveness in their eyes, the subtle details in their skin and the way they move for CG characters that felt as real as any of the human actors in the film...
This is arguably the definitive theatrical experience of 2022!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

CGI was too good. Had the best water simulation I've ever seen, even the first part had incredible water simulation.We'll get extremely bored during the movie because of the reason I stated before, viz. We won't care about the characters. Everyone is one dimensional. The villain is as one dimensional it can get. Imagine a villain still saying ""I'm going to kill your children"" or something like that! And only thing for us to enjoy is the visuals. But they also gets boring since the novelty factor of seeing these sort of visuals worn off in the first part itself. And the story was too predictable. Went to the theatres without any expectation and I still got disappointed. I'm giving 6 stars only for the VFX artists who worked day and nights without a break.

The world of Pandora is more vivid and immersive than ever, with stunning landscapes and creatures that truly transport audiences to another world.The film's score, composed by Simon Franglen and Andrew Kawczynski, is a worthy successor to the original's iconic score by the late James Horner. While it doesn't quite reach the same heights as Horner's work, it still manages to capture the spirit and emotion of the film's themes and visuals.However, despite these impressive achievements, Avatar: The Way of Water doesn't quite live up to the original film. The plot feels somewhat familiar and predictable, lacking the same sense of wonder and discovery that made the first film so memorable. And while the film's length was a point of contention for Cameron during its promotion ,it's hard to deny that it could have benefited from some trimming.The 3D presentation on the first film was impressive compared to most films, 3d films are still gimmicky and add nothing to the film experience beyond irritating glasses. Unlike the first film, I didn't bother to watch this in 3d.Despite these flaws, way of the water still manages to deliver a powerful ecological and political message. The film's themes of environmentalism, colonization, and corporate greed are perhaps even more relevant today than they were in 2009, and its message of hope and resistance in the face of overwhelming odds is inspiring and empowering.Avatar way of the water is a worthy successor to the original film, with stunning visuals, strong performances, and an important message. While it doesn't quite reach the same heights as its predecessor, it still manages to capture the spirit of adventure and wonder that made the first film such a cultural phenomenon. And the world of Pandora is still breathtaking, with even more films on the cards and the films huge box office success it will be interesting to se where we go next.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The fact that they are planning to make 3 more films is mind boggling. This one recycled so many plot elements (and even the primary antagonist) that it felt like this was the 5th movie in the series and that they were completely out of ideas so just reused things that worked in the first movie. I can't even fathom how terrible the next movies will be.Other negatives include irrational decisions made by the characters, poor pacing (way too slow at times + boring drawn out action sequences), lame motivations behind the antagonist (AKA the whole driving force behind the story and the primary conflict is completely illogical and ridiculous)Positives: Visually beautiful, the Tarzan-esque boy was an interesting addition (but they didn't spend enough time on him), and excellent acting from Zoe Saldana, she truly brings her character to life.I've never written an IMDb review before but felt compelled for the very first time because this movie was so alarmingly bad. With over a decade and millions of dollars to create something special, how was THIS the outcome?Re: the original Avatar, I was never a huge fan either but thought it was fine. 5.5/10. Had a pleasant time watching it but felt no need to see it again. Overly simplistic plot and filled with cliches, but it was a cute, fun story that kind of felt like a kids movie. Never thought in a million years the plot warranted a sequel, let alone 4 more movies.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was worried reading it was the same story as 1 and whilst it kind of was, it gained so much more with the addition of water and the battle scenes were jaw dropping at times. Pathos and horror in the odd scene, what man does to other creatures. And it hit the emotions way more than an avengers film would ever do. I just enjoyed it for what it was.

It's honesty mind-blowing how absolutely amazing this long-anticipated sequel looks in every single scene, a truly unprecedented feat of visual effects wizardry that very well might be the most aesthetically pleasing movie ever put on a screen of any size. Of course, the ideal way to watch the piece is in its intended format of IMAX 3D; I can safely say that you should experience this on as big a screen as possible at least once in your life. I am a firm believer that a good film is a good film no matter how you watch it, be it at the cinema with surround sound or on your mobile with headphones. I don't know how successful the flick will be at home in 2D on a significantly smaller screen with a significantly less powerful sound system, but that's almost irrelevant to its success as a big-screen experience. If you can, go and see it at the cinema; you won't be disappointed. Besides, it's not as if I only enjoy the picture as an IMAX showcase and I strongly suspect its beauty will shine through no matter how it's seen.There is one downside to its presentation, though, and that's its incredibly noticeable variable frame rate. James Cameron's odd decision to flicker back and forth between 24 and 48 frames per second comes close to ruining some of the film's best action scenes, principally because it never quite gives you enough time to adjust to either mode. When it cuts to 48, sometimes the action seems to speed up (to distracting and comical effect), almost as if the scene was rendered at 24 and played back at twice the speed. When it cuts to 24, sometimes things seem to jitter as if the film is lagging. Whether these effects are caused by an optical illusion or a genuine rendering issue is irrelevant, as they're distracting enough to mention as a serious problem. The variable frame rate isn't always an issue, but even its smoothest transitions are a little jarring and their frequency is frustrating, for sure. There's no reason why the whole affair couldn't have been presented in either 24 or 48 frames per second, both of which have their advantages. Other than the frame rate, there isn't a single thing that stands out as less than stellar about the visuals of the film. It truly is the best-looking picture I've ever seen, and the power of that can't be understated.Presentation is only one half of the puzzle, and the first 'Avatar (2009)' fell short somewhat when it came to the other. Luckily, although it still has several narrative issues, this follow-up is noticeably better than Cameron's first effort when it comes to its story. The first act almost feels like a different film to the second and third (which arguably have a three-act structure in their own right), as it essentially represents an extended prologue that sets up the rest of the narrative. The start of the second act is marked by a change in location and a shift in perspective from Jake Sulley and Neytiri to their four children and their their efforts to integrate into their new watery surroundings. The new locale is refreshing and vibrant, beautiful in its tranquility and its marked differences from the mountains and forests of the first film. It's here that the flick really comes into its own (although that's not to imply the first movement isn't solid), allowing us a lot of time to become accustomed to the way of water and the young characters we're now following. It's almost a chill, pro-environmental hang-out movie for its middle portion and it works surprisingly well. In fact, even at over three hours in length, I don't think the feature feels too long and it never even comes close to being boring. The slower pacing affords a lot of time to get to know the characters and world, avoiding the first flick's issue of skipping interesting development in montage and rushing character arcs. The decision to establish a human-on-Na'vi war and then background it entirely is surprisingly successful, as it allows the flick to focus fully on the Sulley family unit. The stakes are pretty much entirely personal and this makes for some genuinely moving moments. It's unfortunate that Jake and Neytiri all but disappear from the middle section, only popping up occasionally to reinforce the arcs of their children. The latter, especially, is incredibly underserved, as she never really gets anything to do even when she's present. Thankfully, she gets some great action scenes in the last act.Speaking of the last act, the finale is absolutely great. It's incredibly entertaining, an exciting and surprisingly violent battle filled with Na'vi warriors tossing humans around like rag dolls, spearing them through the heart, shooting them in the head with their giant arrows and working with the creatures of the sea to maim them in a variety of devilishly enjoyable ways. It's a high-octane thrill ride that gets you on the edge of your seat and keeps you there until it's over. It's weird that the water tribe literally vanishes halfway through the finale, but at least the focus rightfully remains on the Sulley family. It's a satisfying final movement that's undercut slightly by a somewhat unbelievable character decision and a last-minute pseudo sequel tease that highlights how potentially inconsequential this piece's plot may be in the grand scheme of the upcoming 'Avatar' franchise (which doesn't reduce its success as an insular, interpersonal story but does distract from it somewhat as the credits start to roll). There are also a couple of narrative elements that are introduced and all but dropped, presumably because they'll be elaborated upon in later sequels. This is slightly frustrating, but it isn't a major problem in the grand scheme of things.Although it isn't exactly a masterpiece, the screenplay does what it needs to and its underlying messages are potent and important. It takes quite a few risks in terms of pacing, which I feel pay off significantly and make for a more distinct and effective end result. It's a more mature film than its predecessor, in a way, and it's constantly compelling. The movie isn't exactly an actor's showcase, but the motion capture has been improved to the point that it feels like a near one-to-one translation of the performances. The main players are all really good, selling even the cheesiest lines of dialogue (which are far less frequent than in the first film) and conveying a lot of emotion. There are actually some scenes that come close to provoking tears, too; it's a surprisingly affecting film at times.Ultimately, this is a visually astounding feature that often drops your jaw with its aesthetics alone. There's a strong emphasis on character and world, the pacing is assured, the slow moments are almost as engaging as the action scenes and the finale is absolutely brilliant. It's an entertaining and enjoyable feature for pretty much the entirety of its gargantuan 192-minute duration, and its presentation is something that absolutely needs to be experienced at least once (and in IMAX 3D if possible). Perhaps it won't hold up quite as well on a rewatch at home, but you can't deny its genius as a genuine cinematic marvel.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The Movie just cut off in the theater the whole screen just went to black, turns out it was malfunction with the movie projector they were using. They ended up giving us free movie tickets, the movie came back on and i was immediately sucked back into the world of pandora like nothing happened. The Way of the Water Sucked me back into Pandora just like the little kid in that seat in 2009. From the build up to the seeing the movie in IMAX, to finally sitting in my seat i was ready to go back to that seat in 2009 and fall in love with the characters and the world all over again. The Way of the Water feels like a movie that is exactly what it needed to be stunning visuals with a story that is what it needed to be from the beautiful visuals to the simple yet grounded story about family to a more complex story about the ocean and how we need to protect the amazing wonders that come with it. I know that this movie will inspire young filmmakers to strive to build worlds and not be afraid to wait until they feel like it is the right time to make there masterpiece. I just know some kid in there Theater hopefully not with the movie cut off is getting so much inspiration from The Way of the Water. In the end of the day that is all that really matters go see this movie and get inspired in your own ways.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was able to have an emotional impact on me despite the fact that I was beginning to doubt it would during the first half hour or so. Yes it was the slower parts, but I like slow movies as long as it keeps me invested with great dialogue, and that leads me to two main things I didn't like about this film.First, it felt like I was watching a game... so a main problem is the CGI being... effectively equivalent in quality to it's 2009 release. That was a HUGE letdown for me when I'm also seeing games with a much lower budget producing CGI that looks so much more real. There is no reason for this mid result after 13 years. It's unacceptable in 2022. Yes it was very beautiful, but I expect that and more from games not major movies like this one. There were also many times when the dialogue could be much stronger for the slower sections. I'm hearing lines that need to be put to death. With this world-building and characters, Hollywood needs to be more creative. Aside from that, the actors did well and held their own. It was a nice movie with heavy emotional moments that fell just short of its greater potential.It get's a 7.5/10 from me!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was hoping for a spectacle like the first movie, but this one was a bit messy and was wrapped around family issues. Was that a bad thing? No.Avatar (2009) builds up slowly and gets his way towards the second half of the movie where all hell breaks loose into a war. There are so many friends, like Max, Trudy, Augustine, the other avatar driver (skinny guy, don't remember his name). They are mostly gone in the sequel. They are kind of replaced new people; Sully's family.In the sequel the war begins very fast. Bringing back the same threath of the first movie. Then we get to see the sea clan. That really is a treat. The bonding with the other clan, water animals. It was a delight to watch.Last part was a war again, messy, long. Villain still lives, don't know why. Then again, there are three more movies coming up. With the same war? Same villain? Is avatar about to become a bad Netflix series? Please don't. Stay creative. Don't deliver the same trick over and over, or avatar is doomed to die like The Terminator and The Matrix. For now, I give it the benefit of the doubt.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Highly recommend watching the first before watching the second as it references the first part throughout the movie. All actors did a great job in the film.

The only problem is that it was so long that I was just sitting there during the climax is a post high trance. Other than that, good visuals and visual Art direction, mediocre but acceptable plot, and the determination to be a decent sequel to the 2009 award winning epic classic Avatar. Honestly, I've never seen the first one, just never peaked my i retest enough. Though as a Avatar virgin I still enjoyed the slow yet epic story of a father and his family. The visuals of this movie where mostly my favorite part of this movie, since I've never seen the first one and was very confused on the lore through the movie. Overall, decent movie that was a fun escape from the miserable real world we live in for a few hours.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is the idea of war and self defense vs peace, where Cameron explores the idea of never responding to violence vs fighting for your people. There is the environmental greed from the sky people vs the native harmony with nature, which was a driving theme in the first movie as well. Another plot is that of feeling othered for the children of Jake Sully, as not being fully Na'vi. But sometimes when so many plot lines are present it makes the runtime long and doesn't allow adequate build up to see these plot points develop to their full potential. I wish more time was given to the realities of prolonged war against colonizers. Sully should have interacted more with various clan chiefs or war leaders within his own tribe to show even though they are fighting against the sky people the sky people still are coming building and settling on their planet. This should have been interposed with how he treats his family and the expectations for his sons.Another problem that took me out of the movie were the scenes with Kiri. You have a girl with the voice of an older women. It removes the child like innocence that Kiri should have. Any scene where she cries or calls for mom and dad seem fake and inauthentic. I would have rather had a young actress portray Kiri, keeping her same features.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

An example with the film I'm talking about, the actors were in the sea to make some avatar scenes 2, it's an exemple a mang so many others.As for the film, I really liked Avatar because it talks about a paralyzed former sailor, Jake Sully who becomes mobile again thanks to an avatar and falls in love with a Na'vi woman. A Na'vi is the name of a group living on Pandora. As a bond with this woman grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of his world.

I am one of the few people who absolutely loved the first one, mainly because I saw it in 3D at the time and it blew me away. The story for the first film was weak I admit but the world they created was incredible and this film builds on that and everything is done with breathtaking realism.The story is much stronger and has real emotional depth. I cared about the characters and (ridiculous as it sounds) even teared up at a scene when a boy bonds with a whale. It look's beautiful and the sentiment behind all of it is beautiful.The level and expectation of great vfx has declined so much over the last 10 years that something like this where they've really taken the time and effort is much appreciated.I hope this is successful because I can't wait to go back to Pandora time and time again for future instalments. All the negative people on here need to lighten up and just enjoy the sheer spectacle of what is a truly groundbreaking film in terms of vfx.I'd also like to point out that I dragged my girlfriend along with me to see this and she absolutely hates Avatar.She loved this movie and has now been converted.One of us, one of us, one of us.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, I felt the entire film was a unconnected series of multiple stories with a weak attachment to each other. Many scenes had felt as if they were simply clipped together and the flow of the film felt jagged and did not relay smoothly, technically and metaphorically. Albeit, at the climax of the film, it felt as if there was now a story and the film was not just a showcase of the visual effects.This film is designed to stimulate strong emotional responses and one of the methods in which it does this is, is the portrayal, and the message it conveys, about the U. S. military and the U. S. Marine Corps in particular. In my opinion the message presented is unrealistic, exaggerated, and disrespectful. Marines are depicted killing non-combatants and children for sport, committing arson against residential structures and generally, as emotionally unintelligent individuals. I could be wrong in interpreting the film is conveying all Marines and personnel of the U. S. military as barbaric machines, and only referring to these characters. However my mind interprets this as the former. This portrayal I had disliked as it was unrealistic and unfair to U. S. Marine Corps servicemen and women.Conclusively the film is worth your time. It is extraordinary in terms of computer aided imagery and not like anything else you will see for a long time. The story does lack in large portions of the film but eventually comes together at a edge-of-seat climax.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

your time and money. The movie lacked plot, and was really disappointing overall. I was trying my
best not to fall asleep while sitting in the cinema for 3 hours straight. In my opinion, they should've
made the movie at least an hour shorter and it wouldn't be that boring. The plot overall was really
confusing to me, and I was trying my best to understand whats the point of the movie, but
I couldn't, plus the font of the subtitles was horrible (James Cameron had 13 years to change the font and chose not to). The music in the movie didn't catch my attention at all, but as far as I can remember it was pretty decent. The special effects in the movie were the best part of it. I must admit, the visuals in the movie were stunning, but compared to the prequel, they didn't change at all. The first part of
""Avatar"" was a box office success because of its visual effects, and I think considering the year the
movie was released in, it was way ahead of its time, and that's why so many people were impressed
with it and went to the Cinema to check the 2nd part out. In my opinion, the new ""Avatar: The Way
of Water"", was overall pretty bad. On a scale from zero to five, I give this movie a 2 because of the
things i mentioned before.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

As if, the world is tangible in every possible sense.One of the great achievements about 3D filmmaking is that it lets the audience be a part of the world. This movie leaves no stones unturned to make you feel so.Avatar didn't just succeed in pushing the envelope of 3D filmmaking but also paved the way for underwater mo-cap technology.What truly feels exclusive to,'The Way of Water', is the underwater sequences of the aquatic ecosystem and marine life forms.It truly feels spellbinding at times. At other times you'd be fascinated by the sheer hard work that must have gone into building this world.Some of the moments that captured that amazing world was when the children of Jake and Neytiri were trying to adapt to the life of water people, the Metkayina clan.The movie is a constant reminder about the balance that must exist between nature and humans.If Avatar was about Jake's journey and finding his place amongst the Na'vi, in particular the Omaticayan clan, then, the sequel acts as a podium for his children to establish their identity among the Metkayina clan.The fighting sequences will be heart pounding and action packed!If Jake had put on the mask of vigilante in the prequel. Then in this part, he'll take on the stance of a defender. It is important to understand that Jake is a father now. He continues to find an escape from adversity, not until he comes to realize that running isn't an option.Finally, the only way out is to face the ultimate villain, head-on!James Cameron did manage to create a world that isn't just full of danger and mystery but also full of excitement and discovery.Avatar is an adventure story that transports the audience into an unknown world. A world rich in biodiversity, and offers a unique blend of Na'vi cultures and values.All in all, it is a visual spectacle. A movie that is grand and epic in its creativity and vision. Even after watching the movie, it manages to live on inside the minds of those who've experienced it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

You would think a director with 40 years under his belt would realise that by now :(","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Avatar: The Way of Water is a visually stunning adventure that you have to see on the biggest screen possible because the visuals are spellbinding and you get totally immersed in Pandora. Surprisingly, it's not just the spectacle, there's plenty of emotion in here and I cried twice. And oh my the world building, the alien creatures in the ocean he has created are nothing short of extraordinary, and jaw dropping to look at. Coming to it's main weakness, which is the storyline- It's an extremely simple story which is mostly a typical good guy vs bad guy...could have had some more depth. Especially on rewatching the first movie I feel that one had a better storyline. Hopefully avatar 3 can combine great visuals with a great story which would make it a masterpiece.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However I have a really hard time to hang on to the movie as there are elements that have pulled me out of the movie.First of all, I did not understand at what point all the Na'vis peoples began to speak perfectly English, I understant that it is necessary to make the film digestible, but an element of answer would have been appreciable. Especially since the colonel says he has to adopt their way of life and therefore adopt their language... that obviously nobody speaks anymore.Then Cameron brings the colonel back, claiming he made a backup of his memory just before the final battle of the first movie, Which is surprising at first when we know how confident humans were in going to fight the Na'vis. Besides, it's strange that if this technology exists in the avatar universe, it wasn't used to save Jake Sully's brother's mind before he died.It is also strange that humans no longer covet the Unobtanium that looked so precious in the first movie(which is the reason of the first confrontation).Finally, one may wonder where the Na'vi culture has gone: especially the respect for animals, at the beginning of this movie, Jake teaches his son to fish, he does not perform the ritual to shorten the suffering of the animal and allow him to return to Eywa. It is as if in about ten years, Jake managed to implant his culture among all the Na'vis, despite the fact that he is considered a demon by many Na'vi.Despite everything, the movie remains splendid and enjoyable and is probably 10 years ahead of the technique used currently, despite all the scriptwriting facilities used to advance the story. I definitely appreciated discovering the ocean, the Metkayina and the reef where all the beauty of this film lies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

James Cameron had perfected the cgi in Pandora's jungle. In the ocean? Yep. In the cgi ocean of Avatar 2 is next level mesmerizing with good story. The characters are all great, when I saw Avatar 2 with my sister in cinema my sister fell in love with Lo'ak (one of Jake and Neytiri's kids). Kiri is a cute character, but my favorite character of this movie is Spider. Spider is the most fun character of the whole film, I love him and he kinda reminds me one of my classmates who is a cool teenager like Spider is. The villain is back on his Na'vi form and he is surprisingly much menacing than ever.It's hard to choose between the first film and which is better, Avatar 2 is better in some ways.

Was in fact irritated with both water people and the family drama. Still don't understand why they made the second movie with such a miserable plot. Just because the used special effects doesn't make it a good action movie. None of the action sequences were amusing.

It came out like 37 years ago - and James Cameron disappeared - presumably working on the sequel and ignoring the 4k releases of his significant blockbusters' 4k releases.... True Lies, The Abyss, Titanic, etc...Frankly, I was disillusioned - and pissed off How could he ignore some of the greatest films ever released - leaving their fates to 480i resolution... And I've been on a warpath for quite some time...The world deserved hi-def releases of True Lies, The Abyss & Titanic.Well apparently they're coming in the coming months...But let's look at Avatar 2.. in 4k. I've been a 4k enthusiast since the format arrived... I've raved about the quality of Nolan's 'Tenet' - the special effects of Berg's 'Battleship' - the color quality of 'Braveheart' or the incredible video brilliance of the Star Wars sequels...Cameron's Avatar 2 is a benchmark for the future - stellar visuals...I mean, c'mon... he invented technology to make these movies...The colors and textures are beyond incredible.... It's the finest 4k disc I own... Nothing short of perfection...Storywise, it's the same as before - a native population fights for survival against an invader - the parallels drawn to the Native American race are there in spades..Anyone giving this film less than an 8 have something else going on in their lives - the film delivers on every level...It brings back Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang and CCH Pounder.. It brings back visuals you have *never* seen - and it brings back what's been missing in cinema for a long, long time... something surprising - your love the characters...","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

For our own benefit. We are not concerned with loving our neighbors but controlling them and taking what they have for ourselves. It makes you take a real good look at yourself as a human , as a person, and how we don't try to understand those that have different cultures from our own or see how even in our differences we are still the same.

The scenes under water are the most fantastic ones. I remember them as if I just watched it.In my personal perception, the action scenes and fights are too long. They could have shortened them. But it doesn't disturb that much.However, there was one weak point that can't be ignored: the story. The reasons why humans came back to Pandora make little to no sense and seemed just to be a self-critic message from the author. It's a collection of some bad, egoistic and greedy motives without any plot/context. It's very unfortunate and the reason why I have to reduce 2 stars.

Well worth the price of admission . As was the case with the original the story and some of the dialogue is cringe making but we all knew that before going in. We also get the required explosions and gun play. What a movie it could have been with those elements removed!Focussed in large part on the family of ex-earther Sully this plays like an episode of Ozzy and Harriet, right out of the 50s including the line of ""We Sully's stick together"". Ugghh. But forget about that. Just sit back and watch and get lost in the visual experience.The best acting comes from Stephen Lang. Despite the cliches that plague his evil bad guy character he still manages to give a performance that really has something to it.Perhaps the silliest thing is the necklaces glued to the chests of all the female characters. Those things never move so we are spared the horrific sight of an alien nipple which apparently would do bad things to us.

The film was about 3h long, but I personally think it is worth watching!This movie continued the storyline of avatar extremely well, I am hyped and waiting for the third film by avatar if they decide to make one.The movie ended with a small cliffhanger, witch leaves some hope that we will have another avatar movie!So, I recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first avatar movie. And this movie has great production quality.Great movie!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yeah, how original. I bet the writers were not very bright and took extra looong coffee breaks, to get done with this one. Another corporate bs, focusing only on the violence, war, enmity, division, instilling panic and fear, along with misusing natural resources. Sounds familiar? Oh, yes, so familiar that it hurts from the 3D reality we're all living it.We ain't that stupid, just because you slap a family sentiments on a political and economic driven movie, where it's all about killing and exploiting, doesn't mean you will fool us and present it as a ""ground breaking"" again. So many themes are wrong in this movie, lacking to convey any positive, uplifting messages, that would inspire e new way of life for everyone. No matter how much of the natural beauty you show in these movies, if the motives and the values are not set right, I'm not buying any of it. Very underwhelming and I'm giving it 6 just for the work crew, because I appreciate their work, but when comes to script writing, themes, messages, interpersonal relations.. it barely goes to 2.Go watch it once and make your own conclusion. I expect Avatar 3 to be remake of Avatar 1&2, now with neighbors. Thank you.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But without a good story to back them up, visuals turn into a documentary.For the first half of the movie it was impossible to know where the story was headed. Only in the last quarter of the movie did things get interesting. In my opinion, the movie time could have been cut down by half, delivering a great story with amazing visual effects.I think James Cameron tried to do a Peter Jackson here with the 3-hour run time. But then Peter Jackson had Tolkien's story to back him up. There wasn't enough story to fill the three hours, so it dragged on for a long time.I know that the movie creators went to absurd lengths to generate the visual effects for this movie, hats off to them. I felt that they had been betrayed by the story writers however.Also, Cameron's obsession with drowning ships was patently obvious in the final scenes of the movie, not that that's a bad thing, just saying.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It barely sequel baits, focusing exclusively on this story and has surprisingly genuine stakes as no one truly feels safe or guaranteed to make it out alive.Sam Worthington gives a better performance as Jake Sully this time around, with his character showing more maturity and a stoic nature. Zoe Saldana doesn't get as much to do this time around but still has her fair share of emotionally powerful moments.Stephen Lang as Quaritch was one the best parts of the original and here he somehow manages to be even better, bringing more of the expected ruthlessness and tough exterior as well as showing a more human side to the character that's unexpected but really works.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Director James Cameron proves once again that he is a true visionary. The film's storyline is a perfect blend of science fiction and emotional family drama, offering a compelling narrative that keeps you engaged from start to finish.The direction in this movie is nothing short of spectacular. James Cameron's attention to detail and his ability to create a believable, otherworldly environment is truly commendable. The underwater sequences are particularly breathtaking, showcasing cutting-edge CGI and technology that push the boundaries of what's possible in filmmaking.The story takes us back to the enchanting world of Pandora, where the themes of environmentalism and the connection between humans and nature are explored with depth and resonance. The film's emotional family drama adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, making it more than just a visually stunning spectacle.While the movie is undeniably beautiful and well-crafted, some viewers might find it a bit slow-paced at times. However, the payoff is worth it, as the story unfolds and characters develop, making you emotionally invested in their journey.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water is a must-watch for fans of the original film and anyone who appreciates visionary filmmaking. It boasts a perfect storyline, exceptional direction, and a heartfelt family drama that adds depth to its breathtaking visuals. James Cameron's return to the world of Pandora is a cinematic event that shouldn't be missed.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

We have the relationship of avatars with their animals and with nature, but the script becomes repetitive and cyclical, in addition to looking a lot like the first film, here the conflict generates a new conflict, but repeated, that creates the same conflict that they have just resolved.We don't see much character arc, we don't even decorate their names, we end up clinging only to the pandora world, their life and especially the life of their animals.To summarize we have a totally different film, an entertainment note a thousand, even a little elitized, because it only passes in 3d cinemas, but sometimes it seems that the film stops , to introduce us to the avatar world, script to cliché and photography out of the question. It's worth the ticket, for the attraction!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Be warned that this movie is a commitment as it is over three hours long!Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the human transformed into a Na'vi person, and his wife Ney'tiri (Zoe Saldaña) are back and now have four kids. With the unexpected return of the wicked Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who is brought back as a Na'vi impersonator along with his crew, the Sully's are forced to flee the forest and explore what other places on Pandora, their home planet, have to offer.Since this is the sequel to the mega-hit film, Avatar, I recommend watching the first film before viewing this one, as there are many important references and details that are key to following this film. The storyline leaves us with some more questions than answers; however it sets up moviegoers for the next installments. Viewing it on a big screen, especially in 3D - which I recommend - makes you feel like you're right beside the characters in the world of Pandora. Speaking of Pandora, the world building is absolutely remarkable. It expands our view of this amazing foreign planet. And as the name suggests, it focuses on the islands, oceans and reefs of Pandora. The aquatic plants and animals are majestic and gorgeously iridescent. The reefs and oceans are eye popping and staggering. Everything is so glowy and vivacious. If you thought the animation of the original film was awe-inspiring, wait until you watch this one! The animation is hyper-realistic. When looking closely, you can see the ultra-detailed textures of the characters and settings. The movement almost looks like it is from a cut scene of a video-game (it's honestly the best way I can describe it). Stephen Lang's performance as the Colonel is so powerful, and makes you hate his guts even more than you did in the first film. Sam Worthington as Jake and Zoe Saldaña as Ney'tiri seem to have developed even better chemistry than in the first movie.The message of this movie is to always fight to protect loved ones. This movie also has strong messages about the bonds with family and friends. Be forewarned that there is violence and violence involving animals.I give Avatar: The Way of Water 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This movie releases in theaters on December 16, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

He takes an unbelivable amount of time to show us the sons and daughters of Jake, their problems, their relations, their experiences. Love it. I enjoyed the dynamic of the familiy.The ocean is as great as the woods in the first film. The visuals are stunning, I liked the 3D. I felt a great need to learn more about the world and get deeper in it.Problem: The story. In my opinion, the basic conflict with the essential moments don't differ enough from the first part. The bad guys are more or less the same, the motivation is basically the same as well as the key moments resulting from it. I was emotionally not as much involved as in the first part. This resulted in less suspense and not so strong emotions. I'm really sad about that because it weakens the strong aspects i mentioned earlier. In the end, it feels like the weak story doesn't do the great world justice Still, a great piece of art and very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to part three.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Where is the Jake I met in the first movie? Lost, gone. Jake here was a jerk that I didn't want to watch, much less listen to. I disliked him completely. His family is not the happy place I expected when I first thought of him and Neytiri, no, they're awful together and they set the tone to the whole movie.The story itself wasn't intriguing, it didn't work. Didn't pull me in. I watched a bunch of kids fight on another planet with the exactly same enemy we got in the first movie. Couldn't they think of something else?The visuals were great, scenery really good, but I liked Neytiri's tribe better and the land around the Sacred Tree worked better than this terrible water tribe.

The world they have created is beautiful for sure. It draws you in. Its breathtaking in places. The imagination required to create the creatures etc is amazing. But we expected all that. Thats what this movie is. Thats what the first one was. This is largely more of the same.I found the jump from the last movie to this one, in terms of story, a little jarring. That said I very quickly grew to like to characters, predictable as some of the character developments are.It rolls along and certainly pulls at the heart strings in places.It is a bit slow paced, but I liked that. More time to enjoy the scenery. I enjoyed the story telling aspect. I liked the fact it had the time to simply let us watch things, like a creature swimming, without the need to rush off and cram more complex story in.All in all I thought it was great.

So it's safe to say that, for me, long cuts of just the characters exploring the beautiful world (with the fantastic job the CGI team did) is no problem at all.Furthermore, the characters from the first film are written perfectly in this new environment and I really enjoyed seeing how their lives had changed over the last 13 years.It's a slow paced film, a work of art that focuses on exploring the world and characters in detail, no rush. That's not to say there's no action, because there is, and some really good fight sequences too that had me holding my breath.On the whole, I absolutely loved this movie. It's similar to the original yes, but it's also new and exciting and emotional and so so beautiful. I think you just have to believe the pretext of the film, not get too nitpicky with plot details and just enjoy the ride. Of course it has faults, and the story is not the strongest, but as I said, if you are a fan of the first one, you need to watch this one. It was truly a magical experience to get absorbed into this story, one I didn't want it to end. Also, do go see the 3D version if you can, it's really well done and it's Avatar, I mean, come on.On the other hand, if you expect that every interaction will further the plot (it's slow paced, but it's not one of those films that feels like they drag on forever, the rhythm is really nice), dislike the sequences where the director explores the world, dismiss the Na'avi just because they are blue and are constantly complaining about long films, then don't even bother watching it and leaving a bad review for a film that's clearly not suited to your tastes.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

And this movie met them at every point which is why I give it a 10/10, I thought about giving it a 9/10 to not seem too generous, but this is how I truly felt once leaving the cinema.I saw the Movie in Imax 3D which took a minute to get used to, especially because I had to wear another pair of glasses underneath to see properly, but I soon became engulf into the beautiful water scenery and pandora world. I loved the bioluminescence of the first Avatar movie so I am glad to see it return. The animals of the oceans were stunning and I appreciated the intelligence and connection they had with the Metkayina clan. The 3 hours 20 min runtime didnt feel that long at all which was surprising and I managed to sit through without a toilet break.As for the storyline, the movie was all about family and doing whatever you can to protect it. The kids having to leave home and learn a whole new lifestyle parallels Jake Sullys journey to learn the way of the Omaticaya na'vi in the first movie. This was heartwarming, yet also filled with frustration as the kids often found themselves in trouble which I think a lot of people can relate to.A familiar villain returns with humans and now they planning to terraform pandora for human living as the earth is a dying planet. The amount of destruction and disregard for nature and wildlife displayed allows you to see they are doing the same thing to pandora. It made me reflect on how we as a whole treat our earth and wildlife.The action was incredibly executed and there were even a few jumpscares. I enjoyed the Pandoran sea animals joining in for a bit of action too. The ending moved me to tears which was slightly surprising because I never felt that emotional since the first movie.Personally, Avatar way of water is my favorite movie of this year, and I look forward to the next installment of the Avatar series.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Water scenes are something I have never seen before. True love letter to our ocean. ♥This films connects me with our own world and with all the destruction us humans did before and are still doing.I wish humans were more connected with the actual things that matter in this life and be less greedy and self centered.As for the story, there were some touching scenes within the family and also scenes of loss and pain which made it real.Action was also pretty entertaining, especially including some animal friends :DOverall, I give it 10, because I have enjoyed it. It is a nice continuation of the 1st film and I can't wait to see more. ♥Thank you all who have worked on this project.

The premise from the first film is certainly still there and god forbid this one would do anything unexpected.However, this time around we got some kids that we're supposed to care about. I guess that's usually effective? But I didn't care about a single character in the first Avatar movie and I care even less for these new ones. There are two brothers in particular who I find impossible to separate.I also simply don't understand why the humans have to be presented as solely bad when I thought they have a reasonable course for attacking Pandora? They also need a place to live and they're determined to prioritise themselves. But their desperation and will to survive is only presented by them being horrid people. However, this time it's only about revenge, revenge, revenge... It's certainly a movie that forces us to side with one side and convince us as clearly as possible who the bad guys are and who the good guys are.Yet another formulaic plot with pretty visuals and excessive music. This sequel has been in the works for 13 years and not once did it occur to anyone that maybe they could spend some of that time to actually give this one some depth and not just make it equally uninteresting as the first one?I didn't enjoy the first Avatar film and I sat down for three more hours of the same thing again. I can't even say I'm disappointed because I knew I wouldn't like this one either. I was really hoping to be surprised however... better luck in the next sequel I guess...","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Nothing was left to chance and everything was intentional.

However, time flew by, so I was never bored. The main characters are exceptionally courageous and endearing. And the plot is moving and surprising.In addition, the special effects are exceptionally mastered. We can imagine that different landscapes, and different creatures that we can see are real. You have an utterly immersive experience. That's true even more if you watch it in 3D. It's a visual revolution !Finally, this movie can touch all the generations. From children to grandparents Avatar represents an intergenerational film that we can watch to have an happy time with our family.In short, Avatar has the capacity to be a classic movie. I highly recommend Avatar. You definitely have to watch it !","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm a huge fantasy lover and this movie checks all the boxes. I love the story line and the fact that we get to meet other Pandora clans. The movie was really long, I will say that. I know a lot of people can't stay focused enough for that amount of time, especially in a theatre. I'm glad there are other movies to come because there is so much more to learn about that beautiful planetary moon. I hope we can meet even more clans in the next one. The movie also contains live action and real stunts! Sure, the blue people and the world of pandora was CGI, but everything else was as real as it could get. I will definitely watch it again. I do wish a certain individual would die already though lol. That plot is becoming repetitive. Then the movie can focus on the real problem; the human species trying to colonize and take control of Pandora. I kind of wish they focused a little more on the 16 years before the humans came back. They just skimmed through an important part. That's part off the reason why I was so excited about the sequel because Sully became a real Na'vi and not just an avatar. I wanted to see what his life would have been like. Aside from those negatives, this move is a great way to lose your mind in a fantasy, futuristic wonderland.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Pandora of course is Earth, the beauty of Pandora is the beauty of Earth in hyperbole, but still clearly recognizable. Unfortunately for Earth, most people on this planet behave like the sky people. So if you are rooting for the Na'ir, realize that in Cameron's view, you most likely are one of the bad guys. He picks up so many current issues, the dying of the coral reefs, the burning and destruction of our forests, the bestiality of whale hunting, the hunting and killing of elephants, rhinos, sharks and many other species for a single body part that is supposed to give us youth or virility. I'm sure I haven't captured all of them. The sentence 'Water has no beginning and no end.' is a very clear reference to the fact that pollution of our planet will inevitably affect us too.Reading the comments and complaints about a 'weak plot' or 'boring movie' makes me absolutely despair. How more obvious does he need to get before shallow viewers finally get the message? Our planet is burning, we destroy the very ecosystems that keep us alive, yet all people seem to care about is their personal entertainment.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Running on empty","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8864280/?ref_=tt_urv","trevorchamberlain-63352","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110016517/?ref_=tt_urv","10 February 2023","At the end of the trailer advertising Cameron's Avatar Way of the Water, the director declares the film is now open for business by saying ""let the nitpicking begin"" Now there is a sentence guarantied to rub any critic up the wrong way.Like Cleopatra that over priced blockbuster from the nineteen sixties, the new Avatar film cost so much to make, it has to do tremendously well just to brake even. Unlike Cleopatra which crawled into profit when it was finally sold to TV, this film is well on its way to profit and if Rotten Tomatoes is a guide, two third of reviews have been favorable, Way of the Water is a juggernaut and at three and a quarter hours you ether have to submit to it or be run over.I am not a professional critic and I am not nitpicking. But I declare that this is a rotten terrible film and it deserves to be taken apart and danced upon. It's critical and financial success is particularly painful because there are at least two more films awaiting completion with a fourth promised if all goes well. Which means a lack of story closure to a series of films that already feels dramatically and artistically squeezed dry.I have always thought the most important and long lasting impressions are made the moment we walk down the isle across the foyer, back into the real world. On leaving this picture I was less interested in saving the whales then I was going in.My second thought was that Way of the Water is overwhelmingly dependent upon America's deep rooted guilt over the European expansion, the cycle of destruction rolling over the Indian nations and the obliteration of wildlife and natural landscape for profit and greed. That humans are inherently incapable of stopping the self destruction is explored in another science-fiction film Planet of the Apes as Charlton Heston goes from damming humanity with faint praise to defending it's virtues before finally being confronted with the total sum of all it's endeavors . The ape society that Heston has crash landed into is a mirror image of everything that the counter culture thought was wrong with America. But Heston's chef tormentor Dr. Zaius knows and fears human nature. ""Man has always destroyed everything around him"".Nothing as complex is going on in The Way of the Water. It's not a exploratory allegory. Guilt is simply the fuel that the film runs on. It is tanked up on it. Even whale hunting is thrown into the mix simply to squeeze one last drop into the tin and that isn't the film's only act of desperation. Borrowing heavily, it reruns the tedious plot of its precuser with added whale juice. Cameron has also raided his own past from Aliens to The Abyss and The Titanic so the finished product feels more regurgitated then directed, Recently cinema has been feeding off the past incessantly. We have had three Planet of the apes, three Jurassic Worlds, two Ghostbusters, two Terminators, two Aliens, a shining, a Bladerunner another matrix. Twenty years later do we feel any real nostalgia for any aspect of Avatar as we do for say the Matrix. Perhaps Cameron is aware of this and that is why the film sweats so much to rehash it's self and our happier memories of his better films. There is after all a lot more riding on this film then just money and critical opinion. There is the future.Something else one takes away on leaving the cinema is that Cameron still has an intense love-hate relationship with the military unit. Cameron comes across as an intensely committed film maker. Working with Roger Colman all those years ago and fighting to get the first Terminator made has turned Cameron into a general who is prepared to work as hard as his troops, get it made, get it done but with passion. Along with that drive, Cameron has always had a vision of cinema that is always a little bit ahead of what the industry is capable off. Now he seems determined to pull that industry along with him, single handedly if necessary.Yet something has been lost over the distance of a life. Cameron was clearly fascinated by the Unorthodox family unit of mother, child and terminator, struggling to survive on the edge of society. One of the most convincing parts of The Abyss was the mature relationship of the married divers at the center of the story. Real world observations make the inner workings of fantasies click in a way that bloated budgets can not match. Cameron may care for the environment and for the choral seas but he can no longer relate that to an audience.He is also starting to disappear behind the curve. Take a look at the effects of The War for the Planet of the Apes where computer generated apes are folded seamlessly, using computer editing software, into shots that resemble the photography and camera set ups of a 1970s film (so that the medium hides the artifice). Now compare that to Way of the Water. Detailed and beautiful as it is, its still has the visual philosophy of a 1990s video game.Depressingly there is also a lack of vision. Stuck as we are in little more then a tedious 3 hour teenage drama it is worth remembering Brian Aldis wrote a science fiction book in the sixties called The Hot House, imagining a planet where tiny human beings have a symbiotic relationship with giant plants, living like aphids on a single rose. Becoming displaced they roam though a insect and plant ruled world before realizing their planet is in stasis against the sun, boiled on one side, frozen on the other. Aldis is blazingly imaginative through out. Eventually they travel on a silken thread woven by a giant spider that links a planet to it's moon. What about that for a film Mr Cameron.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

But from the moment this movie starts, it immediately grabs your attention and doesn't let go for well over three hours.From the plot, the story, the characters, and the overarching themes, everything worked to take you on a cinematic journey. This wasn't just some huge exposition dump either, the Way of Water took its time to explain the story and its relevance to what was happening to the Sullivan family. James Cameron did an amazing job of balancing fierce action with mundane and intimate moments that made this movie come together in a way that made sense. You learned to care for all the characters and understand, if not agree, with the decisions that they made through the story.The world of Pandora continues to be a visual delight to behold. At times I felt as if I was watching a documentary from National Geographic with just how breathtaking the shots of the animals and the environments were. Marvel should take notes, this film was a master class in how CGI can be used to enhance a story rather than be something that's distracting. The integration between the live action actors and the CGI characters were flawless and it felt as if the characters themselves were actual people rather than computer renderings.My only gripe was the fact that in some spaces certain scenes weren't allowed to breathe. For instance, something would happen, and the characters would only have a brief moment to reflect on what occurred before moving onto the next scene. I think that had a lot to do with James Cameron editing this movie in a way to accommodate the attention span of general audiences. However, I, at no point, felt as if I was watching a three hour movie unlike so many other movies that have come out in recent years that felt like complete chores to get through.All in all, this was a fascinating story, and one that I am invested in seeing play out over the next 3 to 4 films. If you're looking for a visual delight, an amazing story, and relatable characters, then this is a film that you should definitely check out.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Although there is no clear story, the movie is mighty!!! Advice, experience it in the cinema, biggest possible screen ,because it is an amazing visual experience! For me, this is the best ""visual"" cinematic experience after ""1917"". The movie is really worth the 192 minutes and the ticket money you spendThe movie's only drawback is that there is no story that draws you in, engages you in the atmosphere of the movie, attaches you to the characters, and moves your feelings! And the events are semi-predictable! Despite the weakness of the story, the movie has some good feelings and a comfortable ending.I don't know if this is intended by the movie or not, but I personally received a message from the movie entitled:
I can't save my family by running away!In terms of the story, if I rate it out of 10, I would give it a 5, or maybe less, had it not been for my love for the end of the movie. But the movie is 10/10 in terms of fun and visual creativity, very creative visually. 8/10 in terms of characters, acting, dialogues, music, etc...In general, the film proved to me something I was previously convinced of, that films can be powerful without telling stories, but only on condition that messages are delivered! My overall rating for the movie is 9/10, for the fun in it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

James Cameron. What happened here? You have some staff firing to do.... maybe even fire yourself for this one if you have to.Artists and graphics staff - On point 100%
Stunning beautiful yes. All credit to them.Everyone else - Absolute garbage.Let me start off by saying that the acting of the kids and youth is absolutely pathetic.Dialogue of youth and main characters is barf worthy.... if you are an intellectual, hell. Even a decently smart individual, the dialogue will make you cringe. Think ""Bruh"" ""Cuz"" ""Dude"" What is this doing in a movie that is supposed to be mystical and magical?The actor that plays Spider is the worse offender. He doesn't know how to act at all. How did he end up on this movie? This young actor must be a child of James Cameron's friends or something.I was crying and wanting to go into fetal position at some point. Animal and wildlife cruelty is an ongoing part of this story plot. And although this is a real world problem ... it needs real solutions and motivation to empower people who love the planet to take action.As a strong animal and wildlife activist.This movie made me feel small and belittled
The native people of Avatar forest and islands are portrayed as ignorant and buffoon like. They want to fight back but have no plan and ""leadership"" doesn't lead the people. Big influences like big screen directors need to help empower people now and future generations to stand against wildlife and animal cruelty. To educate on real solutions. Even if it is fiction. Fiction can still instill real life lessons. Not this. This is humiliating.I cried in one scene because the animal massacre was full blown and nobody could actually help. Avatar people are hissing and bickering amongst themselves while mass massacre takes place.I don't agree that Jake Sully kept his last name in his new home as a new species. To me this portrays white heroism. His character as a white male of privilege was shown to be entitled and causing more problems than solutions yet people still followed him.He didn't better the species. This movie was just a real doozy. So tragically sad.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Naturally there was a need to introduce entire new generation of characters to keep the franchise going. There are 2 strong characters from new generation.But you don't go to avatar for story.

Since it was a little drawn out and the pacing only got better when the A and B plots converged.

It's not quite as bad as Marvel's CGI, but is still too much in 2023. I cannot recommend anyone watch this. I'm actually amazed this project was green-lit with such poor writing.

You get to learn more about them as characters and get interested in their roles for the later movies. You feel their deep bond.

It was worth it.The storyline is not necessarily unique - even to the previous version - though it does not have to be. When compared to the factory that is Hollywood nowadays it stands out as a gem of how far technology has come and how enjoyable it is to see these visuals on the screen. Honestly, I don't understand the bad reviews. As if a unique story is the only thing that matters in a movie. I would argue that most, if not all, movies have a predictable act-structure and storyline. Especially of those only available via streaming services.With Avatar I was positively glued to the screen as the beautiful, and sometimes predictable, scenes are played out. I could understand and appreciate the long runtime as the movie includes utterly breathtaking exposition. Absolutely worth your time.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Indeed, the Avatar saga in general is a masterpiece but not of cinema, it's a masterpiece for the effects but if we have to talk about cinema let's say that there is better on the market. Avatar 2 is spectacular for the eyes but does not leave the magic that the first chapter had left, with this I am not saying that it is not a beautiful film, on the contrary, in my opinion it simply does not deserve all this success. It's a normal science fiction film with an above average budget that tries to surpass the first chapter but fails in its intent, at this point I wonder if it's worth seeing another 2 chapters of this saga that focuses only on the visual aspect and little about a functional plot construction. Without making too many spoilers this film leaves too many question marks, this is a marketing move that works but you have to ask yourself :""how much longer are we willing to wait to get all the answers?"". Finally I want to say that as a film it is very, very beautiful, I admit that in one particular scene I cried, but surely the collection it is making is excessive in my opinion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is some wooden acting, some pointless dialogue and an overly long run time. The CG looks a little cartoonish at times, but overall, Pandora looks beautiful - but that's not enough to make a movie.One final complaint: the green water Na'vi are kind of ugly.

But Avatar: The Way of Water is as great as it's predecessor, Avatar. The formula works very well. We are introduced to the next generation of Sullys, each with their own distinct, and sometimes quirky, personality; a new group of N'avi, who are sea dwellers; and some amazing new animals in sea and air, etc. We also have a familiar bad guy, with his loyal and dysfunctional henchmen, stirring the pot and making life difficult and dangerous for everyone. Nevertheless it is an emotionally charged and super exciting adventure, with great actors and acting and a thrilling plot.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I watched it an unnecessary amount of times in theatres when it came out 13 years ago. Hearing about the 2nd one finally coming out, after what felt like a billion years, I was very skeptical and scared that it wasn't going to live up to the hype I had for it.This hype had been building for 13 years and I can say it was just about everything I could've hoped for. The characters, although many, were fleshed out enough to make me really feel for them. Maybe it's just the sap in me but I cried a few times during the movie. That's how connected I was to the characters and their own concerns, fears, and relationships with one another.If you compare it to the first movie I think you are going to disappoint yourself. The first movie had all the makings for a standalone movie. All the elements were there to make it a very strong movie. The second is just that. A second movie. It has the elements of a second, middle part of a trilogy or however then end up doing it. But even then it was just phenomenal.I loved it. I'm afraid my top 3 movies of all time are going to be avatar movies.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Well maybe in part because I've been so starved for movies that just want to entertain. You can sit down and be transported to another place for a while and just enjoy the ride. Cameron and crew obviously were passionate about making this movie well and wanted to be there for more than just cash. He could have phoned in a crappy sequel years ago but didn't. Big respect for him and his cast. I'm glad they've made their budge back and more.The visuals are stunning. Everything has obviously been crafted with care. You can tell that many of the stunts including underwater work were actually done instead of the much less convincing 100% CGI'ing it. Unfortunately I think it will lose some impact on the small screen, but on the large screen in 3D it blew me away. I know it's unlikely, but it'd be amazing to have it brought back to the theaters in a few years. I'd see it again and I know I'm not the only one.The storyline is where things will get a bit more divisive. I kind of feel like they could have introduced a new ""big bad"", but given the length of time since the last movie I can see why they cast the person they did and if you forget about some of the potential plot holes it opens up then it works ok. Spider isn't used to the best of what his character could have been. Nyteri seems oddly hostile towards all humans considering she had a family with one. Some of the decisions in the film were purely there to move the plot along rather than be deep and thoughtful. It's not that the writing is bad, it just could have been better. I did like the theme around protecting your family. No frills or subverted expectations there. Just the story of parents trying to keep their family safe at any cost. (Even if the methods of doing so are sometimes questionable and not always right.)Onto the main thing that divides people's opinions. The nature documentary! Honestly, I loved this part of the movie. I can see why people don't (you get this distinct break from action flick to ocean explorer) but for me it was just the kind of escapism I was looking for. In all seriousness, if Cameron wants to start making mock nature documentaries on other worlds, I'd been there for that!Anyway, if you've seen the first one, you probably know the level of storytelling to visuals to expect and whether that's going to be your thing or not. Personally I'd say this was the most enjoyable movie I've watched in a long time. Will be there for part 3.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

But somehow it was better. I went to see the film at the cinema almost 2 weeks ago, in 3D. I'm still amazed by the visual effects. The most beautiful film I've ever seen and my new favorite. I am going to the cinema this week again, just to see this film. I'm obsessed. The story goes deeper and slower, making you more absorbed in the film. You feel like you are in it yourself, you even want to join in. With each new scene, I was surprised. There are several reviews that say the story is much like the first one, but I don't think so. After 13 years, you had a certain expectation, a battle that would continue. It met my expectation, even more so. The film doesn't have an extreme climax, which I actually like. I'm looking forward to the next one, but I didn't leave the cinema with a desperate feeling of wanting to know how the story continues. This film is a must watch.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yes the 3h+ runtime can be off putting but I did not feel that the film was slow at any point. The movie flowed well (no pun intended) and had a good mix of heart and quality action. The final third of the film was a joy to watch and was well done. All the characters were well played and additive to the story with the younger avatars being the stars of the show. My only nitpick would be why do these people have to be avatars? I feel like this movie would be the same or better if they were humans instead of Eiffel 65's hit song. I would recommend going to see in the theatres just to experience the world of pandora as it was intended.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The other half had an overly simple, average plot.There were even a couple major plot holes and I also thought it was hard to reconnect with what happened in the first Avatar movie. Understanding the crux of the first movie is quite important to understanding the setup of the second one, and it felt like they could have added more explanation given that the first one came out 13 years ago. Maybe read a quick recap before going in.I'm also not too sure how they'll have several follow-up movies from a plot perspective but I could be proven wrong. With all that said, probably still go watch it though, since it has the best graphics you'll ever see on a movie.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Amazing begin with a beautiful sing to face to you happy moments of the Jake's family for change dramatically to something horribleAct 2:
This is definitely the best part of the movie.This movie talk to you from the screen to your heart to let you simply, ordinary but beatiful fellings About natureAct 3:
So sad a little bit heavy for the hours you got watching the movie but beatiful, horrible and shockingConclusion:

It keeps on switching back and forth between 24FPS and 48FPS, and truly makes the whole theatre experience worthy.

The character development as well is incredible, especially for some of our new protagonists. And don't get me started on the visual effects oh, my God, they are INCREDIBLE!!

The only one that held any weight for me was the ""a boy and his whale aka tulkun storyline"". The whale named Payakan is by far the most interesting character. I also liked Spider since he made the fewest irritable decisions. The rest of the characters fell flat for me. Although not boring, I found myself becoming impatient, but then Cameron keeps distracting me with something pretty.

It's as if someone took the first movie, mixed in Jaws, Fast and Furious, and the OG Predator, then sprinkled in the entirety of sci-fi tropes. Everything is predictable, so even though it was truly beautiful to see, I become more and more upset as the movie went on. You can even predict the musical stings. There were no clever twists. Ms. Saldana played the only character that had any kind of redeeming qualities. Let me be clear, the acting was good. If you don't want to think too hard about what's going on, this movie could be for you. Otherwise you will not be able to help yourself from picking up all the numerous plot holes and character inconsistencies. 8/10 for acting, 9/10 for special effects, 0/10 for story.

In other words: Technology and visual effects alone don't make a movie! You need to tell a story!In this mess barely anything makes sense and the dialogue is so atrocious it makes even people from non-English speaking countries cringe. ""Hey bro! I got you bro! Watch it bro!""
Is this how alien species from a fantasy world talk in Cameron's imagination? Or is this how James Cameron likes to talk, therefore he makes his actors imitate him? Kinda like everyone talks like Tarantino in a Tarantino movie or like Tommy Wisaeu in 'The Room'.There's so much more I could say about this mess, but it's been said already by other people. This movie is objectively bad. You can like it as much as you want, but it's a nonsensical mess.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

First of all this movie is not good enough to make that much money. Secondly it's just mathematically impossible. You have to spend $100 million on your own ticket, or corporate spent a billion and 4/5 come and let you spend the rest. Hollywood thinks you listen to anything they say. They think you're stupid. Since their mainstream media whatever they say goes in your mind that's what they think. Are you really going to go for that? It took Star wars A New Hope, 3 years at three dollars a ticket back in the day, to be the biggest legitimate box office success in the world.

Over a decade since he changed the world of filmmaking forever, James Cameron finally releases the first sequel he promised us years ago.Before I even get into the film, I just have to share my amazement that it actually exists. I remember going to see the original, it was an event. I was about 10, and even though I had no clue who Jim Cameron was, I knew there was weight behind it. Afterwards, I remember my mom reading an article talking about the planned sequels, and how the first was gonna be a bit of a wait, coming out in the far off year of 2014! (To a ten year old in 2009, that was an eternity away). As the years passed, I grew to believe it was just a what if, something we could all imagine, but probably wouldn't actually see come to life. I'm so happy to say I was wrong.Let's start with the obvious, what we're all here for, and what the film really exists for, the visuals. This film, has the greatest effects I have EVER seen. Bar none. It was real, you were looking at the images a camera captured of a real world. At no moment did it feel like I was ever looking at something created on a computer. And the closer the camera got, the more scrutiny they put on the shot, the better it looked. Any close up of a face, a hand. It didn't have that sheen or gloss that some cg has, it was just real. The way the light moved across skin, water splashing up and down someone half submerged. Every single detail.The stand out of course, is the water. Every single underwater scene was astounding. The first time we got to explore the world below the surface, my jaw hit the floor. It was like planet earth on a whole other planet! Living, breathing creatures that felt completely alive. It was true movie magic.The story is simple, as with the original, but it works. Within minutes I felt right back at Pandora, with Jake and Neytiri, and their new family. It was as if no time had passed from the original. Felt like returning home.And while the story is simple, it's filled with richly drawn characters and and a deep, beautiful world. The characters have depth, goals, aspirations. Their personal stories and struggles that we can relate to. Plus, the film beautifully shows the connection between all living things on Pandora. The relationships between the Na'vi and the animals of the planet is one of the main focuses and biggest strengths of the film, and it all leads into the grand, thrilling, and emotional finale.Is it a perfect film? No, of course not. It's got some things here and there you could nitpick, and it's definitely only the start of the story, but as a first entry in this unbelievably long awaited batch of sequels, it manages to satisfy me enough to appreciate the film on it's own, while leaving me excited to see the story continue and what comes next!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, this movie has neither. The story is all over the place, and you have to create your own storyline to fill in the missing pieces. Most of the dialogue is predictable and does not move the very thin plot along. It seems like the CGI was done first, and then pieced together to make a story.Visually entertained you will be, remembering this film you will not.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There was a lot to be desired but I felt that was on purpose considering there are plans for more movies. The main things that are breath taking in this movie are 1) effects and 2) world building. There is a lot of world building in this that does sometimes take away from the story at hand and the story is pushed along a bit faster because of how much time is spent looking at effects and world building. The story in my opinion is nothing to be hated, but nothing to be adored either. I'm not sure what everyone is looking for but if you're looking for a break from all the Marvel, Star Wars Disney B. S then this is a great film to escape with. Honestly it checked most of my boxes for a good movie. Everyone else who said it was bad, I'm honestly curious what you say a good film is. I feel some of the reviews here are pretty harsh concerning the story and characters.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, the shortcoming of this film is that the narrative about the main character's family is too flat at the beginning, which makes people feel a little sleepy, and after watching it, I feel the plot is very strange. The narrative of human beings in this film is undoubtedly a failure, and there is no convincing reason for the audience to explain why human weapons are so fragile. I kind of understand that it's necessary for the plot of the movie, but I can't fool myself that this is really a weapon that humans will have 100 years from now. I also understand that Cameron wants to use this film to describe the growing up of the children, as a way to move forward into the third film. But the problem is that the family part is really boring. I gave this movie an 8 for the special effects (which are amazing in IMAX), but it's not really worth it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A masterpiece such as this franchise can take all the time they want. It actually feels relatable or mundane, to take the movie bit by bit. It's just like how it is in real life, no?Amazing visuals as always. This movie made me miss the white sands and blue seas.

The drama and emotional connections to the characters in this film are much deeper than the first.Take a step into the dreamlike oceanic world that Cameron has created with an open mind because it's a beautiful sight and an incredibly exciting ride.All Cameron fans will catch a lot of self referential moments as well. This is going to smash in the box office. Those 3 hours flew by and I'll be back to see it in a month once I've had some time to digest.

James Cameron is known for getting the optimum out of his cast and crew. All the actors came up with brilliant performances. Jakes Sully standout by showing variations in expressions and emotions. He maintained the same intensity to make an impact. Zoe Saldana, Clif Curtiss, and Kate Winslet blended with him to elevate the scenes with their performances. The actors who played the roles of their children brought in good emotions to complete the story.Technical values :
Technically, Avatar-The Way of Water is outstanding. Right from VFX to graphics work everything looks captivating. The 3D effects are stunning and they are not just for the sack of publicity. Each 3D shot has proper research and reason.The Pandora world created is just amazing and is presented superbly deep underwater. Technical brilliance is visible in each and every shot throughout the film.The background score composed by Simon Franglen is arresting and elevates the mood of the film nicely. The photography work by Russell Carpenter is nice. His work registers despite the film having more graphics.The collective editing work done by Stephen E. Rivkin, David Brenner, John Refoua and James Cameron is effective. The production design is stunning and so is the case with the production values Lightstorm Entertainment and TSG Entertainment. For the audience who are watching the Telugu version, the Telugu dialogues written by Srinivas Avasarala elevate the emotional depth of the film decently.The second installment from the creative genius James Cameron's cinematic universe, Avatar has high making standards. Alongside the magical setup and fictional premise created, Avatar-The Way of Water addresses elements like social equality, civilization and takes a strong anti-military stand.The underlying theme of the film that showcases parents protecting their children and vice versa is conveyed beautifully during the ending portions. On the flip side, the main drawbacks of the film are the thin storyline and lengthy runtime. To summarize, Avatar 2 is a greater cinematic experience that deserves to be watched on Imax 3D screen to witness the grandeur.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The script is fairly terrible, the acting is relatively fair, and the screenplay is uneven and uninspired. The plot is essentially the same as the first 'Avatar', but you don't really care about any of the characters this time around. The requisite battle scenes are there and they are, of course, majestic. Lots of whooping and hissing.The movie is weighed down by what amounts to about two hours of filler: it's Avatars being pretty Avatars. There are many, MANY lengthy segments that don't feel like they have anything to do with the plot; They make you feel like you are watching a nature documentary with killer special effects.Formulaic and predictable, but definitely pretty to look at.

The CGI in this movie is so great that it looks completely real. Pandora is still magical. While the story here is nothing oscar-worthy, it is good, even if it does have problems.

I enjoyed both avatar movies because of their simple but emotionally effective stories with jaw dropping visuals. And that's ok. It's good to have a movie where you can just be immersed in the world and in awe of the visuals. It's relaxing to see how incredible the water looks on a big screen. This is the type of movie where the cinema experience transcends just sitting in a chair and staring at a screen. Way of water lets the audience get lost in it's world for three hours straight. Pure escapism. I wouldn't want it any other way.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Perhaps because the background culture of the Pandora's inhabitants are primitive tribes hence they are more simple-minded people. This movie is basically a continuation of war between the native and conqueror, force of nature and enhanced technology. No strategy and politics.With the superb CGI technology and breath-taking action scenes, this movie is a spectacular ride despite of the plot.

The last fight is also boring, you can imagine the ending like the first one. There are also great flaws as so many aliens can speak English so fluently. In the last one it is understandable as some were taught. Also why it is so important for the 'Sky People' to revenge on one single person with a whole squad instead of finding way to migrate/invade the planet.

Something that also stood out are the beautiful visual effects that in my point of view seemed so real throughout the film. Something that I kind of didn't like is that in both movies (avatar 1 and 2) a different story is told but with the same enemy, I hoped that this new story could change that, but I come back and say the story seemed very good to me. In conclusion, the movie is enjoyable and very good, it met all my expectations and left me eager to see another Avatar movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, the Resources Development Administration (RDA), returns to Pandora to colonize the planet and the natives and they bring Recombinants, avatars with implanted memories of deceased military, and their leader is Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Soon Quaritch and his Recombinants capture Jake's children in the woods, but Jake and Neytiri release them. However, their friend Spider (Jack Champion), who is Quaritch's son raised by the scientists in Pandora, is captured by his father. Jake decides to leave his people to let them safe and move with his family to the island where the sea people, the Metkayina clan, live. He asks for sanctuary and Chief Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) welcomes Jake and his family. However, their children have adaptation problems with some youngsters, but they resolve the situation after a period with them. When Kiri has a heath problem, Jake calls his friends Norm (Joel David Moore) and Max Patel (Dileep Rao) to help her, but Tonowari's wife Ronal (Kate Winslet) uses her abilities to save Kiri. Quaritch tracks their aircraft and now is torturing people from the archipelago to tell the whereabouts of Jake and his family.""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a visually stunning film by James Cameron. The plot is a sequel of the 2009 movie, with basically the same characters. The screenplay could be shorter since 3 h 12 min running time is too much, but the action is good, and the film is not tiresome. The deceptive part is Spider saving the Recombinant of his cruel father, only to have a sequence. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Avatar: O Caminho da Água"" (""Avatar: The Way of Water"")","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the intervening years, even as Cameron updated his plans for the sci-fi spectacle and teased bold new advances in filmmaking technology to make his follow-up movie, people began asking if anyone still cared about the ""Avatar"" world that took the all-time box office crown back in 2009. No matter the filmmaking force of Cameron, or the ensemble cast he built, or the stunning visuals he crafted, the doubts persisted. They persist even now, with just days to go until the sequel is finally released.But few filmmakers in history have ever been able to manage spectacle, expectation, and pure craft quite like James Cameron, the Oscar-winning mind behind ""Avatar,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Aliens,"" and more. Even when the deck is stacked against him, Cameron seems to be able to overcome the odds through pure, ineffable movie magic. It's fitting, then, that ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is the story of a family overcoming the odds to keep fighting, and that Cameron has poured an entire decade of energy and cinematic inertia into telling that story. So put aside your doubts, because one of cinema's great blockbuster artists is back, and he's delivered a film so packed with spectacle that even the original ""Avatar"" pales in comparison.Just as much time has passed in the world of the films as in our real world when ""The Way of Water"" opens, which means Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) have spent the last decade-plus living in relative peace, building a family in the forests of Pandora that includes sons Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), daughter Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), and adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver).But the peace can't last. A new human invasion force has arrived on Pandora, including the revived Avatar form of Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), Jake's mortal enemy from the first film, who will stop at nothing to kill Jake and his entire family, even if it means burning the entire forest to the ground. So, Jake and Neytiri reluctantly pack up their kids and flee their home in favor of Pandora's oceans, where they must learn a new way of life among the reef clans, and pray that Quaritch doesn't find them.With a runtime stretching to more than three hours, Cameron makes sure to pack much more plot into ""The Way of Water"" than this basic arc, from the inclusion of a strange human stray who runs with the Sully children to the culture and rituals of the reef clans themselves. It's a dense film, packed with story and worldbuilding, but there's also a sense that Cameron is taking some extra space to luxuriate in is world this time around. The first ""Avatar"" had the advantage of using Jake as a point-of-view character, a human in a Na'vi body discovering the wonders of Pandora for the first time. In ""The Way of Water,"" through the Sully children, we get to experience that again as they learn what an entirely different ecosystem on their planet looks and feels like, and it's even more wondrous than the first film.This is thanks, in part, to advances in the technology used to render Pandora as realistically as possible, which gives us jaw-dropping shots of strange alien whales moving through oceans, and stunning details like the way CGI feet move in sand or the way water drips off a lock of hair. But this isn't just a movie generated by computers. Cameron's steady, often whimsical hand is at play in every shot, as he frames the wonderland of Pandora with the skill of a master, building all the necessary pieces for the dramatic arc of this film, then setting them firmly in place for a third act that then explodes all of it in a dazzling showcase of action that rivals just about anything he's ever done anywhere else in his career. The first two-thirds of the film will leave you in awe, but the last third will blow you through the back wall of the theater.All this, plus a renewed focus on the potential emotional depth in the story, and the earnestness of the ensemble cast led by Worthington and Weaver, makes ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" a truly awe-inspiring time at the movies. It's a film that was very much worth the wait, and a reminder that James Cameron remains a blockbuster icon.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can remember thinking that it was the coolest thing I had ever seen!I honestly had never seen anything quite like it before?To be honest, at the time, I don't think anyone had!But I never once thought that their would be a sequel 13 years later...
Avatar The Way of Water is truly phenomenal!Bigger, surprisingly better and more emotional than the first...
This sequel is to no one's surprise; visually breathtaking, visceral and incredibly engrossing!The story, the spectacle, the spirituality, the sheer beauty...
This is filmmaking and storytelling at it's very best!To no one's surprise, Avatar The Way of Water pushes CGI and visual storytelling to new places we've never seen before onscreen, and uses the word 'Family' more than any Fast and Furious film...
While some of the new characters are underutilised, Pandora is once again the star of the show.It's miraculously realised, the underwater stuff is just glorious and the final act is full of mind blowing action!James Cameron's level of perfectionism translates to the audience; the details of every frame are precise and I can't help but wonder how on Earth he has done that?With every pulse and vibration from the active non-stop pictures onscreen, to every thump of heartbeat and every resurfacing bubble of air, and from every fall of raindrops and rumbles of thunder to the crashes of waves and splashes of wings and tails, The Way of Water reveals a triumphant return to Pandora, but this time Pandora is way more blue and beautiful...Overall, James Cameron has once again crafted a visual masterpiece, with the most impressive CGI I have ever seen!The dense foliage of Pandora's lush jungles and the hyper realistic water effects are honestly a sight to behold.I found myself gawking at the insane level of detail in every single frame, and I could not believe my eyes...
The work that went into the characters though, is what truly blew my mind!The expressiveness in their eyes, the subtle details in their skin and the way they move for CG characters that felt as real as any of the human actors in the film...
This is arguably the definitive theatrical experience of 2022!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It feels like a film which has no idea what it is, carelessly assembled from individual scenes that add very little to one another. Take each piece of the quilt on its own and they are not bad, some are even good. Taken as a whole you will find yourself asking the same question repeatedly: Why do I care? At many points it is obvious how James is trying to advance the story, you can see and understand the reasoning behind decisions. It is done so clumsily, though, that you are never engaged in a well crafted story, you just see the component parts of an attempt at one.As far as spectacle goes, this film has plenty. You can tell they spent a quarter of a billion on it. By the time three hours is up the novelty will have worn off.","13 out of 20 found this helpful.

When I saw the first movie, I thought it was a masterpiece that couldn't be outdone - until NOW.This one focused on family, something we are sorely missing in today's society, and yes, I mean the nuclear family, with a mother, father, and children. We are so focused on family being whatever we want it to be, which is fine by most of society, but a father and mother is integral to the success of a family - sorry, not sorry.It was a VERY long movie and quite intense, but there were a lot of morals to learn from it.Well done, Cameron, very well done, indeed.And yes, there is another sequel in the works, but hopefully, we won't have to wait another 13 years to see it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a movie you have to go watch on a big screen and if possible in 3D.Regarding the story I was awaiting a bigger and more into your face blockbuster story. But Cameron did give us a very small scale story here focusing on Jacks family instead. So the fight in the end is much smaller in scale compared to even the first movie. I was not expecting that. But what he shows is really well made and incredible to look at but finally feels like a mixture of his other films, like ALIENS, TERMINATOR and even TITANIC. Not a bad thing and with AVATAR 3 coming up maybe a good decision to not show us the BIG fight already. Instead we get a good story of Jacks new family, learn about the new kid characters and can dive into this new world to catch fire and burn for more too come.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jake Sully was exponentially better in this movie than the last. The hard ass dad personality he took on was very appropriate given his backround. I have so much respect for Zoe saldana as well because even though she was sidelined, her relationship between the kids and Jake was a great change between her personality in the first movie. I did not like spider though, although the concept was cool, I did not really dig the performance or his ever-changing personality. The fight scenes were a treat and much better than movies whose sole purpose is dedicated to the action.

I can't imagine how on earth James has been able to pull this incredible saga of the Avatars. Na'vi people are inspiring, living in an amazing life, full of content and respect for the nature surrounding them be it the forest ones or sea ones. A quite clear and meaningful message this story gives us, as a mankind, to love nature, family and then self. Here the usual villain (sky people) representing humans have been ridiculed again (continued from part 1) for their ignorance towards love of nature and their brainless conquest for Amrita ( this is truly inspired from the Hindu mythology Amrita is the nectar for Hindu gods to remain ageless).There are few parts definitely like the underwater playful scenes which could have been reduced, but I guess it was to build the bond with the viewers immersing into the pandora pleasure. For me even this was a pleasure and I felt fine to spend a few more minutes enjoying the unimaginable world and it's beautiful creatures. Overall I think it is a 9 out of 10 because of the experience and the message it gives, the 1 point I could not give it is for the drags it had during the climax, but definitely feel it's a one time watch for everyone. But for me I would love to immerse into the water and explore those Islands some more times and can watch part 2 more than twice.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sully has married a Na'vi and fathered a family. When their forest world is threatened, they must move to the ocean world and try to survive, but...... There is not one fresh idea in this purple,yellow, green and blue flourescent world. The story element is derived from films like 'Last of the Mohegans', 'Waterworld','Dances with Wolves', Finding Nemo', 'Moana' ' How to Train Your Dragon' ""Fern Gully' and 'Fee Willy'. The CGI and 'motion capture' FX are state of the art even if the lurid colors look like a child's first grade Dayglow painting. There are also some 'new age' platitudes and plenty of environmental babble to placate the leftist global warning cultists. The character development is, well 'surely you cant be serious' the action moves like a snail stuck on a wad of chewing gum, and the violence is, well violent. The underwater sequences obviously cost a fortune to film but even they look flat and listless. There is no sense of humor , not even any good one liners. The only scenes that have some merit are the waterborne military vehicles pictured in an ominous gray. In essence ,its a standard 90 minute action film without much action stretched into a 3 hour plus ass and bladder buster .Its like being on the Disney 'Na'Vi River Adventure ride for an eternity. You'll be satisfied in half an hour if you can contend with the excess. A truly mediocre movie designed for non discriminating multiplex morons and franchise film freaks. Another P.

The spiritual essence of the first Avatar film remains, and the character relationships in the film feel genuine, although there is quite a bit of loose ends left to definitely entice for an Avatar 3.The subplot consists of a teenage Na'avi coming of age story, as Jake Sulley's son finds his own sense of belonging in a new clan much like Jake did. He finds a spark of romance, a creature to bond with, and a difficult relationship to resolve, this time with his father as he is second son who is too often stepping out of line. The character journey feels familiar, but it is different. And there is the sense that much lies ahead for the character in any additional film, probably as the franchise's new protagonist.And a good move too, as with the film's heavy CGI use it sounds feasible to expect another lengthy wait time. And as Avatar 1 and 2 makes clear, an aging cast puts some constraint on how long the movie takes, as there was some de-aging special effects going on. If it takes another number of years, perhaps it's for the best to involve a new cast.While Avatar 2 sort of feels like two different projects merged into one (the sequel to the first film, and the basis for a third or an offshoot film), it is still a James Cameron film, and has classic moments within it. There's the merciless mechanical action like on Terminator, then claustrophobic sinking ship sequences like on Titanic. Some snappy one-liners, ethereal music, and of course, an ending credits pop song...I did also see this movie in an imax 3D movie theater with 3D glasses. That was a fun and immersive experience as there's lot of swimming fish, burning embers, some holographic screens, etc. Nice but not absolutely necessary.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Cinemetographically it is a masterpiece, beautiful. Every scene has some meaning. Seems like the first movie James Cameron knew he got everyone's attention and this one after a brief 20+ min recap of the first movie is entirely original, every scene has meaning.The main theme of the movie is a comparison of tribal humanity with modern society. It compares and contrasts western medicine, ideology, and purpose.The second main theme under that is the combating of the cognitive dissonance of modern society. On one hand we are destroying our planet, poisoning ourselves, and killing our persons. On the other, striving for betterment and simply more.The movies general feeling is that of being in Nature. There is also a magnificent analogy that takes place the last 45 minutes discussing the path to end this cognitive dissonance. A masterpiece. The 3rd and 4th are planned and will be an important cultural influencer changing the mentality of our relationship to our planet and even has the power to push the society to fix its idiosyncrasies in our relationship to our planet, the earth.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Painfully sensational was the first film of the now newly minted franchise, where four sequels are already announced in the series at once.The plot unfolds many years after the events of the first part. Jake Sully lives with his family on the planet Pandora. Peaceful life could not remain that way simply because the colonizing people could not leave the Navi planet without attention after the defeat. Actually, the start of the film shows how the conquerors arrive on Pandora again.The plot immediately raised several questions for me. Some decisions of the main characters look dubious at all. However, it seems that neither the writers nor Cameron himself were confused by the obvious weaknesses of the story. They simply follow the plot, intending to tell, and, most importantly, to show their plans. Good. We accept their rules and begin to enjoy the splendor of the picture. The visual component is the main decoration of this work. Actually, this is the best thing in the movie. This is the main attraction for the viewer. Technology has taken another step into the future. Cameron is ahead of the planet in this regard. His fantasy world is so detailed that already in the first third of the picture you realize that you are not just looking at computer-drawn characters and surroundings. They're real in front of you. The characters are so realistic. Drawn to the smallest detail. It's really very impressive. The Oscar for visual effects in 2023 went into the hands of the visual masters absolutely deservedly.It is also worth noting that the actions of the characters are dynamic and interesting. Although the script is sometimes predictable, the characters' phrases are often clumsy, but do not limit the overall impression of the picture. There are a lot of fights, shootouts and, of course, flying and floating creatures against the background of the amazing beauty of the water. Cameron wasn't lying when he promised a lot of underwater and surface scenes. It looks amazing. It is also worth noting the excellent musical component. The sound is at a height, it keeps pace with the development of the plot and complements the perception of the picture.The film will introduce a lot of new characters. At first, their abundance even makes you confused, but closer to the middle you can easily understand who is who and who has what kind of relative. The heroes are good, the antagonists also perform at the proper level. It's really interesting to watch the development of the plot. There are themes of the struggle between good and evil, the theme of revenge, the theme of fathers and children, the theme of friendship and betrayal. The creators skillfully saturate their film with all possible twists and turns so that the viewer cannot get bored.Of course, I didn't get the ""Wow"" effect. The first picture was much more revolutionary for its time. You already expect something like this from the second film, so you perceive the picture more restrained.In general, ""Avatar 2: The Way of Water"" is a high-quality motion picture that will not only please fans of the first part, but also all people interested in science fiction. The film is not inferior to the first part in beauty and scale, it is ready to open a new huge world of the distant planet Pandora. And this world is amazing, it shows how diverse and large-scale this planet is. And you catch yourself thinking that you rather want to see the continuation of this story. Entertainment, drama, scale - everything is on top. And this is definitely worth seeing for yourself.9 out of 10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

James Cameron once again made a magnificent movie. Before it started I was ready that the movie will be too long because it's hard to keep the attention during 3h+ but at the end I wa so surprised it was already finish. Because the pictures are so beautiful you stay focus during all the movie very easily, you have too many fish too analyse too many mountains and all the little detailed in the screen keep you alert.For the plot at the start I was a little disappointed because it's not very original but I forget quickly because u get caught with the emotion of the characters.I felt the same Magick when I watched first avatar as a kid.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But after watching it yesterday, thank God, all what I was afraid of has gone far far way.In Avatar The Way of Water, everything deserves praise. The visual and sound effects, cinematography, soundtrack, use of colors, performances of the cast (especially Worthington, Saldana, and Lang), addition of the water world and Metkayina clan, action sequences, direction, screenplay, and emotional weight, all deserve praise in every sense of it.What deserves praise also is that the movie had no boring minute, even if its runtime is 192 minutes. On the contrary, I wished that the movie was longer.Regarding the flaws, the only thing that I criticized in Avatar The Way of Water is the story because from my point of view, it wasn't bad, but it did not add anything new to the world of Avatar and Pandora.Avatar The Way of Water is one of the best movies that I watched this year, not only this year, but also during the last 10 years. That is why regarding the score, I gladly give Avatar The Way of Water 9 out of 10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Solely about making millions of dollars. It's literally about a big fish. No twists , no storytelling, no point to be honest. James Cameron is a terrible storyteller!!

this film is absolutely awful. It's the only film in history that made me want to go back to the cinema and stand outside with a sign saying...""I'll pay you not to see it""Unfortunately Bad Critics will rate this film highly!

Not to mention, 25 years since we saw Titanic in theaters!It's become a trend to hate on Avatar since its blockbuster release. But I loved the film in theaters back then and the many times I have seen it at home it still holds up. For me the first Avatar is one of the best Scf-Fi movies ever made.So, the sequel of the BEST 3D movie ever is here and I just had to check it out in Imax 3D. No other format can do this film justice.James Cameron is an amazing director. He has made 7 straight block busters in his career. This is his 8th one. This movie deals with what Jake Sully and his expanded family are doing on Pandora as the people from Earth are back in huge forces.The story of the film is a bit generic as was the case with the previous film. I think the director has decided that the visual awe and spectacle of these film must come to the forefront and hence he keeps making the plots extremely simple and easy to follow. Its not like Cameron doesn't make complicated plotted films, but Avatar 1 and 2 both are not that. So don't go in expecting twists and turns and mind-bending plot devices. This is not a Nolan film. Some plot devices and points of the first film are re-used in some manner in this one and it doesn't feel repetitive as its not happening to the same characters but it does all too familiar at times.Instead, this movie is a visual spectacle. I challenge anyone to show a movie better made in the VFX department. The VFX is so good that its very easy to forget that every frame is CGI. The underwater scenes look like they were shot on location. Even the mechs and other technology look absolutely real. This is not a film that can be fully enjoyed at home. Anyone trying to catch it on OTT on their mobile is missing 90% of the films impact. So, this movie is a theatrical experience. Everyone was worried that Marvel movies have raised people's bar for VFX or that VFX have become too common now so people might not enjoy this film. But the breathtaking level of CGI in this film is like nothing that has been seen on screen before. But to see the DETAILS you have to see it on a huge screen.The acting is motion captured so to have bad performances would be really difficult. Still Neytiri comes across as a bit hysterical and high strung as compared to every other Na'vi and Human character including her children. But then she was like that in the previous film too.The cinematography (though wholly digital) has to be seen to be believed. The shots are kept simple and there is not much of camera movements or nauseating Shakey camera moments. There are moments where you will feel like you are actually underwater and swimming. I typically HATE underwater films like Aquaman or Waterworld which come across and boring and tedious, but not this film. The underwater scenes are really well done. Plus the action underwater is swift yet clearly visible. It doesn't become a visual mess like Aquaman. The scenes feel like they are really shot with blue Na'vi actors in some real ocean.The music is adequate but none of the main themes really stuck out to me. But it gets the job done. James Horner the previous music director of the first part has tragically passed away. He will be missed sorely.Overall : This is a must must watch in theaters. Make sure you have a clean 3D glass and the theater you visit has a good brightness. Seeing this at home is pointless.Rating : 8/10. I frankly enjoyed the first one a lot more. This part 2 is visually amazing, but I feel the next two sequels might make me reconsider the rating of this film. Even though the story is complete and there is no cliff hanger moment, it does feel a bit incomplete. Its how Empire Strikes Back felt a bit hollow till the next part came out. So I liked the first one more than this one, but this still is a really good film with some great action moments.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is generally considered hard to display the beauty of underwater shots, and this movie simply delivers in the best way possible. The story is highly predictable and riddled with plot holes though, a problem shared by the previous part. The movie is not a one time watch, not because of the excellent story, but because of the eye candy shots that surpass almost everything else in the market. The message that the movie tries to deliver gets preachy and overly simplistic at times. Still, this is a must watch for everyone who likes to watch the water splash.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story, the world, the incredible effects and how everything just comes together is pure magic. It's been years since I saw a movie where by the end of it I wanted to go buy another ticket and watch it immediately again. It's emersive, emotional and pure genius. It makes you want more and want to be there and want to know more about the world and characters.

The visual effect are great, and everybody agrees on that! But the movie it self was in no way as good as the first one. I watched Avatar 1, 5 or 6 times and have no desire to watch this one a 2nd time. No story, no magic, and 3:18 hours was way to long and made it boring. The whole thing was done with animated characters without any live human interaction like in Avatar 1, which made it hard to impossible to identify yourself with any of the characters. If the following movies which are already made are similar i would not even go to a movie theater to watch any of them and may or may not watch it when it comes on TV but another 3 Hour Avatar movie is nothing i would look forward to. It would be great if Mr. Cameron reads and understand his Ex Fans and adjusts accordingly. Because if he doesn't it would be a shame that such a good start with Avatar 1 will simple be a big looser. Well, go watch it anyway but don't expect anything like the 1st. Avatar Movie.","17 out of 28 found this helpful.

We were reminded that Pandora is comprised of not just plants and big trees but also of beautiful oceans and the marine life that comes with it.People say that the first half felt a little boring and was too long but I felt otherwise,they took their time to introduce us to all the new characters and their personalities and how the
parent-child dynamic is with each character.I was worried that because of all the new characters we wouldn't get much time with Jake and Neytiri but I was wrong,their present felt adequate and their relationship with their kids were also explored quite a lotAvatar 1 climax is basically humans vs navi ,we see almost the whole of pandora along with eywa uniting against the humans so it goes without saying the stakes were incredibly high so I was expecting something grand here too but I felt a little disappointed with how things went but once you know that there are three more movies coming within the next decade it makes sense to carry the story forward in the next movies.On the whole ,just don't think a lot about it and go experience it in cinemas.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film had me fully engaged for the entire 3hr15min. It was entertaining, emotional & tear jerking. It's a must see. It also made me think there is a deeper meaning behind it all, the film portrayed how humans are killing Earth due to the destruction we are causing to our animals & land & therefore the humans are trying to take over Pandora. Such as real life we are looking to possibly move humans to mars or the moon because of how we've treated Earth. For me it was very sad to see how hurt the animals were in this film by humans, which is a true reflection on what we've done to animals & our land in the real world.

Other than the simplistic plot that clearly is setting up for Avatar 3, the love that was invested into this movie is a theater ""must see.""The original is better in that it is concise enough to allow for repeat viewings. Story was simple enough to fit into a one-off movie. This movie shot itself in the foot by making the run time so long that (1) less screenings can occur per day + (2) no one will come back for a repeat viewing b/c it is so long.Still an amazing movie. Definitely needs to be seen in a 3D theater, just like the first movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Story is pretty very much predictable but the visual elements hold the viewers experience together.The underwater scenes are a treat for the eyes and one will get immersed in the experience and become a part of the fantastic fantasy world that James Cameron creates. Acting by is good, Sound design is fantastic....to capture and create underwater sounds is a great technological achievement for the AVATAR team. The length of the film was the only down sider for me, however one may argue that it was necessary to keep the audience in teh fantasy world and feel a part of it.Overall must watch for the experience.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Have you ever wondered ever since these mobiles came into our hands, our attention span has been reduced to that of a kitten or an infant? We stopped paying attention to everything and we became ever-busy, doing nothing - or gazing at the gadget, doing nothing! When was the last time you ""lived"" at the moment? I saw some folks trying to capture the visual grandeur happening on the screen on their 6-inch cell phones rather than enjoying the awe in front of their eyes! So, if you don't have time for this 192-minute visual wonder, you better stay off!*Watching Avatar: The Way of Water is like going for meditation! Only if you indulge all your senses in it, you can enjoy the ecstasy it creates for you. You will be spellbound by James Cameron's visual wizardry - be it the fluorescent bodies of the natives of Pandora, the beautiful terrestrial creatures as well as underwater giants, and the machines, guns, and ships the humans use to hunt Na'vi race - every frame in the movie will make your jaw drop in awe and amazement.The Way of Water picks up a decade after the events of Avatar. Jake and Neytiri are now proud parents of 5 children - 3 biological and 2 adopted. Of the two adopted children, one girl Kiri was born from doctor Grace Augustine's avatar. (Sigourney Weaver must be really happy to see herself younger in the role of Kiri.) The other boy is the son of Miles Quaritch who was killed by Jack in the first part. All 5 children, despite their physical differences, mingle well and they all live happily for a moment until a star appears in the sky! The star is nothing but a group of spaceships carrying humans to colonize Pandora planet for its rich source of minerals. Colonel Miles Quaritch, who was killed by Jack Sully returns as a clone in his Avatar body with his memories embedded. He wants to take revenge on Jack Sully. How Jack Sully faces his archenemy and protects his family forms the crux of the story.Have you ever thought that the other species with whom we live in this world try to communicate with us? If only we care to listen to them! Apart from the family theme the movie explores, it is also about how we should co-exist with other creatures on the planet and care to listen to what they're trying to communicate. There's a beautiful bonding episode of a sea creature called Payakan and the son of Jake. All the people on Na'vi co-exist with their surroundings and creatures that live amongst them. They even consider other species as their spiritual family and address them as their sisters and brothers.Epilogue:Avatar: The Way of Water doesn't offer you an adrenaline rush or the edge-of-the-seat experience. Instead, it gives you an overwhelming feeling of awe and admiration which will stay with you for some time. My suggestion is, if you have access to an IMAX screening, go for it. The gigantic scale on which the film is made is to be enjoyed on IMAX screens only! If it is not possible, well, better enjoy it in 3D. But whichever way you watch it, indulge in it, and you will enjoy it absolutely! Don't worry if all the Na'vi people look the same with fluorescent blue shades. I couldn't recognize Kate Winslet as Ronal! All things will fall into place and you will understand once you enter the Pandora world leaving everything, especially your cell phones, behind and the length of the film doesn't bother you!And yeah! Avatar 3 is due in the month of December 2024, which is two years from now!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Navi and the villagers Metkayina are digitally made so realistic that the skin textures are well-rendered. The motion capture underwater was next-level media creation. The rest of the visual effects are flawless.The acting is good. The spotlight I'm giving for the best performance has to go to Zoe Saldana. When you see or have seen the movie, there is a scene when her emotions are released out, and just by that moment alone proves that she deserves an Oscar nomination.The story, as mentioned in my tagline, is about the same (almost literally). I was basically watching the Navi against the military and machines again. I'm not complaining. I was just surprised since the trailers for this movie that Avatar 2 is exploring that again.The second act did slow down for me because that 2nd third of the movie felt like it was showcasing its highly-advanced motion capture technology and the characters just...hanging around. To be fair before hand, I went through a busy day before watching this movie and I did fall asleep for a few minutes before the action came on.I was also surprised by the amount of violence passable for a PG-13 rating. If James Cameron can pull it off, Marvel and DC can do it too without hold back the story.MILD SPOILERS??? I'm really glad the movie didn't end in a cliffhanger. I would've been annoyed a little bit if this movie strictly ended as a part one of an entire four-part quadrilogy story.Overall, don't let me discourage any of you from watching this movie. It is such an amazing watch and it does deserve its place in the big screen.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This accolade is almost a given considering the length of time James Cameron spent perfecting the technology and techniques needed to bring his vision for the underwater environments of Pandora to life and the amount of money poured into the development of the movie. Instead I will simply say this: This movie makes you sad to leave the cinema. Not in a 'oh what an upsetting movie' way, but in a 'I don't want to leave this world behind' way.The exact same feeling I experienced watching the first Avatar, and the feeling that compelled me to watch that movie eight times in the cinema, has already brought me back to Pandora's oceans three times. And when tickets cost a frankly ridiculous £22.50 these days surely that means something.This is not high concept filmmaking. The script is nothing particularly interesting. The storyline is recycled mostly from Avatar 1 but the setting is changed to the vast oceans that stretch across the planet. We meet new characters who remind us a lot of the old characters; Strong matriarchs, protective fathers, wayward sons. Allow me to make something clear which people may find odd: I do not watch Avatar to be dazzled by a witty script. I don't expect any memorable lines to stay with me. This is a movie that stays with you because you cannot believe your eyes. A movie that effectively replaces the world around you with a living, breathing environment beyond your imagination. This is a VISUAL SPECTACLE, and it is absolutely made for iSense 3D.Avatar is a money-maker because it is shamelessly upfront about what it is. It's a massive, feel-good, tech-driven CGI riot of colour and light and escapism. Overtly at least, this is absolutely the visual pinnacle of cinema. The ocean pulses with life. Every scene is radiant with blue or turquoise or orange glow, shining creatures and flickering embers dance in front of the camera, so close you can truly reach out and feel them. Your eyes struggle to take everything in, especially during the scenes shot at 48fps. Cameron knows exactly when to use these techniques to squeeze every last ounce of awe from his subject material. Long may it continue. I've signed up for the full 5 movie run that's for sure.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is strange to think there was a 13-year gap between The Way of Water and its predecessor. The sequel perfectly transitions the story from the original and answers some of the questions left open at the conclusion of the first movie. The acting and dialogue is excellent and gives you a sense of witnessing an actual culture that could exist out there somewhere. Emotions are very strong, as were in the original film. The film also has strong balance between action and drama scenes, with the 3+ hour runtime being appropriate. Finally, the setting is spectacular to view. The environment, camera work, and CGI are beyond anything that has graced the film industry previously.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I felt that I was living on another planet for 3 hours which is down to James Cameron pushing the boundaries of new technology and filming techniques which includes blending CGI and humans seamlessly. I immediately wanted to jump back into a pool after watching it. We see one the most convincing water communities on film and funnily enough they don't even live under water.The film starts off catching us up to date with events since Avatar 1 and reintroduces us to jungle tribe which looks better than ever before. Following this the action and the pace ramps up which makes for a very interesting first act which starts to point us in the direction that the movie is going.In the second act we are introduced to the Way of the Water and it is here that James Cameron takes his time and basically says look what I can do... The pace slows somewhat (and may drag for some) whilst we essentially live in with the new community and witness character development. I personally enjoyed it as the film looks beautiful and sucks you into another world but you do notice the slight dip in pace. In the 3rd act the action picks up again - The action scenes and set pieces are done well, driving up tension and consequence.There is no denying this is one of the most beautiful films ever shot, the story doesn't quite match but it's easy to get onboard with. Simple isn't always bad especially with so much to take in with regards to scenery and characters.We are introduced to several new characters who take a lot of the screen time away from Jake and Neytiri but each character feels different with their personality directly influencing their onscreen decisions. Cameron is uses interesting characters (some more likeable than others) to drive the narrative as opposed to a complex narrative driving the characters.Ultimately Avatar 2 was a captivating spectacle and a fun ride that sucks you in to unique world. It's not perfect but it's a strong follow up to Avatar and conveys simple but universal messages. I would recommend Avatar 2 to anybody that enjoyed the first film or anybody that enjoys fantasy action films.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Huge chunks of explanatory stuff was intentionally left out. The story is about family, and for that reason, the characters, and not the plot, were brought to the forefront. The characters are very rich (more on the level of a TV show than a movie). The editing is more aggressive than the original. All the fat was cut out. The characters and spectacle are front and center. This one is even more about aesthetics. It's a precisely executed adventure film that deeply immerses you into the rich universe. The CGI has leveled up a lot since the first, and there are shots that you can tell were obsessed over in ways few contemporary directors, other than George Miller and Cameron himself, are thinking about. You feel like you are there, and everything feels natural and authentic to the universe. Nothing feels contrived or out of place. The technology of the ""sky people"" is richly thought out, even more so than in the first, but never brought to the center of the narrative. This one - is about characters and archetypes. The archetypes span galaxies and feel familiar to our own world. Old foes return. New foes are introduced. Although the characters are richer compared to the first, the character building is more precisely executed. By the end of the movie, you know this family. That said, all of the character building is hidden within 3+ hrs of pure blockbuster spectacle. It's a Finding Nemo meets Jurassic Park type adventure, if you will. It's the first of several more sequels, so more character building is to be expected (think the pilot of a TV show) but it absolutely is an emotionally griping adventure that has the blockbuster feel that we've almost forgotten about. You are transported to this world, and taken on an epic adventure. No time is wasted with regard to pacing, and you can tell a lot of thought was put into every detail, so even the keenest of observers would feel the richness of the universe without needing to pass through the uncanny valley. The CGI is probably the best, smoothest, and most photorealistic CGI to date. It feels like thousands of RTX GPUs were rendering for hours just to create a few seconds of CGI for this film. You can especially tell in the faces and movements of the characters. It doesn't appear to be CGI. Also, there appears to be less still ""art"" backdrops and more moving camera 3D CGI compared to the original, which allows for the more immersive adventure story. The acting, across the board, is better than the original. Just don't go into this one expecting an overly complex story because that isn't what this one is about. My guess is that most of the expose will be done in the next installment given how much time was devoted to character building in this one. All that said, I can definitively say, it's a blockbuster. Imo, right up there with the best of the best. Jurassic Park, Avatar, the original Star Wars, Indiana Jones. It's Avant Garde with regard to adventure filmmaking, similar to the first, but better in almost all aspects. I saw it in RealD 3D and didn't notice any framerate issues or anything, but I would have preferred a larger screen with a wider aspect ratio. The aspect ratio on the screen I saw it on was too narrow for that type of spectacle. Maybe the IMAX 3D has a wider aspect ratio. Either way, the 3D was good and seemed appropriate for the immersive adventure movie that it is. I will probably see it again in IMAX 3D to compare. I usually don't do IMAX 3D because they do linear polarization (as opposed to circular polarization with RealD) so the quality of the 3D is more susceptible to where you are seated and how straight you keep your head. I've also experienced framerate issues with IMAX 3D and not with RealD. That said, if the IMAX is a wider format, then I would highly recommend that over the RealD, even if the 3D is not as good. Overall, it's a very good movie. There is not much to the story ala Mad Max Fury Road, but unlike Fury Road, the characters are rich, often times charming, and carefully built up (think closer to Stranger Things character richness). You can tell the things we learn about these characters will be part of later installments.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The scenery is so breathtaking that after 3 hours you feel like you are a part of that world. The acting is Superb! Zoe Saldana Gave every fiber of her being in this role, she sold me on every raw emotion she was feeling.So when it comes down to it. Is the story predictable and Simplistic at times? Yes.

I didn't get bored, and I couldn't count the number of screensavers on my fingers, so the movie absolutely surpasses everything I've seen on the cinema screen this year.I won't reveal the details, because it's worth seeing for yourself, the film presents at least 4 different stories that are very deeply connected, so you just have to get comfortable and enjoy.

If people expected this film to bomb at the box office because it was released much later than initially expected, then naysayers have got it all wrong because this movie brought masses of viewers back to the cinemas in times when most movie theatres are actually closing shop because most people simply enjoy new movies in the comfort of their homes. Personally, I appreciated the first movie but don't consider myself a massive fan of the franchise. I have only recently been watching this film at the cinema of my favourite shopping mall where one could enjoy it for just six bucks. Certainly, Avatar: The Way of Water has exceeded my expectations and offered visually stunning entertainment of the grandest type.On the positive side, the special effects of this film are truly impressive. The fantastic world of Pandora is even more impressive in this sequel than it was in the original movie. Whether viewers discover lush forests, floating rocks or colourful bays, every single environment looks absolutely inspiring.The characters in this movie are also intriguing because it's easy to empathize with them. The story essentially revolves around a small family bound by courage, love and loyalty. Their new hosts are initially cold and distant but go through wonderful changes to become grateful and reliable. The antagonist with his obsessive behaviour certainly also strikes a chord. One has to point out the numerous imaginary creatures that are introduced throughout the movie and especially the sea animals are particularly fascinating.This movie also has several positive messages that work in the context of our real world. Support your family in difficult times and everyone will emerge victoriously. Speak and stand up against those who are committing crimes and guided by prejudices. Respect the wilderness and protect the environment. This film certainly finds the right balance between fantasy and reality.This film however certainly isn't without a few flaws. Its length of three hours and twelve minutes is excessive in my humble opinion. This movie could easily have been cut by about forty-five minutes to make for a more captivating, dynamic and fluid ride. The story of this film is easily predictable and one could even call it overtly simple. Other reviewers have pointed out the simplistic dialogues but I figure that this element was intentional in order to appeal to a particularly wide audience by lowering the film's intellectual side and increasing its emotional depth.Avatar: The Way of Water certainly isn't the greatest movie of all time. However, it's a profoundly humane fantasy film with stunning visual effects. It should appeal to fans of the franchise and anyone looking for an inspired spectacle that invites viewers to dream themselves far away.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you thought the VFX were great back then, we'll prepare to have your mind blown again. Avatar 2 was not one of those bad sequels although I did have a few problems with it. The beginning half was super nostalgic. All in all, It was entertaining, intense, and emotional while also being quite visually pleasing.The story is where the movie lacks. This movie is pretty much the first movie revamped. And I when I say revamped, I mean REVAMPED. Juiced up if you will. The acting for the kid who plays Spider was missing the depth needed to feel his characters emotion throughout the movie. Bringing back the actress who played Grace in the first Avatar voices Kitty who is a young teen avatar in this movie. The effects to make her voice sound younger flopped. She was talking too slow and forced which just made it sound weird.I do like the direct the move goes and what the future avatar movies might hold. There is a ton of potential and lot more of Pandora to explore. I just hope the future film storylines are unique.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was incredibly excited for the release of this movie and it did not disappoint! I love this film even more than the original and cannot wait for the next films in the franchise.This movie is definitely one of the most visually gorgeous films I've ever seen, if not THE most gorgeous. The CGI is once again absolutely flawless and really helps to improve upon the world building of the first movie. Every shot took my breathe away and it's such a brilliant film to experience in a cinema for this reason. There are such a broad range of eye-catching colour palettes that feel pretty hypnotic at times.The sound design is well-crafted, and it makes great use of the surround sound. The score itself is mystical and really helps to immerse the audience into the world of Pandora whilst also including the parts of the score from the original that are instantly recognisable to the Avatar franchise.One other thing that impressed me about this film is the characters, and how well written they are. I cared for all of them deeply, and I feel this movie really helped to flesh them out further. The actors give such strong performances, especially Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri. Every emotional she portrays hits so hard and her performance is completely captivating. Also, the dialogue is very well written, with a lot of heart and meaning.Lastly, the movie is paced very well and kept me interested every second. I was a bit skeptical, with this film being over three hours, but after viewing I believe it makes use of its time perfectly and has enough going on for the film to be consistently engaging. It has a nice blend of slow and fast sequences that piece the film together well and make it a very enjoyable watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Like the first Avatar film, the CGI and practical special effects are superb but unlike the first film, we've seen it all before, so they don't make up for the simplistic story, juvenile script, and card-board acting (both by people and CGI entities). James Cameron's flair for action and techno-imagery is on display, as is his almost pathological lack of subtlety as the painfully perfect Na'vi demonstrate, like the Ewoks did before them, that technologically sophisticated weaponry is no match for spears and bows'n'arrows when the latter are wielded by the righteous and/or oppressed (wishful thinking with, sadly, little historical support). In addition to the overly-long and repetitive battle scenes, and colourful but sophomoric 'new-agey' moments, we also have to put up with a lot of 'awkward teenage blues' as the youngsters infiltrate pretty much every scene (and do exactly what you expect they are going to do). IMO, the worst decision Cameron made was to contrive to have the Na'vi be heard in English, which just highlights the weakness of the incredibly clichéd dialogue (especially that of the 'younglings', which seems to be pandering to teenage audiences as the characters all talk as though they learned the language hanging around a mall in 2020, bro). Audibly, the only thing more risible than the dialogue was the Na'vi's incessant 'hissing', a gimmicky trope that was quickly beaten to death (it didn't help that when they weren't hissing, they were speaking perfect contemporary English). All-in-all: cloying, self-righteous, excessively drawn-out, and not particularly interesting, with a premise and plot so message-driven that the entire film might as well be treated as a parable (just a different J. C.).","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

No. Is this the greatest SciFi movie ever made? No. Is this the best movie even of 2022? No. It isn't even James Cameron's best work. Not by a long shot. Is it better than the first Avatar?Yes.But just by a little.I would've rated the original at about a 7 back when I saw it in the theater those many years ago.The enhanced effects, and to be honest, the lengthy scenes of old school two dimensional action sequences were as unexpected as they were exhilarating.That's what gives this newest edition a slight nudge over the original.But oh my, my, my how long this film is.Admittedly it doesn't feel like over three hours but it doesn't feel like a quick infomercial either.What also drags this movie down is lack of an interesting story, weak cliched dialogue with American slang (which sounds weird when spoken by tall blue people). There's also a young man that walks around the entirety of the movie like a tiny Tarzan or Cha-Ka from Land of the Lost.Who he really reminded me of is the kid from that late 1990's movie, Jungle 2 Jungle. Seriously. And he's in the movie a bunch. It feels like he's in every scene.There are shoutouts aplenty throughout this film, all to Cameron's glory years and far superior earlier films such as The Abyss and Aliens.Will you enjoy this movie in spite of all the things mentioned here?Yes. If you can handle such an intense running time (3+hours!) and you are a fan of the first film. If you cannot answer in the affirmative for either of these, then you are in for a long sit where your mind might occasionally wander and you may check your watch or phone for the time on more than one occasion.I do recommend seeing this film in the theater, in 3D on the most premium screen available in your area.It's been 13 years since the first film. Go see it. And no need to stay any later after the credits as there is no post credits scene here.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film is stunning to watch and explores important themes of harmony, connectedness and the power of nature.One of the best parts of ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is the amazing special effects. The world of Pandora comes to life on screen with its beautiful and colorful environment. The film takes us to the lush green forests and introduces us to the strange glowing creatures. Each scene is visually captivating, especially the underwater parts that reflect the mysterious and beautiful world beneath the surface.The film also focuses on the bond between humans and the Na'vi people. We follow familiar characters like Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (played by Zoe Saldana) as they face new challenges and struggles. The actors deliver brilliant performances, bring their characters to life and make us feel connected to them. His emotional journey reminds us of the importance of understanding and empathy.Although the film is captivating to watch, some viewers may find the story predictable. The themes of protecting the environment and respecting indigenous cultures, important as they are, may sound similar to what we saw in the first film. However, the film compensates for this with its detailed world-building and strong connection between the audience and the characters.""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a great combination of the Avatar series. It transports us to a world full of wonder and imagination, and reminds us of the importance of taking care of our planet.

Set many years after the original, the film follows the continuing lives of Jake Sully and Neytiri - now with a family consisting of several teenage Na'vi children (with the film focusing on the children for much of its runtime). When marines return to Pandora seeking revenge, the couple must flee from their jungle home to the shores of a coastal tribe. There, they must learn to adapt to their new home, overcoming conflicts within their new tribe, as well as Colonel Miles Quaritch (now cloned and in an Avatar body) who is hunting for them in a relentless quest for revenge.Avatar 2's effects are excellent, most of the CGI is beautifully rendered and necessary for the film's sweeping camerawork and scope. It's so good, in fact, that it's easy to forget almost nothing you're seeing on screen at any given moment is real. Unfortunately, many of the underlying failures of this sort of CGI remain: the characters and objects often appear weightless, leading to moments where the physics of what's happening lands firmly in the uncanny valley - even if the aesthetics are often breathtaking.In 2009, the ambition of rendering the majority of a live action film in a computer (one which looked magnitudes more convincing than even the most impressive CGI of the time) was daring enough to justify a tradeoff in verisimilitude. The first film became the highest grossing film of all time because audiences had never seen such expansive use of CGI. Now, though? It's all they know. While they might be cheaper, and not as gorgeously rendered or intricately detailed, Marvel movies - just as colorful, creative, expansive, and busy - are so popular and ubiquitous that the novelty of these massive CGI spectacles is long dead.Given how the industry has changed over the past dozen+ years, and the massive gap between the two films, one might assume Cameron would dedicate considerable time, energy, and attention to his script - he has not. Motivations, character development, and structure are all laughably thin. Despite it's 195-minute runtime, the film is largely uneventful - the main characters haven't grown or changed in any meaningful way by the end of the story, and the motivations of the antagonists are entirely contrived, making precisely zero sense.Filling the void between action spectacles is what some might try to call ""character work"" mostly centering around the children of protagonists, Jake and Neytiri. The children are viewed as outsiders to the new tribe and are challenged to fit in, a plotline which derivatively borrows from the first film, itself an already-tired Dances with Wolves retread.The dialogue is a significant issue here - it's laughably blunt, a cringe-worthy mix of direct verbalizations of feelings, and irrelevant, throwaway banter, all obviously written by a 68 year old with a distant, bland memory of what being a child is like. Cameron seems to think all it takes to depict a teenager is to have them say ""bro"" and ""cuz"" in every sentence, while getting into lots of absolutely senseless fights with some of the most cliche bullies ever put to film and always, *ALWAYS* doing the opposite of whatever they're told.The performances are... fine, I guess. There are very few scenes featuring real humans in the entire film, so the CGI and motion capture is forced to do all the heavy lifting. Actors become voice actors, and only Zoe Saldana musters any genuine emotion - though she is sadly in very few scenes, serving as little more than a background character for the majority of the film (as are almost all of the women, to be honest, appearing to exist on the world of Pandora only to bare children - sometimes even after death).The plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense... Quaritch is cloned into an Avatar body (in the first of *many* absurd contrivances in this movie) and embarks on a mission of revenge against Jake Sully. This could be ok as a simple way to kick off the plot - but it never develops beyond this and it doesn't even make any sense because this isn't a *personal* mission of revenge - he's literally given orders to go after Jake, as if the entire Earth military presence is there on Pandora *ONLY* to go after Jake. Quaritch seemingly has no other purpose for being there.This also introduces problems for the plot when viewed in the context of the first film. The entire reason Jake Sully was recruited by the military in the first place is because they made an Avatar body for his twin brother and when his twin brother was killed the Avatar would have been useless had it not been for Jake. But now we're told they have the capability to not only clone people and Avatar bodies, but also download and save those people's memories to be uploaded into the cloned bodies. Why they didn't just do this with Jake's brother is a question left unanswered.Speaking of plot problems introduced by this movie... the goal of the humans in the first movie was to acquire ""unobtainium"" which goes entirely unmentioned in the sequel. This is yet another absurd contrivance because it means we can conveniently forget all about the jungle Na'vi and what they must be going through trying to defend themselves from the humans who would no doubt be resuming attacks on their home in order to obtain more ""unobtainium."" But because Cameron wants to show his cool new water special effects, he doesn't want us thinking about the tired old jungle he's leaving behind and he knows he can't do that if we're reminded of the giant ""unobtainium"" repository underneath the burnt remains of the Na'vi home tree.About halfway into the film, we're introduced to another, similar MacGuffin, when the whalers (who don't even appear to be a part of the military at all) extract some kind of glowing golden goo out of one of the whale-like Tulkun. We're told this goo is capable of completely halting aging in humans. One might immediately wonder why this is so valuable though, given humans can apparently have all their memories downloaded into a clone - effectively making them immortal - but Cameron doesn't linger long enough for the audience to ask tough questions because this is never mentioned again and has no real bearing on the plot at all. It's *probably* setup for one of the sequels, but nobody has any reason to care at this point. The only reason this appears to be included in the movie at all is to give the humans an excuse to be at sea, attacking the water Na'vi tribes.This is already getting ridiculously long so I'll just rapid-fire a few thoughts here...The children are captured *THREE TIMES* in this movie. So much so that one of them even comments about it, exasperatedly saying she can't believe she's been captured again.The final battle is ridiculously absurd on multiple levels but the most significant issue with it is that the water Na'vi just *disappear* halfway through the battle so it's just Jake and his family (along with the daughter of the leader of the water Na'vi - which was his entire reason for getting involved in the first place) left to fend for themselves.The outcast Tulkun was a really interesting idea that suffers from terrible execution. The water Na'vi treat him like a murderer because he fought back against humans who murdered his family. It felt like very cult-like rigid adherence to dogma and didn't sit right with me.There are also seemingly only three types of human in this movie: The Evil Military Grunt, The Evil Apathetic Capitalist Profiteer, and the Sympathetic Scientist who gives lip to their peers and maybe defects (but we won't know until we see them in a background shot of Avatar 3). No one resembling a real person. Only one-dimensional Saturday-morning cartoon characters. Oh, and Spider, I guess.Suffice to say, outside of the spectacle of the admittedly very impressive CGI, this movie is absolutely terrible.4/10.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

James Cameron punished us for watching this with sealife overkill to make most of the movie feel like a Documentary. Most of our group felt like sleeping or switched off for a while part way through. There is only so much sea life you can watch. Apart from that, was great to watch, and brilliant if an hour of documentary was cut out. I wonder if it's trying to sell toys and merchandise now which is why they added a lot of superfluous sealife to made it poorer for viewers, just like they did when adding Jar Jar Binks to Star Ears!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think they should have been a little bit more effective than they were considering how lethal they were supposed to be in regard to their physical attributes mixed with their military training. Of course the visuals and special effects and the 3D were all fantastic, just like the first movie. They also added some pretty good new characters that will be interesting to see developed in future movies, especially one of those characters who may be a little conflicted with his feelings. There were some predictable or cliche scenes, like when a character is being chased by a big monster though you know they are going to survive. Or when a character was being held hostage at gun or knife point, but again, you know they were going to be rescued. I was disappointed to see how easily those gunships get shot down; you think by now they would have had arrow proof glass! The climax scene might have been a little too overdone and was a little messy, and I think their victory was a little too easy, like did not see enough sacrifice or loss from the natives like we did in the first movie. I was also wondering why we were introduced to this new military base and military general in the first part of the movie but they had really no part of the rest of the movie, although I get they will be a big factor in the movies to. There were a couple sort of sad scenes but this movie could have better portrayed the struggle of the natives, like the first movie did. Still a fun and very entertaining adventure movie and I'm looking forward to the next one!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is no really good explanation of how the antagonists are all in avatar Na'vi bodies, or, how the sea people can communicate with sea creatures, among other plot holes. The sequence where Sully and family 'learn' how to travel on sea 'dragons' is almost identical to how Sully had to learn how to fly with the flying creatures in the first edition of this film. It is a shame that we had to wait thirteen years for the next chapter and after three plus hours.

"8","/10","Flat characters, already seen plot covered by James Cameron CGI magic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8761517/?ref_=tt_urv","lukatisma","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur160477214/?ref_=tt_urv","27 December 2022","Let's start from the assumption that you have re-watched Avatar 1 and that you enter with a fresh knowledge of the characters and the story, this film builds on the first part very nicely. Cameron, as far as the effects are concerned, fullfils his fantasy. The CGI in this film exceeded every limit, the underwater scenes bought me, the way of life of the Metkayina tribe and the Omatikaya getting used to it gives a nice adventure vibe and allows you to enjoy the masterful cgi. Jake and Neytiri are admittedly put aside, that's the impression I got, but it doesn't take away, but rather adds to the essence of the film, which is the importance of family and the limits to which a parent goes to protect his children. Now let's switch to ""people"". The return of Quaritch will definitely bother some people, but personally I like the return of the villain now in the form of an Avatar with the general's memories embedded. That colonist idea from the first part is spinning again, but now it gains weight. Namely, the Earth is ""dying out"" humans also need a habitable planet to which they will move in decades time give or take. However, we come to the question: ""How does humanity plan to inhabit and urbanize a planet where life is impossible without breathing masks, in hostile territory against both the Navi tribes and animal species"" will have to be clarified in the following parts if they plan to continue in that direction. Let's go back to the story, it is very simple, superficially done without any big plots and depth, but that's what the first part was like. The characters tho, idk what could be said, everything has already been seen, Neytiri remains wild and protective, Jake now faces the role of both the leader of the tribe and the father figure, the kids mostly played their part well, some more, some less, definitely the most interesting character is Kiri. Action fans are definitely not left behind, the last hour of the film offers sequences that are hard to beat, mixed with effects, you get the impression... Could the time have been shortened by lets say 30-45 minutes, definitely, but the pleasure would be weaker. The fact that the production of the next two parts requires 2 billion dollars to break even is just an indication that Cameron is putting all his cards on the table so that these films will leave a big impact on the mainstream media and mainly on us viewers. The film, ultimately, could have been done better in terms of the characters and the story, whether these 13 years were worth waiting for, it is questionable due to the fact that many have forgotten about the first part and the hype was not so present, the same premise applies to Top Gun Maverick. It is recommended to watch in 3D on the largest possible screen, because in terms of effects, this is a once in a lifetime experience that you will not regret for 3 hours of your time. The third and every part until the end of saga must build up the story and characters, there must be some depth some building up of the characters through experiences, difficult decisions and so on. That's it from me, I wish a good time to everyone who will watch this movie during the holidays, greetings.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even though 3 hours, 12 minutes long I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. James Cameron's stamp was all over this movie. We got scenes reminiscent of the first Avatar movie, and it is clear there is a huge love of the sea which I think will continue into the next movie. Imaginative sea creatures abound in the new location and it was super cool. There is a scene that reminds one of Moby Dick, one part reminded me of the Jonah and the whale story, and a long sequence takes us back to James Cameron's Titanic. I hope these are not spoilers. There was also plenty of great action scenes so all the quiet parts did not cause sleepiness in such a long movie. The movie opened up a lot of questions that were not answered, so it seems cruel we have to wait two more years to see how that plays out. I thought there was a good deal of story and character development myself and a nice introduction to some new characters. I especially liked Spider. Spectacles are highlighted with brilliant CG. The only thing that bothered me was the casting of Kate Winslet for the voice of the oldest daughter, Ronal. Her voice sounded too old for the part. I also did not understand why she obsessed about her father. I did not see that as relevant here. Perhaps I missed something?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unbelievably enough, the framerate is not constant, going randomly from 24 to 48, and it gave me a headache. And I know exactly why. With something he called ""Truecut motion"", he wanted to avoid some ""soap opera effect"" so he kept the 48fps to action scenes...and that's puke for me. If you do 100% HFR like the Hobbit, you can get used to it. If framerate changes constantly, you just get nausea.Even with good visuals, that's not enough to make a movie.I cannot believe how much violence there is in this movie. On 3 hours long, there may be 1 hour of action, combat, destroying things, the colonel trying to take vengeance.The whole movie is about the colonel trying to take vengeance on Jake Sully because Jake decided on Avatar 1 to protect the planet, against his mission. So we end up with a very cliché story of vengeance with a bad guy that never dies, that we seen a million times already.It is beyond me that James Cameron went from Titanic to such a generic cowardly writing. Where is the debate about ecology ? Did ANYTHING evolved in terms of diplomacy ? I can't see any kind of resolution from Avatar 1 to 2. Nothing happened human-Na'vi wise. They just fight. I guess war is the only answer. Is that the real message you wanted to share, James Cameron ? How can we end up with such basic violence and no negociations ? Did you ever watch Star Trek, Goldorak ?There are some interesting stuff, like the meeting between Na'vi and water Na'vi, but that's it.Now, there are a bunch of things that I didn't understand. If humans can clone a mixed Na'vi-human DNA and put a consciousness in it...there can most certainly clone some whale substance to stop aging to millions of liters, right ?How does the Na'vi communicate with the whale ?Why the girl laughs when she see her brother fight ? Is that so funny ?Why on earth the Na'vi get pregnant because the scientists on earth love each other ?And what about stopping aging ? Is that really useful, in a world where you can just transfer your mind into another body ? Why no character thought about that ?What about Earth ? Did anything happened there ? Are there any medias, any people against the whole process ? Does the scientist have any feelings ? Did anyone evolve on Earth ? We have zero news about it. But we do have hours of hollywoodian fighting.","24 out of 43 found this helpful.

A lot of the female characters were barely clothed. And even though they weren't human beings the way the film makers made the CGI the avatars had the body shape/ they were drawn exactly like humans. So, seeing the woman with nothing but strategically placed minimal cloth across their chest was annoying to me bc it hurt my overall rating of the movie bc I wouldn't want my 15 year old son to see that, and also I'd rather them be a little more covered up. The last reason that brought my review down was that often during the movie it seemed like I was watching a video game. The cinematography was amazing but something about the camera angles of the CGI or the POV of the characters often mimicked how video games do POV of characters in campaign modes. When it felt like you were watching a video game, as a viewer it pulled you out of the trance of the movie and made you realize you were in a movie theater again.Overall, a very great movie. The beautiful nature scenes of the forest, ocean, and ocean creatures were amazing and beautiful to see. If it wasn't for the minimally dressed woman, and the movie sometimes having the same POV as a video game I would rate it higher.Cinematography: 10/10

It would get a 10 from me with better plot/time management. I was joking they ""were gunna need a montaaaaaage""(South Park, IYKYK).The film has a tendency to drag in the middle, it's visually stunning during this time, but the story itself started to feel insignificant. I'm all for character development but it wasn't really even quite that, it was like a cheap version.I will say, I felt the final act completely made up for the long run time, it was just a shame it had to. The action had me on the edge of my seat and flinching. And so many of those moments carried emotional weight as well. During high speed movement, and those trademark Avatar stunts, I was a bit shocked by just how realistic everything looked.Overall I would encourage people to see Avatar 2 in theaters, and I almost always wait to be able to watch via streaming or renting. If it wasn't 3.5 hrs I'd be seriously considering going again to watch in 3D.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First of all, the special effects are incredibly well done, after all, we've been waiting for this movie for about 10 years. The whole movie was too long because 3 hours is crazy. The fight performances are great, and it's worth mentioning that the music conveys character to the whole movie and the action. In my opinion Avatar 2 is a bit overrated, but still quite an enjoyable movie, worth seeing
James Cameron did a really good job same as the first part now we have to wait for the next parts hopefully the next parts will be even better than the previous ones.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

First to start, having the ability to come back with a successful sequel almost 13 years later has its own challenges, and James Cameron successfully created yet another spectacle!! He successfully delivered what may be an even better part than the previous.It amazes me how can someone envision and create such out of this world visual based movie, like what goes through his mind to be able to do all of this? His attention to details is insane!!This sequel expanded with more focus on character building introducing a new family dynamics that hold a big part of the narrative. I really liked that, it added a new spin to the actual simple story.But I think dramatically the first part was more compelling, as the new introductions a bit overtook the further or new dramatic treatment, not that it lacked any drama but the basic premise of it was a very similar continuation of the first part happening in a different setting.Though that wasn't a bad thing necessarily and for me it didn't affect my experience as I was highly invested in the other aspects of the movie overall. It still highly succeeded in delivering a spectacle cinematic experience filled with sensational emotional beats, incredibly choreographed action scenes, and beautifully captured sceneries which all of that allowed the narrative to unfold itself richly exploring the new world development and getting the audience fully immersed through all of it with not even a minute of dullness.It also still managed to continue creating a connection with nature, amplified in this part by introducing a whole new world including new creatures and exploring the perspectives of the human-made environmental destructions and the consequences of that which is an important topic in the movie.Along with approaching the family's connection more in-depth with multiple layered storylines on its importance and significance in the journey, I think this was a highlighted aspect that created empathy and connection with the Sully family.(Visuals)
Mind-blowing, fascinating, mesmerizing.. what else can I add!! This movie is visually legendary!!! It easily beats being one of the tops within the past decade probably.It really makes sense why this was in the making for so years, the imagery wasn't just beautiful it also reflected depth. The visual effects were beyond astonishing, the techniques used for the world's elements and overall technical buildup were unreal, at a point you kind of can't figure out what's real and what's not as the CGI was so smoothly executed especially with the Na'vi characters, the way they are fully transformed yet their body language was maintained authentically and their emotions reflection through it was fantastic.I highly appreciate the director for inverting new technologies and not settling for less technically than what he gave, this probably going to change the future of VFX moving forward.(Performances)
The acting was impressive. Zoe Saldaña stood out she did amazing especially in her character's emotional arc delivery despite performing through motion capture you can feel her emotions through the screen. And so did Sam Worthington aa his character was more developed since his previous performance which is a great improvement to see. The newcomers also did great.Though some of the characters didn't get as much screen time as they deserved and needed further development, but it's a good setup for the future given there are more parts coming, so I hope we get more focus on the different characters in the future.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

And great credits should be given to the team knowing the challenges of getting all the water effects done perfectly for a 3D experience. Definitely worth it. Now the story is something that is okay but is not something that can intrigue you too much. It flows well though. One particular thing that I would like to add is that the 2 is really great for family, and especially for families emigrating away from their hometowns and settling down in an unfamiliar territory. There are elements of conflicts, lack of belonging, building confidence, and eventually getting through at all cost. Nice to bring kids along and watch.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

With the equipment of the time, this was quite a technical achievement.Great, but who cares?If you're making a technical achievement, super, but the story still has to pass. The underwater motion capture is the candle light.I'm a big fan of Cameron and always marveled that I could pick a random scene from his movies and be entertained.This one: no. It feels like a tired retread and nearly the same plot as the first one.In a broader sense, there are way too many characters for a 7 hour movie. The rivalry between the teens should have been cut to the bone.The Spider/Quarrich story was really the most interesting angle here, yet it seemed to be cut to nothing.I always have admired Cameron vs Lucas because it always seemed he was striving to make new great stuff. If it were Lucas, we would have no new movies after the Terminators. Lucas would have remastered the original Terminator to get rid of the painful stop motion.This one... I'm no filmmaker, but it feels like we should get back to fundamentals.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

I must apologize for skipping the first series in 2009 of this film before watching its sequel. Fortunately the story isn't too hard to figure out except that Quaritch the villain was in a human form in the first series. Avatar: The way of Water (2022) - what a blockbusting movie for this year, so much so that I would draw a parallel to my all time favorite The Lord of the Rings trilogy in both themes and genres.I compare Avatar to LOTR because both films are fantasy, adventure and action in genre. They are not about human stories. Yet human sentiment is intrinsically woven into the story.The storyline is simple but touching. An avatar tribe, in fact an avatar family, is fighting for its very own survival by moving to another tribe to gain their trust and help. Such story has abundant resemblance in the human world, be it refugee movement or aboriginal land rights. Yet it needs to undergo tremendous ordeals and overcome hurdles to make this happen, in which love, compassion, trust, courage, friendship and companionship definitely have played a very critical role.Fighting scene is intense, which qualifies this show as an action movie. Advanced military hardware like warplanes and whale hunting equipment and primitive tribal weapons such as arrows and spears form stark contrast between the technological gaps between two species. Yet it is smart fighting on top of hard fighting that sees the seemingly disadvantaged avatars turn the tables. All this exemplifies the superb cinematography I want to lay out next.It is not hard to figure out cinematography has everything to do with cinema by applying etymology, which in this movie simply catches your eyes, holds your breath, blows your mind, and drops your jaw. The fighting scenes, the landscape, the water thumping and particularly the underwater scenes carry great cinematic effects, so much so that I was quietly pleased to have paid a few extra dollars for a 3D upgrade. It is indeed a production that must be watched in 3D.Perhaps one of my unique likes is the depiction of avatar emotions. Their ear movements say a lot about them - upright when angry, and flopping down when sad. All carry the features of cartoon characters, which melts my heart.Acting skills have been demonstrated beyond those fighting scenes. Sam Worthington is a great action actor who has performed in multiple action movies such as Clash of the Titan (2010). There are many soft moments that guarantee a tear or two. Even when the movie was finished I could hear one of the teenage girls in the front row say ""my tears haven't dried yet."" Yes you have every reason not to come out of the cinema with dry eyes. The closing scene is particularly a good example. In flashback Jake the father and tribal leader was shedding tears when he saw his son catch a fish and the son asked him why he was crying. Oh there are many reasons for that, aren't there? Tears for victory, tears for survival, tears for loss of one son, and tears for another son's growing up, whatever it is, you name it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If they don't have a family of their own I guess it makes more sense they don't like it since they couldn't relate. Otherwise the poaching, the colonizing, families trying to stick together through the chaos, those are all real things people and animals are going through right this second. That hasn't changed since the 13 years this movie has been in development. It was simply beautifully captured. Yes, they probably should have left some cut scenes in to explain a bit more on certain topics. However, the movie was already a little over 3 hours I'm sure they were trying to keep it at a certain time frame. Hopefully they get into all of the things that went unanswered in the third one, if they have one, because it certainly looked intriguing. Visually the movie I mean stunning!

This is a coming of age myth about cherishing life. It's not trying to be a ""plausible realistic sci-fi story"". It's a grand allegory told by the greatest living craftsman and innovator of cinema, a complete Hollywood outsider and a-hole who does whatever he wants and doesn't take marching orders from marketing idiots and let his scripts get whittled away into nothing by ""writing teams"" like all the terrible crap coming from Disney/Marvel.This is the Steve Jobs of movies making his magnum opus using all the best paints and brushes in the industry, such as Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver. Is it kind of dumb to have the same bad guy return again, from a story perspective? Maybe. But the thing is, there is no other actor who could have pulled it off and would have been willing to go through what these actors had to endure for this film. So lets give Cameron a pass here. Ultimately it works just fine, and if you get hung up on that, you're a curmudgeon who cannot enjoy anything and you're missing the damn point.Critics and film scholars, being part of the Hollywood snobbery establishment, have always hated Cameron, and always will. They don't want to admit that cinema has always been at least as much about engineering and technological innovation as it has ever been about ""art"". These idiots just want to get to be the people who get to say what's true art and what isn't, but the reality is they're morons, the end.This is a great film. Go see it, and clap at the end, because it deserves it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The sea is our home before our birth and after we die."" Beyond the 3D visual spectacle that Avatar is, something we trust James Cameron to deliver, the franchise's beauty lies in its underlying spiritual arc and ode to continuity of life. Life finds a way. It evolves no matter the surroundings as love is transformative.Humans call the Na'vi 'hostiles and insurgents', when it is they who forcefully infiltrate and occupy their land. Despite its magical, fictional setting, Avatar is not devoid of socio-political themes. It addresses race, civilisation, takes a strong anti-military stand and makes a plea for environment conservation through its simple story of parents and children. A spectacular climax revolves around parents protecting their children and vice versa.From lush jungles to the gorgeous reefs... the action shifts from forests to the sea this time around and it's equally meditative and hypnotic. For over three hours you find yourself immersed in the enchanting world of an oceanic clan (Metkayina) or the reef people who give Sully and his family a refuge from humans. The sequel scores high on action and emotion. One is not compromised for the other. 'Happiness is simple. The Sullys stay together. This is our biggest weakness and our greatest strength,"" says Jake Sully and the story embodies that spirit. The tale isn't unique per se but the storytelling and visual excellence are otherworldly epic. Mounted on a massive scale, not once do you find yourself wanting to return to the real world.While the predecessor set the bar high for visual effects 13 years ago, the new film takes it a step further. Like the previous film, the director does not use 3D as a gimmick but uses it artfully to accentuate audience immersion in the world and story. Avatar: The Way of Water deserves be watched in IMAX 3D. It is the greatest immersive cinema experience of the year - world building at its finest.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sequels can be complicated to make. If a film raises curiosity about what could happen next, it makes sense for a sequel to happen. The ending of Avatar fulfills this standard. While most people have been skeptical about Avatar: The Way of Water's potential success, my viewing of the film convinced me that there are plenty of good reasons why it deserves recognition.While the tone and genre are the same as in the previous movie, the premise is fresh. Avatar: The Way of Water has a fair balance of old and new elements. Even if the concept is familiar, James Cameron applies new themes to tack onto the story and characters.Prominent themes in the film include family, emigration, racism, and trust. Like the first film, the sequel shows how destructive war can be. However, this film sparks the conversation about invading another nation and the violent tactics used during an invasion. Another message I liked was how it's good for children to guide their parents rather than always just the other way around. Each generation has its differences regarding values and beliefs, which makes it challenging for Jake and Neytiri to trust their children. Fortunately, they learn to build their trust. Cameron manages to take the characters forward with their journeys, both story-wise and with character arcs. Even with characters that died in the previous film, they are not forgotten in the sequel. I was initially skeptical about Miles Quaritch returning after Neytiri killed him at the end of the first film, but I think The Way of Water did a good job handling his resurrection. Well actually, he doesn't entirely return in this film. His memories have been implanted into the body of a Na'vi, which was an exciting concept. New characters like Jake and Neytiri's children were well-written. Spider was a cool and likable character. It was also interesting to see the film expand on the Avatar universe by introducing the Metkayina clan and displaying the beautiful underwater creatures and lifeforms.The visual effects and cinematography are just as stunning as they were in the first film; they have the potential to earn Oscar nominations. The underwater sequences were both gazing and astonishing. The film has lots of exciting and satisfying action sequences. There were plenty of moments in the movie that were intense and emotional, which were well-made thanks to James Cameron's excellent direction.While it's sad that James Horner didn't get to compose this film, his replacement Simon Franglen did a fantastic job. I loved The Weeknd's song in the end credits.In addition to the characters, the performances are excellent, although I'm mixed about Sigourney Weaver playing Kiri. She's the daughter of the late Dr. Grace Augustine, whom Weaver played in the original film, so it makes sense for her to play the role. But still, Weaver is 73. While they could've kept Weaver's facial recognition for motion capture, a younger voice actress would have been more convincing.The biggest complaint the film is going to receive is its three-hour runtime. A long runtime can only be forgivable if the film uses that time wisely and provides enough content to keep the audience engaged. I believe Avatar: The Way of Water accomplished that. If the storyline and character arcs are essential, the film must take its time. While the beginning was a little rushed, the rest of the film had a good pace.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water makes a good sequel, and it was definitely worth the wait. I look forward to the subsequent sequels to witness the continuing journey of our heroes and villains, as well as the expansion of the Avatar universe. The big screen will be the best way to view this film. You can see it in 3D if you want to capture the extraordinary experience; otherwise, Dolby or IMAX are good alternatives. Either way, you'll have a fun experience with this action-packed sci-fi film with excellent storytelling.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's totally breathtaking (especially if it's experienced on 3D Dolby Atmos), enjoyable, not at all tiring despite its long runtime and with a powerful message about the destruction of the environment by people, that don't learn by their mistakes (the mass destruction they caused on Earth). It is also solid proof that James Cameron hasn't lost his ability on making blockbuster films, and that is certainly a must-see blockbuster that undoubtedly it's worth the money! The characters, especially the children of Jake and Neytiri, are well-written, even though some changes and other characters remain relatively unexplored. On the downside, the script may not be the most original and the word ""bro"" is heard so many times that it will get on your nerves after a while, but these ""flaws"" can be easily forgiven in that absolutely thrilling movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat! I have no more to say, just see the movie on the big screen and be sure that you will get your money's worth! I have no doubt that it will win the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had high expectations from this movie and fortunately I was not disappointed by it. The direction which was made for one more time by James Cameron was simply exceptional and his work was obvious through the whole duration of the film. The plot was simple and at some points predictable but I enjoyed it and I found it interesting, too since James Cameron presented something new regarding Pandora and Na'vi in general. To sum up, I have to say that ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an amazing movie and I am sure that if you have already watched and enjoyed the first movie then you will simply love this one, too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I am one of those people who are skeptical with the idea of having a sequel to the highest grossing yet forgettable, to some audience, of all time. That being said, I remained optimistic and hoped that it would at least be good. And boy was I surprised by this movie. The Way of Water was not only great as the 2009 technical masterpiece, but was somewhat, better than I expected.In this movie, it does follow the same formula like the first one: you have your first act that has a lot of exposition and information needed to be made, the second act which is basically world-building around a clan, and then the third act which is nothing more than full on actions and emotions felt. Just imagine this plotline but with more emotions on high, dazzling spectacles in the bodies of water and amazing fighting sequences - that is how the Way of Water felt for me. Not to mention unlike Avatar, I was already in for the ride just from its second act which was a plus for me.With regards to the cast, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully is greater compared to his acting from the original. I connected with him a lot more as a family man considering he puts his family as his first priority. Britain Dalton, for the most part, was a standout character especially his connection with a certain whale and how he struggles to step up like his father Jake. Stephen Lang as Quaritch was developed a lot better as a villain though his return still feels like a mixed bag alongside Sigourney Weaver's depiction as Kiri since she doesn't act like a teenager that much. I wish I could see more of Zoe Saldana's Neytiri more in the next film if ever. And lastly, Jack Champion as Spider was difficult for me to understand as a character.But what I can say for the most part is that I was definitely enthralled by the visuals that James Cameron has done in almost 13 years of the film's production. I am inspired by him for how he was able to level up from the first movie and actually doubling down on the theme of environment. The water is definitely a great idea considering at this point of our lives, humans are also abusing the creatures and resources of the water. His activism does shine a lot and was not shoving down like other films with a social commentary would do. Not to mention there are scenes that remind you of his previous films like Titanic and even Aliens.Overall, I had an amazing time watching The Way of Water. For me, regardless of the same formula utilized from the first movie, it is where his film shines by using a simple story and making it a cinematic experience. While I am skeptical of seeing more of this in the future, I encourage people to watch this film to support theaters and filmmakers that have a lot of passion in creating films and putting it out for the world to see.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He placated us with beautiful CGI world-building to help compensate for two hours of minimal plot and character development followed by a predictable overdrawn 1-hour showdown between uncomplicated good vs. Evil characters.The protagonists' vulnerabilities? Moral ambiguity? Complex characters who are neither good nor bad but somewhere in between like real people?No.This type of movie, once common, recalls the cliche all-American movies of the early 2000s: It's centered on a nuclear family led by a smooth-talking stoic hero dad who risks everything to save his family, the fate of the world hanging in the balance.Difficult outcomes? Heavy losses? A challenging ending? Of course not.Miraculously the protagonists' primtive bow-and-arrow calvary take down an futuristic high-tech military fleet and yay happy ending!Luckily this time around we aren't made to sit through a sappy predictable Pocahontas love story like in the first Avatar movie, presumably thanks to prudent editors who amputated a budding love story sub-plot foreshadowed in the first half of the movie but never carried to completion.In sum, the movie is worth seeing only because it's pretty, but expect to lose some brain cells along the way.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

I felt that visually it was incredible but from a script perspective it was ok. So my only real hope for this film was that it gave me a great theatre experience with a more organized and thought out script. Did it do that, let's see.First and foremost James Cameron is the man when it comes to visually pleasing audiences. Every single shot of this film is extremely well crafted and is probably the most visually pleasing film I've ever watched on a big screen. The underwater shots in particular were phenomenal. I had a hard time telling what was CGI and what was not, which is just another testament to Cameron as a director.The action sequences looked incredible and I couldn't help myself from comparing the action in this film and the action in the latest Black Panther. Both have major action scenes on and in water as well as a whole lot of blue people. The difference here though is that the action in this film is substantially better than in Black Panther. They used every aspect of the environment and created some epic action scenes.The other thing James Cameron excels at is immersing you into this world of Pandora. All the different elements that he showcases with his incredible cinematography are mesmerizing, he makes you feel like you're in the movie.From a writing and storytelling perspective I thought it was much improved from the original. The story focuses a lot on Jakes kids, which are all very compelling characters and the development was great to see. Jake and Neytiri take a little bit of a back seat, Neytiri far more so than Jake but I was intrigued enough by the kids that it didn't bother me. That's not to say we don't get some great moments from Jake as he has to balance life as a father as well as a leader. The antagonist was handled far better this time around, he was actually given some development outside of the regular ""kill them all"" mentality from the first.I did feel there were a couple of under developed storylines that seem to have been important when they were introduced but by the end of the film didn't seem to have that big of an impact. Obviously this is spoiler free so I can't share what those subplots are but I think viewers will notice them. My other issue with the story is once the film is done there didn't seem to really be a resolution. We get this big conflict and that specific conflict does end but what the movie was setting up was not resolved. It felt like a midseason finale more so than the end of a film.Overall Avatar: The Way of Water was an improvement upon the original. With James Cameron providing a phenomenal theatrical experience and a better written story fans of the first should be excited to watch this on the biggest screen they can find.8/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

No one doubts his ability to craft engaging action films and to innovate.This? Nothing new being told, a lot of mish-mash scenes of chaos, no emotional investment, exhausting action scenes, too in love with its own mythos to ever ask, ""Will the audience care about any of this?"" I barely did.Of course it's way too long. It becomes an exercise in audience-endurance.It also shouldn't have had a sequel. If you want to do a sequel, take us to a new planet, new race, new story. Maybe show us a little bit of Pandora, if you wanted to tie up loose ends, then move on to a new planet, and explore the universe a little more. It's 13 years later and we're not that excited to see this tribe again.I need not get into the plot holes, they've already been covered here thoroughly. The story is so poorly constructed.It's hard to believe the sequels will be better. How do you drag this non-story out for three more movies? What is there to tell?

The CGI in the ""Avatar"" films do not merely serve the purpose of creating a razzle dazzle on screen but also to build an immersive experience that will soak you into the space that these characters inhabit. You have to be a part of Pandora to relate to these characters and Cameron goes leaps and bounds in infusing emotions into the Na'Vi characters whose every blink, sorrow, joy is not just brought about by the skill of the actors behind the blue skin but also a contribution of a revolutionary CGI that cuts through the blue skin and lets those emotions have an uninhibited reach into the audience's mind.The transition from land to water was not done haphazardly. Cameron takes it slow and as our characters learn the nitty gritties of this new world we learn with them the ways of the new clan. The creatures do not just come and go as fantastical beasts in this new world, rather we spend enough them to emotionally connect with them (just like Loak or Kiri in this film). As Loak and Kiri and Tuk go on a journey with these creatures, we are pulled into this journey with a magnetic pull that you cannot resist. As in the first part, Cameron once again delivers strong environmental message not through heavy-handed dialogues but through the actions which are a part and parcel of the greater narrative. We have message against depleting resources, against whaling and killing of protected species and speaks wholly in favour of environmental conservation.The actors are all brilliant, be it the recurring actors - Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, or Sigourney Weaver - or the new actors Cliff Curtis to Kate Winslet to the child actors playing the offsprings of Jake and Neytiri. In particular, Zoe and Sigourney are outstanding.The story is simple. But simple doesn't mean lacking or bad. Cameron loves keeping his plots simple but the storytelling technique leads up to an immersive experience, you will laugh, cheer, applaud, and cry. Yes, it is long clocking 192 minutes. The first half could have done with some cuts but never for once it will make you raise an eyebrow or look at your watch.You cannot also ignore the sound designers, sound mixers, the production designers and music composers and the cinematographer Russell Carpenter, all of whom gave their best to make the 13 years long wait worth every minute, worth every penny. And yes Cameron gets the emotions right this time too.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Visually Stunning - Same Story, 2 Less Stars Than The 1st Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9042418/?ref_=tt_urv","joncj5","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16497583/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2023","Being single and going alone, I waited until the last few days before pulling to see this in the theatre and found not a lot after the wait. The first few seconds brought tears to my eyes solely due to the visuals; that happened at the first movie too. After that, I found myself enjoying the view, more than the story. When you wait so long after the first film, it's almost hard to remember what the deal was about. I also think too much was revealed about how these movies are made, and that I spent some time critiquing the technological aspects, which I know nothing about anyway.I wasn't happy about some of the necessary evils within the story Cameron thought necessary and think that the extreme violence was inconsistent with otherwise ""R"" rated language that was nearly not used. Only once was the F-bomb dropped, and by a kid at that; one more and the rating would change. My point being, if you can brutally kill on screen, then you shouldn't have to watch your language. 13 year olds are quite used to both and if the violence didn't qualify for a more mature rating, then no language could either. I felt like such language was also necessary, given what was going on, and that we simply speak like that every day.This film is more about visuals than story, because the initial idea has already been covered in the first one. While the story idea is a good one, it never seems to have a conclusion. It is as though we are just living daily life with the Na'vi forest Omaticayas and their new aqua Metkayina friends. Other than that, it is just a continuation of hate and revenge between the same two main characters. That fight just happens to take place in front of the most stunning backdrop I have ever seen. It was that which took my breath away immediately and kept me captivated; not particularly the story, since I had already seen that in the first film. Unlike some films that feature different antagonists in each iteration, this one doesn't. I'm not sure another would work given the story, but the same one does get on my nerves, especially when he always gets away.I did not feel cheated at the box office (3-D $8.50 Tuesday deal). I'm glad I saw it, but had I known how anti-climactic it would be, I wouldn't have anticipated it with such excitement. Since the film has set itself up for another sequel, I have already decided not to get excited again and will most likely not see it. I see very few movies in theatres, so I am a little different in my choices, mostly due to the outrageous admission prices and secondly because I do most everything by myself. In this case, the same antagonist is in these two, and guaranteed to be in the next and I am sick of him not being taken out. The character cannot be redeemed, forgiven or allowed to even live after the destruction he has caused and the only reason he is there is because there are no others who want to destroy Pandora's inhabitants. Once he is done, there is no more story, and I simply don't want to handle him anymore. My prediction for the next is he'll be gone in the first few, then someone will take his place and the whole thing starts over again.I had to see this film just because. I was blown away with the first and expected to be further by the second. I wasn't, but that isn't to say I didn't enjoy it. I would add that I did not move from my seat the entire film for anything, which is a caveat of being single, alone and loving it. I have forgotten what it's like to have someone watch a film for me while I take a short break, so I don't. As it turned out, I did have time to go to the mens' room, get popcorn and a drink (if I were inclined to spend that much) and wouldn't have missed anything important. It did not take 3:15 hours to tell this story, but I didn't have anything else on my schedule, so I didn't mind that part. Cameron need not apologize for the run time, because as I stated, the visuals are stunning and I did not look at my watch until the movie was over. The last film 10, this one, not so much but still outstanding.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Directed by James Cameron (""Titanic""), the film that became the highest grossing film of all time made history and changed the way cinema was made forever. With this baggage, any franchise would have a huge responsibility when it comes to producing a sequel. Cameron's dream has always been to continue the stories of Pandora and the Na'Vi population in the best way possible. After revolutionizing the use of 3D in cinema and popularizing the use of motion capture, the Oscar-winning director saw the need to break (once again) paradigms and deliver a sequel that not only honored the legacy of the original, but also elevated the level of technical perfection. In the end, we see another spectacle that again inherits some narrative defects from the first adventure.The beginning of ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is eye-catching. The look is even more polished. So much so that the level of detail in this world full of textures that seem organic is frightening. Resuming the parallel with the films from the Marvel Universe - the biggest stars in Hollywood at the moment -, there is no comparison between the images from James Cameron's new film and those that come out of the production line of the publisher that became a film studio. Back to the plot, in this initial moment evil is back, but now also in the form of avatars. The story's big aggressor is Quaritch's blue backup (Stephen Lang), the military leader who died in the first film. Escaping from Pandora's immune system, her squad representing humanity creates terror to the point that Jake's family is forced to abandon the forest in search of a safe place. The first part of the film is an introduction that reiterates the human shadow and highlights the suffering due to the imminent scenario of non-belonging. Jake deals with his children's stubbornness in a disciplinary manner, which triggers the main theme of the second part: the rise of young people to protagonism. When welcomed by the people of the waters of Pandora, the members of the stray family are crossed by complex issues that include obedience, rebellion, adequacy, love, learning and losses.In order to give younger people space in the second act of the film, James Cameron transforms Jake into a counselor who occasionally appears to decide right and wrong. In this exuberant interlude, in which Pandora's underwater fauna and flora are showcased to exhaustion, Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) becomes the most central figure. Son of Jake and Neytiri, he falls in love with the heiress of the local village, has character-forming adventures and resents the fact that he is passed over as a warrior for his older brother, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters). However, as the film is too concerned with visual sumptuousness, these affective and psychological trajectories are abbreviated to the point of becoming footnotes. Lo'ak is not defined by filial anguish nor does he have sufficient reasons to identify with a marine being considered a pariah. Using didactic devices, such as sea hunting in which each movement is explained as if we needed a manual, the experienced James Cameron weakens the emotional speech that will later be used again as firewood to burn during the climax. While visually everything seems extraordinary, the feelings at play are refined from an ordinary perspective. However, they are not very dense and deep.An interesting point about ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is how it uses allusions and referential images to generate engagement. Spider (Jack Champion) is a decal of Tarzan - even called ""monkey boy"" -; Quaritch taking the skull from his human body directly refers to the ""to be or not to be"" moment in the play Hamlet, by William Shakespeare; The hunt for the sea animal, especially the obsession of the ship's captain, is a reference to Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick. However, there are three elements that do not support significant symbolism. Spider quickly loses its importance, not even justifying the blood bond with the enemy as something dramatic enough. The indirect quote from Hamlet could mean that the villainous soldier has Shakespearean contours, even more so when he discovers that the son of his human predecessor now acts on the side of the enemy. Unfortunately, it is nothing more than a moment of tribute to the bard. Just it. The sailor's fixation on the enormous prey that can give him unimaginable profitability does not have enough time to be more than a simple symptom of capitalist ambition. Therefore, James Cameron demonstrates an interesting repertoire of references, but uses them without much dramatic relevance. The feature film goes from a somewhat empty core to catharsis at the end.Even though the film returns to scenarios and situations already known to the public, the visuals dazzle thanks to the rich texture details, the lighting work and even the play with the speed of frames per second during the scenes. It is an impressive spectacle not only for the grand action scenes, but also for the more intimate moments. The film uses technical advances to bring the Na'vi closer to the public, making them palpable both through visuals and through the drama of a family fleeing the horrors of war. And if the view is already fascinating on dry land, the production doubles the bet by taking the Sully family to take shelter with the aquatic tribe. Remaking the mechanics of presenting the wonders and peculiarities of a new world, ""The Way of Water"" surprises once again with its imagination and execution capacity.There is a long-held concept that ""water movies"" are expensive and difficult to make, in part because the result is usually not convincing enough for the public. In love with the idea of aquatic filming since ""The Abyss (1989)"", which he built on the historic success of Titanic, and followed it during its documentary phase, James Cameron takes the challenge to heart and creates some of the richest sensory experiences in cinema in the last years. The result of years of preparation behind the scenes, the arrival at Pandora's reefs transmits all the excitement of the filmmakers to the public. To the horror of those who demand the cutting of scenes that don't advance the plot, this second part deliberately stops everything to show characters connecting with sea life. For the film, exploring the new scenario is as important as the plot itself, in the sense of existing as a work of cinema. What other form of art would be capable of generating millions of dollars in the construction of cutting-edge technological devices to record the actions of human beings amidst a ballet of alien aquatic creatures? And more: doing it in the most realistic and passionate way possible?Of course, such charm would be empty without a story behind it, and this could be the issue that will divide the ""Avatar"" audience once again. The plot does not escape a simplism that sometimes leaves something to be desired. Even using shameless sincerity when literally saying that it has no answers for certain situations at the moment, the text also falls into traps that make the story unnecessarily dated. It doesn't help that ""The Way of Water"" has trouble bringing together different plots in a fluid way. In its megalomania, the production is unable to naturally insert the reminder that evil is surrounding the protagonists. The warnings that the villains are approaching end up looking more like interruptions than an integral part of the story that the film is really interested in showing. This is a frustration that arises because, from the beginning, the film's script appears to be far superior to the original ""Avatar"".As an extension of the family theme comes the whole aspect of the relationship between society and nature, already part of the first film in the franchise and really the flagship of this second. Everything that happens can be interpreted from the perspective of the importance of recognizing the world around us as part of us, in addition to criticism of humanity's capitalist view of nature. But this story finally cares about the characters enough to give them personality, arcs, and charisma. It's no surprise that it's a plot that focuses so much on family and fatherhood - themes that are very important to James Cameron's previous work. Proof of this improvement is precisely when two cores that don't work very well separately come together. In addition to putting an end to the strange intercalation between these axes, this junction begins a climax so powerful that it practically erases from memory the strangeness experienced up to that point. Especially when we realize that every feature previously introduced as part of the initial exploration returns to make the action scenes even grander. In retrospect, it's curious how the big battle in ""Avatar 2"" echoes so many of the great moments in Cameron's filmography. It is possible to draw parallels with several classics mentioned above, as if the filmmaker drew on the screen that everything he did before was, in some way, a preparation for what he does today.The action scenes are exciting and have urgency, making you worry about the risk. And we are inserted into battles with real consequences, making the scale of the threat increasingly dangerous. However, the Colonel's return to the plot is questionable, did he really need to return? It was clear that he will be the antagonist of this franchise, the question is whether this will be able to be sustained for longer. Well here, it already seems unnecessary. And it's certainly not for lack of creativity, we could have built something from scratch, or at least ended this character once and for all. Therefore, even with some reservations, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" shows that James Cameron can do it all. His strong convictions as a filmmaker, together with an excellent team that contributed greatly to this visual bang, make this one of the great films of the year.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Why does Hollywood always seem to think that the most important thing is personal brand and reputation and that that far outweighs actual performance?Having all the characters speak with a dialect (apart from Sully) was also a bit weird. If anybody would speak differently it would be him (since it's not his first language) so why is he the only one who speaks perfect Navi (translated to English)?All in all a very good movie but I wish that the producers would have been less blinded by stardom and more true to the reality of things.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film picks up where the first one left off and takes us on a journey to an even more mesmerizing Pandora. The world-building and special effects are absolutely mind-blowing and once again, James Cameron has pushed the boundaries of what's possible in terms of filmmaking.The action set pieces are also incredible, they are thrilling and I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The addition of ocean creatures was a great touch and it was a pleasure to see the variety of new life forms that Pandora had to offer.The performances were also fantastic, Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana once again deliver strong performances as Jake and Neytiri and it was great to see them reprise their roles. The new characters also added depth to the film and it was great to see a new perspective on Pandora.The story was engaging and kept me hooked from start to finish. It was a bit slower than the first movie but it gave the audience a chance to fully immerse themselves in the world of Pandora. The themes of family and protecting one's home were present throughout the film and it was a great addition to the story.Overall, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a visual feast and a cinematic masterpiece that should not be missed. The film is a must-see in theaters and I highly recommend experiencing it in 3D. I would rate it an 8/10, it may not be perfect but it's a wonderful addition to the Avatar franchise.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Taking place nearly 20 years after the events of the original w/the Navi happily living their best lives but then the pesky humans come back, w/a slew of the deceased marines (now inhabiting avatars which they downloaded their consciousness into) ready to retake what's theirs, especially after the military general, played by Edie Falco, states the Earth is dead for its inhabitants, so all bets are off. Focusing on getting a hold of the Sully family w/their 3 hybrid kids along w/Sigourney Weaver's daughter (w/her playing the part) who's birth father at this point is unknown & a human baby boy left behind during the original's Terran exodus which they raise as their own. Formidable enough to send the Scullys fleeing from their tree habitat, they soon lose themselves in a cluster of islands to hide among the sea Navi who take them in as their own (as long as they learn their ways) which opens up the bulk of the middle section of the film as the kids relearn their skill sets w/Weaver's daughter particularly adept at the new setting (setting up a mystical connection future films will probably explore). As the pursuing Marines close the gap in finding the Scullys, partnered w/the human boy who was captured in an early melee (& turns out to be Stephen Lang's son), future installments are well stocked & set up w/lives lost on both sides. Ambitious, even for typical Cameron standards, to the extreme w/world building (quite literally!) to span across another 3 films can be daunting for a mere mortal but Cameron who has surrounded himself w/at least 5 other writers are making this franchise something that will give Star Wars & the MCU a run for its money (again breaking records w/the fastest film reaching a billion dollars already) & other than some details brought up quickly & glossed over (perhaps something that'll be fleshed out later), the film is still a marvel to behold & entertaining to boot.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.","33 out of 63 found this helpful.

The most visually stunning movie to ever been seen before. It brings heart and a new depth to existing and new characters. The meaning of family is tested and really explored through the relationships seen. Every character is worthy of their own arc, and I hope to see more of the Metkayina Clan in Avatar 3. The beauty of this film is felt on all aspects, in heart, acting, and the setting. This film wows in 3D and 2D. I'm still in awe by the beauty of Pandora. Exploring new areas of this fantastical moon adds a new level to world Cameron has already worked so hard to build. The Way of Water is a worthy successor to the highest grossing film of all time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first Avatar movie had already passed through years and people have been waiting for it for already decades, and now it's here! When the first movie just ever got released, I was very little yet to watch it on theatres but I had a first glimpse of that movie when my Dad is watching it on his TV. Years later, I decided to watch the first Avatar myself and it's Remarkably Gorgeous! And this time, after watching the first one, I'm already anticipating for the second one to got released and the trailer just got dropped in the media!! Months later, I watched it on theatres and what in the name of Eywa did I just watched..... IT'S FREAKING BEAUTIFUL!!! Calling for all of the Visuals, Characters, World Building, Culture, and the Eye-Catching Creatures are just so mind blowing! The story is so simple that made me easy to munch to it and focus on more of the beautiful world of Pandora! I may call this a masterpiece because James Cameron is a kind of a director that was so creative, so talented and so productive that madd this things all happen that made a massive world phenomenon!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I've got to say I'm on the side of those praising it. Thinking it's equel to the first.The effects are of course still up there, and there's some excellent bonus underwater stuff. But it's a better story and the characters are better. The beginning is a bit of a stretch. But I got more into what was going on overall this time around. So it's got what any effects movie should have plus the great visuals on top of that.I was invested in what was happening to all the new kid characters here. As I knew there was too many of them for them all to make it. I usually can't be doing with too many annoying kid characters in a movie, but they all made for a less predictable plot.Plus I'm always won over by a good bad guy and this one has that great snarling villian. They're also the best character done in motion capture. Really adding an extra something to the movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I expected rather a different story.However, I still put a 10 because this is a true eye pleasure, especially for those who wonder and fantasize exotic alien planets, their fauna and.flora.

CGI's pretty hollywood standard to me, nothing special, the messaging is simple, not to politically lean to either side of the spectrum, draggy at some parts, dialog's okay, the interactions and the dynamics between the characters sometimes felt too rushed despite this movie being more than 3-hour long. It's pretty clear from the ending and the mystery box Cameron put in this movie that there will be a third movie, though I'm not pretty excited for that (dunno, hollywood fatigue maybe?) and I think the first movie is still better in delivering the story and the worldbuilding aspect, this one overall feels like Cameron needs to tell you what happens after the first movie without so much expansion on his Avatar-verse.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When you come out of the cinema you feel like you've come out of a different place. It can be due to both how visually engrossing the movie is or because of a great screenplay and characterization. Avatar The Way of Water definitely falls in the first category (goes without saying) and how. I think I can definitely say that this is the BEST visual experience I have had in a theatre.I had my reservations about this movie when I saw the trailer. The trailer didn't feel much different than the previous film and also considering how so many movies come with high budget visual effects these days as compared to 2009. But when you watch this on an IMAX screen you will realize why the trailer wasn't really impressive because you'd need the visual medium to go with it. This movie felt like I was watching a game and in a very very good way. Back in 2009, Avatar had impressed me visually but I hadn't seen it in IMAX. This time around you'd have to give it to James Cameron's detailed efforts and the movie visually justifies all the research and time he has put it in. The movie starts in Pandora and it immediately takes you back to the familiar world which we had seen 13 years ago. However, the movie goes to a whole new dimension when the world (or should I say way) of water is introduced. The underwater visuals are mind blowing and it is much better than what I thought they would be. A few scenes are beyond a human mind's imagination. The people who walked in late in front of the screen in the theatre post interval with their food and beverages looked underwater, that's how good the visuals and 3D effects are! It is safe to say that James Cameron has started another revolution in the movie making this one.Avatar's (2009) plot wasn't a groundbreaking one but it still was gripping and many characters had a great emotional arc. The Way of Water's plot is pretty simple and straightforward and also continues from where we left off previously. There are many moments where one can easily guess what happens next and also what caused something. The set up for the sequel is pretty obvious as well, unlike the first one. This movie finds it very difficult to establish an emotional connection between its characters and the audience. There are way too many characters (especially teens and kids) and some are written for a very obvious role. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana almost kinda play the supporting roles here and I really missed their chemistry which was seen in the first movie. Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver are back again (you'll know why) but this time their characters don't really make the impact as much as the previous one. I would have definitely loved to see some changes especially with respect to those two characters. Apart from that there are many supporting characters and some usual suspects who try to bring the humour and the classic 'human' overconfidence. There are some great goosebump moments in some frames, however the same cannot be said with respect to the action sequences. Some of the new animals introduced this time probably connected with me better than the speaking characters :P Although the background score is pretty good, I feel there was some room for the element of surprise. I wish there was one classic theme associated with the movie like how the Terminator, Star Wars and Indiana Jones are remembered. However, all these shortcomings don't affect your viewing experience in any way.Avatar: The Way of Water is groundbreaking (literally and figuratively) in many ways for a modern day cinema where every other movie comes with top notch visual effects. Unfortunately a lot of experience is dependent on one watching it in IMAX 3D. I believe that it wouldn't be the same if one watches in 2D or at any average 3D screen. So I'd recommend you to wait for the chance to get to see this on an IMAX screen in case you don't have easy access to one.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not that the storyline is anything fresh or mind blowing, but that there are so many elements to the movie that are done so well. As expected, it's a visually captivating film. I made sure to see it on the biggest screen possible. I wasn't disappointed. The underwater sequences in IMAX 3D made this movie more than a story, it's an experience. There were times when it really gave me the sense of being under water. James Cameron knew he was giving us something beautiful to look at, so he made sure there are plenty of scenes just showing off the scenery, colors and interesting sea life. But The Way of Water is more than just a treat for the eyes.When the action really takes off during the final third of the film, it's thrilling. I would even describe the battle action as epic. It's surprisingly brutal given its PG-13 rating. The story even managed to make me a bit emotional as my eyes welled up with tears a couple of times. The Way of Water has a daunting 3 hour and 12 minute runtime, but to its credit, it didn't feel that long. I was very pleased with how well this sequel works as a standalone. I haven't seen the first Avatar film since that first time in 2009, but this film made me want to go back and finally watch it again. I think this may be a case where I will like the original film more as a prequel to this one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The older brother's heavy responsibility to the middle child rebellious behaviors, to the the youngest innocence and a sister thats adopted but yet made the family whole!!I liked how it answered things and left some unanswered so we have somethings to look forward to. This is a great build up for what is to come in the upcoming movies parts !!I think James Cameron is genius as far as waiting out for a great franchise to die so he can build upon this franchise! Great timing , great movie, excellent details in a good story 👌","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","I loved the original, but the sequel was disappointing from a thematics perspective","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8759936/?ref_=tt_urv","therealgreenrocket","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur159697885/?ref_=tt_urv","27 December 2022","Dang. I know a lot of people probably enjoyed the movie, but I was pretty disappointed after watching Avatar 2 (despite its beautiful visuals, anti-imperialism/explotation reflective themes, and intended Indigenous homage), at least after having personally loved the original Avatar film so much.However, having originally been so excited and hopeful for this sequel movie before watching it-yet while also having heard some criticisms of the film, and also negative responses from Indigenous people who had disliked the movie and the Indigenous representation and themes done by it-my biggest complaints with James Cameron's Avatar 2 are these, despite loving some of his other movies.1) White Saviorism, thanks Mr. Jake Sully - one solid criticism I wondered about before watching the movie, particularly from seeing other indigenous peoples' criticisms, but definitely the underlying theme of the whole white saviorism of this brilliant random White guy from Planet Earth who was able to come and solve all the Indigenous' problems for them. As in real life has historically been seen countlessly scrutinized about by other more fortunate, non-indigenouous cultures and individuals, and still today seen within indigenous societies and the problems they face.2) Weak Script, ""bro"" - this movie not being as strong as the original Avatar in terms of script writing and plot, and kind of obnoxiously laughable at times (like how many times ""bro"" was probably said in the movie) while the original Avatar did excellent in its execution in its symbolism and themes, and strong plot narrative in comparison.3) Patriarchy and Gender Stereotypes out the wazoo, ""Sir"" - a super patriarchal world, hitting from the leading patriarch, father figure of the protagonist who military-trains his sons to lead and protect the sisters, and only refer to him as ""yes sir"" (only the ""sons""), and the men who coordinate, speak, and lead (from face value) amongst the clan nations. IN SPITE, of badass inclusivity in fight scenes with the women characters, and the one scene where protagonist says, ""Who I'm really afraid of here is the ""spiritual"" (emotions-intouch one obviously) woman, and not the male clan leader"", yet the movie then proceeds to have the women start arguing and the men slide glancing in the back before trying to defuse the ""emotional"" scene unfolding. We had a little bit of a giggle there in the theatre for the audience... also again, besides action scenes and the ""women get super emotional and crying"" scenes, men did not cry, only called each other bro or cool military nicknames, and did much of the plot leading. Also like shi, the hippie daughter character was my favorite, but the other women besides the female wife protagonist, did almost nothing for the movie plot.4) Based on Reflective Indigenous Imperialism & Environmental Exploitation, yet the ""natives"" are jumping around like damn monkeys - indigenous representation (and appropriation), again a big complaint by many, including particularly indigenous movie watchers, was questionable, and other scenes just embarrassing and disrespectful in the movies approach. From originally being created off the basis of reflecting Indigenous cultures and histories in real life that help culminate to create the indigenous people and plot of the franchise. From the ongoing conversation debate of the very obvious reference of Afro/Indigenous hair dreadlocks being used by white characters; to this one aspect of the film that got me, the constant scenes I'm sitting there wondering, ""Why tf are the Indigenous natives jumping around and crawling looking like monkeys, hissing their teeth like savage animals, and hooting in more so inaccurate fashions than some traditional Indigenous linguistics, but instead sounding like some scene from ""Planet of the Apes"" and coming off as just a laughable, classic Western-percieved mockery at times.5) Boo Yah, Let's Go Soldier Culture - militant culture in this film was, contrary to the original film I felt, seemed more glamorous and ""hollywoodized"" for ""badass"" action sequences and cool effects. In spite of the disgusting whole film's theme of the imperialism and colonialism of this (Western) foreign people, and their hyper-masculine, machismo military ""bombing tf out of everything green and different to themselves"" culture.6) Swear to God, I don't remember seeing one Black person - diversity casting was lacking (despite this franchise, at least original movie, being so progressive in its themes and topics). Besides a VERY few Afro/Indigenous voice acting you can hear and who were casted, all the ""foreigners"" crew in the movie were even more predominantly White than the first film... however, that could be argued as reflecting the nature of Western, more White imperialism and colonization of Indigenous lands and genocide as seen in history, that are again some of the film franchise's biggest themes it reflects and was based on.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Visually out of this world ( like the first one) , but it also delivers the same effect either, however it is 2022.I dont want to judge other people's opinion, but if somebody tells you that the story/script is boring just finish the conversation with them right there as politely as possible. The Way of Water is about family and their emotional connections with each other and with the Na'vi's environment, which were perfectly shot/captured/presented throughout the whole moovie.The score is impeccable, not to mention The Weeknd's soundtrack during the post credit.The only reason why i didn't give this masterpiece a 10 is ,that i'm very looking forward to the upcoming sequels, where i will want to be blown away by the ending (character improvings, final battle etc..) . I also would be very thankful if Mr. James Cameron won't leave the director chair until the end, because if somebody could fulfill the fans expectations, it's HIM.In summary, if you love cinema, and visually stunning films you have to experience Avatar 2. In IMAX. However it was 13 years ago when the first chapter came out , in my opinion it was completely worth the wait!Best regards,
A fan from Hungary.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I could see that being true in the overall forest sense. But in the tree sense, there was a plot.It seems this movie chose to focus on relationship and interactions. It's as if you erased the avatar aspect of the movie, you'd be watching an episode of full house, step by step, family ties, etc.I think they'll could have fixed the large forest problem in the plot of they made it so that they were trying to take down Jake Sully for a better reason. Like he had was trying to lead the resistance, he knew too much, so they need to get rid of him for safety. Then, there should be plots of them organizing to fight a resistance. Instead, to the plot seemed more trivial. If they created a letter of the resistance needs to be killed plot like in Terminator 2, that would have easily fixed the plot... The forest plot... To be less simple.Now the tree plot.... If you erased the cool avatar aspect of it.... It feels like a bad episode of boy meets world it something.I was afraid of watching such a long movie. However, the movie didn't feel long. It felt like I was chilling at home(I saw this on the theater) and watched 4 or 5 different TV shows.I felt chill... First, I watched an episode of M*A*S*H, (which I did not sign up for!!!), (MASH is a sitcom about soldiers in the Korean war? Maybe Vietnam war.) I didn't like MASH, so I'm glad I next felt like I was watching an episode of Step by Step. Then, an episode Sea Quest, Save Willy, then an episode of Titanic... though that's not a show...Having so many transitions made the movie not feel long. It was good.I thought it would be gross to see mostly naked creatures. I thought they'd be ugly. But, in the movie, these creatures were really pretty and nice to look at.They are better looking than humans. I wish we were cuter. Oh well.I'm really jealous of these creatures. The weather on their planet Pandora is so nice. They can be outdoors in great beauty all the time. Have creatures to fly around or swim around on. I wish we lived like them.I'm bothered by how they portrayed the humans as so evil. It was a bit over the top. Maybe some are that evil, but they were acting official... So, I don't know.Cultural appropriation? I don't know.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Considering how recently these movies came out when compared to franchises like Star Wars, the Avatar films are the new intellectual properties in the genre. That there seems to be an overarching plan for the franchise gives me hope that James Cameron knows what he's doing. If Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) is any indication, he's done his homework with its world-building.I know people complain about the weak plot of these movies; but maybe with the state of the world, we need to reiterate stories about the harmful effects of colonialism and capitalism. As always, the visual spectacle of The Way of Water is on par with-if not significantly better than-Avatar (2009). A lot of what you see on the big screen has been difficult to accomplish with CGI-until now, apparently. And sure, it's a bit hard to tell all the different Na'vi apart at times, but it doesn't detract from the experience.What strikes me most about The Way of Water is the world-building that continues to bring the planet of Pandora to life. Things like an eclipse providing moments of darkness and distinctly different Na'vi based on their environment of upbringing are excellent examples of the depth of thought that went into creating this sci-fi universe. And while this movie falls into the conundrum of being a sequel that requires another sequel despite the first movie being a strong standalone entry, I'm interested to see where this franchise goes from here.Another visually stunning sci-fi film that's burdened with laying the groundwork for future entries, I give Avatar: The Way of Water 4.0 stars out of 5.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

You jump right back in 13 years later like you just finished the first at the cinema. What an experience it was back then and what an experience it was again. Nobody can deny the beauty of the film. Visually it's one of the best pieces of cinema we've seen in a long time and will probably see for a while (until the next film that is). The story isn't quite as strong as the visuals. It's predicable, but then again so was the first. Some of the best scenes were the emotional one's which I think the film as a whole lacked enough of, such as the wasted romance with Tsireya. The narration during the film was great but there was so little for the mighty length of the film. Overall though the film had to introduce a lot, new characters, new villages and new relationships, but I felt they dealt with this well. It didn't drag, it wasn't so drawn out that you felt bored but it kept you invested enough throughout to want to see where it was all going, even if you could've predicted it all after the first 10 minutes.

That's why we'll be back for the third, perhaps not for the story, or the characters but to see what the beautiful world of Pandora has to offer, and to get the full experience you have to see it on the big screen!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now, Jake Sully's family begins to learn about his new life in the waters to become their refuge.Avatar: The Way of Water is the best and best film as the closing film of 2022. This second film has a much different quality from the first film. There will be a special experience, of course, in watching the new adventure story of Jake Sully and Neytiri and their families. Avatar: The Way of Water is a sequel set a decade after the events of the first film. Of course, this sequel presents the story of the Na'vi nation and life on Pandora which is explored wider and farther by James Cameroon. This second film presents a new tribe and a new life that is really explored more widely. To support this, of course, the image quality and CGI of this film is much better and more interesting than the first film. With the concept of the aquatic world, the quality and CGI presented really spoil the eye. The depiction of the waters and their contents is really well drawn and visualized and beautiful. Not to mention the combination of dominant blue with supporting colors of marine life material that also spoils the eyes and amazes us. This film provides its own experience to see and witness the beautiful visuals of the sea.Avatar: The Way of Water is a film that can be said to have strength and sell more in terms of visual quality than the plot and conflict. Indeed, the film presents a decade from the events of the first film. However, if you pay attention, this film is nothing but a place of revenge from Colonel Miles Quaritch to Jake Sully and Neytiri. Although there is a family conflict that provides a new story from the story of Jake Sully's life on Pandora. If we count, the film, which has a 3-hour runtime, has a 60% story plot to explain the life and introduction of new tribes on Pandora. While the rest is a build up of Quaritch conflicts and interesting final battles. Likewise, there is a conflict with Jake Sully who has now become a father and is responsible for his family. However, this film still gives an emotional side to the audience. Especially on Jake Sully's emotionally draining family conflict at the end of the film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Nobody has seen anything like this before! So what? Most of us (the earth people) are still watching without seeing... and many of us are still complaining about the ""plot holes""... The people with the physically intact eyes... and these ones are still so blind... Unfortunately!...
Blind to see the core conflict of our human (planetary) Civilization...
As the great Russian poet once put it writing:
""A fairytale is a lie (of course), but the right people see its Hint"".And that Hint, as seen from my subjective point of view, of the Avatar fairytale is as follows:""Sky People"" of ""Avatar"" are the obvious and picturesque representation of the Western Civilization from the planet Earth and its way of treating (oppressing) the ""indians"" and other human (intelligent) species from the ""rest of the world"".And ""Navi people of Pandora"" are representing the essential values and the core Spirit of the Russian Civilization and its way of incorporating the different nations into One (planetary) Civilization, which is NOT melting but safely keeping (defending and enriching) all unique pecularities of each kind.That is why ""quaritchies of all kinds"" hate Russia and Russians so much, I guess...God bless and protect James Cameron from ""the global quaritchies"" who think that Cameron betrayed ""their kind""!.. Just leave the director alone and let him finish his Universal work. Who knows, may be, Jake and Quaritch could finally make Peace.. Just because, they BOTH LOVE their children equally, at least... and because we, people of the Earth, don't and won't have another spare ""Pandora"" available! For obvious reasons Mars does not count. If you do not agree, just for comparison, rewatch the ""Ad astra"" (2019) with Brad Pitt. It is our cosmic reality and real perspectives on that account.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story generally is pretty much a predictable mash of what you'd expect once the setup is given: Qiddich returns tech reincarnated in a Pandoran bod by means of a ""backup"" recording of his brain before his mission. Realizing his original was killed by Sully, he goes on a vengence hunt. Meanwhile to avoid endangering his whole adopted tribe Sully packs his family and goes off far away.Overall the film is over long on the initial exposition and the battles .... a good editor would have insisted on leaning it down at least half an hour, and would have been right. But Cameron is such a towering figure that he could get things his own way no matter what.And I agree, go watch the movie. It's a great ride despite being over long to the point of tedious in some aspects. (these folk get themselves taken, rescued and then dive back in to be trapped again ... sometimes several times for the same character. Silly, but an excuse to keep the action going...)But there's one aspect to this film that's GREAT and rarely to never seen in other films I've seen ... something I'd say Hollywood as almost never come to grips with. Sadly it's overshadowed and underdone because of the other circumstances of the story .....That is the complexity and complications of relationships in a larger family! The amount of give and take affection and resentment between the older sibs and their father is VERY realistic, and likewise the inter family tension with the kids' relationship to their ""outsider"" friend whom they treat as virtually another brother while the mother particularly is barely tolerant to borderline hostile to him.As mentioned I almost never see this kind of nuance of familial relationships displayed to the point of becoming part of the story of a major film, and it would be easy to overlook as events quickly overshadow these interactions... but coming from a larger complex family, for me this nuanced interplay between the characters made them MUCH more realistic and my ability to empathize much easier.I wish more films would pay attention to realistic inter familial dynamics and integrate them into stories as well as this one does.Odd that it's done so well among peoples who are supposedly ""alien"" to us. I wonder if Hollywood has s some kind of fear portraying realistic family relationships, or simply that it's so hard to do in a visual medium.At all events kudo's to Cameron for this. It's not like he needed more accolades, but there it is. Another point of genius he's earned in my opinion.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This time around we follow the Sully family - Jake, Neytiri and their kids - as they face several challenges to remain safe. Set more than a decade after the original film, this instalment brings 3D entertainment to the next level.The narrative follows the Sully family as they navigate a world of danger and uncertainty. We witness their battles to stay alive, their lengths to protect one another and the tragedies that befall them. All these elements are intertwined in an amazingly crafted 3D adventure.The narrative of THE WAY OF WATER is a prime example of how 3D can be used to create a detailed, captivating story even though the narrative is nothing out of the ordinary. The visuals are stunning, the action sequences nail-biting and the characters are easy to relate to. Plus, the use of CGI enhances the visual spectacle even more.The acting performances in THE WAY OF WATER are also noteworthy. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) delivers an emotionally charged performance as the head of the family, while Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their children are equally impressive. The acting is even more impressive when you realise that the scenes shot underwater were actually done underwater with innovative new techniques and technology developed for something never done before! James Cameron has excelled once again with his directing and the entire crew has done a tremendous job in bringing this ambitious project to life.There is a plethora of themes explored throughout such as family, courage, and determination. The issues around colonisation and environmentalism also feature although avoiding the preachy clichés of some other sci-fi films.Although AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER is a little too long (over 3 hours!) and drags slightly in a couple of places, it is a splendid example of how 3D can be used to craft an unforgettable story that draws viewers in. It's gripping, visually stunning and emotionally engaging with captivating storytelling and performances - making it a must-see for fans and newcomers alike. Highly recommended! And make sure you see it on the biggest possible screen in 3D if you can!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm happy to say that the story, and characters featured, are a faithful and worthy extension of the world already created. With a few pacing issues, and a runtime that would make even a diehard kojima fan's head spin, there few things that I take issue with in this film.What truly set the original Avatar a head and shoulders above othst films of the time we're the visuals. I still remember seeing the home of the Na'vi for the first time and being in blissful awe of how far computer graphics have come. It's something truly special to be able experience the same leap in CG again. Even the less action scenes were still a feast for the eyes. It is all the wonderful sights that you would expect and more for a film bearing this name.Though I believe no film is truly perfect, I think that a 10/10 film is one that exceeds the value of the movie ticket. And that is, in my opinion, what Avatar: The Way of the Water does.In any case, this is a must see film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The 3D adds so much to the movie, and most of it is subtle. The sky people return to Pandora, with a vengeance. And target #1 is Sully and his family. The sky people have learned a lot since they were forced to leave, and they bring with them a twist. Since the presence of his family is most important, Sully flees to hide with the sea people. So the movie becomes a story of family and acceptance of a different culture, as Sully represents the forest people. One is introduced to a whole new world on Pandora, that of the ocean. And this is done visually stunning. There is a cultural tension. Yes, the movie is very long, but it really doesn't drag and the heavy action is towards the end. This is a movie that really has to be seen on a big screen, and the bigger the better. The special effects are in service to the story, not the other way around.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unbelievable graphics and action, looks amazing in every single way. JC's attention to detail is just fabulous, and it shows here. Cool new characters, great new machines, cool guns, great cgi and scenery to be spell bounded by. I loved the film, the the 3.5hrd just flew by. I don't know what people were expecting with this film, but it is superior to the first one , it moves quicker, looks better with great editing. Go see it in 3D if you can, it will blow your mind!! It is the best way to see it imo.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But at first.. i didn't expect much of Avatar 2, even though i found Avatar 1 quit brilliant.. the bar was set so high and you know there is no other way for the story to continue other then the sky-people returning to Pandora, as the Na'vi sure as hell are not leaving the planet on spaceships !What's noticeable technically is that the image so freakin SMOOTH and the 3D effect is actually working the way it should... i had to google afterwards to see if this wasn't actually 60 fps or something.It's indeed 48 fps, so double the frames and it enhances the 3d effect. No wonder people are so stunned by the visuals.The essence of the movie shows both the tribal/indigenous/spiritual side of human nature as well as great sci-fi tech. But it's all done in a convincing way, you will recognize both the technological side as well as the deeper spiritual meaning if you have any experience with either.There are SO MANY little things that make the movie satisfying to watch.In fact you feel the whole family and tribe vibes really well !There is too much to add in a review..One of the most CRINGY things in movies is when a new ""language"" is MADE UP... like in Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings or whatever. It's often CRINGY and just not done well... at all.Avatar isn't always perfect either in that department but it's OFTEN convincing and feels real with the emotion of the actors, VERY WELL DONE in that difficult area.The tiny flaws the movie has are worth mentioning to be objective, but the good side overshadows it.I've seen it only once ( so far ) but i just missed a little part of the story that explained how the general's son was suddenly there ? He's a very cool add-on, one i wouldn't have thought of myself to add, but it worked well. He's like a little Tarzan/mowgli or monkeyboy as they call him, VERY COOL.In fact the characters added are well designed and they add to the story.There is so much info one can add, but i rest my case..Even if you don't like sci-fi this can be a movie for you, as i've seen people love it who actively dislike the genre... simply because it's done so well.Avatar might sound silly on paper... blue aliens.... Who cares ?!But it's done in such a convincing and often recognizable way.It's a huge eye candy and GOOD-SPIRITS-FEST !A MUST WATCH !","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie score is beautiful . James Cameron still used James Horner´s score. The plot is not bad. Yes, it´s more than 3 hour long movie, but believe me, it´s worth the time and money.

After having seen the film, each viewer will understand that the story is about so much more than mankind destroying the beautiful planet Pandora and its friendly inhabitants, de Na'vi. Lots of hotly debated issues are part of the story. The message about ecological destruction is very clear, but the film also deals with the refugee problem, racism, the obsession with youth and health, religion, and the importance of the nuclear family. There's lots to talk about afterwards.At the same time, this is a blockbuster movie, and providing entertainment has clearly been the first priority of the film makers. The messages are there for those who want to see them, but they are not in-your-face as they were in, for example 'Don't Look Up'. There are many magical moments in the movie, but other scenes made me cringe because of their simplicity or sentimentality. I also was a bit annoyed by the simple good versus bad theme that dominates the screenplay.The movie is a showcase of the limitless possibilities offered by computer generated images. Many scenes are jaw-dropping. But at the same time, it struck me as too big, too exaggerated, too far removed from a simple, human scale. Only afterwards I realized that the teenage girl Kiri was played by 69 years old Sigourney Weaver. That's because I didn't see Weaver herself, I saw a computerized and distorted version of her.So is this a great movie? Yes. Anyone watching it will be amazed, will have a great time and will have something to talk about afterwards. Did it dissapoint me? Also yes. Because it prefers to be spectacular instead of sophisticated.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is basically a continuation of the message from the first movie, but I think in here it is shown even better in the form of the Tulkuns (Whales) and how the experience the world and how Avatars are connected with them. You get a very good feeling how cruel humans can be towards other living things and that we are prepared to do horrendous things in our self interest.The reason why I didn't give this movie a higher grade was, because the plot was designed in the way, that a lot of very unlikely scenarios had to happen so that, things turned out the way they did. I also found that recycling the villain from the first movie is a little bit of a ""cheap"" move and that there were better ""villains"" we could have had. And the thing I found most annoying was that the Na'vi are too humanised in a way, that the behave and speak like humans living in a modern 21 first century city. Given, that their culture, physiology and the structure of personality should be completely different from humans, they should never behave that similar to humans.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Top Gun Maverick gave me hope, and Avatar the Way of Water sealed the deal. It's a lengthy movie but for those who've missed the days of yore such as the LOTR trilogy, then 3 hours is nothing. From start to finish Avatar is a visual masterpiece, leaving me wondering what was real and what wasn't. I also must say I'm incredibly impressed with James Cameron managing to stick a whale in a green screen suit! Jokes aside, that's how visually epic this movie is, and it'll blow your mind just like the first one did if you saw it in theaters with the 3D glasses. The story is crafted delicately, allowing you time to be introduced to Pandora once again, the world, its culture, familiar characters, and completely new ones as well. It's a slow build, but well worth it, and once you get to the actual water you're just left glued to your seat. It was a breathtaking breakthrough of cinema once again. I praise James Cameron for being able to deliver again a masterpiece in cinema. Go see this movie! It's utterly incredible.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With the film costing about the same as a premier league football club, there was some serious pressure on box office returns. However, it did mean that Cameron had all the fancy toys that money could by in order to make it look good. And it did. Unfortunately money can't always buy a good story and this story was average at best, being very similar to the first film. I can aslo safely say that I haven't seen parenting that bad in a film since Kevin McCallister was left behind by his mum and dad in home alone. Furthermore, within the three hours we are treated to a twenty minute fishing sequence, which transported me back to late 2000s British televison programme Robson Green's extreme fishing. A welcome callback for me as it gave me a little break from the boredom that I was suffering. Although the film may recover its hefty budget, it is unlikely to linger long in the memory of world cinema. For me it was mostly just colours and noise washing over like the waves...

Using a higher frame rate can create a more realistic and immersive viewing experience, as the increased number of frames can make the action on screen appear smoother and more realistic. Believe it or not, it's a mind-blowing experience that I loved and love.James Cameron is known for pushing the technical limits in his movies, and Avatar 2 is no exception:He used high frame rate (HFR) technology in Avatar 2.The movie also featured groundbreaking motion capture work for the Na'vi characters.Cameron used a combination of practical and digital effects to create the creatures and environments of Pandora.The level of detail and realism achieved in the special effects is impressive.The story is straightforward In Pandora's world, Jake Sully is undecided between his loyalty to his own family and his duty to protect the Na'vi. Protecting his family and protecting the oceans are James Cameroon's concerns on Avatar 2.The actors' work was hilarious, particularly for the underwater shooting (many scenes were shot underwater in a very large pool made exclusively). Comedians learn new respiratory skills: 7.15 minutes for Kate Winslet (Ronal) and 6.5 minutes for Sigourney Weaver (Kiri).The technology behind Avatar 2 is breathtaking, for example: In underwater scenes, they used multiple motion capture cameras (Mocap cameras). James Cameroun has developed a device called THE DEEP X 3D. Which weighs less than 30 kilos and can be handled by one person and the actors themselves they wear a GoPro action camera.The Spirituality in Avatar 2 is too powerful, one can feel it and experience it during the 3-hour show. Neural tendrills help NA'VI connect to animals and land and even EYWA. How do we connect profoundly to ourselves and the natural world that surrounds us? With the connection of the divine anything can be accomplished. ""All energy is lent and that one day it has to be returned"", this sentence was said in the two films of Avatar and resume everything. All life is loaned and that one day must be given back to the divine.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster has raised the bar even higher, showcasing groundbreaking visual effects and an enchanting narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Here's a general review with some key highlights:1. Visual Spectacle Beyond Imagination
Avatar - The Way of Water continues the legacy of its predecessor with jaw-dropping visuals that redefine what's possible in filmmaking. Cameron's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology is evident in every frame. The underwater scenes are a sight to behold, and the bioluminescent world of Pandora is more enchanting than ever.2. A Return to Pandora
The film brings back the beloved characters of Neytiri and Jake Sully, portrayed by Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington, respectively. Their chemistry remains as captivating as it was over a decade ago, and it's heartwarming to see them reunited.3. New Faces and Fresh Stories
Avatar - The Way of Water introduces new characters and intriguing subplots, adding depth and complexity to the world of Pandora. Notable performances from Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis add new dimensions to the story.4. Environmental Message
As with the first film, Avatar - The Way of Water carries a strong environmental message. It explores the consequences of human exploitation and greed, underscoring the need for harmony with nature. The film's allegorical nature resonates deeply with our world's ongoing environmental challenges.5. Immersive 3D Experience
The film is tailor-made for 3D viewing. From underwater sequences to soaring flights on the back of Ikran, the 3D technology enhances the immersion, making you feel like you're a part of the action.6. A Cinematic Odyssey
With a runtime exceeding two and a half hours, Avatar - The Way of Water takes you on an epic journey through the breathtaking landscapes of Pandora. The pacing may feel a bit slow at times, but the grandeur of the world compensates for it.7. Enigmatic Soundtrack
James Horner's musical legacy is well preserved, and the soundtrack by Simon Franglen complements the film's emotional depth.In conclusion, Avatar - The Way of Water is a triumph for James Cameron and the entire team. It's a visual extravaganza that not only lives up to its predecessor but also surpasses it in terms of storytelling, world-building, and technological innovation. While it might not be a game-changer in the same way the original Avatar was, it's a worthy sequel that continues to immerse audiences in the breathtaking world of Pandora. Avatar fans and film enthusiasts alike will find this movie an unforgettable experience that's well worth the wait.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie was NOT supposed to be fast, it was supposed to be slow and long, the creators wanted the audience to familiarise themselves with the Way of Water and the characters pivotal to the future of Avatar.So go to the theatres and experience this mammoth spectacle!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And I see that in this movie and after 13 years and with the advancement of technology we will penetrate the magic and beauty of this world, we will see the old Pandora and a familiar side to us and a different and new side of this world. In more than one scene and more than one event I forgot that I am watching a movie scenes, I felt completely that I am inside this world. Also I thought that dealing with all that visiualizations will let them neglect the story side but they didn't Unlike the first part. The acting was amusing specially from Zoe Saldana I got her feelings in a wonderful way. Great movie that is worth seeing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first movie, for better or worse, really changed cinema. I can never replicate the same feeling I felt when watching the first movie in cinemas when I was at 9th grade at school. I was instantly drawn, and wanted to stay in this world as much as possible. I bought different versions on Blu-ray and watched them many times, even memorising some lines of the movie. It was truly something amazing. At least according to me, but as with all things popular it's gathered a lot of hate, memes and some infamy during the years. So it feels unreal to see the sequel appear while I myself have gone from being just a kid to becoming a full-fledged adult. And while some of the sights feel familiar and bittersweet I can say it feels great to be back in Pandora.The movie is great, it's what James Cameron is known for, perfecting sequels and making them into an experience that's bigger than its original movie, we saw that with Alien and Terminator. Here in the second movie of Avatar he does what he's always been fascinated by, water and the life surrounding it. Going to the sea was a brilliant move from the director that also feels like a natural extension of what Avatar really is. And many of its components are stunning, the design, the effects, the music are all fantastic.The actors do a great job as well, just as in the first movie.While this movie is great I think it has a few flaws and I think it's just mainly how this sequel is being written. It's a bit like how most sequels are written, bringing back the same antagonists but in another shape, kids of the protagonists etc etc. Some of it can feel a bit cliche but most of it makes sense when you watch the movie. Also with how the movie is going to end (no spoiler) I think they're gonna keep on this premise. I also think some plot points are smoothed over and there's some things that aren't really explained. Maybe it's because they want to keep viewers to see the sequel or something.As I watched the movie I was first a bit ambivalent because of my memories of how the first was and also the sound of the haters saying that I'm corny and stuff. But the movie has a charm that instantly takes over you as soon as they reach the sea, I damn near cried at some of the stuff that happens in the movie.So I guess I am corny, I like this, even if some of the plot feels familiar and even if it feels very bombastic but I still feel this movie deserves its flowers and just the amount of time it took to get here feels unreal. Go watch it if you have the time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When you walk into the theaters for Avatar you're expecting to see the highest level of visual effects cinema can possibly have and this film did not disappoint. Everything is painted with action sequences and music that make Pandora a living planet in our imagination. Clearly Avatar doesn't aim for the plot by moving on terrains already seen and not reinventing itself. The movie is really long for what it has to tell, but it still works with the formula introduced by James Cameron and you will not be disappointed if you think about the long process needed to create this sequel.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movies such as Avatar series just intend to infuse enormous exotic scenes and actions together with ugly and unsavory cast so that you forget the genuine beauty and to convince you that this would be the movie that justifies spending your money to pay for entrance ticket at this hard time of inflation and high interest rate and finally to convince you to accept the ugliness of the cast as something a la mode and modernity.In short; I desire to have my money and time back which is impossible; rather I urge you to keep the ticket money for this movie in your pocket and find a better way of using it than nurturing the producers that use ugly images in a colourful manner.","90 out of 194 found this helpful.

Thankful for the filmmakers like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro González Iñárritu, and Martin Scorsese. They realize the importance of creating art that you can only truly appreciate in the movie theater.This film is exactly why we love going to the movies. You are immediately drawn into the world of Avatar with the stunning cinematography. What made it better was the acting. Though there is CGI, the actor still has to emote the right intensity and feelings to capture a connection with the audience. The work that the actors did underwater was beautiful too. I know that they had to get special training for like a year to be able to free dive and act from 30 ft. Below. They all looked at ease and as if they were at home underwater.I loved that Kate Winslet was in this film.....plus the subtle nod to Titantic at the end. There were a few moments in the middle of the movie where it seemed that maybe it could have been cut out or down, but because it has been announced that there will be at least 2 more films, I believe this film was laying the foundation for those to come. You also have to remember that it has been over a decade since the release of the first movie. It's like we have to be reintroduced in a way.Overall, just like the first film, I walked away wanting to show more respect to our planet. The family dynamic was also very refreshing to see! I'm excited to see how they expand the storyline!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I enjoyed watching it in the cinema in 3D, though. Same here. Very enjoyable to see the next level 3D, but lack of good story makes it a one time show. But this next level 3D is incredible. Most of the action takes place literally on your lap? Add some reverberating seats -that makes your heart pounds out of your chest with each explosion- a recliner, and some pop corn and you're set up for a most memorable experience.The movie started with a fast pace, but then died out and became very slow for more than an hour- the National Geographic portion. Maybe this was intentionally to allow for better appreciation of the 3D effect. When the pace became fast again I could hardly notice the effects.It's all about Cameron in there. He is the director, producer, and writer! He had a team of writers to help. But I think he told them what scenes he wanted to direct. How to put in the story is not his job. He also decided to re-use Titanic set. It's just lying there so why not!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sequels usually disappoint more than satisfy. Since so much of the talk around the film surrounded about the technical feats and cgi, i was like uh-oh. But its the week before Christmas, why not.The story, although not original, it is very well put together. While the main story is about revenge and conquer. The film has many familial side stories that really made the film interesting to me. For me, it wasn't about the CGI. What won me over was the father-son dynamic between Jake and Quaritch's sons. It had conflicts and almost redemption. A unspoken attachment bond between father and son that is almost absent in today's modern Hollywood. Famly bonds between siblings too. The problems of fitting in to a new society when Jake's family self excile from the forest to live with the Neytiri to prevent further harm to the Navi people.Yeah, its the side stories in this film that really make it good. No, its not all original. Its a Native American vs US Cavary film we have seen over and over but wrapped in a Sci-Fi world. But it's so well put together that I didn't mind. What makes this film good isn't the CGI, its the multiple side stories within it. This makes it better than the original and will probably stand up against time as there are lots of thematic ideas about a person's role and responsibilities in society and family. This film can easily be watched a few times and we can pick up something new with each viewing.So yes, it was worth the 3.5 hour run time because it had very little filler and lots of story. I feel I got my money's worth at the box office.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It helps us as the viewer connect with the world more, but also understand the characters better. And while the plot may in some ways be simple, I think this simplicity is a strong point, not a flaw. The plot needed to be simple to not shift the focus from the bigger picture. The movie goes beyond struggles between individuals, it's a clash of worlds, a story of beauty and destruction. And it makes one ponder on the values of humanity and the type of actions we are taking as a species.It's not the novelty of the messages that impresses the viewer, but the masterful way in which they are delivered. They are particularly impactful because the movie gets us attached not so much to characters, but to a philosophy of life. As someone who usually prefers character-driven stories I was surprised at how much I agreed with not developing the characters more. Again, I really believe the focus needed to be somewhere else.I would dwell on it more, and explain why I think so many of the choices fit so beautifully together and work towards the same goal. Yet, I might need to start getting a bit specific and I am trying to keep this spoiler free.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Visually, it looks like a very good and a very very long computer game intro... Story-vise extremely dull, predictable and sorry to say but boring... Cameron knows how to press the emotion buttons and that's it... they should make a Disney+ series out of it and not a 3 hours long movie... obviously people don't want complicated stories or good dialogue cause that movie doesn't offer it and still made almost 2 billion... What a world we live in... I would say I am disappointed but I didn't expect much to begin with... First movie was already very dull and boring story-vise but at least it was visually first of its kind and it was worth watching but the second one doesn't even have that pioneer effect it is just milking the cash cow instead of telling a good story.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

Through stunning visuals, we are once again absorbed into the mesmerising world of Pandora, this time exploring its oceans and the unearthly creatures that inhabit them. It's a truly beautiful experience to see on a big screen, with not one shot being uninteresting to look at, which makes the runtime of over 3 hours completely acceptable. Even with multiple rewatches there will always be something new to see.Though the visuals have definitely dialled up for 'Avatar: The Way of Water', the film has a much simpler plot compared to that of its predecessor. But it is nevertheless compelling and ends with highly entertaining and extensive action sequences that bear, resemblance to another James Cameron blockbuster, 'Titanic'. There's also the return of some great characters who are deepened throughout as well as the introduction of new, interesting ones, both of which create questions that we can hope to see answered in future installations.For more reviews check out our instagram: film.follower.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first film in the series, ""Avatar,"" was released in 2009 and made use of innovative techniques such as performance capture and 3D technology to bring the film's fictional world and characters to life. The sequels to ""Avatar,"" only being ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" as of now, continue to push the boundaries of visual effects and immersive storytelling.In terms of the enjoyment of the film, this is a subjective experience that can vary from person to person. Some viewers may find the ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" to be visually stunning and engaging, while others may find the change from 48 fps scenes to 24 jarring and out of place. I would have much preferred the entire movie to have been shot in 48 fps as I genuinely enjoyed the 48 fps scenes shot when I viewed the movie in my local Cinemark XD 3D theater. The 3D was stunning and by far the best use of it since my viewing of the original ""Avatar"" in 2009. The story was great at including as many of the main characters as they could, I just wish some more screen time was given to Jake, Neyteri, and their oldest son, Neteyam. Personally I felt like Jake had some character decisions that did not represent who he became at the end of the original film, which could have been better explained.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The underwater scenes are sublime. The 2nd hour is the most tedious time I've spent in a cinema though. Cameron says he wanted time to explore the characters more, given this wasn't done in the 1st, however, he jumps into doing this but it feels rushed. The film didn't need 3hrs+ to do all of this. We're just meant to accept that Jake's avatar has babies with an alien and that's that. It was overlong, boring and ultimately bland. Folks who aren't regular cinema goers will flock to this in droves and probably will enjoy it. It's a popcorn flick that attempts to bring emotion but in the end it is an emotionless, vast blue pit of nothingness. Oh, and don't get me started on the villain....","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

I was a fan then and after the movie can't wait for the next one!It definitely didn't disappoint me, but I can't see it is movie without flaws. Let's start with what I loved and what was outstanding or well done as for a sequel:The sequel didn't feel repetitive in a sense that I would feel like I don't see nothing new. The way of water expands the world of Pandora and takes us to new places, landscapes, cultures which I loved! Didn't expect the movie to feel so fresh one can say.Also I think most obvious Pro of this movie that the Visual effects are just off the charts and almost everything looks REAL and is not overcooked like latest Marvel movies (They just lack consistency and immersing experience). This movie makes you feel like this world could be out there and looks like Earth in our dreams. You can still connect to the space.I liked that we got new characters (some of them more developed like Kiri, Lo'ak some of them not). But it's very well balanced between connecting new stories to some roots of the characters from previous movies.Either way I felt like this movie was lacking in some places:I keep revisiting the first movie more due to one reason. First movie had a very good feel of harmony and pure connection of human to nature. There were moments when Jake Sully learned about Pandora's world and it didn't move main plot further, but it made the audience stop, look, feel, immerse and get a sense of harmony. Where as in The way of water I felt this war/action plot even when Lo'ak was getting to know the Tulkuns and such. Some moments had it perfectly like Kiri on the ground feeling the pulse of Ecosystem. But I want MORE!Lastly, the story felt too nichey like Fast and Furious saga with the center 'Family', but not really telling more. Yes it is important, but for this scale of a movie it could have more messages, levels and I hope it will. Because if it will continue to revolve only around family theme, the franchise will feel exhausted quickly. Fingers crossed!I give this movie a solid 8/10. Worth (re)watching and only at some spots felt a bit lackluster or just not right. But overall it exceeded expectations, I hope the sequel will improve on story/message and will show us more character.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story was still gripping to me and I actually liked the plot slightly better than Avatar 1.Not that this movie doesn't have its own similarities. This one had moments that reminded me of James Cameron's Titanic. But the similarities of Avatar 2 did not feel as on the nose as they did in Avatar 1, which felt to me completely like Blue Pocahontas in Space.The children (very often I find that child characters are badly done in action movies) did not annoy me either. There were actually moments when I liked them too, so that's good as well.Naturally, the most important thing about this movie is, just like the first one, its visuals. I have no complaints about them this time either, but the truth is that the 2nd time around the technical aspects were not as impressive or awe inspiring as it was the very first time I experienced it, so there's not much more to say about it than ""we expected it to be great and it was"".","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is like a beautiful woman who captivates at first glance, but upon delving deeper, all that is revealed is emptiness emanating from her eyes. It's as if we are faced with a piece of work that is helpless, resembling trash unwilling to be discarded, or worse yet, it is downright boring, transforming into a potent sleeping pill. It is truly ironic to see James Cameron, with his sharp criticisms of the Avengers films, hoping for the public to grow tired of them. Yet, in reality, this film feels far more absurd than the epic adversaries portrayed in the Avengers.As an unbiased observer, not swayed by blind fanaticism, I appreciate the audacity of a story to be fresh and surprising, steering clear of the clichéd traps that often lull audiences into a deep slumber. Unfortunately, it seems that James Cameron has been captivated by the visual grandeur presented in his works. Ironically, this visual splendor is not accompanied by an equally compelling narrative, but instead resembles the suffering of an absurdly pregnant woman, as if giving birth to a never-ending series of nonsensical events. This work is truly unworthy of being called a masterpiece, which should deliver a captivating cinematic experience in its entirety.As a fan of the first Avatar film, I couldn't help but feel disappointed after waiting for so long. What I received after decades of anticipation is a collection of fragmented characters, akin to puzzle pieces that never form a complete picture, a multitude of birth and death-related issues that saturate the plot with inevitable stiffness, and an antagonist so generic that I experienced countless instances of déjà vu.James Cameron should have advanced by bringing forth a fresh and exhilarating narrative, rather than being fixated on tribal relocations without a clear direction, neglecting the untapped potential of fantasy. As a director who is considered great, my expectations for his work are naturally higher. Perhaps it is time for Cameron to rediscover his creative thinking and not be confined solely to visual accolades. Creating a masterpiece requires a deeper exploration and a thunderous storytelling approach, rather than merely playing it safe within the confines of familiarity.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

The 3 hour and 12 minute runtime is a testament to the capabilities of today's cinema, and the movie's stunning visuals and cinematography are truly mind-boggling. The water effects, in particular, are some of the most impressive ever seen in an CGI film. The realism and attention to detail in the water is truly impressive, and it's easy to forget that what you're watching is not real. The movie's reported budget of $350 to $400 million makes it the most expensive film in Hollywood history, but it's worth every penny for the impressive and innovative special effects.The film's director, James Cameron, is a master of his craft, and it shows in every frame of The Way of Water. The movie's plot is thrilling and engaging, and the character development is superb. The movie's cast is also top-notch, with strong performances from the entire ensemble. The world-building in The Way of Water is also exceptional, with the movie's stunning visual effects and CGI used to bring the breathtaking world of Pandora to life.One of the most impressive aspects of The Way of Water is the attention to detail in the movie's water effects. It's clear that the filmmakers took great care to ensure that the water looked and felt as real as possible, and it shows in every scene. The movie's VFX artists estimate that a short 2-second clip from the film cost a staggering $100,000 to create, which is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the movie's crew.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water is an exceptional sequel that sets a new bar for animated and computer-generated cinema. The movie's stunning visuals, impressive water effects, and thrilling plot make it a must-see for fans of the first movie and newcomers alike. With the third Avatar film already partially shot during the production of The Way of Water, fans can look forward to more exciting adventures in Pandora in the coming years.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I haven't seen True Lies in a few years, and I haven't seen Titanic yet.What I can say is that I don't think this is a good movie, but I like it. Objectively speaking, it's not well-written. Probably because Cameron worked with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver who are hacks. (They helped write Jurassic World, which is garbage. And they wrote the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy, each entry of which is nowhere near as good as people think.) And the movie is an hour longer than it should be.The majority of the movie should've been in Na'vi. No, they wouldn't have to learn the language. Just say the lines as they're written, and annunciate. ""Oh, but people don't like reading subtitles."" Screw them. It would've made the movie better on an objective level. It would've made sense!But what keeps me from fully hating this movie are the special effects, the ambition, themes of family and sacrifice, the action scenes, the simple but effective storyline, sense of discovery, and some of the performances. Most of acting was pretty bad or just unspecial, but Kate Winslet, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and Zoe Saldaña gave the best performances in the whole movie. Just like she did with the first one, Zoe Saldaña steals the show. Her acting is very energetic and expressive.The last hour of the movie kicks ass!Also, personal point, I have a special place in my heart for James Cameron's movies. They connect with me on a personal level. Sure, they can be really corny but I like his corniness. And for that reason, because I love the ocean and animals, as well as the positives that I have listed, I will watch this movie again. And I will buy it on Blu-ray to support the artists, and to watch the behind the scenes.I find it funny that he said he never wanted to do a movie like The Abyss ever again, yet years later he would make Titanic and then much later made this.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

It earns 8 stars from me purely as a visual experience. And it's absolutely worth watching just for that.Should you watch it in 3D? Why not. It is well executed and the effect is stunning... for the first few minutes. After that you forget it's there. If you wear glasses or just can't stand the 3D visors, you're not missing much watching in 2D.Unfortunately, The Way of Water feels small compared to the original. Plot-wise no one would accuse tWoW of being a epic. It is more a 3-hour episode in a mini series, than an Epic movie. Lot's of filler, that might be generously filed under world building.Usually this would earn any movie a much lower score in my book. But being awed by the stunning imagery, I am willing to accept that tWoW is merely setting the stage for future installments with tighter, more meaningful stories.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The sea creatures were amazing the story was good too. But I don't know why at some point it felt like it was an uneven fight. James can easily make the Navi a bit stronger than before. And it seemed unreal how they were fighting against a super modern army with almost nothing. The whole movie was good but at some point, you'll see some unrealistic movement in the characters like their movement is smoothing out. I don't know if it's just for the theater I watched but it was pretty annoying. 3D layering was good but I missed the color depth and contrast because of my local theater.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The best CGI in a movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8763313/?ref_=tt_urv","mattiaberselli","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur150955697/?ref_=tt_urv","28 December 2022","Avatar The Way of Water is the sequel to one of the films that made film history with its magnificent CGI and spectacular world setting. Avatar The Way of Water does the same but better; it is true that the first Avatar was something revolutionary that had never been seen before (which is precisely why it was such a huge success), but the sequel succeeds in enhancing the world of Pandora even better: by having us discover the seabed and the animal species that live there, we are introduced to a new ""tribe"" and the differences between it and the Na'vi tribe we met in the previous film. The weak point of this film is definitely the plot that for many may be trivial but in any case I consider it better than the previous chapter also thanks to the enrichment of main characters (or at least important characters for the continuation of the story), in this film in fact Sully and Neytiri have children who will also have a more important role than their parents. Avatar The Way of Water can be summarized as a great documentary on the beauties of Pandora enriched by a decent characterization of the characters and with a plot that does not live up to the wonderful world that is told to us in this film.It is recommended to see the film in the cinema on a screen with good quality and preferably in 3D.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Beginning with the obvious, the Visual effects of the movie raise the bar to a place only James Cameron can surpass. From an advanced motion capture technology, to the overall advances in the VFX industry, The NA'vi were brought to life and with the help of IMAX and 3D, not only you will watch a movie, you will experience it. Avatar 2 also exceeds the first movie in the spectrums of world building and storytelling. Cameron and his team managed to create a compelling story, with great new characters and a really good villain. A trip to the movie theatre is a must. Make sure to see it in a premium 3d format (IMAX, DOLBY).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yeah it's long but that shouldn't discredit the movie itself. My love for Avatar as far as I'm concerned has been reignited. This film brought me back to why I enjoyed the first one so much but it also added more development of characters and storyline. One thing I felt conflicted by was Neytiri not trusting or liking Spider, especially since her husband was human once and for the fact that humans still live on Pandora. Maybe another small thing here or there that felt off or I thought could have been different but overall I truly was entertained and enjoyed it.

Also, The son cannot be so disobedient!!! The action lasts too long. The first movie was very good. As a result the standard was too high. The work of 14 years can be seen in the movie from the special effects side. Scriptwise, there are weaknesses . I would be unfair for such an effort to put a 7, but it would be too high to put a 9.

I'm also someone who was adamant about the fact that the first Avatar didn't need a sequel because it was a complete story on its own. However, although The Way of Water isn't as good as the first film, it was worth the wait.Sam Worthington and Stephan Lang stole almost every scene they had as Jake Sully and Miles Quaritch respectively. Their hero and villain chemistry was excellent, mostly done through audio communication until they finally met face to face, at which point the testosterone levels went through the roof. One can tell that Jake and Quaritch despise each other, yet also have an unspoken mutual respect that any true warrior would feel towards a worthy opponent.Zoe Saldana's ability to switch between Neytiri howling with grief to a deadly warrior in full murder mode was chilling. To avoid spoilers, I won't say why she was grieving but it's the most heartbreaking moment in the movie and the only time where one of Sam Worthington's co-stars actually managed to steal a scene from him.Sigourney Weaver was in a unique situation, being the only onscreen performer in history to play a teenager whilst in her seventies. The decision to have her play Kiri could have backfired because although the CGI was able to flawlessly hide Sigourney's real age, many people in her situation would still have the body language of an old person. Watch Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in The Irishman if you want to see how CGI can't hide the fact that they're unable to move as easily as they once could. Fortunately, Sigourney still has an extraordinary amount of physical strength and agility, so whenever she's moving, she does it in a way that looks as effortless as it would be for an actual teenager. My only criticism of her performance is a few line deliveries.At it's core, this is a movie about family. However, there's more going on in the script than there was in the first Avatar, which had a very simple script. I'm not one of those pretentious idiots who thinks that a script needs to be complex in order to be good which is why I consider the first film to be a masterpiece. The Way of Water doesn't reach masterpiece status because this story has so much happening that it causes a few pacing issues. At one point in the finale, there was so much time spent on action that I completely forgot some characters were still struggling to survive underwater at the same time. Furthermore, unlike the first Avatar, there are loose ends that need to be tied up which makes another Sequel a requirement in order to finish the story.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It still always makes me cry. It's a world I've always wished to be able to exist in, being based on the Lemurians I've always felt so connected to. I love the characters, the story, the messages, and the visuals are of course absolutely stunning.Avatar: The Way of Water however... there is not another movie that gives me a sense of longing this intense outside of the Harry Potter franchise. I mean that. It was worth the wait. I fell more in love with this universe and these characters than I ever could have anticipated. I left my heart on the theater floor, truly.I cried through over half the movie the first time I saw it. Tears of joy and tears of gut wrenching sadness alike. The second time I saw it, I cried even more. Seeing the movie through a new lens, with all the hindsight and context of the story throughout watching, soaking up every detail I could, noticing things I didn't before, consciously paying attention to things I wanted more insight into, it was just as enjoyable as watching it wish fresh eyes. And being already so attached to the characters and the story, I was certainly more emotional.The whole experience is so immersive, so ethereal. It deserves to just be appreciated for what it is. A beautiful story, that in my opinion doesn't require any more drama within the plot in order to have you completely captivated during the entire film, and also should not be cut any shorter. I really have a hard time viewing this story through the lens of a critic in that sense, and I think that speaks to how special it is.Because why on earth would anyone want less detail? Less of the moments that give you more insight into the characters and allow you to form deeper understanding and attachment to them and the plot? Why would you want less immersion, less stunning visuals of this gorgeous and quite literally otherworldly place? Why does every story need to be constant chaos, be it euphoria or rage or heartache, in order to be entertaining?Life isn't like that. We're allowed to have moments of calm weaved in and out of the more tumultuous parts of life. Why should the stories we love, be any different in that sense? If we love them, their characters, their universes, the visuals and imagination of it all, why does it need to be constant go, go, go in order for us to enjoy it? If we love the story, don't we want all the context in the world in order to understand it better?The best movies are those that allow us the deepest glimpses into the worlds they take place within, and the character that are a part of them. They're visually captivating and immersive, beautiful even when they're ugly. They are more than a mere distraction, they make you feel the full scope of emotions because of how deeply you connect to and are invested in the story. They are those that leave us wanting to theorize and predict and create headcannons, they leave you curious, wanting more no matter how tightly they tie things into a bow at the end or how much they leave up to interpretation.Because you love them enough that they leave you yearning to know and understand and connect as much as humanly possible to the story and characters. You wonder about the existence of the characters behind the scenes on the screen, the words on the page. They're comforting even in their chaos. They help us connect to deeper parts of ourselves, and create new ones. You miss them. You want the whole world to know about them.

Lost that one star. Sorry. Myself, I found the visual effects were stunning. The imagery was excellent and I found myself trying not to miss any of it. I don't comprehend any loss of storyline or anything negative. I thought it was a great segway from the first one.Graphics left me glued to the screen.Overall, it did great justice to the storyline, narrative, and visual effects. Even the facial expressions were fantastic. I very rarely go to theatres for the simple fact of wasting money only to be disappointed. This was well worth it. I sure hope that this gets the correct nominations it justly deserves.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Esspecialy Zoe Saladana she played Neytiri so emotional and she did her job perfrct. The music and the lyrics support the plot. But, in my opinion, the plot was really boring and predictable, apart from one unexpected plot twist. The characters were shallow and just boring. The music and the lyrics support the plot.

They leave you with emotional highs or lows, perhaps questions are asked but the theme is the only answer you're gonna get.Avatar 2 isn't either of these. Instead, The Way of Water is like reading chapter 2 of a really, really great book. This chapter is full of incredible character moments and character introductions. Beautiful experiences that you (the viewer) are a part of. Some important character progression and of course, world-building.But, it's only chapter 2 of 5, and that's OK!People have been complaining about the lack of story. That's because their field of view is too narrow. We're part of the 'part1, part2' era of movies now. Avengers 'mainstreamed' the idea and now every upcoming movie has a 'part 1' label attached. That's not necessarily a bad thing. But judging by how much Avatar 2 leaves on the table, you can bet that we're in for one hell of a ride for part 3, 4 and 5.My prediction is Avatar 3 may leave the audience with a more satisfying intermission between movies. Whereas Avatar 2 does leave you wanting for more straight away. Understandably, that's a bit annoying. But in the years to come, people will appreciate The Way of Waters's place in the story. It's chapter 2.As for the standalone film, it does fall back on a few easy story beats. But due to the otherworldy experience that takes your breath away (no pun intended), you really can enjoy this movie and I'm already planning my second viewing with some more friends. Please go and support this movie in theatres. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many of us to enjoy this in 3D.I hope anyone reading enjoyed my little review and I can't wait for the third chapter.Callum.

For that, seeing it in 3D is essential, there are moments in which you feel you are there.I especially wanted to see the movie because it was going to show underwater shots and, yeah, it didn't disappoint. I am freshly freediving (diving while holding your breath) certified and it's accurate enough. I highly suggest seeing on YouTube 'One breath around the world' by Guillaune Nery, they are real shots and captures the magic you can experience while freediving.Yeah, the bad humans are simply bad, but honestly, it doesn't take make much to make that believable. I mean, we are currently destroying our environment for lesser reasons than in the movie. We are cutting trees and we are killing the seas and oceans. Personally, I think it would be a poor world or universe if most of what we are surrounded from is man made. I doubt that we can create as much diversity as nature and diversity sparks the imagination and new ideas. Without it, I think we would be missing out and essentially become dumber.I love the sci fi genre, and Pandora might seem cheesy with its weird collective consciousness, but I think it's the answer for humanity, something that can be made reality someday through technology. Otherwise, we will just keep spreading our cancer throughout the stars, consuming everything and always being at the risk of self destruction because of our, let's call it, chaotic side. A some kind of collective consciousness that connects all life would raise us up from ignorance and would make living sustainable truly possible. It would unite us, being able to withstand threats, while also preserving what has been there before us.So, yeah, it's worth seeing. There is no other movie that immerses you like this in a fantasy world. That's worth 8 stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But this movie lacks so much on the writing and story line department it makes the movie painful to watch, the only reason I kept watching was because of how awesome the visuals are. It seems like they decided to hire subpar writers who came up with a predictable and simple screenplay and awful dialogue to save on money or something, after 13 years I was expecting a more detailed story and something with more substance than just somehow resurrecting the original bad guy and choosing Nurse Jackie as the new military leader lol (what a joke) who has the worst military leader acting job I've ever seen, I was hoping for more tribal infighting or something that wasn't just a rewrite of the first movie script, but I guess with the new Star Wars movies I can't be disappointed in Disney because they are just known for putting out dead beat sequels to their big franchise's.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

You could argue if the movie would still be that good without 3D, but neither is that the recommendation I am giving nor was it an experience that I had. The production is on a very high level, if not the highest we have at the moment. Action scenes were visually stunning and not repetitive. I don't think any character was cringe, they all played well. Towards the half of the movie it felt a little bit dragging, but it got better.

I totally get that ""backstory"", explanation, and description are important to a total story. But there was so much of it that the movie felt like it was dragging the entire first 2 hours. I honestly couldn't imagine sitting in the theater for the length of this movie. I don't want to give anything away because I believe everyone should form their own opinion about a work of art, this movie is that and more.The story just echoes the original but with some rather oddly inserted additions. These additions come with the tiniest of explanation on how they even occurred. The life of the water people is very similar to that of their own people. The animals are equally impressive. If your looking for action then you will need to wait until the last hour or so, then it does get a bit intense.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The VFX & CGI of this movie were so realistic that sometimes it felt like watching a Pandora's Underwater documentary, it was real. The underwater scenes were very alive. What a wonderful way James Cameron presented a simple story with visual effects. He proved once again that he is one of the best. If you don't actually watch this movie in 3D, it is not possible to enjoy the wonderful work of its visual effects.There is much more for the next part i am so excited to see part 3 just waiting ⏳","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The boat crashing scene just looks like something from a 90s computer game.Avatar 2 is so inferior to Avatar 1, I could not stress that enough. It is missing so many elements that made the first movie, with an absolutely empty pointless story that seems to be mish-mashed into the visuals. Avatar 2 has none of the mystic feeling energy that the first one had. And after a 13 year wait, I just felt so disappointed with the movie, not reaching any expectations whatsoever.There are reviews listed here, mentioning 'best film ever', 'best ever CGI', 'Oscar material' etc etc... either it's their first trip to the cinema or they have never seen a good film to compare it to.Overall it's just one big empty snoozefest with visuals.","32 out of 63 found this helpful.

When in our own solar system there is already at least one option. It would have been way more enjoyable for me if it was over the precious resources again.

Good as it was a case of a sudden but ad dur to several budgetary and watching reasons . First let me focus on the bad reasons and skipping the budgetary. The movie has been watched in a regional city with only one multiplex cinema with small halls and quite low illumination. The Dolby glasses were very dirty. Cleaning them helped very little . Watching was relatively difficult and required frequent glass removals to calm my eyes.Now the good: as with the previous story this story is hugely CGI based though it was also 'filmed' in the sea, possibly New Zealand as noticed by other reviewers or in the trivia. Landscapes nicer than in the first installment and the ewier copesinto a totally new underground world. There is still some negative as most of the movie is near 2D that can be watched without glasses even partially... More than the 2/3trd has not deep scenes at least for this cinemaNow to comment to other reviewers :Movie is surely with some flaws with first and most possible reason to deliberately troll anyone. Think that as a kind of advertising that works even if negative as happens with the movie troll (my previous review) . Second the movie is mostly CGI based this work requires very long time to get in 2D add then the time to design into 3D and get thje satisfactory results required with possibly lots trial and error> I read in the trivia that the design was around 3000 hours long,Third has anyone seen on how many movies Cameron made in all this time in between? T a blink I measured 14 movies video games amd TV series in total in the mean time . Don't forgat that all of his productions are primarily strong action movies where text passages only help the story go far! IF someone is interested in movie with higher or stronger character arcs is better to watch another movie . I still think that there is some fair arc especially when they moved to the oceanic landscapes in the query of a new home .Amd also the emotional part: my daughter was deeply pushed by the story tearing in the end. AS teenage she is fan of mostly crap music and actions scenes but the story between the local 'guy' and mark's daughter plus the marginal but glorious winning against the bad humans made her cry. Possiby an easy watcher? She prefers of watching stories Instagram and tok-tok for quite long time everyday ...Another questions of trolling (read as flaws ): The Navis human behavior nearly similar behavior of the Metkayina a Maori inspired clan in the islands not to say the English language used for all the movie instead of designing a more tribal or just using a aboriginal . Also How the 'whale hunters' were found in this planet? How this family adopted teen could inhale in the jungle without mask or it is supposed to die as in the first installment ? There is something also hidden well in the story...The movie for sure takes the rate of 8/10 hugely based in the excellent 3Dlandscapes (5/2) with long story for pop scorn without requiring too much 'after sales' thinking.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was worried that the lenght of the film makes it difficult to watch without pause but there was not a boring moment. I hope the third part will have the same attitude. The beauty of sea creatures is pictured as impressively as the spirit of the woods in first part. The difficulties facing youngs and kids amongst their age group is also taken to notice very well.

However, apart from its spectacular effects and backgrounds, etc, the script... it's not very good. The approach and development are quite good, but the end is more extended and makes it a bit tedious; I liked it but it doesn't go to the point. It's a problem that this movie has; I enjoyed it, but the 3 hours do feel. It doesn't have too many characters, but some are too meh. The kids are too DUMB. Okay, I get it, they're kids. But they were raised by very strong people; Can't they really obey EVEN ONCE? I liked the part at the end, it's going to develop a lot and I hope they will use it carefully.

No one cares about 3D anymore Bro! But, here we are after a 13-year slumber, waiting to be proven wrong by James Cameron. Does he do it again?Visually, Cameron manages to meet audience expectations making full use of Dolby 3D although personally, it was a little bit jarring when frame rates were switched. You can expect to be transported to Pandora's seas. Wakanda forever or Aquaman's underwater scenes cannot hold water against James Cameron's Avatar. That said, Avatar needs to pad up in the story and dialogue department and maybe also try cutting down the runtime a bit.Kiri was a standout character for me. Jesus! I didn't even realize it was played by Sigourney again.""James, I will watch your movie as many times as I have to!""

I Went to see this movie twice and the second time in 3D which i must say was a completely different breathtaking experience.I see a lot of people complain about the story and plot of the film but i don't think it was that awful, yes it was a simple premise and in a way maybe a somewhat predictable outcome but for the most part it had strong messages for viewers as well as being a very emotional movie which from what i saw had half the theatre tearing up.The performances were also incredible with a very special mention to Zoe Saldana who really, really shined in her performance considering she was being motion tracked. The sound of the movie was also absolutely amazing and the overall immersiveness of this movie was spectacular.In Conclusion the movies visuals really compensate for any small faults that you may believe the movie has, it will really make you forgot that Pandora doesn't exist.

These sequences felt immersive and made me feel like I was there alongside them.However, despite the visual spectacle, I found myself frustrated by the pacing of the film. The lengthy exposition took too much time to set up the story, with over an hour devoted to establishing the characters' backgrounds and the world they inhabit. This prolonged introduction felt excessive and detracted from the overall momentum of the plot. Additionally, there were several instances of filler content, particularly in the form of predictable teenage drama, which added little to the overarching narrative.Ultimately, while I was captivated by the movie's impressive visuals, I couldn't help but feel that the story itself fell short.

It feels so real that suspending disbelief isn't hard (which is one of the major problems I had with Avatar I, I kept seeing it as a cartoon all the way through --- well, that problem is gone!).The part I liked best was the first hour, where the film just illustrated how the inhabitants live happily within a balanced and intact ecosystem. Of course, the last hour (of the 3-hour show) descends into conflict, and that is much less enjoyable from my point of view. Why not just devote 3 hours to happy beings living fulfilling lives on a bounteous and nurturing moon? (Pandora is a planetary moon, not technically a planet. The floating islands in the sky go back to Philip Jose Farmer, a scifi writer whom I used to read extensively.)All of this said, it's still very much a great movie --- I'm just the wrong person to drag through extended battle scenes, since I consistently find peace and harmony much more interesting and entertaining.WIthout digging into every corner of the plot, I think Mr Cameron definitely has an agenda he wants to drive home about machines vs. Nature. Despite the fact that he uses very fancy machines to make his films, he clearly sees nature as generally good, and machines as prone to be bad, so the idea that the natural world could overcome machines (in a battle-like way) seems to be attractive to him. However, I don't really follow along with him on that line of thinking!My view is quite different. I believe that machines and nature can coexist in harmony. I'll agree we're not very good at it yet, but I quite like machines and nature both --- in fact, I believe that well-designed machines can protect nature and make it more secure, integrated and beautiful.Despite my criticisms, Avatar: The Way of Water is quite a success as a film overall. I rated it 8/10, with the 2 points off for its overemphasis on violence and conflict.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was incredibly satisfying to return to Pandora and I fell in love all over again. With the characters, their connection to the natural world, and the simple pleasures of learning end sharing. The intensity of the conflict is hard but it's worth it to see the beauty of this amazing world! See it on the big screen. Wear the 3D glasses. Soak up the experience. My family and I can't wait to see it again. To us the only downfall to the film is they really should have honored the outcast at the end for what he actually did for everyone. That fell a little fat flat. Folks who have seen the movie will know who the outcast is and may agree. Why didn't they honor the outcast as they should! Otherwise, we really did love this movie even with its few flaws and holes in the story. Thank you all for your commitment to this incredible world.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the second movie we meet Water World of Pandora, magical creatures and Metkayina clan (Na'vis that lives near water).Through this movie, Cameron shows us how big corporations don't care about anything, they don't mind to run over and destroy everything in order to get money, how that negatively affects the planet and nature, and ordinary people. But his mane story is about family, something most valuable, that you protect with your life.I read a lot of people complain about the story, yes its true that villains are practically ""remastered"" characters from the first part, but I don't mind that, come on, or because he ""borrowed"" some scenes from his previous movies (and he did great job there also), this movie is not just story, this is a visual spectacle, I don't remember that I've had this kind of experience in the cinema with any other movie before, Cameron is still visionary No1, and hope that Avatar 3 will be such a magical experience as Avatar: The Way of Water.Ps: Recommendation to watch this only in 3D, because ""it matters""...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Even though the story has that clear line we know from other blockbuster movies, Cameron did a solid, good job at presenting characters, tribes, emotions. You can summarize the plot in a couple sentences, but you can't summarize what details you've seen, what character development you've witnessed and what emotions you felt in those 3 hours bc the whole time you're experiencing something.

It has no shape, no thematic magic. There's no intellectual or emotional structure to connect to. It's just a series of visually vibrant scenes.There's barely a story. The characters are one dimensional and the dialogue is bland. The main character is as interesting as a coat hanger. The visuals, while technically impressive, are limited in their substance and highly repetitive.Compare this to, say, Harry Potter 2. The story was multilayered and compelling. The characters were lovable and emotionally engaging. The visuals were artistically beautiful and infused with meaning.Avatar 2 is a big, meaningless, dumb, blue blur. I kept the faith for James Cameron for all these years, but he didn't even bother to nail the most important aspect of a film: the SCRIPT!Given the success of the original Avatar, writing an excellent script (even if it meant hiring others) should have been priority number 1. All this talk about pushing the limits of CGI and camera technology, underwater filming etc... Totally worthless if the story and characters are bland.Sigourney Weaver's young character with a mysterious connection to the planet was the only point of interest. But that wasn't explored with any intention. She could have been the main character, and the story all about her going deeper and uncovering Pandora's many and varied secrets. Maybe it's not really a planet. Maybe an old foe is returning from a distant part of space. Something different. Instead, we get a rehash of natives and soldiers gritting their teeth at each other for 3 hours.","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

Yes the story is nothing original and not the strongest but its compelling and tugs at your heartstrings so above average.Visuals are indeed great in many scenes but I found the 3D weak and not worth it at all, like pretty much every movie sadly. I don't remember too much of the first one but it doesn't matter too much this flick mostly stands on its own less a few tie-ins.Overall I say well done JC.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought they introduced the characters so much better. I thought Avatar the way of water came on too fast as they invaded Pandora. I thought they could have elaborated quite a bit further at the beginning on how earth was dying, right up to the time they entered Pandora. It was like they rushed the movie just so they could hurried up to do nothing much. I like it when they lead up to a war (how how's and why's) not just a bunch of fighting. Once you see a bunch of fighting it all looks a like. Not saying a good fighting scene isn't needed. Just don't make it feel like it is lasting for eternity.

If you liked the first one, you will like this one. And if there's one criticism that sticks out most to me, that is it: it caters completely and wholly to its original audience.Sure, the visuals are STUNNING. The incredible world building here is worth the price of admission, full stop. Emotionally, thematically, it feels like it fits behind the original with characters coming through as you'd hope they would. But, and this is a big ""but"", you've seen a lot of this before. Which may not be a bad thing if you want to see it all again.Beautiful new environment? Check. New creatures they must learn to bond with? Check. Even one big creature that is a defining part of the climax? Check. Bring back previous cast (even in ridiculous ways)? Check. Humans are still (mostly) greedy and stupid? Check. Political leanings all here? Anti-colonizing, eco-friendly, anti-government, anti-military, anti-fishing industry, dominant white people evil (unless they begin taking on the forms and traits of the indigenous)? Check. Some stunning action scenes? Absolutely. Did it make me cry? More than once. Did it have a heart-warming central theme? Yes.It's good. It's well made, predictable and bankable. Watch it.But...Visuals aside, it's chock full of plot oddities, retreaded material and sometimes highly stereotypical characters. The choice to use Weaver's voice for multiple characters gave an ""uncanny valley vocal"" feel to the performance, and there's not a lot of surprises (a few, yes) along the way in terms of writing and performance.I somehow felt like I was watching a 2023 remake of the original, with different environments and larger cast.There's a lot to love here. A lot to praise for a cast and production team full of ground-breaking everything. It's awesome. But it suffers from something that movies like The Matrix struggled to overcome, which is that the original was so groundbreaking, so different-mostly visually- that's it's nearly impossible to recapture that vibe in the sequel. It feels like a derivative of itself.I was happy to see them focus on family dynamics and work a little harder on character building this time out, but if you want to be truly surprised, this isn't the movie you're looking for.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I felt the story was forced in, trying to be wise without an argument. I understand that this sequel takes a long time to develop and made into a movie. The box office said it is a successful sequel. I do hope the next installation would be better.Visually, Way of Water showed advancement of SFX far beyond the original. I could see facial details of emotional reaction clearer and enabled the actors to showcase expressive acting through their exaggerated facial movements and expressive voice. Technology-wise, Way of Water should win an Oscar.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

My expectations were far from being met. The 3D post processing looked like a mixture of scenes containing either 24p or 60hz and moments with high interpolation (the soap opera effect). Also it looked like a mixture of animation scenes and video game scenes with obvious transition from one scene to another. I still don't know how to digest the experience. Secondly, it was way too long for what it wanted to tell. I have no problem watching an immersive long movie. But this one made me impatient more than once. It really felt stretched intentionally and obviously more than once. I've walked in with high cinematic, visual expectations and low expectations for the script. But boy was this one going to surprise me. I rarely feel like I wasted my time with a movie. With this one, I feel double-crossed. I don't want my money back, only because I got the chance to warn others. I can understand why they didn't want to disclose the budget. You would feel tricked if they did. Maybe the 2D would look better, I don't know. But it's a stretch anyways.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

Also, The Way of Water is so long that my fingers started getting pruney near the end. They could have cut at least two of the excessive storylines.

If there had a slightly less predictable story line or any attempt at making the characters have depth and charisma this movie could of been something for me.

Good that I didn't watch in premier Theaters (Saved some money)

Why, when you could create any kind of world that is unlike our own world, decide to have lots of musclebound machine gun wielding men being macho idiots?Is that so we know they are the bad guys. Okay. I get it.If we are exploring a different culture, why did they have the same mannerisms and speech patterns as humans? Why do all the sea creatures seem so benevolent to these human like people? Do they have no enemies in the sea? Or are they so Noble and virtuous they are immune from other creatures in their environment?I think one of the reasons this movie is nowhere near as good as the first is we are getting to a point where CGI no longer amazes us like it once did. In someways the closer we get to a perfect replica, the less interesting it becomes. Think of manga animation which is simple but incredibly effective.There is something lifeless and souless about the Extreme verisimilitude of Avatar the way of the water. Thanks to motion capture the movements are so very lifelike and believable, it's almost like, meh, okay, so what? Although the way the reptile-birds fly is way too ungainly and clumsy. If these were real birds they wouldn't be able to fly at all.Also, the thoracic and cervical areas of the human like characters still doesn't look right. A bit awkward. The shoulder joint is a very complicated situation. Keep trying. Or don't.Another thing that annoyed me was the action and story mostly revolves around the male characters. Yes there are strong female characters but a lot of the movie is about the men having fights with each other or proving themselves or getting the hots for someone, the women and girls serve as accessories to a degree. I've only watched half the movie so maybe the females get more of the action later on.There is a 10 minute documentary on Disney about the making of the movie. In a Studio where you can see about 25 to 30 people working on set, only one was a woman. Maybe that has something to do with the focus of the film.The plot is very flimsy, the dialogue is awful. And it's too bloody long!I'm only halfway through. Three hours is ridiculous and unwarranted considering the lack of story. Really crazy, considering the cost and work that goes into just one second of animation. It's bizarre to think that they left so much unnecessary stuff in, amazing. I suppose being a three hour movie is supposed to make it seem more serious or something, but it really just makes it more boring than it already is.Of course the visuals are striking, the best thing about this movie are the incredible sea and land environments inspired by our incredible planet we are so Lucky to live on.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

I went into this hoping to be be filled with joy once again but it's just such an enormous let down, I'm extremely glad I didn't pay for it and waited until it was free on Disney plus.A plus side I guess is the visuals are once again very good but still not new. The film as a story feels like a desperate attempt at trying to be relevant but falls flat. I made myself watch until the end but my husband got so bored he figured mowing the lawn was more exciting. I just beg JC to stop because of the rest are on par with this I'll go watch paint dry.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

That's my review because I was so bored watching this movie that I could not tell you what happened if anything. I loved the first one but this was so bad. It was like they spent ten years on the special effects and then COVID hit and nobody wrote a script until a few weeks before the movie came out. The effects were beautiful but the characters were just kids and whales. There was no real conflict other than the same one as before. Not worth the twenty bucks if you ask me.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The characters and writing lack any depth and getting through the almost 3 hour runtime is a bore.Like the first movie, Avatar 2 feels more like a techical showcase than an actual movie. The main characters are bland and lack any persona or motivation for their actions. Over 70% of the film consists of fill or environmental shots that do not develop the story anywhere.Like others have noted, the world-building is good but not enough to make the film worth three hours of sleeping in the cinema. I can only recommend this if you have a good patience and are a big fan of the first movie.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

As Papa Smurf (Sam Worthington, who might be phoning it in; you can't tell because: CGI but also: Sam Worthington) muses from the start, Neytir's identity is rooted in how others perceive her, and she's never been given the opportunity to tell us who she is. Thus, Neytiri sets out to make a name for herself amid a sea of patriarchal social mores that dismiss her perspective.Along the way, Neytiri's quest teams her with a band of quirky companions, from Cliff Curtis's burly Tonowari, CCH Pounder's of course wise Mo'at, and Sigourney Weaver's American teen except for size Kiri. Even the vocal talents of Kate Winslet -- who sounds as if she'd rather be filming TITANIC 2 than cashing a check, here -- make an appearance in the role of, I think, Smurf Willow, but nothing can lift a drab sense of defeat bubbling under the gloss of Pandora's neon-plastered paint job.No matter how old-fashioned and doggedly colonial its inclinations are, it's still wrapped in a ridiculous package hand-delivered by cyan humanoids. Absurdity isn't always the mark of simplicity, however. Ambitious films like INSIDE OUT and THE MUPPET MOVIE (Gonzo!) prove sharp wit and blue characters don't have to be mutually exclusive. AVATAR 2 buckles under the pressure of the bar set by far superior titles that have come before it, skimping on narrative nuance in favor of a showy fireworks display that's bound to distract nondiscerning cheese eaters on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but might leave anyone with a brain blue in the face.","127 out of 296 found this helpful.

Disgusting and shameless use of CGI and literally ripping off scenes from the first movie over and over again. It is needlessly 3 hours and it does not matter whatsoever. 13 years and no progress made in story telling makes me question James Cameron and what made this movie so bad. I believe there are good movies and there are bad movies. This movie enters a new category of movie which has never existed before: Bottom of the Mariana trench terrible. This movie was made with a newly formed AI algorithm that we have never seen before to make an absolutely atrocious movie that rips off the first and leaves it feeling soulless. There is animal violence and lots of blue people no one cares about. Stay far away from this awful movie. Shame on you James Cameron. And shame on the evil AI that crafted this garbage pile.

From someone who loves movies and grades them a bit harsher than most others I have to say Avatar The Way of The Water was a cinematic failure at best.The introduction of characters were horrific, they introduce characters, but they did not build upon them, for a 3 hour long movie, you should be able to build upon the characters instead of introducing a character, and hinting at another character which can build a special relationship, friendship with them both. But they didn't do that here, instead they introduce characters and left them as is and moved on to a different plot.","24 out of 48 found this helpful.

But that's as far as it goes; the story was ok, just throughout the entire movie the plot continually undermines itself, characters continually have plot armor except when they don't & it seems the only time they don't is cause Cameron felt like shafting one of the characters, & there were numerous times where the story should of just completely haulted because it was poorly written but they just skip over the gaping plot hole like they expect nobody to notice; they try to give you a sense of mystery that there is something you don't know or understand yet as for why the plot hole happened, but just turns out there was no reason other than that the writers just suck! Again visuals stunning & for that alone was the only reason I didn't walk out, cuz tbh it is really cool to see.....just the story itself 🤢","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

That it's a movie with its political and moral values clearly and passionately expressed is, of course, not the problem. Whereas most CGI productions might offer an occasional ineffectual and disingenuous whisper of a moral view in between this or that deafening bombast, who would argue against Mr. Cameron's messages espousing family loyalty and regard for others who are different (species, tribes, perspectives) as opportunities to embrace and learn, vs otherness to destroy? Thus, Avatar 2's problem is not an absence of morality or interest regarding big and important problems of human nature but the simplistic story development and, at its core, implausible and one-dimensional characters. Portrayals of supposed character growth ring not just false but nearly random, and silly. In my audience, there were a few scenes that, unintentionally, elicited blurts of laughter--along with an audible ""really?"" once or twice. In the end, Avatar 2 was beautiful to behold but felt manipulative, patronizing and boring. And too painful.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

There is no twists nor revelations.What's even worse is the stereotype of this family and toxic masculinity it tries to sell.Its very easy to see how storytelling has done a much much muuuch better job lately on other art pieces. Such a shame they've spent all that movie on visuals without looking after the story.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

Honestly, wtf were those sudden zoom-ins?! Wtf were thise slowmos? Are you zack snyder? The story is super predictable and ends in a way that they can make the third one exactly in the same way. There is absolutely no progress in the story telling or world building. It's not bad at all, but you would expect more from a guy named James Cameron, or basically anyone who has been willing to make sequels after 10+ years, you would assume they had something interesting to tell. But naah, just add more cgi to make more money!Now time to talk about positive aspects, I haven't seen many movies that are as aesthetically pleasing.

Things seem peaceful but the RDA has other plans, invading and capturing Pandora. Sully forms a guerrilla group to try to expel the invaders.The first Avatar, released in 2009, was visually stunning but had a very weak plot. The story was basic, cheesy and predictable, like it was meant for kids. Characters were hardly developed at all, so you have very little empathy for them. Making it even worse, the film was massively padded, with several scenes adding nothing except to the running time which clocks in at an insomnia-curing 160 minutes.Avatar: The Way of Water is more of the same. Great special effects, weak, cheesy story, one-dimensional characters. Running time is even more excessive, clocking in at 192 minutes due to a plot that just drifts for an eternity in the middle section. Director James Cameron could easily have cut an hour out of the film without subtracting from the story (what there is). But then he would have less time to show off his CGI skills, wouldn't he?","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Strip the shiny distractions away though and honestly, it's a bit boring. It's at least 40 minutes too long, some of the dialogue is truly dreadful and the plot has all the complexity of a ham sandwich.People lauding Cameron's return...I just don't get it?? This is no Aliens, nor is it a patch on Terminator 2, two films that themselves had 'blow you away' visuals in their day (and still stand up over 3 decades later). The notable difference with those two over this though was that they brought so much more to the table. The pacing was far more efficient, the dialogue for both were memorable (I don't hear anyone quoting lines from Avatar), the scripts were lean and didn't waste screen time and the characters, man the characters! There is no Ellen Ripley, no Sarah Connor, no Kyle Reese, no Vasquez, T-800, Hicks, Hudson, Bishop, Newt etc here. It's not that the characters here a bad, but they're very run of the mill affairs and none of them are particularly memorable, or stand out in any significant way other than how much screen time they are allocated.This isn't to say that it's a bad film, because it isn't. But once you strip the very impressive effects away, it's just not a great film either. It's just a very average sequel with just one stand out appeal in the visuals. If you want to spend 3 hours marvelling at the effects, you'll have a ball. If you're looking for a bit more depth below the shiny surface though, well it'll be a very long 3 hours for you.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

Jake decides he needs to take his family to a safer, more hidden location where the water tribes live. Its a tough adjustment for the family and that's where the picture becomes overwhelmingly slow and focused on the kids and their relationship with the water clan. The move becomes about the native and magical bond between its inhabitants. Its way too long and the story drags. I give it 2 stars only because of the CGI. Not worth the viewing if you've seen the first.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film's ambitious attempt to transport viewers back to the lush world of Pandora is marred by a plot that seems stretched thin over its extensive runtime.The sequel's reliance on spectacle over substance leads to a storyline that feels recycled and predictable, lacking the originality that made its predecessor a standout. The characters, while visually stunning, fail to evoke the emotional connection necessary to drive the story forward, leaving the audience adrift in a sea of stunning imagery without a compelling anchor.Moreover, the dialogue often borders on the banal, with attempts at profundity coming off as trite rather than insightful. The film's antagonists, particularly the human military forces, are painted with broad strokes, their motivations unclear and their actions serving more as plot devices than as genuine threats.In essence, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a testament to the power of visual effects but also a reminder that even the most beautiful of films can lack the soul needed to make a lasting impact. It's a reminder that cinema is not just about what we see, but also about what we feel, and in this regard, the film struggles to resonate on a deeper level.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first Pocahontas in Space was hands down the director's weakest work at that point and I didn't have any expectations for this one. Still, I was shocked by how bad this movie turned out to be.Good things first, the film was quite visually stunning in places. It's impressive how far technology has come since the cave troll of the Lord of the Rings. Especially the facial gestures with the CGI characters were very top notch. Combining water and CGI has certainly not been an easy task.Too bad that the plot, characters and dialogue were all laughably bad. The whole movie was like it was written by a primary school student. All the film's themes were hammered so visible that even complete idiots will surely grasp them.An even bigger problem than the bad script was the completely incomprehensible length of the film. Watching it in the cinema, this would surely have been a totally numbing experience, luckily, I watched this at home so I could take breaks. I couldn't believe my eyes when at two hours I looked at the remaining time and it showed the movie would still go on for more than an hour! The final battle of the film lasts 45 minutes and is extremely boring to watch.I will never watch either Avatar again or any of their possible sequels. I can't believe how once such a master level director has condescended to direct such garbage. Even more, I wonder why some people actually like these movies. Is the exterior all that the audience expects from movies these days, with the content being an insignificant side point?","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Only this time, it didn't bust the block quite like it did back in '09. I'm not sure if it was because the novelty of it all was lost on the audience the second time around, but it seemed as though the wonders of the foreign moon Pandora were a little less breathtaking than they were the first time. Seeing the movie pan out, things just felt like a sequel was made for the sole purpose of making a sequel. Some of the dialogue was cringe-worthy and hard to listen to. The story, despite its potential, felt repetitive and predictable too often (it's almost as if it didn't need to be 3+ hours long). All this culminated in a lack of emotional attachment to characters who had plenty of screen time for the audience to get acclimated to them. There were heartfelt moments shared between family, and new and exotic creatures that the N'avi people rode into battle, but it paled in comparison to the original Avatar throughout. Even Jake Sully's epic monologues fell short of what they originally had been. Initially filling transitions with emotion and tension, Sully's speeches in Avatar: The way of Water only seemed to put the ribbon and bow on the exact gift it was- a flex of the prowess of computer generated image technology that was state of the art... 13 years ago.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The visuals look amazing, whenever they were underwater it felt like a documentary. The visuals are almost flawless except for a alien-shark-thing that moved wery cluncky and it felt like the frame rates slowed down for it.The direction and action are great (as expected from Cameron).Negativs:
The characters are pretty unintresting and when they were in danger I felt nothing.The story is extreamly predicable and cliche.The movie is long and the pacing felt off in the middle and it laked much forward momentum.Conclusion:
The movie looks great and is worth seeing in imax but it is very unoriginal and unintresting as far as the story goes and I will probably not rewatch it.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Weaker than the first movie. Sure It's supposed to be black and white for smaller kids, but given the amount of efforts spent on the visuals they could have done waay better job on motives and action for the characters
First movie was like a breath of fresh air, even if you are not a fan of explicitly magical worlds and excessive drama - its was still a new solid movie for entertainment purposes. This one, however, brings nothing new to the table except stunning underwater world with a dumbed down storyline. Especially when it's 3 hours long!I pray for the almighty cinema God the characters in the next Avatar will get at least a little development, change their NPC-like scripted behavior. Maybe some plot twist in the middle would be good like a bad guy suddenly dying mid-film or getting inner peace and joining the protagonist to resolve some new existential crisis (hopefully a more
thoughtful one)Next time I'll read the reviews first as a precaution if they are similar I'll probably skip :)","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

James Cameron returns to direct Avatar: The Way of Water, with returning performances from: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and Michelle Yeoh. Other cast includes: Kate Winslet from Titanic, Cliff Curtis from the Meg franchise, Britain Dalton, Jack Champion from Avengers: Endgame, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, and Jamie Flatters.Years after Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) decided to stay on Pandora with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), they are once again threatened. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) wants to kill Sully for betraying him during the last fight for Pandora.I liked the first Avatar movie, it had action, beautiful visuals, and a touching message. Even though this film had action and beautiful scenes, I didn't like it as much as the first, due to the story being similar to the previous.Just like the last film, there is lots of action. Once again the Navi people have to leave their home for somewhere new. In doing so, they have to learn how to survive with the Metkayina clan. They teach the Navi to hold their breath underwater for long periods of time. I liked all the underwater animals. Friendship develops between Lo'ak and Payakan, I found this sweet, since they are both outcasts.Cinematographer Russell Clapenter and director James Cameron did an excellent job creating beautiful scenes in and out of the water. They used a technique called performance capture, which means all the underwater scenes were filmed underwater, with everyone involved having to hold their breath underwater. Since this has never been done before, I find it amazing and feel this will change how underwater scenes are filmed.The storyline was very similar to the first Avatar. In the first movie the military wanted to use the Navi land to mine Unobtanium, in this sequel the military wanted revenge on Sully for siding with the Navi in the last movie. I found Avatar's: The Way of Water's three hours and 12 minutes unnecessarily long. Even though I didn't like this movie as much as the first, I still appreciate how beautiful it is and what it could do for Hollywood.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had similarly high expectations for the new Avatar considering the director has gone vegan and it seemed his heart is in the right place.But this movie is terrible. And I recommend you save your money. I live in Finland and it cost EUR 17,40 for the matinee showing at 12:45. I was sitting at home contemplating whether to go see it or not since it was pretty cold outside, almost -16.Well I should've stayed home.There is no plot resembling anything of substance. There is zero percent humor except a flying arm late in the film that got one lonely gag out of one of the few people in the theatre, me.I kept checking the time on my ipod nano and hoping it would end already after about 20 minutes into the film. I did breathing exercises and practiced mindfulness during the movie to help cope with the annoyance of having paid for an incredibly pretentious and boring film (with a budget that could feed a third world country).Great art has to be surprising. Gimme something. Even the score is extremely dull and predictable. Such visuals would perhaps go with a more futuristic soundscape and why not throw in some absurd dance or sex scenes in the middle of the film. Nope. Nothing. This is hollywood woke familly friendly all the way but with a lot of violence and killing white people.Of course.I couldn't make it to 3 hours. I put on my winter gear, left the 3d glasses on the adjacent seat and walked out. I wanted to make sure the gods understood my disatisfaction in the hopes of attracting higher quality content into my version of the dreamworld.Now back home, drinking beer, contemplating the vicissitudes of life (this year has been a weird one) and writing this review.If this is what you have been up to James for the last 15 years or whenever the first Avatar was released, your integrity as a film maker has seriously been compromised.Thanks for reading.","28 out of 62 found this helpful.

Direction-ish

But sadly, even a visionary like Cameron can fall for the usual Hollywood banality, and Avatar2 is nothing but full of cliches, so much so that I found myself saying ""we get it, it's a beautiful sea world, now for God's sake, move on with the story and give the swimming and fishes a break."" Make no mistake, Avatar2 looks stunning and has the telltale Cameron signature, with scenes that invoke memories from the Jaws, Terminator 2, and Titanic. If you watch it, you should definitely watch on the biggest screen available near you. But that's where the good things end. While making the movie a visual masterpiece, Cameron forgot to throw in a story, and it's as if at the last minute he went like ""Oh gosh, we forgot a story, let's just throw in some kids, and some family propaganda, release it in December, and the usual American audience will lap it up along with their Christmas meals.""--
Story-ish

Jake Sully is living happily with four kids, which, if you're conscious, is four too many when the world population has just hit 8 billion. He wasn't an officer in the army but he raises his kids with an iron hand acting like a General. The kids just exist, and often make stupid decisions only required to advance the movie. Jake and his wife have occasional loving arguments, but no fights, ever (I want to know which marriage counselor they see), and the wifey and children always fall in line with Jake.There's a character called ""Spider"" or ""the Monkey Boy"", but Cameron forgot to tell him what he was supposed to do, so this dude just dresses like Tarzan and tags along with various people at various times.There's more; the Earth is dying and humans want to establish a colony in Pandora. They decide that the natives must be wiped out. But when Jake flees (because family), the humans, for no reason, decide to forgo their mission and spend the rest of the movie hunting him down.3-star for the visuals.","17 out of 35 found this helpful.

The storyline, the ending, the acting and that mother of all twists (when the tree of life answered Jakes prayers and sent the jungle animals to their rescue). It well deserved to be the highest grossing movie ever made.How about this one, though? Well, you guessed it, sadly, their business people sat down and said hey, it's time to make another 1 billion dollar profit, people will line up to see the sequel but wait a minute, what difference does it make, why bother with another brilliant plot, and exceptional writing. Let's make a watery storyline ourselves (hence the name: way of water) and save a few 1000$ on the script. Actually, John's 3 year old nephew has come up with this good plot: a second group of avatars keep telling Jake sully: Jake, the way of water has no limits, no shape; for 4 hours, then we add as much cgi as possible and bingo = another 1 billion dollar.Unfortunately However, they failed to realise that people will never watch the 3rd sequel any more and the legacy of avatar will be brought to an end, comprehensively.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Got a numb feeling of realizing it's just a duplicate of the last movie, but with more water. The villains had no energy, no anger, no feeling. The threat was so bland and the action sequences were short and forgetful. Scenes dragged I suppose to keep you in awe of the visuals. The family had moments, but not enough to really have a huge impact. Lastly, I don't know who approved the uses of new teenage slang like the word(cuh), but that was also not needed. It feels like the type of movie that does not need that type of content they are on another planet after all... It's Just my opinion.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

My friend and I even fell asleep in the cinema. I would almost recommend the movie for family with kids if there weren't some quite violent scenes.Part 1 was also cheesy but more mature in terms of the themes and character development/arcs.If you want to watch some nice graphics and don't want to buy a playstation 5, then the movie could be a good choice.

In essence I've watched the whole movie mostly at 1.5 speed, and during the annoyingly protracted action scenes, at 2.0, even 2.5 speed. This should tell you how incredibly dull and unengaging is this sequel. I feel very sorry for the people who went to the IMAX Cineplex, where they didn't have the luxury of increasing the playback speed. Full three hours Chinese water torture - that's The Way Of The Water! :-DThere was only one (1!), relatively funny but predictable, moment in the whole movie: ""Show me your fingers!!!"" (If your IQ is over 80, you'll guess the outcome.)It is just one beautiful, expensive exercise in CGI. Hopefully, in Avatar 3, the ""Sky People"" will hire one truly gifted military tactician, who will bring approximately 300 kilograms of the neurotoxin Botulinum Toxin (or its Pandora equivalent), exterminate all life on Pandora during the first 5 minutes of the movie, and happily extract Unobtainium and Amrita for the remaining 85 minutes...Trivia fact:
About 200 kg of BoNT is enough to poison to death every oxygen-breathing animal on Earth, if released high in the atmosphere. That's why the airplane carrying few grams of raw materials for Botox®-from the US to the Allergan's facility in Westport, Ireland-has a military escort...I'm waiting now for the end credits, because I'm pretty sure the music will be good.

It's also look alike the Chin Dynasty, when the Chin Empire was founded, it's so powerful and invincible, then it weakened within decades and finally overturned by a new force. This is exactly what we've seen in Cameron's Avatar movies. The original first one is great, but after 13 years extravaganza of mindless self-destruction, the sequel simply failed to maintain its greatness and became so lame and so disgustingly repetitive. I strongly suggest to Mr. Cameron: Better cancel your 3rd and 4th sequences of Avatar. If you couldn't do the 2nd better than the 1st or just equalize it, then there's no sense to continue waste your time and money again and again. It's just too foolish, man. I just can't believe what you've done during the 13 years period by only focusing on the visual effect and completely forgot to visualize a better story and plot. You just cashed in what you've achieved from the 1st Avatar success and wasted it like a blind mice. Making Avatar like a visually stunning video game with hollow repetitive cliche after cliche and criminally piled them up without innovation of ideas. You are a tailor who cut and pasted from the mold for the Emperor's 1st new cloth, but forgot to make a new underwear for the Emperor. So when the emperor coming out of the palace facing his tax paying crowd, they immediately found out that the Emperor was just wearing an new outwear but without underwear. Please seriously consider my advice: Stop churning out the 3rd and 4th sequels, our family could only consume one badly baked turkey on this Thanksgiving.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

.The saddest part of the whole story is that it had absolutely no conclusion whatsoever.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

Magic can be created first time but not again. This time story is too shallow and run time of the movie is unnecessarily long and boring. We have to force ourselves to sit through the movie in expectations of some new exotic content like first part but we were hugely disappointed. There is absolutely nothing new or exciting in movie except nice visuals and wide exotic colour gamut. Would not recommend to spend money on theatrical release. Wait for some time and watch it on OTT platform for a very easily forgatable story. 2nd part afer so many years and that too with such a dull story line is really not acceptable.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

While the first Avatar was Pocahontas (I wish I was kidding), and already made it clear which side was in the right - this is worse. Utterly one-sided, no-redemption, flat-out evil is what we are supposed to feel. It is honestly quite stupid.The story is predictable, lame, without a single twist. I have seen more surprise watching a tree grow in real time.The dialogue is simply atrocious. What a waste of actors..
Oh and this movie steals three hours, while constantly feeling like it should only really fill two.In the final conflict, I challenge you to count the seconds between cuts to parallel theatres - no perspective lasts for more than five seconds before switching between protagonists, a total unfocused mess.What a shame.We can only hope the real humanity can do better, which leads me back to the beginning - I don't know of he planned it all....
(And yes, of course it is visually stunning. Sure, Avatars are still the slender beauty contest winners. Nice to look at, superficial things.)","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

Fx are still great, but you have seen it equally nice in other movies. But the story..., oh boy...
No nuanced characters, no character-arc, only exposition in the dumbest way possible.The story is extremely boring, combine that with a 3-hour runtime, it was almost torture.I guess there were too much characters to ever have time to get connected to anyone, even in 3 hours. Less would have been more.If the story was at least mediocre, i would rate this film 7 Stars; sadly the story is a a lot worse.I would rate this movie as one of the worst i have ever seen.Despite i like Cameron-Movies, i definitely wont see part 3.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Personally I was not a big fan of the first part. It was definitely a visual delight but I never re-visited the movie again.Due to its massive success, a sequel was inevitable. The Way of Water delivers on the visual front; with beautiful landscapes, creatures, characters (now with better VFX!) and more. It is clear that James Cameron wanted to focus on the world building, allowing some scenes to even feel documentary-like. But this is not a documentary, the story and characters are responsible for keeping me engaged and sitting in my seat for 3 hours and 15 mins.I found myself bored through several sequences, not really caring for the protagonist and his family (as much as they wanted me to). The 4 stars out of 10 are all credited to the VFX team, concept artists and stunt coordinators. I would not recommend the film if you felt so-so about the first one too. If you're a fan of Avatar and its world you will enjoy the film, but if you're like me, you will find yourself bored and checking your watch for when the 3 hour marathon will end.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

After about 5 minutes you know what's gonna happen in the rest of the movie. The theme revolves around the tired clash of nature versus technology (how incredibly original!), repeating much of the first film but worse. There are zero surprises or innovative or unique storytelling ideas. Instead, it's all just regrettably formulaic and unoriginal, failing to offer even a grain of depth, originality or wit.Without exception, every single character populating the screen is cliché, boring, and flat: The hero dad, the rebellious son, the emotional daughter, the sadistic bad guy, and of course the unbearably constantly smiling (even under water) nature-loving savages ....Wait, it get's worse! Because unfortunately the characters speak: the dialogue is so aggravatingly tedious and dim-witted, that it makes you want to innerly scream. The lines sound as if they had been written by dyslexic six-year-olds trying to sound cool (""yeah bro!""). Alas, throughout the entire movie not a single original or intelligent thought is uttered.Scene after scene the audience is tortured by a slew of one-dimensional torrid mush, drowned in an overload of meaningless special effects... and to make things worse it's even really long at 3 hours runtime!In Summary: Barring the big budget, this film would have struggled to rise above C- or B-movie rank. Save your time and money, avoid this film like genital herpes, and instead do something comparatively more intelligent or interesting with your life, like watching paint dry on a wall, or observing laundry tumbling in a washing machine...!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

They just recycled the old one.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

After the intermission I decided I was going to wait for the movie to finish in the entrance of the cinema because of how uninterested i was. As i am writing this I am waiting in the entrance of the cinema. The graphics are absolutely amazing but I think there is too much movement for my liking. Although that is just my preference .

If I were Native American I would raise a very strong protest about hackneyed cultural stereotypes- whooping war cries, bows and arrows, face paint, wampum beads, skimpy dress, sign language, etc. Terrible. I found the way that the females were clothed to almost deserve an R rating.

The good old good vs evil with little nuance to it. Lots of shooting and blowing up stuff, wrapped in an environmental friendly jacket. Also the dialogs are not much to be excited about. The scenario is pretty much a copy of the first installment. In some ways it actually got much worst as this movie really mostly looks like a costume play of AI characters. I mean if no one would tell you that the base are real actors, you wouldn't know.The positive part is probably that the execution is still a Cameron movie, so it's visually mind blowing and cutting edge... is it enough though to elevate it over any other popcorn movie?

You need a movie too, and Avatar 2 is none. It's a compilation of effects and Camerons technological capabilities acquired over many years. The story is ridiculous, the characters are, the lines are lame, the Pandora magic is gone, the new ""Pandora gold"" the sky people are harvesting is a joke only brought in to bring the story in the water from the sky people side, but boy, so badly done.With this movie and all follow-ons Cameron doesn't do himself a favour, as he didn't do before with his Terminator reincarnation, which was a total failure. His days are over and he shares this fate with his director buddy Ridley Scott, both never should have done any more Alien or Avatar movies.

The story of the first one was already cliche enough but had a reasonable endpoint. Here, A2 basically repeats the plot of the first one, and retcons some of the more important things of that film.At some level, if this were the historiagraphy of a true series of events, I could see the plot here being a reasonable next step. However, from a creative perspective, it is sorely lacking. It feels as if certain actors were contracted for a trilogy, but then circumstances had to be cleverly written to keep including them despite critical endpoints. It feels a bit cheap. Likewise, since the story is itself a rehash of the first movie, it doesn't feel particularly thoughtful. The major action sequence focuses around a moralistic tale from our own history, but is mainly set to tug at your heartstrings in a variety of ways that never really succeed.Probably the biggest misstep here is that the Reef People are not really explored from a cultural perspective. They are shown as having physical adaptations to undersea life, but at the same time speak the same language and have largely the same culture as the Forest People. This makes no sense, and also removes an obvious opportunity to explore inter-group relations among Indigenous peoples. There is never a suggestion that these peoples have any prior history up to this point, which is odd. It all fits into a 'Indigenous Good, Colonizer Bad' mentality- that isn't necessarily wrong, but it is patronizing at the same time.I did enjoy watching the spectacle. The CGI here is miles better than most of its contemporaries, which feels strange to say when we are 30 years after Jurassic Park. The world and the animations here at least look real, which is more than I can say for many current films that over-rely on CGI.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

After waiting 13 years, my hopes were high for an amazing film. However, what I found was that it focused too much on character recognition without an engaging storyline. It feels like a visually stunning display of art with a disappointingly flat plot. I was expecting a sequel full of intense action and vivid conflict. Unfortunately, what I found were ambiguous conflicts, particularly those involving birth and migration within a water tribe or the like, that lacked clarity and interest. In addition, the duration of the film that is too long makes it even more boring. Avatar 2 was supposed to be something new but was so similar to the previous Avatar that it made me less interested in watching it a second time. I expect there will be significant improvements in narrative and plot development in future sequels. While stunning visuals are the film's main draw, a strong story and engaging plot remain important factors in the overall viewing experience.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now after leaving the theatre I just feel disappointed of wasting 190 minutes. The climax could have been trimmed down by atleast 10 minutes. They let one of the main character alive just for the next part. Too many cringe moments like that and the kids behaving dumb just to extend the movie will make you irritated.

Sorry I might have went in with more expectations but now I really hope they don't do the next part.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I know James Cameron is looking for another franchise and I gather this is it, but... why? It's boring. It doesn't add much to the universe. It doesn't add to the characters stories or anything. It just exists. I really cannot tell why this was a necessary addition to the series, other than the obvious. It's just a cgi showcase.Hopefully the following chapters justify this one. Otherwise, I have no idea why (narrative-wise) this was made. Lame.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Its stunning visuals are a delicious feast for the eyes and the technical achievements on display carry the legacy of the original exactly how one would hope. But there is an emptiness here not unlike the feeling one has after gorging themselves like the Rock on cheat day. The feast may have been delicious but there was no nutritional value to be had.Here's a quick and dirty breakdown:PROS
+ Visuals are absolutely astonishing and may be worth the price of theatre admission alone for most
+ The world building on display is magnificent and it's tons of fun seeing another ecosphere on full displayCONS
Just like those pizza and pop nights capped off with a full pint of ice cream, Avatar: the Way of Water wouldn't be worth it if it didn't taste/look so good. Underneath that incredible veneer lies a subpar movie, even for mainstream Hollywood's modern standards.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I think Cameron is treating these like a prestige TV drama series so he can afford a movie or two just to create a bigger payoff in the later films.However, with just this one to go on your left with a film that could have been a pretty relaxed 90 minutes and instead has another 90 minutes of foreshadowing thrown in as well.TL/DR - Not even worth watching for the pretty colours.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Maybe it's one you had to see in theaters, but I don't think even a giant silver imax screen could've hypnotized me into enjoying this flat, cookie-cutter, unoriginal, and absolutely uncompelling story.Don't get me wrong, I thought the first one was bad, too. But this was another level. And I get it, it's a PG-13 movie, pretty much made for kids, not really my demographic. But even a preteen could have guessed cliche after cliche twenty minutes before each happened. And let me tell you, this movie is rife with them.It's important to recognize this is a Disney movie. And it feels like one. I'm not sure how involved Disney really was in the production of this movie, but everything from the acting to the lighting felt so... Disney. Fine. But here's the thing. Disney has been on their A-game with the writing for the past decade at least. Even the newer era Princess movies have some compelling arcs. This?

It is the best technical implementation of 3D in a feature length movie - that I have ever seen. The 3D shorts at DisneyLand and DisneyWorld were better. The blocking and editing honed for 2D 24FPS doesn't work for 3D HFR.REALITY CHECK:
Avatar-1 was perhaps 75% cultural, dealing with psychological perspectives, and incorporating many traits of indigenious Earth cultures, which are only palatable to Americans -- when made alien.Rewatching Avatar-1, I found that it plays much better today than 14 years ago, since environmental issues are front and present for a majority of Earth population.Avatar-2 is 66% a wannabe Marvel Comics festival of video-game violence. The digital effects at HFR - in action scenes - look like a video game. But then, that is probably the intended market, where the huge investment in 3D CGI will end up.To paraphrase another movie -- ""If you buy it, they will make it.""
""Show Me The Money!"" -- the motto of every major movie studio. Disney is no exception.Violence sells. Emotional intelligence does not. Thus, humanity is in a perpetually downward spiral into self-annihilation. E.g., people would rather watch Woody Allen's psychosis, than watch anything about the Dalai Llama. Mike Judge got it right with -- IDIOCRACY![Okay, now I have satisfied the 600 word quota.]","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Though it's hard to top what the original brought to visual effects more than a decade back so the ""wow"" factor is no longer there and CGI won't float the boat alone (I saw it in 2D so maybe the 3D packs more punch). It brings nothing new now, other than vivid colours.The storyline is the absolute letdown though. Not sure what I was expecting, other than having reasonably low expectations - this is Hollywood, so cheese and predictability are given afterall.But even then, it fails. The characters and scenes were transparent copies of ones we all know; idealistic village scenes, rites of passage, suspicious natives, city kids homesick on arrival in the countryside, grumpy kids and cliched family bonding, whale hunters persuing poor defenseless creatures, native Americans on horseback fighting against colonists, damsels-in-destress tied to the railway tracks...even the ""village scene"" from Platoon and Capt. Willard emerging from the Nung River to take out Col. Kurtz thrown in for good measure.And like every a good (bad?) action film, you can expect it to follow a tried and proven form. All but one of the hundreds of bullets sprayed by the ""bad-guys"" will miss its target, while arrows from our blue heroes are guaranteed to hit every time. It's a very predictable good-guys v bad-guys battle, relying on perfectly timed coincidences and sequences of events, limited nuance or surprise, plus a few mildly sad moments to give the impression the conclusion isn't clear-cut (when it pretty obviously is). All tied up in a way that leaves no doubt an Avatar III, and probaby many more after that, are on their way. All aboard! The money-making express is departing the station.Ultimately its a kid's film, with enough eye-candy to prevent most adults from falling asleep. But in the same way anyone old enough to have watched Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back will likely have been initially wowed, only to be stung by a string of abysmal sequels, Avatar feels headed in the same direction. It is simply weak. Boring characters, cringeworthy attempts at portraying ritual and culture, annoying kids, with a script and storyline written by a recently hired intern.Still, there is a way to make it more bearable. Be sure to take a bottle of your favourite tipple with you to the cinema and the rules are simple: down a drink every time one of the characters shouts ""Go!"" (with ""Go! Go! Go!"" resulting in triple drinks, etc)...guaranteed you'll be drunk as a skunk pretty quickly once the action heats up....such is the depth of script.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

There is no denying that. The water effects looks amazing the characters do look amazing. Everything else is fine. The characters and story are fine. I will admit that for a 3 hour movie that it didn't drag, but I don't remember much about it. I saw this movie four hours ago. I swear that it's already leaving my memory. I don't know how James Cameron thinks he can make over five movies about dull characters and plot. I don't even remember the characters names. Even the main character's name. There is an interesting aspect of father and son dynamics that would be interesting if it didn't boil down to bad guy bad and good guy good. There are some dumb plot beats here and there, but most of the plot feels unimportant to the main draw of the film. The visuals. Which I wouldn't mind if the characters were more interesting. Which they are not. This film didn't annoy me. I did like my 3d experience with this film while I was watching it. So, I was considering it a six. Then I realized that the memory of the film was quickly leaving my brain somehow. Including the main character's name within four hours. The only reason why I would watch this again would be to refresh my memory before the Third film comes out. That's it.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is advertised as a ""race to protect their home"". Nope. That is definitely not what this movie was about at all. This movie is nothing more than a personal vendetta about Quaritch trying to kill Sully. Towards the beginning of the film, it is stated that the humans want to control the ""hostiles"" in order for the humans to inhabit Pandora. But the rest of the movie has nothing to do with that at all. The protagonists even flee their home instead of protecting it. And the movie isn't even about protecting their new home either. It's simply about surviving Quaritch's attempt to kill Sully. It's a revenge movie, nothing more.It's just lazy writing. I guess they won't get to the part about ""protecting their home"" until Avatar 3 or 4 or 5 or 6, etc... What a shame too. Because the visuals in this film are absolutely fantastic.This film was basically 3 hours of clickbait.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Perhaps James Cameron waited so long to bring out this second instalment in the hope we wouldn't notice the almost complete repeated story of the first film. The only major difference to the first film is the location, with the ocean replacing forest.A film with stunning visuals, which this admittedly has in spades, this is utterly pointless as it lacks a compelling story with compelling characters. I'm writing this during the film which says a lot about how little I'm engaging with it, as a viewer; I've considered switching off a number of times. As with the first film, this one has some appalling dialogue, though this one has the addition of some really bad acting to boot.As an additional thought before watching this film and as it was set in the coastal region, I kind of hoped that it would involve the aliens seen in Cameron's much earlier film, The Abyss. Sadly, this was not to be.I'll certainly not bother watching the additional sequels.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Keeping this in mind, I decided to download the 4k version, hoping to witness a revolutionary 3D art. However, I was sorely disappointed, as the movie failed to impress in that department. The use of the Papyrus font in this film is quite puzzling. Was this a decision made by the director, and how did the art director approve of such a terrible choice? This font is typically associated with Christian flyers and esoteric scented candles, and it feels out of place in a movie that was supposed to be the pinnacle of high-concept entertainment.Despite the director's commitment to addressing environmental issues, portraying the native Smurfs as hunters seems inconsistent with his vegan or plant-based lifestyle. A truly balanced society that is in sync with its environment would respect all animals and refrain from hunting.The character design in this movie is unimaginative, and it is hard to understand how anyone could have approved it. It is even more perplexing that an alien culture could resemble run-of-the-mill mid-2010s goa-ravers with dreadlocks and earlobe rings. The design is so distracting that it made it difficult to focus on the dialogue, and it was unintentionally comical. It is mind-boggling that a movie with an almost unlimited budget could attract zero talent, and it is probable that it was merely ""yes men"" for the director.Overall, this movie is a great example of how money cannot buy love or artistic talent. I am sorry to say.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Among these causes are his convictions that movies yearn to be seen in large formats and that society must consider its impact on nature. Cameron's ability to convey these topics in a way that's appealing to mass audiences is what's always made him a revolutionary filmmaker. But the balance between striking visuals and an engaging story was skewed in Avatar: The Way of Water, which hindered my investment in the characters and rendered the supposed emotive moments unsuccessful. The pure spectacle of the film can't be undersold, but that alone failed to hold my undivided attention for the full 3 hour and 12 minute runtime. I'm an advocate for any movie that can draw audiences out of their homes and into the theaters, but next time I'd prefer it not be reminiscent of an egregiously long video game cutscene.","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

Violence as solution is the main focus of the movie covered sometimes by high preaching. Visual effects are not enough to cover shallow and predictable plot.

Also, while Cameron's vision & his execution of it are laudable, it's all a case of been-there-done-that. The first film was revolutionary in terms of pushing the envelope & giving audiences a never-before-seen technical extravaganza - & one with heart. In this film there is no breaking of boundaries, & its heart feels manipulative, not organic. Cameron basically throws in the kitchen sink & ends up losing focus. The story's emotional core - that family needs to be protected at all costs - gets drowned out by the inordinate length, slow pacing & over-emphasis on the technical razzle dazzle.Tread with caution.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

More fighting scenes than lore.Also translations are very bad because ""bro"", ""dad"" and ""buddy"" are no authentic words, for a spiritual species living on an other planet.It just sounds like out of an Teenage-Highschool-Movie instead of a film made for its actual target group (mid. 20s, that watched Part 1 - 13 years ago).I didn't like the movie at all and I am very disappointed by what modern movies seem to become... cashcows with 1h showdowns, that are so boring and repetitive, you start falling asleep.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

(way too much) against fantasy world backdrops. The End.Long version...
I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen other movies just so the ideas and plot devices all seem fresh.The adventure is cheesy and predictable but the action scenes are well sequenced and you can forgive the rampant cheese on the grounds that it's a family movie.The CGI seemed to have advanced very little since the last outting. And the IMAX 3D I thought was surprisingly weak and underutilized. I was hoping that any dumbed-down storytelling might at least be propped up by stellar 3D but it was disappointing on that front too.I'm giving this a 4 stars because work clearly went into it and I know underappreciated CGI artists must have worked tirelessly to make all the assets as they do for these kinds of movies.Given that I'd heard quite a bit of hype over this production along the lines of ""best movie I've ever seen"" and similar, I had high hopes. My experience was a long way from best movie ever and I really think now, more than ever, James Cameron peaked with Aliens back in 1986.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The first one, back in 2009, truly impressed me. 13 years later they manage to make a poor sequel. I've seen the 2009 and 2022 both in 3D. The HFR version was under expectations.The camera movement was poor, too much useless movement, not cinematic at all. The 3D effects in few parts were great. I enjoyed to see how well the characters were built, especially the portraits. These are the only good parts.The story was average. Hard to understand why they'll go so much trouble for revenge and why any of the tribes did not defend their leader. Also in the middle of the movie Ney'tiri is just gone for a while.At the end I had a strong feeling of 'Titanic 2: Pandora way.'","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

However, the middle part of the movie is just like a BBC documentary of the arctic without the excitement and depth that BBC is capable of putting into their documentaries.The entire story line is almost perfectly suited for a video game. An example would be Cyberpunk 2077. You switch characters and make videogame-ish decisions, until you reach the final location and beat the final boss. You always know it's going to happen, and as the story progresses you can begin to guess what the finale may be. Cyberpunk 2077 is well made and it's plot has twists and depth, while Avatar 2 seems to have put everything into visuals and nothing for gameplay and story.I am a fan of James Cameron from the Titanic and the Terminator series, so I cannot express my disappointment in this terribly made sequel. I sincerely hope Avatar 2 does not represent the current status quo in Hollywood, for that will be sad for everyone who love entertainment with actual intelligence in it.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

But it's obvious to say though that the visual effects were magnificently gorgeous and I owe a hats off to the visuals effects team themselves for all the hard work they did on every detail of everything! THAT is only the reason it is even getting 5 stars....luckily....Compared to it's predecessor, which kept the game simple, this one just has too much scrambled eggs together of things that make absolutely zero sense, cliches that we've already seen from other things before, with a bunch of overdone ""bonding"", drugged eye candy to where eventually your eyes get tired of looking at everything, a rehash of everything that happened in the first one, and top of all that, ZERO depth to anything. Which basically means zero emotional depth and you just don't care about anyone it seems. Zero story. If I could even call it a story itself, but sitting there watching a bunch of creatures fly, swim, crawl, etc is not a story. This could've been a completely different story and it probably would've been pretty solid with a different formula. Great visuals alone DO NOT MAKE A GREAT MOVIE. So agonizingly long too. Easily could've been 2 hours or less. My goodness. I was about to shoot myself.It's crazy to believe we waited 13 years for something to turn out not so quite good unfortunately. Not the sequel that we wanted. You would think for that long of a time, that they could've came up with a completely strong narrative, and an engaging storyline. They had PLENTY of time for rewrites and discussions. How did James Cameron not see that so many things were missing in this? Seems he went too far into his world of things and pretty much ignored everything else. Seems to me they gave him the right ideas or idea, but he just threw it away and instead wanted to focus on only Pandora. And I bet ya that is exactly what happened! His ego really led him astray.I think it goes to show that he forgot how to make narratives. And by all means, he is a fantastic director, but after seeing this? I don't know man, I think his time might need to be done. I just don't see how anyone can be so excited for the other Avatar movies to come. Because I'm absolutely not...I know...ouch.Avatar, your time is done. It's Game Over.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

doing exposition and world building. Mr Cameron knows this and has proven it's his strong point like in T2. I understand Pandora and the Na'vi are a lot more complex than robots becoming sentient and wanting to destroy humanity but if Cameron is planning more of these films then he could have spread it out a little more.Asking audiences to sit in a theater for this much world building after doing a nearly inordinate amount in the first installment is too much. I left the theater about 2hrs in because nothing of note actually happened in the movie. Caught a pirate stream to see what I missed - seems like all I missed was a mad-dash to an open-ended ending to set up part 3 and beyond.Performances were much better in this one. I was hoping to hear Jake Sully sound like an American all the way through and not dip into Worthington's Surrey accent, but I guess you can film an entire act underwater with motion capture but can't do another take of voiceover for consistency.The novelty of 3D in theaters has sadly worn off and the 3D filmwork in the movie was abysmal. The framerate kept noticeably dipping and speeding up during heavy 3D scenes. I was really looking forward to this sequel but it really underdelivered compared to the first one. Which I did watch before going to the theater and throughly enjoyed.","17 out of 44 found this helpful.

This film is excruciatingly boring, the run time was way too long, the plot is LITERALLY (not even exaggerating) nonexistent. Even with the stunning visualsThe first hour is pretty much a recap from previous film, then follows by an hour and a half of national geographic documentary, then some build up for next franchise. ALL (and i mean all) the characters are one dimensional, lots and lots of horrible line. I can't really tell the acting through the cgi, but the ones without cgi is borderline tolerable, almost bad even.Cameron has been working on these franchise for decades, the least he could do is to hire some proper screen writer, because MY GOD the writing is extremely awful. I'm not even surprise if the actual script is written by an intern with 0 experience. It's so cringe it gives me physical pain, and i wish i'm exaggerating.Eh, i guess if you like the first film, you might like this one.

Hopefully they do a much better job with the 3rd instalment of the franchise.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film goes around a lot, and in the end, you are left with the sensation that you wasted time. Also, in some long scenes that didn't lead to anything, the rhythm is lost, like the scene of the boy swimming holding onto the fin of the underwater animal, and this scene, apart from being long, is repeated twice... what torture. I think that Cameron, who wanted a super-production, made the mistake of making several alternative ""sub-films"" almost with different directors and later, cutting and pasting, which generated the abysmal gaps that are seen and noted in the script. On the other hand, the animation seems to have ""deteriorated"" compared to the version more than 10 years ago, there are scenes where the animations are almost dubbed superimposed on the real actors, and others where the actor is talking to the animation but is looking away... in short, a number of incredible editing errors, I really don't know what were the criteria to be in the best films of this year... But hey, not all bad, the plot, although overloaded, is not bad, the same as the message of family strength, and the visual effects.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

And finally.... after 14 years this idiotic teeange-y mess came out and left us in more disappointment & resentment even worse than matrix sequels did.Where to begin to tell about this insult to original Avatar? Should we get frustrated to see the characters are stereotype American teenages? (Even ""forest people"" get bullied by so-called ""sea people"", oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...) Should we get surprised to see people of Pandora acting as mindless zealots? Didn't they have connection to the soul of the planet?

To the reader, I wouldn't waste your time or brain cells, this movie will make you dummer while fooling you with extensive CGI visuals. The storyline of this movie couldn't have perpetuated more negative stereotypes if it had tried. The plot was predictable, one dimensional, disconnected, and flimsy. First and foremost is the utterly predictable and painfully one dimensional Sully family dynamic punctuated by a stereo-typical level of family discipline reminiscent of the 1950s. Second, is the utter over simplistic view of indigenous people as primitive ideologues. Third is the equally over simplistic view of Marines as murderous brutes devoid of dialogue that exceeds two syllables. The majority of this film consisted of stunning, imaginary visuals that were punctuated by dialogue and attempts at weaving bad plot lines into a story. If you want to enjoy the visuals, listen to a podcast, listen to a book, or do something else to occupy the intelligent parts of your brain while your eyes are occupied. Better yet, turn it on when you can stream it from home, mute it, and skip around the parts that aren't CGI immersive alien aquarium views. The visuals would make a great update to my screen saver for my 1990s Macintosh. In fact, watching a screen saver of fake marine life for 3 hours would be more intellectually stimulating and less insulting to the viewer, sentient creatures, and people in general. Finally, how can anyone make a movie about life of a Marine, dealing with stereotypical (utterly unrealistic) Marine family life, inter-personal Marine drama, based in a marine scene and leave out crayons?","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It seems 13 years weren't enough for Cameron to improve a single line of the dialogues. Tons of cliches. Tons of plot conveniences and plot holes, like where were the Metkayina when Jake and Neytiri went to rescue their family? What was the dynamics in the relationship between Quaritch and Spider to understand their motivations and decisions at the end? It's not even clear the motivations of Quaritch to hunt Sully to begin with. Some may say that these and other holes are due to a cut Cameron had to do to the original 3 and a half hours movie length, but that's not a valid pretext as he could've cut some parts from the long and dull set up in the first hour. Besides, it's not like Cameron is an independent filmaker that was victim of a big studio decisions, he has full control over the final product.Overall it's a mediocre movie with great visuals and packed action.

I had to put in my two cents, though it will be short. If I have to read one more time that this film had the most amazing visual effects ever I will lose my mind. You want visual effects? Watch Dragonslayer. Watch The Empire Strikes Back. This is not visual effects. This is some nerds behind computers playing around with ones and zeros. Brains, sure. But actual masters of visual effects? 100% absolutely not. It just amazes me that there are so many that are saying that this is a masterpiece. That it is James Cameron's greatest film ever. I can't believe what a huge disappointment this film was, in every respect.","12 out of 31 found this helpful.

Truly a theater going experience of a life time I saw that film over three times in IMAX 3D but finally after twelve long years Cameron releases Avatar: The Way of Water. Does it surpass its predecessor or blow it out of the water? (yes pun intended) to this question I say disappointingly no.I will get the obvious out of the way first, Avatar: The Way of Water much like the first film is a cinematic marvel! This film is beautiful and absolutely gorgeous. While returning to the traditional forests and mountains of Pandora was great the true beauty lies in its underwater world. The underwater sequences were absolutely stunning. I can only imagine how this film looked in IMAX 3D I'm sure it's incredible in any premium format.Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana return as Jake and Neytiri though they both take a backseat in favor of they're children. As for the children they were not strong enough to carry this film. Constantly getting themselves into trouble over, and over, and over again as well as never listening. Now granted this can be excused as they are kids who don't really know better and haven't had to face the threats Jake and Neytiri have. So I am slightly willing to give a pass here as long as Cameron realizes in the future these characters must be matured, I will only accept ""kids will be kids"" for so long and after what these kids went through I expect them to be matured in a third film.The return of Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver was wonderful they both gave great performances and I loved having the Colonel back he was a great villain in the first film and is a great villain again here. Sigourney Weaver plays Jake Sully's adopted daughter Kiri and I have to say she did so fantastically, how a 73 year old woman convinced me that she was a child is beyond me but she did it.Now to talk about the negatives. The story is just a recycled narrative of the first film and Cameron for some reason is content at just rehashing the same story beats throughout the entire second act. You did all this in the entirety of the first film so why are we doing this all over again. The third act is less a booming climatic battle but more of personal conflict and vendetta between Jake and the Colonel. Which wasn't bad because the story being told was more of a intimate story of family and the Colonels quest for revenge. But then what was the point of the sea people taking part in this ""battle"" they disappeared so fast. There's a clear indication of a grander conflict here but it's just not touched upon in favor of this personal conflict which would've been okay if it was resolved but it wasn't.Which was another draw back, the scope of a grander story is here but is just abandoned almost immediately. Perhaps this grander story will be picked up in the additional sequels Cameron has planned but unfortunately its just not used here. The first act in my opinion was the best this film had to offer, Cameron wasted no time in getting straight to business which I was incredibly grateful for. After about ten minutes of reintroducing Jake and Neytiri and introducing their kids we are immediately treated to the humans return and the ensuing conflict. Unfortunately due to the fast paced nature of the first act the explanation for their return is rather glossed over, like if you blick you miss it.Speaking of weak explanations, while I definitely enjoyed the return of Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver the explanation as to how was just soo... why? To me. I'd go into further detail but that is spoiler territory and I don't want to give anything more away as I feel I already have. Now the run time, I personally felt every minute of the 3 hours and 12 minutes admittedly that last 12 minutes is credits but still 3 hours is a longtime for what was the most part to me a rehash of things we already saw. I must say though the first hour of this film flew by as I was thoroughly entertained by the action but things slowed down immensely afterward when going into the second act.Lastly and this is more of a personal problem, James Cameron just has to bring something political and preachy here. More of his humanity is evil and the natives are good crap. The forced empathy for the sea people after seeing the aftermath of the whaling sequence was just annoying. It all came off as a poor ""save the whales"" message which was made pretty clear during said sequence. Anyway I just did not care as I rolled my eyes extensively to this weak forced sympathy attempt.Well this review really got away from me so I'll start wrapping things up. I was thoroughly hoping that this second viewing was going to help maintain my score but it just lowered it because of the story repeats of the first film, a rather lackluster final act, a overbloated run time, and of course Cameron's typical political, preachy nonsense I have to say it was just average to slightly below average.Second viewing thoughts:
I want to take this chance outside my review to mention the 3D and HFR (High Frame Rate) experience. The 3D format is second to none, it elevated all the spectacular visuals to booming heights. Also the 3D technology added a layer of immersion to the underwater sequences I have never experienced in a cinema. Now throw in higher frame rates with this 3D and it is just stunning! The high frame rate made everything look soo smoth, it was gorgeous and because of the immense cgi usage in this film the high frame rate made the 48fps (Frames Per Second) sequences look like a video game and I loved every minute of it. I yearn for the day video games can look as good as this film does. Unfortunately the transitions between the standard 24fps and 48fps was at times unnatural and made for a bit of a turn off.This second viewing also just highlighted this films shortcomings particularly in the story department, while a first viewing things were more tolerable this second viewing just made everything I was slightly annoyed by to being extremely annoyed by. The children are just stupid and not at all that interesting and because of the recycled story it made the 3 hours unbearably long.At the end of the day I firmly believe this film is only getting high scores because of fantastic visuals and James Cameron. A terribly boring story, and a run time that is completely unnecessary makes this beautiful mess of a film extremely average, but because it's been a long time since Avatar it recieves eights, nines, and tens. Well James Cameron isn't getting a pass from me.By the end of the film I was just extremely disappointed even more so than my first viewing. While the 3D technology and HFR affect carry things to amazing heights, you can't just rely on amazing technology to make a good film. Now because my score for this second viewing was so dependent on the 3D, HFR format I'm going to have to for the first time in my reviews give two different scores.2D non HFR:

Once we'd gotten enough visual effects for the day we were left with bad dialogue and template storylines mashed together in a weird, off-putting way.The movie tried to tell me a story but didn't know where to begin, where to take me and how to take me there so it panicked and just threw some random scenes at my face, and when that failed, it kept buying time with special effects and wonderful nature panorama...
It was like we're building up to something, we're not excited about it because it's incredibly predictable, and there is a good chance it may never come because it's already been 2 hours...There is no build up to the emotional bonds between characters so they seem very unrealistic. There are unnecessary characters that add no value and they are intolerable. The dialogue just kept getting worse and worse to the point where we watched a woman chatting with mother whale about their children, and the whale was asking 'how is your baby doing?' or something. This was the moment we decided to leave the theatre to save the rest of our evening.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first movie. It had an actual storyline, even it it was a bit weak and predictable. But this? Really, it's just a beautiful visual assault and that's all.Although I've not been a tremendous fan of Cameron's movies, this has to be a career low for him. He should have hired someone who can write a decent story and create decent dialogue. I don't recommend spending money on going to a theater to watch this one. Wait until is streams.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

There are many interesting things that add to the story that can be answered or simply cut the duration. Many things don't make sense anyway.

It could have a nice message, but it's such forced judgement against humans that it loses any entertainment value.

This was one of the least necessary sequels ever and it's overly long to boot. It suffers from the same malaise as most of the recent Marvel movies and ultimately it is much ado about very little.

The world desperately needs the sense of mystery, hope, magic - which I presumed was what we were gonna get here, but I have to say - it was very dissapointing.We learn nothing new about Jake and Neytiri, and their characters need further development because their inner dynamics were one of the strong points in the original. Jake's narration and video logs in the first movie, his transformation and falling in love with Neytiri and Pandora were a strong point in the first movie.Actually, none of the characters have depth and development. The dialogues are horrible.There is no mystery, no real world building except - ""Hey, some Na'vis love water and there are some cool creatures there.""The story is really bad. Bringing back the old one-dimensional bad guy, whom nobody wants too see back.Humans want to live here? Why, what happened? What about unobtanium? Why Amrita?The only slightly magical part for me was that girl who has a special connection with Eiwa, that was interesting and I had hoped too see more. And learn more about Eiwa.In the end, nothing was resolved, after a long 3 hours.Like another reviewer here said, all style no substance. I could go on and on about the faults of this movie, but in the end I am glad it is doing well, because it might help achieve Cameron's goal about inspiring people to care about nature more.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Loved the space whales, especially when one went full Avenger.Perhaps it was seeing alien blue people - yeah, I know, they're hybrids raised by a former human - Jake, hiss like cats one minute, then snap, ""Hey bro!"" and ""Come on, cuz!"" the next, but just looked silly. The alien green people - the Way of Water, were straight-up alien, though still acted like moody teens - and a lot of hissing. Perhaps that's just how Jake's 'translation app' made everyone sound - making it easier for the audience to comprehend.

We already have plexiglass that can stop bullets from an AK-47 at point blank range, can't we improve on that?Instead of making arrow proof glass, they do form a new infiltration squad but they end up being useless canon fodder.In short, 3 hrs of tedious, repetitive action.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is an absolute favorite movie of mine. Magical atmosphere, super cgi and great story.The way of the water however is an unworthy successor.About the story: it is very banal and extremely similar to the first one. Besides gaps in the context and completely incoherent events, the label's desire to release another part is very clear. It has its moments but in the end it becomes very obvious that it was just something to close the gap to the following movie. The open end comes as a horrible decision on top.Characters: acting-wise it is what it is, with cgi unfortunately not much to hollow out. But also hardly any new characters and other things are introduced to the first and you could have honestly organized another better villain.Now for the cgi: the film is beautiful. Nothing breathtaking through the bank, however, there are some very good scenes. Still these can't make up for the fact that there are some extremely bad cgi sequences and objects. The potential is also either not fully exploited in the right moments, or is far too bright and shiny and just seems fake.The new world that the film wanted to show is not really as beautiful and new as was hoped.The film does not really convince me but more important what really leaves me cheerless is whether the next part will be a pure money-making or if it finds its roots again.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was a competent sci fi/action flick with a cool premise and a nice array of exciting action set pieces. It had many negatives however. The characters were paper thin, the dialogue veered between banal and complete cringe, the designs of the creatures and planet of Pandora felt quite derivative despite how nice everything looked and, which has been noted many times before, the story is a straight up reskin of much better films such as Dances With Wolves and Fern Gully. However, despite its many shortcomings, it still managed to rise above them and be mildly entertaining.The same CANNOT be said of its sequel. Wow, what an utter SLOG. This film is a chore to sit through. An endurance test. 3 hours is a long time, but if the film is compelling enough, it can whizz by. Not in this case. The story, which can be written on the back of a fingernail, cannot justify the obscene bum-numbing length. From this point i'll list the pros and cons in bulletpoint form:PROS: -The visuals look lovely as you'd expect. I wouldn't say they are a massive upgrade from the 2009 film, but they certainly dazzle. The 3D as you can expect is absolutely masterful. Not gimmicky, just completely immersive.-Stephen Lang. I won't spoil anything regarding his purpose in this film but he's easily the most fun character in these films, easily. One dimensional to the max, but that's perhaps part of his charm.CONS:-The runtime. The film had no right being this long. It feels padded out and bloated with looooots of filler.-The dialogue. Oh boy, the dialogue. I don't expect every character to speak like a Shakespeare character but come on. Sample quote 'I don't speak English to buttholes'. The bulk of the most offensively bad lines came from Sully's kids who can't go a sentence without saying 'bro' and 'cuz'. Because of course if you're born on a alien planet without access to humans, you'd talk like that(??). Sully doesn't speak like that. Baffling. James Cameron having a 'hey fellow kids' moment.-Unlikeable/boring characters. Never found Jake Sully a particularly engaging character (perhaps a result more of Sam Worthington's pancake-flat wooden performance) and here is no different. At least he had the compelling aspect of being a paraplegic who is now put into a strange body where he has freedom to fully live and move around. Now he's a fully formed Na'avi and that interesting dynamic is all gone. His personality is basically 'i hate humans and love my family'. I was completely passive to him ever being in peril. I detested his stupid annoying children, they were aggressively irritating. Neytiri is still...there. The inhabitants of the new water location are also....there. By the way try and guess the character Kate Winslet plays because i couldn't work it out!. There's a reason Avatar gets a lot of flack for 'having no cultural importance' despite being the biggest film of all time...and it's because the characters are absolutely awful. They all speak the same, look the same, they really really love nature don't you know?? There's no real variety and that's a hindrance.The story. The humans are back and the Na'avi have to move. No, that's it, that's the story. 13 years of writing and that's the best way they could move the story forward.I was completely indifferent to how this film unfurled. A deeply disappointing 2nd entry in the series. Certainly not looking forward to any successive sequels after this. Might check them out on TV but certainly won't be making the effort to drive to the theatre, i don't care if they play it on a screen the size of the Grand Canyon.I've seen people declaring the film a masterpiece and showering it with praise. They're clearly blinded by the pretty colours because there's nothing behind it all. Sorry, i'm not so easily fooled. All spectacle, no substance. Visually mindblowing, narratively braindead 4/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Strong engaging story
2). Length of the movie
3). Gap in time of releasesBeing a fan of sci fi and thriller movies, Avatar 1 caught my interest for it's ability to not just create a new world Pandora but also an engaging yet crisp story telling about humans , their need for Pandora and the natives. Best in class team to work on Graphics made the story more so real that we all wanted to watch Avatar2.But having waited for almost a decade, I think the A2 has to be more interesting than its predecessor on all fronts mentioned above. Story, engaging yet crisp and graphics.While graphics didn't disappoint, the movie for me fell flat on all other parameters.Movie came across as a revenge party between the villain and protagonist than anything else. While it isn't a bad plot, a decade wait for this story line didn't justify for me.It's stretched in story telling in A2, with rushed up scenes to cover gaps in later part of the movie to make meaning of climax and didn't help. There was a few moments during later 1 hour of the movie where I just wanted the movie to end.To conclude, am sure there's enormous effort that has gone into the movie and kudos to the team, it's just that I believe I am not as excited after watching A2 as I was A1 and have no plans to watch upcoming ones.This movie will definitely garner support and box office for marketing and audience that will love graphics but that isn't the barometer of a good movie!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

-film score blends well
-don't need to remember anything about first movie to watchCons:
-action for action's sake
-long
-wish there was more commentary or suggestion of openness to others joining a new tribe. When in film will we see the tribe that is open to immigrants/otherness from the getgo?-this movie is pro-mother but not necessarily pro-woman. Man is king and so is heteronormativity.

Please don't waste your time watching this.The movie is incredibly beautifully made. But when you've seen 15 minutes, you've seen it all.And it has literally no plot. There's no story to the movie at all.There's so many indifferent scenes, that has nothing to do with anything, that's obviously only made to make an impressive animation, which they naile - but that's about it. Nothing exiting about this movie.There are so many strange scenes that are repeated for no reason at all, again only to do more animation.The only thing I could think in the cinema while watching it was ""oh please let it be over soon""

He's directed two of the greatest sequels of all time with Aliens and Terminator 2. I was wondering, could he pull it off again?The answer is no. Like many of the other reviewers will tell you, the strongest point of the movie is the visuals. The story is the same as the first movie with many of the same events happening again and even some of the same dialogue being used again.Basically it's an inferior version of the first movie. It had some good ideas but didn't execute them as well as it could have. Being so similar to the first movie there really needed to be some other side plot or something going on, especially when the movie is three hours long.Since seeing the movie it really made me think about Terminator 2. Terminator 2 is very similar to The Terminator but it's bigger and better in almost every way. Avatar 2 needed to be bigger and better than Avatar and it's not.The 3d was pretty cool. There were moments when it was like you were right there with the characters on screen.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was give you a bad bad headache. The movie is too long and that too unnecessarily and sitting there for that long with your chair shaking so much. Thank God nobody threw up. It could have easily been reduced by 30 mins or more. To add to my misery, the screen got stuck 1 hr into the movie and after that the next 15 mins we had to watch it with an audio lag. Not sure how they realized, but they fixed it 15 mins later and moved the film back again from the scene where it had got stuck. So, we had to sit down an additional 15 mins. That is not the movie's fault, however, the movie still is very very long. When Avatar 1 had come out, for its time, the graphics were really cool. But for Avatar 2 given the year we are in, we have seen stuff like this. It cool but not ahead of it time or something unbelievably good. Still I would graphics were good. The biggest let down was the story and the pace of the story telling. There were so many times I was wishing for the film to end. The end fight scene was dragged way too long and for no reason. I did expect a lot since this was a James Cameron film, however for me, this will be my final Avatar at the theatres.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

No one at Fox said, ""Wait James, don't you think you need to give them something more than just pretty pictures, gun fights and LOUD explosions? And he said, ""Shut up. I am king of the world."" And so they made his picture. They spent 300 million, and evidently set aside $1000 of it for the script writer. Oh yah, they forgot to hire an EDITOR! Even the spectacular special effects, great as they are -- everyone agrees on that -- they are repetitive to the point of painfully boring.That said, the score and soundtrack in Dolby Atmos is a pleasure to behold. Just as the 3D (stereo for the eyeballs) is beautifully and judiciously executed, so to is the spacial expanse of the orchestral and choral musical score. It literally surrounds you; it is the most immersive soundtrack I have heard of any film to date. And the ability of Atmos to locate sound elements precisely in any part of the 360 degree soundstage allows bullets ricocheting back and forth, up and down and around you in the theatre is quite amazing. But then someone need to get a doctor to check the sound mixing techs for hearing loss because the fight battles -- many MANY of them -- are eardrum splittingly LOUD. And you know that is not the theatre just keeping the overall sound level to high, because the dialog in the quieter sections is spot on; making it any lower would lose the dialog. They just mixed it way to loud. I saw patrons holding their ears during those fight scene -- which, btw, we way to many and went on for way to long.For the enjoyable elements of visuals, the 3D and the score and sound mix, I give this three stars, but they are certainly not enough to hold together the rest of the mindless nonsense that goes on for 3 freakin hours.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Okay...It should be a game to drink ""water"" every time a character says ""bro"" in this movie.The movie is really forgettable. I watched it a few days ago and I can't remember much memorable scenes.The main characters in the first one takes a major backseat; in fact, Sam Worthington's Jake character is really annoying, unnecessary side character, along with his wife, also nagging and screaming and crying all the time on screen - like stereotypical crazy parents - while it's more about two brothers trying to deal with what else... bullying and trying to fit in.... Everything is generic, stereotypical and predictable.This took over a decade to make? Maybe this movie is only meant to be seen in 3D IMAX and it's not worth your time in other ways; kind of like the movie ""Gravity"" was an absolute bore on a home screen, but is an amazing experience in 3D.The special effects in Terminator 2 is still impressive than this movie.

While the first film was a groundbreaking and visually stunning achievement, Avatar 2 falls flat in every other aspect.It is clear that James Cameron is more interested in showcasing his CGI skills than in crafting a compelling and well-written story. The plot is weak and unoriginal, with shallow characters and predictable plot points. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.I was extremely frustrated with Cameron's obsession with CGI over substance. While the special effects are impressive, they cannot save the film from its numerous flaws. It is clear that he prioritized visual spectacle over storytelling, and the result is a shallow and unengaging film.Furthermore, the film's runtime is excessive and indulgent, with scenes dragging on for far too long. I found myself checking my watch multiple times during the film, eager for it to be over. It was a tedious and painful viewing experience, and I would not recommend it to anyone.Unfortunately, Avatar 2 is a huge disappointment and a clear example of style over substance. It is a prime example of James Cameron's ego and lack of storytelling ability, and I would strongly discourage anyone from wasting their time and money on this film.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The sequences and how everything moves and works together is very nice to take in and visually stunning. We got that with the first one and now with this one as well.Where this falls short big time is the story. The story is very light and a little all over the place. You're going from sully being hunted to sully learning how to swim and then oh wait.. here is a story of how some whales know how to communicate with the locals, back to sully and his family swimming..Now on to one of the family members having special powers and staring at the sand for a bit.. okay now back to Sully escaping the crazed captain wanting sully dead. Mix that in with some really bad acting by the kid that played Spyder and you have a very sporadic story with no consistency.The ending however and some of the swimming scenes were very immersive and inviting. Overall just a 5/10 and probably gonna skip the rest of the avatar saga completely now.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, now with a nice little family. Searching for something more, that can be absorbed as the soldier, he still are portraying. He ends up in the the same scenario like last time, where he and his spouse needs to clean up. The twist: They now need some help from there kids. A more appropriate movie title could also be: ""The Sully's team-up"".""Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win"" (Sun Tzu). Is not in use, when it comes to war on planet Pandora, episode 2. What did the Navi tribes learn from the first encounter with humans? I guess, absolutely nothing, but a walkie talkie. Still attacking heavily armed gunships with medieval weapons. And why not, as they are winning the battle. The reverse question is equally disappointing. Humans don't adapt any new strategy to concur or remain among the Navi, other than a small tactical improvement. They camouflage them selfs as Navi in various ways. However still failing their main objective.I don't think the movie want to portray a big dilemma or a complex situation to solve for any of the entities or persons in the movie. However, I felt a real hunger for a bit of story somewhere, while watching the movie. I even think this film can be watched in a language, nobody understand at all. No real need for any dialog, as you will still get main story.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I am a person that doesn't put to many points into technical aspects. Sure, I can be impressed and when a movie really blows you away AND looks incredible it does a lot to you. A good camera and great effects can really enhance an experience. But I see it as no more than frosting on a cake, a great core story, great characters and having something to say is what builds the cake all the frosting is going on. In the case of Avatar I´m impressed by it´s technical aspects, but not blown away in the story department.When Jake Sully and his family is threatened by the humans again, they flee to a water tribe of the Navi. Here they most learn to adapt to the new tribe.Let´s start with the biggest praise this movie should get, it´s CGI. This movie looks absolutely incredible! It feels lightyears ahead of its predecessor and that says a lot. The way water looks, the shadows, under water, over water, the Navi, the water on their skin, the creatures, backgrounds, machines. All are done to an insanely high standard and the animation team should be proud of their achievement. This is a technical marvel, but sometimes it cracks. Sometimes the characters look a bit like a PS4 game. Sometimes the creatures don't look too great, sometimes the backgrounds stick out as just CG backgrounds. This is more praise to the high standard this movie sets, but it also shows when it can´t uphold it and that´s a shame.My biggest issue with this movie is it´s lack of a greater point for me. I don´t really feel like I watched a movie, but binge watched 5 episodes of a show. Jake and his wife now have 4 kids and 3 of them has a lesser story going on, as well as the villain and everything in between. There is too much in this movie, too many directions, too many micro stories that barely fit together. This coupled with some poor editing in terms of editing between scenes creates this movie that gains momentum, only to cut away and start a new, the snowballing effect of scenes don´t really work here for me and it felt incoherent at best. This also makes time feel incoherent. It´s hard to tell when events are happening relative to each other and sometimes I blatantly think there wasn't given a thought to the passage of time.The movie uses some really annoying and pandering voice over. There are beautiful and emotional scenes of great acting and music that tells it all and then Jake has to explain to me what is going on. It´s annoying and really undermines the tone of the movie and the intelligence of the viewer. Other than that the acting is pretty solid. A lot of strong performances all around but no character is given the earned focus they need too. I really think they should have cut down on characters. Th villain felt dumb from the beginning, the kid felt unnecessary, the one of the sons and the sister is barely there and it goes on like that. A tighter movie with more focus on 3 characters story would have done better than having it as it is now with few stories but many characters to tell it. The character Kiri was also a bit distracting because of the age they were supposed to be and their story really led to nothing.This movie is filled with cliche lines and story tropes. While they are fine, they feel see through. Misunderstood giant, bullying, fitting in, family, stories that are good to tell, but feels barely given the time they deserve in this movie.The world is incredible here. It´s fun to see another side of Pandora, see the plants, animals, different water and buildings. It feels like another culture to explore and that is no doubt one of the fun aspects about the movie. It´s hard to teel the different characters here apart though, and I wish they looked different enough to really make them stand out.The last hour of this movie is a great acting set piece that I enjoyed, but like I've already mentioned, this movie has too much going on and I wished it would have been cut down. This movie felt long, too long and after an hour I literally thought we were getting to the end as all the pieces were in place for an ending. A rushed one, but at least not a drawn out one.I think this movie really missed out on a great story about family. It doesn't really feel like the movie wants to say much compared to the original movie and the bonds between family and friends are glossed over here. All the characters and their relations feel separated, like we are supposed to just accept they have a bound because they are related. The first movie didn't engage me with it´s characters either, and this movie really wants me to continue the bond from that movie so it was already working against itself in my case.I thought the different new animals were well designed and looked cool, although I think the movie didn't implement the learning curve well for the characters. They have a hard time riding them for one scene and the next they are masters. They have a breathing technique that is hard to master and then learn it right away and there is also an animal that makes them breath underwater....why introduce this? Also, why do the water Navi speak English? I think it´s so fun this universe has an entire made up language, but this movie never use it.Avatar 2 was fine to me, but nothing I feel like I need to watch again. It has it´s ups and downs, it has it´s fun moments and is beautiful, but the storytelling didn't do anything for me. It feels like it works against itself to cram in as many characters, stories and ideas as possible, instead of working on it´s great world and the relations within it. I see potential here, but the movie didn't do it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sorry it's well told, although nothing new or surprising. Well written story, that virtually anyone could have come up with. Piggy backed on most of the innovations from the original and just stayed as the status quoWhile it was entertaining enough to watch, it by no means brought any type of deep view about life or three world in which we live. I think it was more perhaps a missed opportunity that could have covered so much more, but instead repeated itself and stayed in the safe boring path that is all too predictable and so much manufactured by Hollywood.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

After waiting for 13 years we got the newest avatar but was waiting for so long worth it? Avater is a science-fiction movie, produced by 20th Century Studio. The script for this movie was written by Josh Friedman, Amanda Silver, Rick Jaff, Shane Salern and the director James Cameron. For me this movie was really good but it could me better. The cast was full of well known actors and actresses, the music suited brilliant the mood of the film, dialogues were also great. The thing that in my mind is the reason why it is not as good as it could is the lenght of it, 3 hours and 10 minutes is a bit too long if it was 2 hours and 30 minutes it would be much better. I think that is the only thing that I would change. The movie overall was good and I totally recommend watchng it, especially in 3D.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It trod new ground as far as CGI Cartoon/live action mash-ups were concerned. The story was terribly cliche and had been done many times before but it was an entertaining ride.The sequel, however, is not fun. The revolutionary CGI looks old fashioned already and seems quaint in a novel way. The story is even more cliched with teen romance/drama seemingly taking front and center. To avoid spoilers, the main bad guy looks particularly weird and causes an extreme Uncanny Valley reaction in me for some reason.I've been watching the blu ray of this for months and still haven't finished it nor gotten to any meat of the story. I can only do thirty minute chunks before giving up. It's incredibly boring for some reason and at over three hours is just stupidly long. Strip away the fancy glitz and there's nothing new underneath. If Cameron is relying solely on visuals, he's going to come very unstuck with the rest of the pentalogy as the story is either almost non-existent to very thin or has been done better elsewhere. This is throw away cinema at it's finest. Billions of dollars for what amounts to a dull experience that isn't any where near as good as Fern gully....err I mean the original.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie is WAY too long. There are very unnecessary long scenes that had zero purpose other than James Cameron just showing off his visual making skills. He could have easily made this into a two hour movie cutting out the fluff. The acting is over the top and not great.

And I dont want to say any Spoilers ,(so can't relay tell you the plot in less than 50 words, what is all i need)It is just things happening for reasons what go no where? And that is all, it is just to look at and with watching this on a normal 4k TV in 4k, it just looked... ok not relay special at all,
this movie could of been 30-40 minutes and it would have all the same feelings and understanding of the would and story!So i say just watch a recap of the movie on YT or read an online essay of what happens in this movie, it will be more fun than watching this for 3H!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

As a positive example for that kind of cultural sensitivity I would call ""Dances with Wolves"" a really good and touching movie, we can see the weaknesses of the invasive western culture compared to a better form of living together, in a authentic community/culture connected with nature.In Avatar 2 all the time basically there is just violence as an answer to everything. It is the basic approach of the old testament, eye for an eye, kill or be killed etc., not really any higher spiritual way or more intelligent solutions.Actually I find it quite abhorrent how Jake Sully treats his own children, virtually using education styles of the 19th century, they have to say ""sir"" to him, act like being in a military unit etc. - Instead of having learned a higher way of a natural, native, spiritual community, his whole family acts like they are modern americans, just living in the woods. It feels totally unrealistic that his Na'vi mate Neytiri and their whole family would become assimiliated by american culture, like we see it. Rather Jake should behave more like spiritually, morally developed native folk, after having lived in the nature, in their clan. Not still acting bascially like a marine with blue skin who is allied with the Na'vi. His slogan that men are (just) for protection is also quite backward and reduces men. E. g. The very important part of showing how to be a ""good"" person, high morale, good values etc., all this loses in favor of simple masculinity. Moreover dialog parts like ""bro"" etc. Sound so unfitting.I find a lot of illogical issues, too. For example the Na'Vi are soul mates of the tulkun (these super intelligent ""whales""), but they accept the murderous activities of ""whale hunters"" as long as it is not in their direct neighbourhood... Na'Vi didn't even try to develop some defense tactics or anything for them, does not sound believable.Enough said... ;-) You can have good fun, with cool action and great effects, but don't expect anything above lower standards regarding story/world/plot/characters.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie turns out to be a three hour long showcase of what a team can do with current technology. But after you get past the visual effects, the story gets stale and you begin to lose interest in the characters. There appeared to be a lot of B-roll that simply was not important in the story telling. The film began to lose the audience attention roughly halfway through and I noticed quite a few people getting up to use the washroom. The character development was limited also to a person's perception of the dialogue, you never really feel emotionally attached. I saw the movie in 3D and would recommend that format, but that is the only recommendation I can make for this film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But Avatar had major flaws. Practically everyone agrees - the visuals were very impressive, the world was detailed and interesting, but the actual plot and characters weren't that likeable. The message (nature good, humans and capitalism bad) is preachy and stupid.Cameron, being the genius that he is, decided to use the same characters in his sequel, with the same dull qualities and the same reliance on amazing graphics (I admit, they look amazing, a good way to show off fancy 8k OLED screens) without a good story, themes or plot to make use of them. I mean, I don't think it's a spoiler to say he brought back the same bad guy from the first movie. The bad guy we all thought was too 1-dimensional. Well, I guess he's 1.5 dimensional now. A fractal, if you're mathematically oriented. Not really an improvement.In fact, it's almost worse as now he's mostly evil... but also a bit inconsistent. Sometimes arbitrarily nice or overly trusting. We need a deeper motivation for him, some kind of vision that he thinks is good - he has to see himself as the hero.Avatar 2's problem is that I just don't care. I want to but can't. Zoe Saldana's character does absolutely nothing but scream, cry, scream, glare, shoot arrows (okay, that's kinda cool), cry, growl and scream. It's lame. I can't remember the main character's name. Or any of the others. I don't get why they do what they do. I don't feel connected to their world or stakes.Look, we have words like barbaric, tribal, backwards and uncivilised for a reason. All humans started like that - primitive and animalistic. But there's a reason we started using words rather than grunting, wearing clothes rather than leaves, using guns instead of spears, etc. We became civilised. That's not just a fashion choice, it's a critical part of progressing.It makes no sense for the Avatar people (Na'vi, whatever it is) to still be like cavemen but super advanced. It doesn't work like that. The same with Wakanda. Advanced technology isn't something you just do 'cause you feel like it. It takes decades, centuries of infrastructure, education, clothes for crying out loud, and other basic civilised things.Anyway, because of that, I find the blue (and teal) people really uninteresting and self-contradicting. They couldn't possibly have weapons that advanced but still be like tribal people who live in nature. They argue and assume things, their strategy is often terrible. I don't like them. A few are okay, ironically the ones who are more ""human"", who think and have motivations.The baddies are still completely superficial. They just blow up, burn and destroy stuff. That makes no sense. We cut down trees to use the wood to make buildings, houses, furniture, books, etc. Is that so bad? No, it's justified. Some animals get displaced, but that's a necessity. What matters more - 50 orangutans or 1,000 humans? But in Avatar 2, what is their motivation for the destruction?Why is there no mutually beneficial exchange going on? This part of history gets ignored. The more advanced civilisation can offer better medicine, transport, communication, clothes (pretty important), etc. The local primitive people will definitely want those things! In exchange, they can offer insights into the land, the animals and plants, etc. They can cede land to the more advanced culture in exchange for a share of the more advanced technology!One thing the baddies do is kill giant whale lobsters for their glowing yellow brain fluid. Oooh, so evil. What does the yellow goo do? Apparently it lengthens human life. Oh my, these baddies are so deeply ev- wait... extend human life? So, like, by how much?They say the goo from a lobster-whale brain is worth $80 million (in 2050 (or whatever year) US dollars I assume). But how powerful is it? Can it lengthen ten people's lives by 5 years each? A hundred people's lives by 10 years each? One person's life by 6 months? Why is this never explained?I'm sorry, but if the brain goo of a lobster on steroids can extend a lot of people's lives by a large amount, then it may well be financially worth it and morally justified to hunt the huge lobsters.Also, they don't use the rest of the carcass. One of the goodies is upset by this. What, would you prefer they cut up the carcass and sold it for other uses? Speaking of which, why don't the baddies use the rest of the carcass? Really? None of the rest of it has any value? Basic economics and the concept of incentives have gone right out the window.The acting is decent, the innovation in motion capture and CGI is good, the music is forgettable but I guess it's at least there, the story and heroes and villains have no depth or logic to their positions, the characters are boring and unlikeable. It's a little too long and convoluted, but it generally held my mild interest.There were some more touching moments near the end, but even they get ruined by histrionic wailing by you-know-who. The plot is so dumb that even a girl observes that ""I'm being tied up again?!"", to paraphrase. If the characters are noticing bad writing, what does that tell you?We get a major battle perhaps inspired by They Live!, but it all feels pointless because of what happens next. I really wanted a sequel (another intense personal fight) as that would have been absolutely hilarious. It's a bad sign when I want the movie to turn into a terrible parody of itself just so it becomes more enjoyable.Avatar 2 wasn't all bad, but it's not really a success either. It's terrible in terms of narrative, character motivations, logic, likeable characters, deeper themes. All it has going for it are the effects, the overall look and some action sequences and dramatic scenes here and there. I can't call it a disappointment since my expectations were already at sea level.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, yet-again, Neytari undergoes psychological trauma by experiencing her planet being ravaged and torched by the invaders at the beginning of the film, all the while grieving for her murdered son.

When the previous film made close to $3 billion in the box-office, pray-tell, why would the writers and producers wish to change the profit-formula for the next film? Albeit, this CGI fantasy storytelling is popular among the masses, it does not contribute to the already oversaturated film selection that already has explored this theme time and time again. This film is literally a new interpretation and presentation of the first film, without the charm and authenticity of a stellar plot. Among the infinite avenues that could have been chosen to explore the world of Pandora, Cameron and company chose to restrict their universe and characters with an algorithm designed to pays the bills and remain predictable. As such, this film was an entire let-down, and I will not be wasting my time with parts 3, 4, 5, 6, and possibly 7.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Like most of american movies, they rooted for an obvious ahole and troublesome guy, who with a cheesy redemption become a main hero, injustifically forgetting all of their previous sins (pretty much forcing a flawed/short-sighted christian ideology to us viewer); or one that obviously imitated from Games Of Thrones: they unchallantly killed the good one for some shock effect; or dumb twist to push over to the next movie which I really don't like; a movie should be fully content by itself, never hold on to the next one like some Mexican soap opera series.Overall if you care enough for the story, this movie is not for you. But if you wanted an amazing visual experience, you have to watch it best on the big screen on IMAX 3D.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Does anyone need this movie? Nope to both. The original movie was such a success because everyone wanted to experience the technology and to be honest the story in the first movie was far from original and no where near as ground breaking as the visuals tbh it was a little boring.No one cares about the Navi individually or as a whole and whilst there might be some under lying moral about the exploitation of indigenous people it's lost here on family Sully. A dad dealing with uppirty teens YAWN.Effect's as good as these are now the norm and can be seen done better when done less. Too much cgi these days is a negative and these movies are too much. This movie lack originality the same villain the same hero's largely the same story with a couple of teaks. The only good thing is that I'll know not to bother sitting through the rest.Underwhelming at best but then that's the legacy of the first one nothing will be that ground breaking again which leaves any sequel floundering in it's wake.If you were the 'sky people' and you were really intent on killing everything that moves you'd just do it from orbit.An unnecessary movie with an unnecessary plot.

Sure the surroundings were pretty cool for 5 minutes, but it gets old pretty fast. And they couldn't even come up with a new, or at least believable, bad guy. I don't even have the energy to list all of the things that don't make sense in this movie.I can't believe that I waited 12 years to watch the sequel, but what's worse is that James Cameron spent 12 years making this movie.

And yet, it wouldn't be worth it. Lengthy underwater scenes, a whale hunting sequence that felt like watching a documentary rather than a sci fi movie, endless fighting scenes that could have been wrapped up quicker, and a plot that is so spread out that it gets boring to follow doesn't make this movie justice.In addition, the CGI were like those of a video game and not at all what one would expect from the sequel of a film that was groundbreaking for that mare reason as well as took 13 to make.Also, the plot is all over the place, with Jake being the patriarch of the family and only popping up to scold his kids after the events had occur, otherwise being nowhere to be seen, abandoning the rest of the tribe to their fate, despite his actions and morals in the first movie, lying and setting everyone in danger and, overall, being selfish and a toxic male lead towards his family.The rest was a National Geografic doc blended with Free Willy and teenage angst with an alien twist.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Frankly the main plot felt more suited to a side story which focused on humans 'calming the natives' to exploit resources, but it actually was more about revenge between the old general from this first Avatar and Jake Sully the rogue soldier. During the film I did start to wonder whether the sky people's (aka humans) military would be happy with pouring this amount of funding into killing one rogue soldier. Honestly I don't think they would, when they can just nuke everyone.The film was as expected filled with over the top sentimentality, but at such a level that I stopped caring about the characters. I also felt the film showed conflicting messages regarding gender. Action scenes showed strong female characters but dialogue re enforces male and female stereotypes of male protector and female carer.The actions scenes were brilliantly constructed but very fast to the point where the 3D visuals couldn't keep up and you ended up just watching a blur which was disappointing.At over 3 hours long narrating a thin plot line I felt the film could easily have been 2 hours without losing anything of value. It was all very indulgent to the creators and at one point I wondered if I was watching an episode of Blue Planet.Honestly, stay at home and watch something else instead. The 3D is nowhere near as good as the first film because its trying too hard. At one point during the film I wondered what it would be like to watch if you suffer from migraines. I fear it would bring one on or at the very least leave you wishing you'd done something else with your time. Cleaning the bins is more preferable, harsh?

And Jake calling Kiri ""Babygirl"" hahahaha. So many more examples of awkward dialogues. Don't get me wrong here, I get why they had the Navi speak English, but it still felt strange.The first movie explored the complex nature of the relationship between the Navi and humans. It was about desperate attempts at diplomacy gone south, and the clashing of cultures far detached. It had complex character development, entire inversions of characters interests and motives. It posed many questions and ethical dilemmas.The Way of Water posed no questions, it felt like a trimmed down version of the same story. The new setting had no meaningful impact on the story besides serving as a pretty backdrop.I'm happy I saw this movie because I enjoyed the spectacle of it. But objectively it's a massive letdown.

Give the cloned anatagonist a child with unknown mother (Ray) too: Spider.Cameron even pays homage to Dune (which Star Wars riped-off) in a subplot (camouflaged by inverted humidity): the mining of a life elixir, produced by huge non-walking animals, on a wild colony planet.I love Avatar 1, but this movie...","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But script is nothing and using bow like Predator movies Prey's protagonist they have 100% accurate and full of penetration. And why avatar risk theyr life to took human weapons such as automatic rifles after still keep using bows and arrows, spears primitive weapons. What happens with Sea Avatars group in the end? Where were they? Wakanda Forever is much much better than this. What they have purpose to fight each other? Just for his family? Or just for revenges? Or to take miracle medicines? Suddenly Asian humans hunts down whales in the middle of battle with for immortality medicine ? All scripts are going wrong its like made by randomized. And One of human called as monkeyboy or spiderboy(why call this? Another racism for Asian? Poor acting and naming)and i don't get it why he is so many times switching sides friendly or foe and boss villan is also blue so disappointed. And why so looong sequences? Tooo maany National Geographic like scenes or just meaning less and have no relation of main story scenes. Even action scenes are nothing new features its sooo normal. And zero gore scene(just a little couple seconds take by far far away. Is not counted)I watched mx4d 3d. I watched can't stay of complete end roll . I regret selected this already. I don't recommend it. Watch on normal screen or just wait for release on web streaming is enough. If you want to play with ocean life go to play HTC Vive Steam VR game called ""TheBlu"" you also can touch with them play with them and of course it is 3D. Its almost 6 yeas ago already released so Nothing new specific features. Can't believe other great reviews and took about 10 years to finish this. And this time why doesnt have Michelle Rodriguez? I thought she love whales and dolphins?Except Shigourny. Weaver or Sam. W other characters hard to reconnized who is who. And play by S weaver character Kiri is a teenage kid with ages female voice its just little a bit odd? Yes of course she is not teenage. All of Faces made by cgi but forgot fix voice tones?I felt asleep even in mx4d.I hope no more Avaters. I can't believe they have plans to sequels. Nexttime no more Humanoid's characters. Just make one of only those Extraterrestrial marine ocean life's movie like an aquarium. I love those beautiful animals and nature. Human and Avater please keep do nonsenses civil wars and both sides are not survive. After Ocean lifes would be happy ever after and make one of sequel of them.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even some of the iconic sequences and shots of the original are directly copied in this sequel.But the worst part of this story is that it's clear that any and all struggles the characters go through are going to essentially amount to nothing as Disney wants to keep the core characters alive to create many more sequels to come. This also means that many plot points get drawn out needlessly in order to create more repetitive content for the future.This is why the movie only gets half points for me. It does a spectacular job with revolutionizing visual effects for future films, but the story leaves much to be desired.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I understand director wanted to present new part of the Pandora planet, but it could go with the interesting story and not like this.I think, considering the fact it should be sci-fi / action movie 5/10 is okeyish.

To be honest I forgot about this movie until I was forced to watch it.If you read my Avatar 1 review. I'm a prolific reviewer. I stated that they took so long with Avatar 2 because the producers didn't expect people to like Avatar 1 because it was boring. Really boring.I wish i got to watch that other hash movie Wakanada Forever instead. Oh well...About: Blue people once again fighting humans aka invaders aka colonizers aka cliche plot.Story and production: The story once again fails to amuse me. It's about the same as Avatar 1. Really boring and too long fillers of nothing.The graphics were good but if the effects and graphics are good but the story is boring then the worthless.This movie was more about showing off the effects than having a worthy well rounded film.Genre: Adventure, WarSound track: Decent mix.Highlight: My favourite colour is blueDo any worthless Mutt appear? No. I can't recall. The boredom must have erased my memory of an ugly dog.Is this movie worthy? No. Now I heard that there will be a lot more of this hash.Should you watch this?: Please don't. It's too boring. It's the same as the 1st but worse because this is the 2nd time that We have to suffer through this hash. 2 is worse than one.","11 out of 32 found this helpful.

Dragons look funny, Tulkun looks hideous, Action is underwhelming, Dialogues are thoughtlessly written and whole movie is desperately Under-cooked.All in all, you deserve a pat on the back, if you do end up surviving the whole movie.

The film is all style and no substance. Yes, the visuals are amazing but all of that doesn't matter when you don't care about the characters. Character development is none existent and it's impossible for the first 2 hours to know who is who. The story and script are lazy and there's some real clangers of one liners.The film is way too long and the 3D format is dead. At one point near the end, it almost felt like I was watching Titanic. Sigourney Weaver's character is silly and I didn't even know Kate Winslet was in it until the final credits.Overall, the visuals are great but we've seen it all before.Snoozefest.

Don't care about this movie or get the hype, nor did I care for the first one. It was way too long in my opinion, and has too much unnecessary fluff to it's story.This film was very slow to get off the ground, almost 2 hours before you get any kind of action/good writing. And I didn't really see anything spectacular here that wasn't seen 12 years ago, though my husband doesn't agree.I just don't understand what everyone sees in these films, they only remind me of the matrix. It's almost like they took the premise from there and added an alien type species.Unless you want to go to sleep I would not recommend wasting 3 hours of your life or the $45 on this, especially since the 3d effects will make you sick on top of that.

It's basically the same as the first Avatar movie, only that the action is happening on water (or underwater).Furthermore the first movie had that novelty factor explaining about what avatars are, abou tthe na'vi and you also had that wow factor due to the visuals of the alien world.Now, there is nothing new, now we already know what ""avatars"" and na'vi are, it basically becomes an action movie with blue people (larger smurfs)
There's really not much more to say, nice visuals, nice effects and aquatic creatures however there is no true plot (humans want resources) and nothing really different than the first movie...
I'm curious if the next movie will be the same just maybe with a na'vi tribe living underground or something...","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

But James Cameron did not get the memo apparently. The stereoscopic effect here is purely used to overstimulate your senses so that you ignore how poor the actual 3D animation is. When you watch it without the 3D, everything feels fake an less polished then the predecessor. The way objects interact with the environment, There is no smoke, dust or loose sediment in the oceans. Everything is sterilized to keep the 3D scenes crystal clear. Trains, boats and ships all exhibit rudimentary crash physics of tumbling and rolling without realistic crash damage. The explosions feel like they are used to cover up the animation crime scene.Every moment you are reminded that it is nothing but a cartoon. 3 hours of James Cameron doing a homage to himself . Recycling the same cliche action from his previous thrillers The Abyss,s and Titanic . If I wanted to see a reefs and whales, I would rather watch Discovery channel then imaginary animation for three hours.The story is as thin as it gets, teen drama of imaginary blue aliens having human problems, not even interesting problems.This is more suitable as a 15 minute Disneyland ride than a 3 hour movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, it falls short of expectations and fails to live up to the success of its predecessor. Here's why:Firstly, the storyline lacks depth and originality. It follows the typical hero's journey with predictable plot twists and an unremarkable climax. The themes of environmentalism and indigenous rights, which were prominent in the first movie, feel recycled and lack the same impact. There is nothing particularly new or thought-provoking in this film, which makes it feel like a mere cash grab rather than a genuine attempt at creating something unique.Secondly, the acting is subpar, particularly from the supporting cast. While returning cast members such as Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana deliver passable performances, the newcomers fail to leave a lasting impression. The villain, played by Cliff Curtis, is particularly underwhelming, with a one-dimensional personality and no real motive beyond greed and power. Even the iconic Sigourney Weaver, who makes a surprise return, feels wasted in a role that doesn't do her talent justice.Thirdly, the visual effects, which were groundbreaking in the first movie, are now nothing new. While they are still impressive and visually stunning, they no longer have the same ""wow"" factor that the audience experienced in 2009. Furthermore, the overreliance on CGI detracts from the immersion in the story and characters, making it difficult to connect with them on an emotional level.Fourthly, the pacing of the movie is uneven. It takes too long to set up the plot, with a slow and meandering first act that fails to capture the audience's attention. The action scenes, which are meant to be the movie's highlight, are over too quickly and lack the same intensity as the first movie's battle sequences. The final act feels rushed, with a resolution that is both predictable and unsatisfying.Finally, the movie lacks the heart and soul of the original. While Avatar had a sense of wonder and awe that made it a cultural phenomenon, Avatar: The Way of Water feels like a cynical attempt to recapture that magic without putting in the same effort. The characters lack the same depth and relatability, the world feels less fleshed out, and the message less powerful.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the hype. It lacks originality, strong acting, and emotional depth, and relies too heavily on visual effects to carry the story. While it may satisfy die-hard fans of the first movie, it is unlikely to win over new audiences or leave a lasting impression. Overall, I would give this movie a 2 out of 10, and suggest that viewers stick to the original Avatar for their fix of this universe.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And I'm not saying Avatar 2 is a terrible movie. However, for me it was a mediocre experience.To sum it all up: A terribly boring villain who has nothing better to do, a story that overall kinda feels like it has been recycled a few times to often. Nothing made me interested in part three. Even the great water visuals didn't change that for me.And yes, I enjoyed the first 'Avatar'. I wouldn't say it had a mindblowing story, but it worked well. And the new 3D at that time was amazing and probably still holds up very well.The sequel on the other hand seemed to me as if Cameron was only interested in depicting live under water. Everything around that kind of felt like he was mixing together various story and character ideas from his previous movies...Also, I'm not a fan of mixing 24fps and 48fps in a movie and a lot of the computer animations feel a lot like video games these days who visually improved a lot during the past 12 years. Don't get me wrong, the under water segments of the movie are visually amazing (aside from the 48fps, which is a matter of taste of course). That alone just wasn't enough for me to enjoy a movie that long. I would have preferred a shorter, more compact movie in that caseSo yeah, it's difficult for me to recommend this movie. For a younger audience it might work better. Or if you are able to fully enjoy the experience and don't get hung up on the storytelling. But still, I think it's one of Cameron's weakest movies on a narrative level.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This was like a made for TV movie, which had nothing new to push the envelope after 13 years, story wise, nor visually. Not much plot, yet still some bland loose ends for potential sequels. I can't imagine the budget for this movie, but hopefully the technology was cheaper, otherwise it was a complete waste of the studio's money. The acting of the principal characters was weak as well, compared to the original. Even the score had a few familiar themes, but it was no James Horner epic. I can't imagine the franchise doing much going forward, in spite of the hype.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Likewise, despite all of Avatar : The Way of the Water's glitz and glamour and box office success it too in my opinion is not very good.I went in with limited expectations as I found the first one to be fine but not exceptional. I found that one to be a story hijacked from other works but never did I think Cameron would hijack his own story and resell it to us. This second movie just takes all the major themes and applies it to the water people. For example , in the first one the banshees were the creature of fascination and in this one the tulkun whales just simply filled that void. Not to mention incredible amounts of time dedicated to simply just floating around with them. If I wanted to see this I'd have simply watched a real documentary like the Blue Planet.Furthermore for a 3 hour plus movie some critical elements were rushed through at the beginning. The introduction of the family really wasn't adequate given how many new members there were. Unfortunately because of this I had difficulty even telling apart the two brothers throughout the movie.Beyond this I even found the acting to be clunky and the script weak. It also has a rather dull ending. Is this villain really strong enough to make several movies on? I personally don't think so.For the people who enjoyed this movie I'd ask this: In 3 weeks after viewing the movie will you remember the name of the outcast tulkun or even the name tulkun itself, I suspect a majority would not. Further how many people would actually be able to take me through the story scene by scene in a months time? I reckon hardly any and it wouldn't be their fault , it's just not a powerful enough story. Of course many movies fall into this category , but with this one getting labeled by many as a classic then certain standards must be met in my opinion and this doesn't come close to meeting them for me.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It lacks everything that made the first one so good that it has held up for 13 years. Sure the effects are just as good as the first one, but the movie itself has absolutely not been worth the wait.

For the overall message, Avatar keeps reiterating the same old stereotypes: nature is good, the white man is bad. Blues, greens, and virtually all other colors and species of all sizes are innocent and friendly. What makes white people so ugly? Greed, lack of empathy. So you can follow the rest of the consequences along a flat script with flat characters and some minor parentage issues (x is a child of y, and that creates a conflict. Have you heard of that before?).The movie is long because CGI costs seem to have come down, so things you could explain most vigorously in 5 minutes run for an hour, iterating over and over again ad nauseam fast camera movements and details that mar any sense of realism and participation.Warning: If you plan to watch this movie in a 4DX theater, be prepared to sail in a small boat in a heavy storm for three hours. Watching Avatar 2 in a 4DX theater is the worst experience I've ever had in a movie theater. All the problems seen in Top Gun 2 are made worse and multiplied by the continuous and violent movement of the seats, which makes it impossible to maintain an upright position. About halfway through the movie, you'll probably start wishing all the characters (white, blue, and green people alike) were dead and the end credits start rolling. Virtually every person ended up feeling dizzy on their way out. A real torture.And no. Despite all the CGI improvements, you can still feel yourself watching colorful silly Tom & Jerry cartoons.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Currently, it is clear that the majority of reviews on IMDB and elsewhere are based on 3D theatrical viewings. However, when viewed in 2D, the film does not impress as much. 3D films tend not to age well, and this one likely will not either. The use of rendered objects thrown at the viewer for the purpose of creating a thrill in a 3D theater loses its effectiveness when viewed at home in 2D. It essentially becomes an expensive screensaver. It is unclear why this film had to cost $400 million. Was it necessary for the Na'vi to be CGI creations? They are similar enough to humans that they could have been achieved through makeup and possibly some CGI enhancements to their eyes. As a result, the film feels like an expensive cartoon, with only one major human character and all other characters being digital aliens. The renderings are polished, but they do not appear photorealistic, particularly when the characters speak. The movement of their mouths reveals their animated nature. It is one thing to have a CGI character in a film, but when every character and environment is animated, the film resembles more of a cartoon like ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" than a live-action Marvel film.The story, such as it is, could have been told in 45 minutes. The majority of the runtime consists of filler meant to evoke a sense of awe at the beauty of nature. The film does not delve into the darker aspects of nature. It is assumed that life on Pandora evolved through the process of eliminating the weak from the gene pool. Yet there is little depiction of predation on Pandora. The Na'vi and animals live in harmonious coexistence, except for the fact that it is acceptable to kill fish for food but not whales. Characters from the previous film, such as Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), have minimal roles and serve only as one-dimensional cameos. Jake Sully is no longer the main character, replaced by his children. In fact, he has so many children that it is difficult to keep track of them. All of the Na'vi look similar to one another, with the sea people Na'vi being a lighter shade of blue. It is not clear why Jake would choose to have so many children, considering he is living on a world under attack by invaders and would therefore be bringing them into a dangerous situation. It is also unclear why everyone is naked and why Jake, being from Earth, would not have a greater interest in clothing to protect his skin from the sun and the plants and animals on Pandora. The character Monkey Boy (Spider) also raises questions as he walks around without clothes or shoes. The story does not make much sense, as Jake was previously tasked with defending the forest, but he now easily abandons it.As numerous reviews have stated, the film is excessively long. It could easily be edited down to 90 minutes, as much of it is CGI filler. There is no reason to spend such a large sum of money on a film that ultimately feels like a waste. The amount of electricity used in rendering alone is staggering. If you do decide to see the film, it is recommended to view it in 3D. That is what it was meant to be, a demo reel for 3D TVs. 2/5.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Apparently yea.The boring story, long run time, terrible dialogue is carried by how visually stunning the movie is. I despise some culture, but it almost feels misogynistic for how poorly they wrote Zoe back into the story. She's pretty much useless and is an unhinged emotional wreck the entire movie.Shame that this is what James came up with after 10+ years.

I seriously don't understand why they needed to do all these just to get to Jack Sully. I mean, just do what you did in Avatar 1, attack the forest people and Jack will be forced to come back. But to forcefully introduce us to a whole new world, and then spend hours just exploring that world without any connection to anything, together with all the kids drama, it was just too long, unfair and not unnecessary.This was a real bore.

The creative team had over a decade to deliver us a worthy sequel, and all they managed to do is deliver the same film we got in 2009. They recycled basically everything, including the plot and the main villain. If you are going to reuse the same villain, then they had better be an interesting villain, like Vader, instead we get one of the most unoriginal stereotypical villain trope characters... AGAIN.The sequel delivers trope after trope, even with the few new creative additions that the sequel adds, like the children, felt like recycled scenes we've seen in dozens of films before it. James Cameron has a pretty amazing body of work under his belt, but it felt like he put as little creativity into Avatar 2 as possible.That's not to say there were no positive things to the sequel. Like the original, the sequel is visually beautiful. And while the plot was basically recyled from the original, there were still touching moments, and the performances of the top-notch cast were well done, but unfortunately that was not enough for me and my friends to not notice how unoriginal it was. Normally, if a movie is good, I have no problem sitting through a 3+ hour film, but this movie definitely had me feeling all 3 hours and 15 minutes. Even the final battle scene of the final act played out EXACTLY how I imagined it would.Finally, (exactly) like the first film, there were many important messages about how we treat the environment, animal cruelty, racism, colonization, over-consumption/greed. But, to beat a dead horse, these same messages can also be found in many other films out there that the original Avatar was clearly inspired by in the first place. My advice: watch it at home, especially if you saw the original in theaters. It's basically the same movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

He expects you to be so invested in the beauty of the 3D fantasy world of Pandora, that you're supposed to forget about the elements that really matter; story, compelling characters, good dialogue and entertainment value. The 2021 sci-fi epic Dune had the exact same problem, but it felt like that movie cared more about the audience than the long-awaited sequel to Avatar does.Film and TV reviews are always meant to give credit to where it's due in the movie or series, so we'll start by stating the obvious/the thing you've heard a trillion times by the time of seeing this review, but the budget of over $300 million dollars is put to some good technical use by delivering an immersive 3D experience that viewers hungry for stunning visuals will enjoy Avatar: The Way of Water for. 13 years have passed and technology has obviously improved a lot since 2009, so the cinematography, special effects and picture quality are more advanced, and watch this film in 3D is an absolute hallucination. The fantastical creatures, underwater sequences, humanoid aliens, colours and action deliver the same effect as the first film, making you ask what's CGI, what's shot in real life and how this is all possible.However, this movie thinks it can crawl away from criticism if it's able to impress us with the visual effects, even if it's lacking of elements that are much more simple, though much more important. The story consists around daily events as Jake Sully has now had a family with Neytiri, and a lot of the film focuses on their parenting or the kids getting themselves into trouble. There is no connection at all to the problems the characters must face, the characters themselves, or the uninteresting fantasy world we're supposed to care about. Therefore, this film is extremely boring, unoriginal, predictable and messy. Unless special effects are enough to impress you, Avatar or movies like it don't deserve your money, time or support, and you should shouldn't be afraid to skip it in a heartbeat.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's filled with way too much pure eye candy shots and tired tropes about family and bullies and being outcasts/freaks.I couldn't help but roll my eyes at these tropes. Its a trap too many film makers fall into: We are in a extra ordinary setting on a different planet and we fall back into covering social drama and not even smart social drama, but very generic one.Another small aspect was that much of felt like a cutscene from a video game. Camera movement was just too smooth, it felt very unnatural from following characters in third person to really hard zooms that started and stopped abruptly.At this point should i watch this movie again i know i will skip quite a bit of it.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Then let's just think about how they (J Cam and team) spent nearly 2 decades trying to come up with a world that still holds the patriarchy (The main family are the Sullys) still features hierarchical tribal systems that are able to connect with the land and be one with it yet always seem to lean towards combat, violence and the glorification of war and warriors.The father son relationship is actually toxic as Jake keeps mumbling how its the father's role to protect (sure buddy, thats all a father is, a bullet shield), his kids keep yelling ""Bro!"" like they're the Island Boys, white boys acting black.BTW, A majority of the actors playing these roles are white.

It was so immersing. This one was far from that, I would never want to see it again.Sometimes the CGI was so disappointing, I see better quality in games I play on my PC with a 5 years old graphic card. (GTX1080).On the other hand, sometimes the exaggerated sharpness stole the cinema feeling. It didn't help you in immersing into the buzz of the story, it was alienating you instead. Sometimes the camera-handling, (too many yanking of the camera that supposed to give the feeling of being present on site - but failed doing that) and sharpness of the picture gave the feeling of a cheap TV program with the lowest possible budget. Movie makers should refuse to use this technology, it is a bad direction to go. (It was the worst in the latter parts of the movie.)
The movie also had some parts where it was just foolishly unreal in physics: like when the boats were bouncing on waves, and the actors in them were almost steady.The creatures in the movie sometimes seemed ""too much"". It was like when someone with a bad taste uses the full spectrum of opportunities in MS PowerPoint in a single presentation. For example, why those big sea creatures should have a bigger and a smaller eye? Only because it seemed a good idea to the visual designer. If there is something that has such a role in the visual universe of the movie, that should be explained, should have a reason to be there, I think.I wasn't sure about the actor who played Spider. Sometimes it seemed very bad acting, sometimes quite good.And finally: by the end of the movie it was obvious, the ""way of water"" means much more that it meant in the story: movies this long need a bathroom break, because it was painful to be there this long without it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Everything from the last and the most negligible details looks real. It is soo good that from all the 4 stars I gave for this movie, all 4 of them is the CGI and the way that it looks. The story is 90% copy paste and I know we have to pay attention to the envirement nowadays but in a movie this much recycled element is a joke. The dialouge is bad. And I mean atrociously bad. The characters are week as hell. Either you are good like Jesus Christ himsefl or you are as evil Darth Sidious. And we got the same exact villain with on of the weekeset motiation I've ever seen. The kids are cringy as hell as always in a hollywood blockbuster, but this movie has a lot of them in it and they are kind of the main characters so expect a lot of suffering when seeing them on screen. And the duality comes from here because you are blown away in the opposite direections at the same time. You hear them interacting and acting but you are looking at such a great CGI that you won't know what to think.If you watch this at home in a year, you are going to laugh how bad it is, but If you want to see what our technology can do nowadays with visuals I think it's over the moon in that regard.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I didn't expect more issues that would turn me off either, but that's what I got. There's no way there's going to be 5 of these things, even if China is complicit in inflating Cameron's numbers with whatever backroom deal they made.

I only confirmed after realising that okay i wore glasses so it is a 3d show. Total money waste. Story also not extraordinary, an ordinary story thats all. I could spot many scenes from avatar 1 which are directly copied to avatar 2. Story also same no change. Since both the movies are James cameron's he escaped from copy rights infringement. I was waiting for avatar 1 sequel eagerly for almost 2 years and very much disappointed.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

There is a decent story there. But, when you get down to it, it is little more than a war movie with interminable firefights. Also, some of the typical cinematic techniques, like switching quickly from ""scene to scene"", don't work well with 3D. The backgrounds on 3D are very blurry (to create the depth of field) but by the time your eye finds the main focus point, the film has moved on - leaving the feeling of ""what was that?"". The movie obviously attempt to appeal to virtually everyone - those looking for something ""morally uplifting"" and those wanting a good action flick. I'm guessing it went on so long partly because of that and partly because they spent so much money on the special effects that they could not bear not to use them. They made a movie with much potential quite boring. I think I'll skip the obviously forthcoming sequel.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The only decent aspect in this movie was it's soothing emotional music. If it wasn't for the sprawling VFX, this film probably would've got 20% on Rotten Tomatoes. The dialogues were poorly written and childish, lots of cringy bro talks even in dire situations. Also there was lots of plot holes and side stories that left without an answer. They turned Jake Sully into a useless and weak character and he didn't do anything significant in this one considering he's the main character.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Good idea! Sombody is bound to love it, and it's likely going to be James himself!I love how they'll spend 600 mil + on a couple of movies that are just Pocahontas in space, this latest with twist of Moby Dick, literally going to great lengths to demonstrate imitations of natives of a multitude of under-represented actual Earth cultures from around the world rather than making actual movies about these cultures and their own actually intriguing and desperate battles with the rest of humanity and the fight for their land, our own actual beautiful world. But hey, who cares about Earth and its tribes? We can CGI something better!... This is really the way to raise awareness about our own planet if this is the message he's trying to convey, just keep ignoring what's here and distract audiences with what's not. Waste millions producing fluff rather than elevating your neighbours in any way. But hey, if this is James living out his fantasy then I'm perfectly happy for them, god knows we all need our distractions in this place and wish for a way to get away from everyone in it.The movie is LITERALLY 3 hours of ""Pocahontas saves the whales while her braindead husband gets their kids captured over and over again for 3 hours"". With the addition of a Hawaiian surfer reject in a gas mask imitating a monkey. I think it may have been the same turd who wrote the script.GET REKT WITH THIS GARBAGE. You're all GERBILS people.

I did not really love or hate the first Avatar movie, but it did mean I went in to this one sort of cynically. The first movie was forgettable, expensive and bland, so why did it deserve a sequel?And, well, nothing here convinced me it did. At several points all throughout this movie I found myself wondering why I should care about any of this. ""The Way of Water"" never had answers for me.I have absolutely no connection to any member of Jake Sully's people and their incredibly boilerplate family dynamic feels made more for a Thursday Night Sitcom than a three-hour movie. You have the two head-strong boys trying to impress their military father, the shy quirky girl, and the baby. Everything we've already seen before.Which I suppose is the heart of some of this problem: despite being ""aliens,"" everything in Avatar always feels too human and too normal. They spent a quarter of a billion dollars on some (admittedly, very nice) CGI for concepts that aren't that far off from what we already have on earth. We have fish, we have whales, we have birds, we have jungles, and we have indigenous people.So it all comes off as feeling very self-important and highlights the idea that the message conveyed in this movie is extremely manufactured. An excuse to spend a lot of money that didn't need to be spent.It's $250 mil just to say ""Humans are destructive and we should care more about our environment"" as if that isn't obvious already. Or, in other words, the longest, most expensive ""crying native american"" PSA ever created.Maybe there will be a day when the temperature around this message is different, but as of this writing, it feels like the last thing we need is all this money spent on ""saying something"" and not actually doing anything.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The nature shots are beautiful and it's clever how they've introduced different types of Avatar people into the planet which we weren't aware of before. Did the war not affect them at all you wonder...It's a simple revenge movie yes, but we all knew that the human army would return. Altho not with Carmela Soprano as their general! Anyway...Where this film fails for me is how long it is but also how it dwells on some scenes for far too long. It's almost like it's so smug with how it looks it forgets to continue with the story. At one point I almost forgot there was a plot happening, because they dwelt for so long on a sub story with a giant whale. The new characters aren't solid either and take valuable screen time away from the main 'heroes' and villain, who are more interesting as protagonists. The children are just so....annoying. The way they talk and interact will date terribly. One of them (Kiri) is totally obsolete but is thrust on us far too much without any real need. The human friend (Spider) also seems contrived and redundant.All in all this film could've been 45 mins shorter and would've been just as good if not better. Makes you wonder what they'll do next.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I also know that a lot of work went into this technology as well but it didn't seem to translate as well to the big screen to me.The story was also not as gripping to me, but I could follow the story quite well. Avatar: The way of the water felt very average but I have no regrets in watching it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Those goose bumps, that excitement of what is next, what will be next. In this movie, another whole Pandora was shown, not in the first edition, which i think they should have, but continue with a whole different story. This is where the story became dull, too predictable and the movie lost it's flavour.In the first edition, one can relate the avatars with real actors, but in this one, they were shown too different, too similar to each other, that distinctiveness is missed.Bringing back the same enemy from part one, Quaritch, another dull idea, not worked for me at least.It is very long, this movie being super long, that eventually by the time it ends, you will be thankful.Then again, watch it for it's superior past, such movies will always remain a work of art.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The magic that first movie brought just disappeared.Also, at the beginning it was hard to follow the plot since I barely remember what was happening in the first movie. Too bad they waited around 15 years to create and release the sequel.I'm really disappointed that they haven't invested more into making an awesome and interesting story.

Funny though half way through out the movie she said ""what is this crap, I want to go home"" and I answered with ""I told you so""All the hype and all those high ratings by people and critics shows the difference between someone who really knows about cinema and who have been watching movies their whole life like me here, and others who easily affected by visuals and main stream. Which is also applies to video games these days.I won't go into details really because I would have to write for hours about so many things that were faulty and incredibly bad.So many actors were bad and what even worst so many characters was unbelievably pure crap and did not make any sense at all. The story is by far one of the most boring and common stories you can get from a children's Disney movie. The dialogue, lines and script is so bad I was really tortured.If you actually compare the visuals with the first one then they're on par which makes the visuals actually outdated. If you look closely every little CGI was noticeable and average at best by today's standards for being a movie.If you someone who watched thousand of movies and also play a lot of high end games. You would se that Avatar CGI nothing special now days nothing special at all.When the movie ended no one clapped and no one was happy.

Never mind that Jake was a traitor for going over to the other side and fighting against his own people, killing his own people. Never mind that the sophisticated weapons the Navi were using could never have been invented and made by the peaceful but underdeveloped Navi society, but were clearly stolen. Yes, I get that Quaritch was overly vengeful but this movie was so terribly one sided and they made him that way to encourage sympathy with the Navi. England took the land from the Native American Indians. Since America was formed, we haven't taken anyone's land, indeed we have fought and bled to help them keep theirs. Why all the America bashing?

I remember watching it at the cinema upon its release and loving it. I got the DVD and watched it many times too. When the internet sort of turned on Avatar and it became trendy to crap all over it, I was still in the camp that supported it and was always looking forward to the sequel.When the official trailer dropped after 100s of fake fan made trailers, naturally I was excited. I went to my local cinema on the first day it was available and was ready for another epic movie. However I left feeling as though I had seen one of the worst sequels ever made.Its clear that James Cameron was so focused on the cinematography and special effects that he neglected the writing. The plot of this movie was probably thought up in half a day or less. The action of this film is just generic and boring to watch. In many of the fight scenes at the end of the movie, its not even clear who is fighting who since all the avatars look exactly the same.I will admit the first hour was enjoyably and I did actually like it. But it feels like Jake does a complete 180 after this and just abandons his tribe and runs away to the ocean leaving his people to just fend for themselves against the humans I guess.I thought that the Colonel was a good villain in the first movie but I didn't need to see him again here and for the next movies. It also makes any death in avatar now feel pointless since they can just bring them back in a new avatar body. What made him a good villain in the first place was that despite being in a deadly world, he was still a threat without the need of an avatar body. Also what about the unobtainium? It never gets mentioned once in this movie despite that being the main reason for the humans being on Pandora in the first place. I get that they are trying to colonize the planet now, but nobody is interested in unobtainium now?Avatar 2 is just a long boring movie that has no plot and distracts you with the special effects. The characters are just bland and forgettable and I have no desire to see where they go in the next sequels.1 star out of 10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

That wasn't the problem. Terminator 2: Judgment Day was literally, a big budget remake of the first one. And nobody complained. Its because James Cameron went back into the elements that made the first one a classic and improved them. Same story, only bigger and better.But this time, in this ""Avatar: Way of Water"" project, he veered off into self indulgent boredom. The brilliantly simple and inspired elements of the first story are all but scattered to the wind and the sea here. He touched on a few interesting, familiar paths but abandoned them over and over, until we were left with a vacuous, disappointing ending that did NOTHING but lay there like one of those beached weird-eyed whales in the Pandoran Sea.I hope Avatar 3 gets back to business, and lets a FEMALE CENTERED story grow and develop into something that is worth sitting through for three hours. We're no longer impressed with the visuals of Pandora alone. The kickass, female centered STORY that made the first one so good to the very last frame...rehash it right.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

If you are not a fan of the comic-book-mythology genre (STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS, SUPERMAN, etc), this is probably not for you. But if you avidly enjoy films like that, this may be just what you're looking for, because not only does it have all the stock characteristics of such films, it additionally has some thrilling and awe-inspiring 3D special effects. I personally am not a big fan of fantasy films, but I can appreciate the technical wizardry. I don't really care whether the evil whoosies attack the good whatsies and end up ruling the universe, because I'm sure the evil ones will get their comeuppance in the next sequel. Technical elements are spectacular, but I need a story that really interests me and characters that I care about, rather than those that are just generic ""types."" The actors are all buried under tons of makeup, so I cannot vouch for any of the performances, because the actors are severely handicapped by so many facial prostheses. I also feel I should add a word of warning for religious people who are easily offended. In one scene a character says something along the lines of ""Christ, can't you do anything right?!"" (That's not an exact quote, but it's the gist of it.) I ask, what does Christ have to do with a fantasy set in an alternative universe? How do the characters on Pandora know about Christ? A missionary from another dimension? And why did the filmmakers include such a line that they must know is bound to offend many in the family audience. They go out of their way not to offend so many groups, but devout people apparently aren't worthy of such consideration. I personally don't care, apart from the desire to keep things logical within its own framework. And I found it jarring. But if you like this kind of movie, I'd say go see it in IMAX and get the full theme-park-ride experience.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This use of the word ""bro"" is so annoying and unnecessary and I don't understand that at all. Overall language in the script feels poor and english is not my mother tongue.The plot just makes the characters look a little bit stupid, I'm sorry.They are nice and interesting, but their actions are making them look stupid and use of ""bro"" doesn't help either.At the last third of the movie I had a feeling, that the same plot is repeating with change of different scenery, but at least the scenery is so impressive, that you can overcome repeating plot theme without falling asleep.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

1. The underwater concepts were fun and magical. I loved the whale-like creatures. I wish they would have slowed things down even more.2. The concept of a blended family.What is not enjoyable:
1. Basically the storyline and the character development is really weak. Nothing surprising or that beautiful to pull at the heart. Pretty images can only do so much for a film.2. The amount of violence. I thought this would be more about living in harmony with a new people and land but they're still fighting the humans.3. Number of times I heard bro and curse words and the American accents of the family members. Really takes away the fantasy aspect and cheapens the script.4. They used Papyrus font. Are you kidding me? Must not have seen the SNL skit with Ryan Gosling.I would not consider this for family movie night even though the story centers itself around family.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After two hours of film finally comes a spectacular, engaging and, at times, thrilling finale.Technically perfect film, I dare not imagine the difficulties in shooting it, with excellent performances by the actors (see Kate Winslet's almost 7 minutes in apnea).I liked the inclusion in the soundtrack of a song from memory by James Horner (RIP).Probably the best CGI movie I have ever seen, but it is not enough to be a great movie.I honestly do not understand the time it took, it was announced as far back as 2009, to write it through no less than 4 scripts.Where is the story?Happy viewing to all

There was no doubt it looked impressive, but I found it an overly long version of a story that I just didn't care for - so it's safe to say I'm not exactly looking forward to this.Dear God, there's 3:12 of the thing. ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO MINUTES! Who needs that?!? If I had just one guess, I suspect I'd go for ""not me"".Well, I did it! ALL the way through and boy was it a struggled. There's no doubt that a lot of the components of the film are impressive and I promise I'll try to remember to mention some of them. But......there's a very fine line between ""epic"" and ""dull"" and this film sees that line, speeds over it and leaves it for dust in the rear view mirror. It also desperately wants me to care about the characters - and I just don't. I don't know if it's because they're animated or because they are aliens or because they're not particularly well written - but I really don't care if all of them and their beautiful planet gets entirely destroyed. In fact, I'd destroy it myself if it meant the film finished in half the time.Actually, I'm not being entirely fair there - if it was half the time, then I might have cared an awful lot more about it all. There is a decent enough (but not great or particularly original) story hiding in there and there were some moments in the last hour where I did feel slightly engaged - but even they were spoiled because......there are too many setpieces which are only there to provide a visual spectacle but they add nothing to the plot - they would be impressive (although still too long) if part of a David Attenborough documentary, but all you've got here is the imagination and ability of the animators. There is, however, no doubt that they are very able animators (IMDB lists 63 of them!) - there's some very impressive visuals on display in pretty much every frame of the film. I found the ""animated"" humans particularly intriguing - they manage to somehow look real and fake at the same time.My other major talking point is that for a film with such a stellar cast, a lot of the voice acting isn't great - it's all very over the top. The baddies in particular are all very pantomime villain and some of the other characters have very poorly written motivations, so I guess the cast were just working with what they'd been given but, once again, it didn't help me care about things.Wikipedia tells me this film has grossed over $2 billion worldwide, which is an absolutely mad amount of money. And, joy of joys, that means we're going to get Avatar 3, 4 and 5!! Wikipedia also explains why it didn't appear in The Guardian's list with their critic having described it as having a ""scathingly bland plot"" - I agree with the sentiment, although I remain unsure about the use of the word ""scathingly"" there!You know what (and this might surprise you) I really didn't like this film (although I did enjoy picking that quote as the post title) and I am completely mystified by its popularity. If you want to watch it you can find it in all the usual places, but I struggle to imagine why anyone would want to do that to themselves.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The problem is where it is visually stunning. The movie lacks any true story it lacks any real depth and quite frankly it's just boring as hell may be able to felt differently if the movie had come out within a reasonable amount of time. Instead, Hollywood didn't want to do a sequel until frankly, they just realize they had no more ideas in the last few years they just decided to make sequel after sequel, screwing up sequels in general.Poor writing.

While the visuals are notably spectacular, and the realism of the animated characters are very lifelike, the story lacks the essential elements to make this movie as much of a hit as the first one. The storyline seems contrite and difficult to follow. If you do not manage to grasp the concept of what Cameron is trying to convey in the first 20 minutes then you will be lost for the rest of the movie. There is no doubt this movie smashed the box, office records, but this may have been from the initial fanfare and newlywed relationship with it. I feel that once the publics love affair with the movie exits the honeymoon phase the box, office, receipts, will decline I anticipate this movie moving to a streaming platform in a few months from now. I am a very big fan of James Cameron's work and enjoy almost every movie he has made, but sometimes sequels don't hit the mark as is the case with this one. If you are a diehard Avatar fan, give it a shot, otherwise give it a miss. Hopefully this mediocre storyline will not set the tone for the upcoming Avatar 3 and 4 releases due to be released by 2025.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Story, plot, acting, pacing all had to make way for Cameron to make his CGI nature documentary. Taking 10-20 minute detours to show pretty CGI, nature, animals, putting (what's left of) the shallow story on hold.A story that is filled with potholes, inconsistent acting and strange character motivations.Characters that should be angry at each other; aren't. - Characters that shouldn't be angry at each other; are.. for some reason.Especially the generic teen drama with forgettable characters.. (not helped with having 100% CGI characters. They all look alike too much to figure out who's who.. )
the children just get into trouble over and over again, they get involved over and over again, at the cost of everyone else, which just got annoying at times.. there is so much inconsistent drama in this, and it's only there so that we can take a detour into the next CGI nature bit to watch a CGI whale swim about for a bit instead of moving the plot forward.It's a movie filled with cliche's and story points that are just copies from other movies and franchises. *just add blue body-paint*. There is no mystery, there are no surprises, there is nothing new in this very shallow story. Meaning it gets predictable, and boring. And Cameron tries to distract from that with pretty visuals and CGI nature documentaries. But no matter how pretty the visuals might be, it can't fix that..","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The quality of the CGI was impecable and was used on a scale that I have never seen before.Unfortunately the ilogical and corner-cutting plot stoped me from apreciating the quality of the special effects. It seemed that due to the focus on CGI, the story suffered. Particularly in the beggining, some of the decisions made by characters simpily didn't make sense and felt like a poorly written excuse for a change of setting. I lost count of the number of hostage situations but by the end they had lost all meaning and you just started assuming the captive character would escape. Two of the characters looked identical and sounded simmilar which made it difficult to dicern between them. It felt like the makers of this film were relying on viewers not to question choices made by the characters and just blindly belive in the protagonists.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The special effects are meticulously detailed and the money is all on the screen. The water looks wet and whatever's swimming swims swimmingly.Unfortunately, The Way of Water's witless and humorless story falls behind its visual magnificence. In a retread of the colonialist outsiders vs the natives' story from the first Avatar, Jake Sully and his wife Neytiri and their family, learn about Pandora's ocean subculture like Jake did last time in the forest.Dripping in corporate saliva, the film devotes all its time like a scheming illusionist seductively teasing the audience to step into Pandora, so it can dazzle them into funding a third film.Suffice it to say, I did not connect with Avatar: The Way of Water. I cannot buy into this world. The marines all talk in tough guy clichés. The good guys are super good and the bad are super evil. I do not get how any of the human scientists don't giggle over saying ""Unobtainium"". But there's more to it...Beneath all the world-building, colorful creature designs, and pioneering special effects, I do not inherently believe that James Cameron is a tree-hugging nature lover who believes that all life is connected through the joining of tails.Cameron claims to be an ocean lover, but that sentiment is muted by the film's corporate sensibilities.The Way of Water's environmental message is repetitive and one-note. It's not the sentiment itself but the way it is cheaply used. Whenever a conflict happens, the script manipulatively plays that environment card to hook the audience into the plight of the Na'vi like, ""Why can't anyone leave these blue cats alone?""Throughout James Cameron's career, technology has been a prominent role and theme in his films, whether it's the mind-blowing special effect of the T-1000 from Terminator 2, the mech suit from Aliens, actors diving underwater for The Abyss, the recreation of the Titanic sinking or the deep sea exploration in his documentary work.In my head, James Cameron is closer to the tech-driven human villains in his own film. The director's true nature seeps through The Way of Water and consistently takes me out of the story.For example, the visual designs for the ocean Na'vi people were all drawn from Pacific Islander cultures. All that reminds me is the actual Pacific Islanders in real life who had their culture decimated by colonization throughout history. I am too aware of the design for it to have its intended dramatic effect on me.When the film asks the audience to sympathize with the Na'vi and their homeland being destroyed by resource-stealing colonizers, it feels disingenuous. The story is asking for a sentiment from the audience that the storyteller does not possess himself. I hate to say this, but there's no real soul in Avatar: The Way of Water.As bitter as I sound, I am genuinely happy for anybody who enjoyed this film. I watched it with my family -I insisted we see it in 2D. They enjoyed it immensely and notes were compared in a civil fashion afterward. Even the children at my theater enjoyed it in a rollercoaster type way albeit being completely drained when the credits rolled.I was bored out of my mind and it felt like an eternity. I figure I might be biased. After all, the first Avatar also brought us 3D cinema, which theater chains used as a ploy to charge more money by front-loading a new release with 3D-only screenings, forcing people to watch a dimmed image for the next 5 years.I genuinely hope for Avatar to end and pray that moviegoers will not be ransomed into wearing 3D glasses again for half a decade.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But I took my grandkids (8, 10), and their response is the reason for the addition of extra points.Full disclosure: I was no fan of the 2009 original, but appreciated the technical work on display. The story wasn't merely simple, but fundamentally simple-minded, as though reverse-engineered from pre-existing set and character designs.The sequel, The Way Of Water, is so hollow and pointless that it makes Avatar 1 seem dense and complex. It is a story that could easily have been outlined in a single pencil sketch, yet the resultant film is somehow over three hours in length. Which means that the middle third, more than 60 minutes, is all shots of blue people swimming with eels and clownfish.That's not hyperbole. This movie is fully 33% swimming... but it looks gorgeous. If you're the type of person who gets nostalgic for the screensavers of yore, this is the movie for you.I was reluctant to take the kids because of the excessive runtime, but realized they'd never experienced 3D in the cinema (and may never get another chance), so I bit the bullet. I told them, ""It's a long film. We don't have to stay to the end. Just tell me if you're getting tired of it.""At the 2-hour mark, though, it was I that longed to check out and go home.Those two went right to the end, and wanted more. The 10 year old declared, ""Best movie I've ever seen!"" And the 8-year old allowed that it was ""pretty awesome.""And that was the true joy of the thing.Avatar 2 is a childish movie, but, unlike Avatar 1, it may actually be FOR children. And that's a whole new context. Five kids are the narrative focus, and the youngest two had my youngest two absolutely enthralled.So... Thumbs-up, with reservations.Beautiful emptiness for grown-ups.Pure magic for kids.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Like the effects. Well, the effects are very impressive, but so were the effects in the first movie. An evolutionary step up indeed, but nothing truly revolutionary from a viewers point of view. To me, that leaves the characters to captivate the audience, and unfortunately they are as two-dimensional as in the first movie. Often marred by cringe worthy dialogue and klichéd teenage drama not even worthy of a late 1980's sitcom. It is as if Cameron once again caters for the lowest denominator to make sure as many people as possible are lured to the box office. I fully understand that, as a lot of money are at stake, but I miss the Cameron of old, willing to take risks and challenge us as an audience. Oh, but what about the movies messages you ask? As for the movies messages, which are obvious even to a 6-year old, I am sure most will agree on them, and yet, they somehow seem like low hanging fruit, with over the top antagonists lacking any redeeming qualities. With 1980's thematics instead of true eye openers. As a viewer you are left with an empty feeling of deja vu once the end credits start rolling, where you ought to feel rage and a desire to save the world based on a fresh perspective. Yes, we know indiginous people have been treated poorly whenever invasions have occurred throughout the centuries, but that goes for any invaded population throughout history and not just the so called nature people. We also know that whale hunting is bad from the perspective of those who does not base their survival on a species. But it all amounts to nothing new. Given the movies lack of substance, it is at least one hour too long, and I have no urge to revisit Pandora in the coming sequals, as nothing truly exciting seems in store for us. I will watch the sequals, off course I will, but mainly because it seems unlikely that we once again will be served the same dish in a slightly re-arranged manner. Crossing fingers!","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

Combine with new technologies, it actually give the audience another great opportunity to feel that planet one more time. All the details are great and the ship are cool.And I think Mr. Cameron really did try many new elements in the movie. We can see this point from many family scenes in this movie. It reflect how families is important to all of us. However I guess he haven't had enough time neither to express his ideas or incorporate these elements. The whole story seems like a pasta. There are many stories lined in there but they just intertwined with full randomness. In other words, the.motivation of each character is not sufficient to justify their actions. For example, the main character, Jack, often unaware of the consequences of his actions.Lastly, it really surprised that there are not a single part in this movie can actually touch my emotions.

So now everyone is happy and Jake has a family.The ""sky people"" return (devastating the forest) and the Navi begin fighting back. But hey, let's download the consciousness of the badgiy from the original into an avatar so he can start to hunt Jake and Co.Spider gets caught and Jake moves his family to the water tribe where they have to learn new Navi ways.Blah blah blah, I'm out.I started laughing the moment Jake's wife got all teary and cried when the forest was damaged. I groaned at the hoora semper fi B. S. warrior plot. The acting was bland, the story was tripe, and I walked out before my laughter would ruin the movie for the 12 other viewers.CGI is a crutch used by filmmakers to pass lame stories off as epics. This movie is forgettable, overlong, and poorly written. If you like it, that's fine, but this is not a masterpiece. It's a beautiful c grade script that I regret giving money too. I hear the third act is pretty cool, but if you gotta sit through two hours of corny environmentalist writing, I say skip the theater and wait for clips on youtube.Saw a few clips and laughed at how bad the acting was.

The worst part is that almost every spectacular event was entirely predictable. I actually leaned over to my wife about halfway through the movie as I was getting bored and sleepy, and said, ""This isn't very good."" She agreed.As a final note, I think that the original Avatar brought forth sooo many new ideas, characters, and fantasy thought processes, it made it extraordinarily difficult to meet up or exceed that amazing original.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

And it proceeded to be mostly exactly that, with a few exceptional bright spots throughout.Starting with the positives, the action sequences and underwater camerawork are exceptionally well-crafted. It's so vivid and eye-catching, always keeping what's important at the center of attention. When it's time for spectacle, this movie shines brighter than anything else I've seen, even though the film's frame rate frequently shifts between 24fps and 60fps, and it's very distracting.There are quite a lot of characters introduced in this story, and only one of them really stands out: Jake's son Lo'ak. He has a very simplistic character arc but it's largely effective, being efficiently introduced and having a very satisfying, emotional payoff.Unfortunately these are the best things I can praise, because everything else really is just more of the same.They bring back the same dull villains with the EXACT SAME motivations that are uninteresting at best and nonsensical at worst.They bring back the same ""having to learn a new culture and attain acceptance"" arc from the first movie that is entirely devoid of inspiration or nuance.They bring back the exact same theme of ""military exploitation bad"" and the exact same presenting of that theme with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face.Even the film's climax just comes across as a scaled-down, beat-for-beat remake of the climax of the first film, with even the same final fight that's predictable and overly long.And what's not new is mostly underdeveloped. I do praise Cameron and co. For trying to explore a new region of Pandora and add new blood to the cast of characters, but a lot that's introduced is presented in the same way as the first movie (riding new creatures, treasuring new resources, etc.).One of Jake's daughters is given an intriguing origin and set of skills, but almost nothing is done with it and it's never explained.As for the screenplay, it's clunkily-paced and the dialogue is...a mixed bag at best. There's a lot of ""get some!"" and ""that was sick, cuz!"" and other such placeholder dialogue that made me cringe into my seat.All the pieces were there to craft a groundbreaking new chapter to this saga, but in the end I rarely felt anything because it feels like unfocused, indecisive filler content to pad runtime while we wait for a more substantive, compelling chapter.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie is a feast for the eyes but the storyline is beyond empty and lacks logic. Many 'human' characters lack richness and character - without being provided dimensional depth and reasoning they leave the viewer questioning if the script / storyline writer actually was able to get what they wrote to the screen or whether it was manipulated by some 'marketing / profit return calculation algorithm'.Simply put the storyline is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. Whether it was being marketed solely to an audience defined as that or the test audience was having giggle I guess I will not know but will live in hope someone decides to take this potential gem and do something unexpected (be original and intelligent) and decide to write scripts for all characters that actually make sense. Actually bring everyone to life because the visuals are amazing but the storyline contradicts and lacks dimensional richness. You are putting paper thin characters into a 5D perspective and that is not going to provoke a response that is moving in the direction you wish. Left feeling I just experienced a 3hr 15min void of being stuck in a pile of chewing gum. Certainly not feeling drawn to view Avatar 3, 4 and 5.

Theme for a very ordinary Masala movie with nothing innovative.The last 45 minutes is a torture to watch as they have dragged it on and on and on and on.

It's an hour longer than it needs to be, the writing is absolutely abysmal at times and most of the characters are annoying as hell. But even then, I still had such a great time watching it. In some ways I love this film, it encapsulates the ""blockbuster movie"" experience so well that, at several moments, tricked me into believing I was actually watching something good.When you stand back and look at the film as a whole confined experience it is just plain odd. When I walked out of the cinema the one word I kept describing it with was weird. It is weird, weird, weird. It blew me away honestly, how they could get so much bang on perfect and so much astoundingly awful. I suppose I'll start talking specifics now, refraining from any spoilers of course.The first 15 or so minutes of the film felt like I was watching a video game cutscene, and this is a problem which plagued a lot of the film for me. A lot of the time I struggled to view the story from the perspective of any one character, greatly detaching me from the events taking place. I think most of this can be explained by the rather strange way this film is shot and edited at times. There are many sequences in the film that look beautiful, don't get me wrong. But at other times I was extremely confused over what the cinematographer's aim was. On countless occasions the camera would do this awkward zoom-in which made it feel like I was watching some kind of nature documentary, and, during many of the action set-pieces the editing was cut together so quickly when the scene would have greatly benefitted from longer takes. Overall, this contributed to the feeling that I was just watching a pure spectacle, rather than a character driven story. And yes, maybe that was intended and if so, fair enough. But if that is the case then what is the point spending so much screen time attempting to develop your characters, because I can tell you, I didn't care about a single one.I'm not going to go into the plot at all, but wow, it is certainly nothing unique or special. Of course, I wasn't expecting it to be and I'm sure that the same can be said for Avatar 1, not that I can remember any of it. Let's just say, don't expect anything you haven't seen a hundred times before, this is just your basic action, adventure storyline, which is totally OK if they nail the visuals and the climatic set pieces, everyone knows what's going to happen so just make the journey as enjoyable as possible. So, did Avatar 2 achieve this?For the most part yes. It almost feels stupid for me to praise the visual effects and CGI because they are so obviously fantastic. However, I think its important for me to mention that there are some sequences, particularly those that are underwater, that I thought were worth the cost of viewing alone. Some sections of this film are just jaw-droppingly beautiful to gaze at, it is a triumphant achievement in visual effects. However, saying this, they still haven't completely nailed it yet. A lot of the shots which involved an avatar and human character in the same frame really pulled me out of it. I'm not sure whether it was a lighting issue or something, but they never felt they were truly taking up the same physical space. My absolute favourite aspect of the film was the sound. They did such an outstanding job with the foley. I could feel every footstep and every drop of rain, definitely worth the cinema experience! I loved it and, as per usual, the score was fantastic. The Avatar theme is definitely one of my favourites, fits the film perfectly.So, the most important question, should you watch it? If I had to give you a straight answer I would say yes, it is worth watching. The sound and visuals alone make this a wonderful experience in cinemas, something I'm sure most people were expecting. It's just such a shame that the film falls short in almost every other aspect of its presentation, and I've limited my rating to a 4 because of this. If I were to rate it on my pure enjoyment, I would have to give it an 8, but that's not how I rate films.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I looked at the wiki pages for this movie and Babylon. Babylon's not doing anything in the box office practically, within the same stretch of days between the middle of December and the middle of January. The excuses they made for babylon's poor performance at the box office, is a triple pandemic, and ardent fear of it. And the wiki entry for this movie Avatar The Way of the water, they say it made an impossible amount over a billion dollars in the same stretch of days. What happened to that fear of the triple pandemic? What the wiki says is that it did a great performance in a pandemic year. Either you are scared of the pandemic, or you are not. Which is it? Plus this movie is being touted as made a science fiction amount of money in the same stretch, while Babylon made practically nothing in the same 30 days. This comparison reminds me, the way they trivialize the pandemic, of a Saturday night live sketch. It's the greatest sketch of all time, on a show that now primarily sucks. It was many years ago. They simply had a screen, your TV screen, showing an orange on a revolving surface. More like the surface that you would have in your microwave, except smaller, and flat enough to comfortably sit the orange. That orange was being rotated slowly, like some diamond encrusted showpiece, being rotated so you can get a view from every angle as you sit in front of your TV screen. After a few moments of you just sitting there watching an orange rotate, on the motorized platform, you see the screen fade to Black, then the screen fades back in and you see the orange again, as a whole bunch of people come chasing after the orange mob style, to get its autograph, which today would be a selfie, with you and the orange in the same frame. Yes I am talking about the fruit. You know the message. If it's on TV, you will believe it, no matter what they say do or think. The purveyors of the television media, the press media, print media, mainstream, that own online articles and such, are what you will bow to, blindly, no matter what. The fact that they were willing to put that skit on screen proves that the author of Saturday night live and all those who run mainstream media, are aware of the power they have, and they think you are stupid. And indeed, when some of us are told we are slaves to the media, we get indignant and defensive. Of course that feeds into their hand. Both of these movies are being nominated for awards, and probably have already won some by this writing. And you will believe it's all legitimate. Having said that, I tried to watch both of these movies, and I got the feeling, completely disjointed motion picture, and I have yet to to complete the viewing of either. A movie should not be a labor to get through. Why is it that the ones that are labor to get through, always get the awards and their critical praise? I randomly gave it five stars just to get attention. The reality is this movie is really really low grade. But money matters. They spent over the usual Budget on Avatar, so they are determined to make you think it profited. Big time in an impossible fashion. They spent very little money comparatively speaking, on Babylon. But they still spent some money, so they are making excuses for the movie. Either way they know better what you're doing than you know yourself. Apparently. I suspect this movie review would get banned because I'm not on topic. I am on topic because the other movie and media presentation were necessary for the comparison.

Because of that I couldn't be drawn into the movie. It was like you are watching movie and falling into the story and into that world and BAM, here comes some ""video game"" scenes and at that moment you are being pushed to the reality that you are actually siting in the cinema.Dont get me wrong. Its visually great, but for some presentation video or a video game, and not for a movie. I mean, Avatar 1 looked crazy good and from start you were pulled into that movie, into Pandora world and everything that was happening. It was visually stunning all the way without any ""video game look"". I understand they are trying new technologies and all, but you cant sacrifice that movie experience just so you can show how good can something look and to show more details in scenes with high intensity moving.From start there were some scenes that left you questioning how did that happened. Its possible they will resolve that in the future movies, but still. Story is a bit shallow.I didnt connect with Pandora or the people or some character at all. Usually you connect with one, or few, characters and you follow that character development and have emotions when something happens.In Avatar 1 I was also connected with the whole world of Pandora. Watching that movie I kind of felt it was something alive.In this 2nd part nothing. There are multiple characters, but I didnt connect with anyone. At some point it was a bit boring. When I say that, I dont mean about lack of action scenes. Im saying that I have watched movies that have ultra little action scenes, but the story was driving me whole the way. That was not the case in here.Overall those 3 hours in cinema really felt like 3 hours (and not like 20 minutes when you are pulled in the movie and follow the story).I am a kind of person who can watch movie marathon for 2 days non stop. If I like some movie I can watch it like 100 times, no problem. I remember that I watched 1st Avatar in cinema, and in next 7 days, I watched it 3 more times with different friends.For this 2nd part I already had arranged plans to watch it with someone else again, but the sad part is I really cant. I told that friend to watch it with someone else, or even better to wait and to watch it online.I hope they will look into a lot of comments and make some changes for future parts. BTW this 8 star rating is not honest. Even if there were not ""game like"" problems, the story and everything simply is not there. Its like someone organized and paid rating to be high...At this point, honestly, I dont even care if we will ever see parts 3, 4 and 5. If they gets out and be like this 2nd part, I will watch them one time just to see the story. Beside that, Avatar 1 will be in my heart as stand alone movie that I will gladly watch from time to time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

He seriously looked at those youtube videos the put 60 fps in movie scenes and actually thought ""wow this looks super cool"" and decided to put in scenes that don't fit that frame rate possibly on a coin flip at random.When I first heard that avatar 2 was being announced I thought that the worst thing that could happen to it was that it wouldn't bring back the magic that the first movie had. I never could've in a million years be prepared for the worst possible scenario to play out.The reason why games work better in high fps is because people playing the games would be able to respond more accordingly with everything on screen, that is not the case for a film. The action and the dialogue scenes in this movie fly by so brief and quickly and looked so unnatural like that I couldn't absorb what is happening. And it's never consistent, one minute it is hyper as chihuahua on Crack and the next it is absolutely choppy. I guess to make the dialouge scenes give more space to breath but when the hfps is implemented is absolute random.It is a shame too because there are some breathtaking images in this movie but are marred by this horrible new experiment. By the time that the final action scene kicked in my mind was just absolutely done. I stopped paying attention to the story and was just focused too much on trying to process the visuals to the point where my brain was actually physically hurting.Please don't give James Cameron any more money, please don't make this movie a success. Petition your government to ban this film from the public consciousness. If this movie actually succeeds on the back of this high fps in movies meme then there is no telling what damage this will do to cinema going forward.And I give this a 2/10.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

One can only watch alien creatures frolicking in the ocean for so long.The sequel just proves James Cameron is all about the gloss, no substance. The movie would have been far more interesting if it revolved around the character of Grace's daughter.

They are not for me. They are designed for people who are under the influence and just want some fun visuals to look at. There's no substance, hell there's barely even a plot. And they still find a way to stretch it well past 3 hours.The best movie villains are relatable. You don't have to be on their side, but you have to understand where they are coming from. This movie doesn't have that. The villain's motives are as forced as I've ever seen in a film. And it's exactly the same as the first movie.The movie may look good, if you care about that, but I will never understand the concept of everyone looking exactly the same. It's exhausting having to look for small details in every single scene just to work out who is actually talking.This one is long, tedious, lacking in any kind of a story and immediately forgettable.

The graphics were on point, in 2009. Sad to say there was really no noticeable difference 13 years later. James needs to realize what got him here, won't get him 'there'.2. This sequel figuratively 'craps' on the entirety of the motivations that made the audience care about Pandora and everything that made the first one special. (e.g., what about unobtanium, where's the grand unity; the spirituality, why are these once great protagonists now so one dimensional?)3. Completely unoriginal plot accompanied by a lackluster story, to say the least. No depth, no continuation of the moral principles, James just does a fantastic job at insulting the audience by simply copy-pasting climactic elements from past franchises. It's evident the only goal here was to separate money from wallets when after more than a decade of development, we get the same tired old antagonist, altercations and plot vehicles. JC should be absolutely crippled with shame after pumping this the way he has.4. The acting was uninteresting, boring and in many scenes tedious; yes, I'm looking at you Zoe and Sam. Perhaps just a result of their characters radical change for absolutely no gain.5. Character continuity is obviously not as important to this franchise as hectic world building. It's a shame these actors were on-board with such a dismantling of their original characters. Is the audience really to believe that self-righteous American family values just all the sudden trump generations of indigenous culture? Neytiri is reduced to an emotional basket-case of a housewife/mother, with at least half of her script being wailing in anguish or screaming in anger. Jake's character instead doubles down on the dumb jarhead persona who's only goal now is to keep his family together and safe, like a good little pack of marines, yet stumbles miserably at that. Quaritch is just a steaming pile of disappointment, I can't describe how lazy and dissatisfying it is to see them base the continuation of the franchise on this shallow, unrelatable ogre. Kiri/Grace could have had such potential, but instead the audience gets lackadaisical religious doctrine with little to no explanation nor acknowledgement by any of the other characters.6. Character development is on par with the Hallmark channel. Now that Jake and Neytiri have been reduced to mindless nuclear parents, we get uninteresting kids who do nothing but the opposite of what they know to be right, simply for the sake of introducing dramatic affect to move the story along to the next unoriginal conflict. Entirely new populations of characters now some-how know a great deal of the English language. Their youth seems eerily in-tune with twenty-first century teen culture and similarly are inherently disrespectful, rude and demeaning for no other reason than to create cheap conflict resolution.7. The new 'McGuffin' is pitiful and insignificant to the franchise and so forgettable that it's abandoned almost as fast as it's explained. The 'sky people' are back, but is it to terraform or is it for the elixir of life? Who knows and who cares, because no matter the reasoning the message here is clearly the same --humanity shaming.8. The erratic filming frame rates also make this visually exhausting (seen in IMAX 3D). This movie was filmed in 48 fps, as well as in 24 fps and is nowhere near consistent. Every other shot is rapidly switching back and forth, so one scene will be established in 24 fps, then suddenly switch to 48 fps, and it happens throughout the entire movie. I was literally crying in the theatre, but certainly not due to the utterly superficial story.Rating: 2/10 stars: Just bad movie making.Entertaining --yet neutered-- computer aided visuals carried this 3+ hour storyline/screenplay like a donkey through the wetlands. This film was made for the dull and unimaginative.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was all there but they went for the standard, outdated formula and made another movie that is over saturated with action and plot twists, spoiled with smarty-pants dialog and overblown with theatrics and characters egos etc.Just proves good directing, good actors, record breaking budget and tech isn't enough to make a good movie.All the hype and hysteria even when we were facing global environment issues... Perhaps in the future movies like this will reflect the state of mind of today's society and serve well as retrospect.One thing for sure: They certainly know how to play on the success of the first and secure the financial success of this move.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

A 5 rating is generous.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The storyline of this second version of Avatar was basically almost exactly the same as the first movie 13 years ago. It even seemed that it didn't know which direction it wanted to go and just mashed up different events and ideas randomly together into a 3 hour movie, which eventually left you with an unsatisfying feeling. The 3D effect is however yet again top notch, you feel as if the characters were real and alive on screen, however I am afraid that the 3D gimmick has worn out over time, that 3D alone wont contribute significantly enough anymore to make a film watchable.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes, the visuals are amazing, I get that. But this is not some Unreal Engine promo.I never expected nor wished for an outstanding plot. I say with all honesty that I went to the cinema without any expectation for plot at all. And yet, no matter how much good will I armed myself with, nothing could prepare me for the horrendousness I've just witnessed.There is absolutely nothing coherent in this movie whatsoever. There's too many characters, too many plotlines, too much stuff going on. There's too many moment that require massive narration to explain the backstories. It's just too much to handle, and nothing goes any direction. There is never a purpose, never.The characters are, for the most part, unlikeable. I could not bond/empathize with a single one of them.I should add that I am really not a big fan of film plots where all characters always make bad decisions, without exception and also without any learning outcome. The character development in this film is absolutely missing. Gone.I don't think I've ever felt so much disappointment about a film ever in my life. I am deeply disgusted.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I will definitely not go back to the theater for any more Avatar movies after this fiasco, I will wait for them to stream or not watch them at all. I didn't even feel the 3D as much this time either, it was a fairly flat movie with a few moments of 3D when projectiles were flying at me or particles floating in front of the image. No more proper pacing, no more slowing down some scenes to create actual awe and wonder, everything is fast-paced like it's made by a complete maniac. What a let-down, wow. It's not even a ""visual spectacle"" this time because all the plants and animals look like plastic figurines in a videogame's cutscenes (which is only made even more obvious and jarring if you see it in HFR), so it failed even at its most basic task. And as many have said, the writing is also bottom of the barrel stuff, again like the ""script"" for your average videogame between-missions cinematics. Considering this and the Dark Fate fiasco I'm starting to believe James Cameron is actually dead and has been replaced by a lookalike just to keep the marketing going.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Oh wait here we also already brought danger, and might bring all into danger again... but nah, these guys take us as their own, let's stay with them now. So why not to stay with the previous in the first place... a specially you were kind of their leader and they depended on you...This and many other flaws already can't be overwhelmed with beautiful picture, it could in 2009... as it's already 2022.

Genuine kudos to James Cameron for being brave enough to do this in front of an earth full of human. But this also puzzles me, in the sense that the hero of the movie, being an avatar, is essentially an immigrant on Pandora that fully outgrowed his past identity as a human. Even though this is purely fictional, people would inevitably think of its real-life parallel. And if you stare at this parallel long enough, you will start to feel uncomfortable about what potential messages the movie might carry.Here are some notes I made during my first (and only) watch:","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

The remaining three hours of the movie go on to show Jake's struggle to keep his people safe with the impending humans coming back to take their revenge. We get introduced to a new setting and extremely forgettable characters. Matter of fact there is basically no human actors in this movie, it's mostly all Avatars which doesn't work in the films favour. Partly what makes sequels successful is that people want to see their old favourite characters in action or the introduction of memorable new ones we grow to care about and want to see a potential third movie. This film gives us a ton of absolutely forgettable characters and doesn't give us any reasons to care about them for a third instalment.The visuals are the only reason I give it a 5. If they were hypothetically done poorly I'd actually give this film a 3/10 maybe even a 2. There is no way I would have sat through and watched this empty plot at home on the TV for 3.5 hours and only reason I didn't walk out was because my partner fell asleep who loved the first one so much she saw it 3x in the cinemas but couldn't keep her eyes open for the last 90 minutes.I looked around the cinema and managed to spot one other person dead asleep and if they were to ask me what they missed it could be summarised quite thoroughly in 2 minutes.I think this movie came 8 years too late and it's become completely irrelavent. The people who saw this movie as teens or young adults 13 years later should definitely have out grown it's thrill. I still would have an easier time summarising what made the first film more memorable having last seen it about a decade ago than telling you what I liked about this film having just walked out of the theater.Good luck making 2 billion on this movie!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","All Spectacle, No Substance.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8772474/?ref_=tt_urv","ryanpersaud-59415","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65683941/?ref_=tt_urv","1 January 2023","So, a year after seeing this movie, I feel like yet again, the world has been fooled by James Cameron and his shiny objects. Avatar: The Way of Water is all spectacle and essentially no substance. It's a testament to how easy it is to be tricked by gorgeous visuals and swelling music, although at least this time, audiences seem to be a bit more aware of the schitck.I don't this is a ""terrible"" or even ""bad"" movie. There are some redeeming aspects here. First off, the visuals are absolutely gorgeous and the film, as long as it is, takes it time to introduce us to a new part of Pandora. It's hard not to be swept up in it all. There's also a nice father-son arc here with Jake (played by everyone's favourite generic white man, Sam Worthington) and Netayam, even if it's something we've seen many times before, it was oddly refreshing. Of course, some of the action scenes are great and very fun while you're watching them. That's the bare minimum though, right?But, let's be real here. Cameron has upwards of ten years and unlimited resources and creative freedom to make a sequel to the highest grossing film of all time, and THIS is what we get? The Way of Water is a complete retread of the original, playing upon the same themes, and with almost the exact same resolution. It suffers from tremendously bad writing and very cringe worthy dialog.If you've ever wondered why this ""massive"" franchise has almost no iconic characters - ironically, the most memorable, Zoey Saldana's Natiri is sidelined for most of it - it's because none of them are written particularly well.The fundamental problem with Avatar is that the Na'vi are boring. They exist in a world where all their needs are catered to, they live in (seemingly) perfect harmony with each other, and there are no genuine conflicts amongst them. Even when there are, they take the form of childish rivalries and jealousies, and nothing substantial. Cameron's preachiness about ""harmony with nature"" can't be taken seriously given how the Na'vi interact with and are provided for by a sentient planet that essentially is always looking out for them.Whereas the Na'vi are boring, the humans are cartoonishly evil. It's hard to view them as compelling villains; they're physically smaller, weaker, slower, and less capable than the Na'vi are. You always get the sense watching these films that the humans are bound to be destroyed as soon as the Na'vi and their animal allies unify. It doesn't help that the ""technological advantage"" the humans have is negated by said animals. Cameron hates these human characters so much that he can't even give them cool, futuristic weapons, arming them instead with the guns, helicopters, and boats that'd you imagine soldiers today using.Also, can we acknowledge how terrible of a decision it was to have Sigourney Weaver play the teenage version of herself? My God.The Way of Water is a fine movie, but I can't help but feel it's a wasted opportunity. Cameron seriously needs to work on the writing and figure out ways to expand the world, but not with more creatures or locations, but more thematic, philosophical, and character complexity.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That is impossible to watch with a break.The story recycles many dated Vietnam War tropes, along with too many references to African and Oceanic cultures. At times, I felt like they were even ripping off from Jacques Cousteau.The main characters from Avatar 1 are present, but they have grown up and are not that recognizable. Recognizing different characters can be difficult sometimes.There is little resolution at the end of the movie, and no overt signs of a sequel. I saw the movie in 3D with glasses, but I don't know if the 3D was worthwhile or necessary, just another price gouge.Would I watch it again, even to just see the parts I missed. I'm not sure. Overall, I found the movie anticlimactic and frequently dull.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In Avatar, The Way Of Water it is the Hakuna Matata shot of Blue Guy Número Uno raising up his baby boy to the skies.That visual cliche sums up the movie. You get a little Tarzan, some old Western train heist mini-movie, a lot of Finding Nemo scenery, and an entire Moby Dick (in Space!) film with a little Dances With Wolves ""white man teaches you how to fight the white man"" for good measure. But when it comes to the story, it's a lot of blue and turquoise cardboard cut-outs tugging at your heart strings. And maybe I'm heartless, but it didn't connect.Actually, I can't be heartless. I absolutely loved the Baby Shelob The Builder spiders and the crab cabs. I didn't care for the new skinny exoskeletons, but most of the space hardware was space cool. And Pandora *is* pretty. Not so pretty that we need what should be a five second shot last fifty seconds, but at least you can go pee without being worried about missing anything important. It still is the story of a manly man protecting his family because another manly man is trying to harm him. Sure, the manly men are blue, but an important lesson from the movie is that manly men are manly. Also, don't be wasteful and save the environment. But mostly, be manly.Should you watch it? Sure! Everyone else is. But don't try to be manly and hold your pee for the whole movie. That would be bad for your manly kidneys. And really, you have seen this movie before, just with normal hue humans and a shorter run time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

After waiting such a long time to be presented with this travesty... I'm not even really surprised, but it still hurts when even thin hopes are dashed.I refuse to believe that James Cameron had much if anything to do with writing this. It reeks of hollywood swine infecting and botching everything. No intelligence, sense or even logic. There's no creativity either, they just recycled a bunch of recognizeable favorites from the original - and not well, just facepalmingly shameless cut and paste.The movie seems more like different imitation franchise, where they took the script from a low budget rip-off, hired Cameron's effects time and got Uwe Boll to direct.Suffice to say I'm not interested and however many more installments follow. As I feared Avatar has gone the way of The Matrix.

Whatever it was it was not interesting. A big military ogre, engineered to look like the guy he wants to kill, chasing after children to use against their parents, murdering innocent animals and destroying villages of innocent people in his wake. What a way to waste 3+ hours on a Sunday morning. At least an hour was pointless, bloated battle scenes. If I had not rode with friends to the theater I would of left early. Sure, I guess it had cool visuals. The interaction with the water people was interesting. But the rest sucked. Testosterone filled men, destroying land that is not their own, murdering the innocent natives because they have something of value. Sound familiar? I'm so sick of this narrative.

Unfortunately I could not get the 3D glasses to work over my prescription glasses so I had to watch the movie as a 3d blur. Nevertheless I did find the film interesting and engaging and I imagined that it would have been really awesome in 3D. So I was really looking forward to seeing the new Avatar in IMAX 3D because I heard that they had 3D glasses that now worked much better with prescription glasses.After about 10 previews of upcoming superhero movies at the IMAX the new Avatar movie started. The 3D really worked. I had no trouble at all seeing the images. But after a few minutes the novelty wore off. I found the 3D did not add much of anything at all. In fact it started to look really cheesy and I was surprised at how phony it all looked. After 10 minutes I realized that I had not paid attention to any of the dialogue or characters and had no idea what was going on. It was a lot of talk, talk, talk but completely unengaging.I nodded off a couple of times and 45 minutes into the film I left and went home. So I really did not see this movie. Maybe it got more interesting as it went along. So I'm giving it a generous 5 based on what I saw. I am never going back for another Avatar.

Good if you're 16 or have the mentality of a 16 year old. If you've seen a movie or two in your life, you'll know how each science ends, who exactly is going to die, and how will the protagonists respond. Also, about half of the movie has no plot, just visual effects, so make sure to pack a lot of patience.The fantasy is really lacking, especially compared to other universes such as Marvel, LOTR, star wars, or, you know what, Rick and Morty. There are like 7 species on this entire stupid planet. One type of bird. 3 and half type of fish. Nothing makes sense anymore.In retrospective, I was sure I loved the first Avatar. This movie reminded me that I didn't, and was probably inception-ed to believe I did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While the first part is definitely a must-see, The Way of Water was pretty disappointing. The plot was just confusing and I am still not quite sure what was the point of that film. Sure, Jake has to protect his family so he seeks help from other communities. But what lead to that? It all happened so fast even though the movie was long. Too long. I'm gonna admit, it didn't feel long, but at some point I just gave up and went to sleep. Although, the movie has a few good pieces. For example, the music wasn't too bad, Neytiri's song was actually enjoyable and I really liked it. The special effects were absolutely breathtaking and amusing, I definitely can't complain about that. The Avatars and Pandora are beautiful and the action scenes were pretty realistic. The acting was fantastic. I'm surprised at how well someone could portray a furry. The actors did a great job and played their characters perfectly. We've got an emo teen daughter (who was by the way played by a seventy-three year old actress), an edgy son, an annoying baby sister and the eldest brother accompanied by a strict father and a loving mother, both ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of their children. And I need to mention once again that Jack Champion portrayed Spider really well. I actually believe that he's a furry.Overall, the film wasn't the best and definitely not what I was expecting. Not after the original Avatar movie. I wouldn't watch it again.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

While it excels in delivering an adrenaline-fueled spectacle from start to finish, the film falls short in narrative depth. It prioritizes stunning visuals over a compelling storyline, which may leave fans of more story-driven cinema, like 'The Godfather', underwhelmed. Despite this, the movie is a perfect test for high-end audio equipment. The sound design is impeccable, particularly through Atmos sound bar speakers, where every audio detail comes to life, enveloping the viewer in the midst of the action. It's a feast for the senses, though perhaps not for the mind.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Masterclass cgi and a solid story fullfill the high expectations.Story:
The Way of Water introduces the Water Tribe to the audience which is created with a lot of love. They have their own rituals and traditions and that is shown perfectly. This movie is not the last of the series so dont expect a big climax here. It has a solid finale and helps to build up the climax that will come with Avatar 5 (!). Therefore that it is 3 hours long the pacing is great. (7/10)Acting:
Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana in the main roles are great like in the original. The antagonist is also well depicted. With all the cgi it is not as easy for the actors to show their talents, but it is though satisfying. (6/10)Music:
Well, the soundtrack of the movie is good, but a blockbuster like this deserves more. In my case the cinema I watched the movie played ""Victory"" by Two Steps From Hell before the start of the movie and this is how a masterclass soundtrack works. They should have hired Hans Zimmer or so for such a big event. (5/10)Visuals:
Well this movie sets the benchmark high in case of graphics. The Last Time I saw this beauty in a movie would be 2020's Dune or 2019's Rise of Skywalker. Unfortunately nowadays the graphics are getting worse (Yes, I mean you MARVEL!) so it is great to see this quality. It's quite as good as the cgi in videogames!Genre:
As a science fiction movie it has a great world, we already know of the original. But it expands this world with the water tribe and you have the feeling that every creature or technology was created with love and makes sense. (8/10)Verdict:Avatar: The Way of Water is far better than I have expected it to be. In my opinion it's even better than the original. James Cameron proved again that he knows how to make blockbuster movies!(7/10)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But really, I am so tired of potentially great films being botched.First, I don't want to spoil this for those who LIKED this movie, so if you thought it was great, continue to love it and feel free to stop reading now, 'cos I'm about to be somewhat negative about a few aspects.Despite the drawbacks of the first movie (Pocahontas script la la la)... it was visually beautiful. The Pandoran forest was truly alien and above all, the story line was still unique enough to draw one into this fantasy world completely.This second movie is like a Michael Bay Transformers movie with military assault weapons and fight scenes and explosions and action and-- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CONCEPT OF STORY??? Good guys run away from bad guys, good guys fight the bad guys, yadda yadda yadda.This could have been so much better developed. Sure, the sea creatures are interesting and well done. The ""intelligent whales"" were a big jump the shark for me personally, but okay, intelligent whales. We wonder still about just how intelligent whales are on Earth. I can handle that.But what really burned me was this: it was so obvious that humans would return EN FORCE... and Mr. Marine-turned-Pandoran, brilliant military man / strategist / warrior that he is, didn't really prepare ANYONE for that very obvious future incursion. WHAT WAS HE THINKING? (Or rather, what was Cameron thinking?)What, they're just going to settle into their nice, idealistic alien life and never have a problem with humans ever again? Seriously?This movie was all flash and no substance. Sure, the CGI and special effects were great. How could they NOT be in this day and age. I do admit in many parts of the movie I found myself asking, ""Did they film this in an Earth coral reef?"" because seriously, it just wasn't all that ""Pandoran"". It's like they took a standard seascape and threw in a special jellyfish here or a different plant there and it was all just kinda ho-hum. Nothing like the complex and gorgeous scenery of the first movie.Sorry, but this movie just lacked heart. Sure, Neytiri was incredible when she went on a rampage (go Neytiri!) and the bad buys were proper scum-sucking pigs (people hate whale killers even on Earth). There were parts of the movie that were somewhat interesting, but a whole lot more parts that were just ho-hum another large military battle please get it over and put some actual story into this thing.Which is where this movie falls apart. It simply doesn't have anywhere near the heart and soul of the first movie, and we've seen it all before.

In spite of all these weak story telling elements the visual brilliance of the film cannot be overstated. The underwater sequences transport the viewer into an ethereal realm of beauty and wonder. The symphony of colors, textures and movements takes one's breath away. The effects to be fully appreciated should be viewed in 3D, a medium rarely done right, blow this movie out of the water.

It felt like stories within a big story, but not all of them fit together in terms of pace and resolution. Perhaps it is simply the movie lenght. As if it had to be pushed to such a massive runtime just for the sake of hitting 3:20.Overall, I enjoyed the beautiful shots.

Viewed on a big movie theater screen, the spectacle alone will take moviegoers' collective breath away. It's hard to tell what is real and what is Cameron's effects team. More than almost any other movies, the two Avatars are worth watching on a big screen. It's almost like watching one of the big Disney nature documentaries.Screenwriter James Cameron has a great deal of difficulty in writing stories and dialogue that are worthy of Director Janes Cameron's gift. It becomes tedious and starts one fidgeting because the characters we are supposed to care for are basically one note personalities without the benefit of looking different enough to tell them apart. When the battle starts, it's hard to keep track of who is who, and we have no emotional investment in any of them to care who lives and who dies.In Way of Water, the choice of not putting the climax of the story arc happen 45 minutes before the movie ends is a wise one, but there's about an hour and a half of lackluster dialogue in the middle that could have been trimmed to twenty minutes or so. It resembles the aforementioned Disney nature documentaries, but without the narration, and without the educational aspect.Titanic worked because, even though the characters were mostly stereotypes, there was something recognizable about them that most people could see themselves in the situations in that movie. Granted the boat sinking is the real draw, but having someone to root for in whom we can recognize our own hopes and fears, allows us to have a stake in their survival, if only as avatars for us.The plot is basically Dances With Wolves 2. ""Blue People Good, Everyone Else Bad."" There are very few exceptions to this rule, but not by more than a Navi handful.My recommendation? See this on the big screen, in 3D. It's not going to have the benefits of those on a home video console and the story isn't enough to make it worthwhile without.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The entire movie was set at a fast pace hoping to create a sense of urgency, but you don't really feel for the characters because there's so many of them to keep track of. Also, the entire point of the movie was that Jake would save his people and family, but obviously he would be followed wherever he went.

I would rate Black Panther: Wakanda forever 3 notches above Avatar 2 just for the incredible character arcs and performances. Avatar 2 lacks both. Speaking of Wakanda Forever, the oceans in Avatar 2 look like a video game! Why the hell is every organism bioluminescent?! Because that's the easiest way to make things look pretty. Not original at all. The dialogue delivery and background score is, well, so forgettable that I couldn't find any imdb review mentioning any of them.The story at the end of 192 mins of Avatar 2 seems like exactly the story we had before the first minute started - except that we have 5 kids now.

There is no nostalgia or emotion like the first, Jake and Netiryi have no connection, the old characters are a shadow of themselves from the first and the new characters are awful apart from Kiri, why Cameron felt the need to give Jake so many children I don't know, the plot at the start moves so quick you can't get a connection to any of them.Quartich is the biggest let down, he was immense as a villain in the original in way of the water he suffers from bad writing more than any other character.Ultimately it didnt feel like pandora at all.The CGI that Cameron claimed he'd been waiting for wasn't even that impressive the original was better if anything in terms of the ideas surrounding the visual effects.It's got some good action in it but compared to the standard of the original it's such a let down to any avatar fan especially if you are looking for nostalgia.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was forgettable, but I appreciated the world design and visual storytelling on display. It had a simple, generic plot that despite the length doesn't overstay its welcome.Way of Water is aptly bloated, with too many side characters and subplots, most of which aren't explored to an effective level.The film starts off incredibly disjointed, sacrificing what could have been a great reentry to Pandora for voiceover and montages of new developments since the previous film, before the villains descend upon the planet. The villains (some of whom are resurrected, stakes from the first film be damned I guess?) that have more ships, more mechs, and set up foundations far faster. Great.We then get a short time skip, with our insurgent protagonists fighting against the 'skypeople'. Ok, so we're back to square one, or two really. But why?Avatar was already a decent foundation for a great sequel (Terminator 1 is fine, but 2 shined from what 1 set up). Way of Water acts like it's setting up the main story, still. It's been 6 hours. This isn't a 90s sci-fi TV show, it's a film series. I don't want to watch 6 hours of generic plot to get to something interesting (which honestly, Avatar 3 very well might be).Fortunately there is some good to be found here. The visuals are stunning. This film quite simply has the best visual effects I've ever seen, and I expect it won't be topped until Avatar 3. The 48 frames per second worked really well (in IMAX 3D, not sure about 2D) and gave an incredible sense of fluidity to the underwater scenes.And changing to underwater was a great idea, we've seen the forests, what more does this planet have to offer? Well we find out a small part of it, and I assume there will be more biomes in the sequels.It did essentially feel like a documentary at points, with a decent amount of time spent just showing off nature and no dialogue. I didn't mind it. The only times I was brought out of my immersion tended to be when child or teenage characters spoke dialogue not befitting them. Sure, they're aliens, but it felt like young people being written poorly, not borne from a different way of life.The exception is the character of Kiri, which was perhaps the most interesting part of the film for me. Her connection to the planet's biological memory bank (the most interesting part of the first film) was fascinating, and a decent portion of time was given to her character.Spider though, a human boy who grew up in both worlds, was a confusing addition. His decisions were chosen from shallow motivations. His character could be really interesting, but just not enough is done with it.The water tribes were also underwhelming. Being from New Zealand, it was nice to see the influence of Maori culture, and Cliff Curtis is always a good addition to a film. But we don't see enough variety between the tribes, and their presence is weirdly forgotten about in one of the action sequences of the film.I suspect if there's an extended edition, there will be a scene or two to fill the gap.So, Way of Water was incredibly disappointing, especially considering Cameron's track record with sequels. Is it a bad film? No, the spectacle really does wonders for it and I don't regret going at all. It's also nice that there is heart to be found here; James Cameron really believes in this world and as a result it never feels soulless.But the whole package could have been so much better. A tighter focus on some of the ideas would have gone a long way. Less characters, and more subtlety would have been appreciated too. Does the writing staff really need to hit the audience over the head with their themes? Did we really need to do another three hour movie that seems to be interested in what comes next? Probably not.At the end of the day, a film this long should not feel rushed. Especially one that is guaranteed to have a substantial amount of money poured into it. I do hope they refine the script for the sequel, and hell maybe the extended cut will improve things here.But, I'm not anticipating much.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In any case, it was enjoyable and makes for the perfect family movie.

As we saw in fantasy movies such as 'Back to the Future' and 'The Matrix', so much novelty is spent in the first movie that invariably the second seems a bit dull in comparison. This latest 'Avatar' movie conforms to that template.The 2009 'Avatar' was set in 2154, so this one must be about 2165 or 2170, judging by the age of Jake Sully's kids. He has managed to make his life in this world far away now that the invaders are gone. But they return! They managed to re-make themselves with Pandorian DNA so they are blue and large and can breathe the Pandorian air.And that is what this movie is about, Jake and his family have to travel to a new place, to blend in with the water people, but are being relentlessly hunted down. Now one would think, 150 or so years in the future, they would have something better than guns, guns, and more guns. But no, most of the action involves relentless gun battles. Which for me takes away a lot of the potential enjoyment.The movie is long, at over 3 hours, and part of the reason are long scenes showcasing the beauty of the created worlds and the interesting land, air, and aquatic creatures. So, while the movie is a bit short on interesting story, it is long on fascinating beauty and absolutely astounding animation.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. A new feature I had never encountered before, you can select an audio that is more family-friendly, it cuts out the harsher dialog. In fact this should become standard, so many movies nowadays have such profanity in them, it would always be nice to select a more pleasant sound track.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

James Cameron expands the world of Pandora like no other franchise. It is by far the best CGI ever.The characters around Jake Sully and Neytiri feel organic and grounded, so you empathize with them at all times.But, the film's biggest weakness is its running time.Where Act 1 felt almost rushed, Act 2 drags a lot. The third act has a good pace, but struggles to reach its big climax.With many characters taking center stage, some characters' character development comes up short. As a result, some of the film's decisions fail to reach me emotionally.The story of the film is similar to the first. Quaritch's return, while plausibly explained, is also a bit lazy. The return of the humans itself is understandable and the conflict between them and the Navi continues to be exciting.The Way of Water is a worthy successor to the first film (which was much too hated anyway).So ... go to the cinema!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Which I don't like it. But visual effects are outstanding. You never seen this kind of visual effects. Story is just same, where Avatar 1 villain wants revenge from Jake Sully. And he targeted Jake childrens.It should have been more better if Sam Worthington role had bigger. But we can expect better things in Avatar 3.It is more child movies. But worth to watch for it visual effects and action.But definitely not the level of Avatar 1.Water scenes were awesome. Never seen this kind of under ocean scenes in non animated movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are countless ways to approach the subject of life, and everyone's experience of it is unique.One way to approach the topic of life is to consider the different stages of life and how they shape our experiences and perspectives. For example, childhood is a time of innocence, exploration, and learning, while adolescence is a time of transition and discovery. Adulthood brings new responsibilities and challenges, and old age can be a time of reflection and contemplation.Another aspect of life that can be explored in an essay is the concept of purpose or meaning. Many people spend their lives searching for a sense of purpose or meaning, whether it be through their work, relationships, or personal passions and interests.Another way to approach the topic of life is to consider the challenges and struggles that we all face at different points in our lives. These challenges can range from personal struggles such as illness or loss, to larger societal issues such as poverty or inequality.Ultimately, the subject of life is vast and complex, and there are countless ways to approach it in an essay. Whether you choose to focus on the different stages of life, the search for purpose or meaning, or the challenges and struggles that we all face, there is much to be learned and explored about this fundamental aspect of the human experience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first one was meant to bring some awareness about nature and love for our planet. This one is a sequel. Of course it'll be about the same topic. What did you expect?Some people also criticized that the Na'Vi spoke in English. Yes. That's what happened in the story. Colonizers came years prior the first movie's timeline, and taught them English. The (good) humans did it to comunicate and bond, and the Na'Vi learned it to defend themselves. I hate to break it to you, but a LOT of countries know more than one language, and it's a great thing. It only empowers you.I don't need to say that the visuals of this film are flawless, breathtaking and plain mesmerizing. The animation and CG are perfect. Don't let the haters turn you down, this film is great.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

And finally, after a decade of expanding the mythology of Pandora on paper & helping develop the technology needed to adapt his vision on screen, the King of Hollywood at long last makes his much-awaited return to his throne and instantly lets his presence felt & importance known to everyone by reminding all what a larger-than-life extravaganza should look & feel like.Avatar: The Way of Water is a worthy sequel that both improves upon the original and also feels slightly inferior to it. With there being a long gap between the two releases, Cameron opts for a plot that isn't just familiar but is also recycled & reworked into an epic family saga. Full of callbacks & references that reacquaints the viewers with what's happened before, this follow-up story still packs ample heart & enough substance to stand on its own and the cinematic wizardry on display is a strong reminder that the visionary filmmaker is still unrivalled when it comes to redefining big-screen experiences.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
