Sure it's probably the best (or second best) DC Justice league era, but that's not difficult.
Like all the other offerings, it's overblown, wooden, one dimensional and over reliant on over the top CGI.
As a child I was always a DC fan and I want them more than anything to bring this thing together, but Marvel have certainly laid down a tough marker for how it should be and DC still haven't met that challenge.
The main thing missing from the film is charm and simplicity, sure Momoa just about saves the day and I think he can develop Aquaman into a loved character, and the film is a step in the right direction. But 10 out of 10 it most certainly isn't.","1,634 out of 2,341 found this helpful.

That, however, doesn't mean that it has a great script. The truth is, DC played safe on this one, and it pays off, mostly.I was never bored throughout this movie, but that is not because of the clever dialogue, or the the amazing score. No, it's because everything in it is incredibly over-the-top. No kidding, be it the heroes or the villains, the action scenes or the romantic ones, every single thing in this movie is kind of exaggerated. Sometimes it worked for me, but sometimes it didn't. With that in mind, let's get to my pros and cons.First, what i liked the most: the direction, specially during the action scenes. James Wan managed to differentiate himself from that Snyder style of action pretty well (there's still one or two ""Snyder slowmo"" kind of shots, but that's it). The fight sequences were well choreographed and shot, with wide angles for most of the time. It was very pleasant to see. Now, I usually don't like when movies start looking like videogames, but it didn't really bother me here. During the gigantic CGI battlescenes you've seen in the trailers, the amount of elements on-screen can be overwhelming, but for the most part, they are well enough shot that you can differentiate what's going on, and so they eventually become quite satisfying.
The interaction between the two lead characters is too very entertaining, but then again, because Aquaman is just really extravagant most of the time, so it becomes this quirky, awkward chemestry. But that leads me into the cons.Yeah, remember when i said everything was exaggerated in here? Well, sometimes that leads to some really weird and unfitting, or just unintentionally funny scenes. For example (and I don't wanna spoil here), the movie will have this really awkward romantic song playing throughout this ""lovey dovey"" scene, but that just took me out of the film because it's so over-the-top and doesn't fit at all with the previously established tone of the film. It was weird. Not only that, but this certain character will constantly scream during battle scenes like he's a football commentator announcing a goal, like he's really badass when in reality it just comes off as ""just too much"". I won't lie, I started laughing after a while because he repeats it quite a few times during the movie. Most of these are nitpicks, but because this movie blows everything out of proportion, these small problems end up REALLY standing out.
Some bigger complaints are: characters having really flimsy convictions and changing them in the matter of seconds for weak motivations. The movie is also filled with cliches, but that's mostly because Aquaman follows the standard superhero movie formula. On top of that, i found some inconsistencies regarding character's abilities (like, it is established that inhabitants of Atlantis cannot breath outside of the water, but during certain moments they do it just fine).
The CGI is very inconsistent, from this gorgeous color filled underwater kingdom, to some pretty terrible green screen effects.
The dialogue, is mostly not very well written. Some characters don't suffer from it, including Aquaman, because it ends up fitting their personality, but some characters end up sounding really artificial.
The acting is fine. Willem Dafoe is Willem Dafoe, Jason Momoa is Jason Momoa. Temuera Morrison, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren all did fine with their respective characters. I think the worst ones are the villains, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen and specially Patrick Wilson (who's character is the embodiment of ""over-the-top""). Too bad, I don't consider him a bad actor, but goddamn was he subpar in this one.
I don't have major complaints wit the editing. It's pretty good, except once or twice where there's just too much going on on-screen and I couldn't follow it, but those were rare moments. However, the sound design has some odd choices. There's this scene where a certain character is handling a knife, and every time he gently touched it, the knife went ""KATCHING"" with that standard blade sound , but just extremely loudly and exaggerated. I just thought to myself ""what?"".Despite the fact that i nitpicked a lot, i think this movie works more than it doesn't. Yes, it's as a standard superhero movie as you can get, but it's a good one. Even with all of the odd choices and apparent problems, it's not a bad movie. The direction is quite good, some shots are fantastic and the fight sequences were very satisfying. It's pure, blown out of proportion, massive CGI fest fun, and I think that's enough for me. For an Aquaman movie, it does everything it should.","199 out of 360 found this helpful.

It is so all over the place and disconnected that it is not easy to follow at all. Both Amber and Mamoa are dull as dishwater, which many knew before this movie and sadly this does nothing to remedy that either.The movie is a mess, the story is a mess - and when you leave a movie thinking that the only enjoyable part was the CGI then there is something wrong.Clearly, this movie was made for the cash grab and WB once more PROVE what we have all known for a long time; They simply cannot create comic book movies.

I thought Amber Heard as Aquaman's love interest could have been better. Granted, she wasn't given a tonne to work with.Surprised to see Dolph Lundgren pop up a few times. Great to see Willem Dafoe, an actor I've always thought was great. Same goes for Australia's own Nicole Kidman. In the movie, her character is in love with the character played by New Zealand's Temeura Morrison, which is pretty cool, if you ask me.I'm pretty easy going and enjoy most everything I watch. Never get too high or too low on a film unless the film is thoroughly deserving of either.As far as comic book adaptation spectacles go, you won't find many better.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they're from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.This would've been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn't hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - ""Wow there was a surprise and now we're accidentally holding hands"", ""Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you "" - give me a break. And whoever put together the soundtrack for this film should be summarily executed.","194 out of 243 found this helpful.

"","","Everything But The Kitchen Sink","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4607878/?ref_=tt_urv","gogoschka-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15794099/?ref_=tt_urv","26 January 2019","Everything I saw, read and heard about 'Aquaman' before it came out had me convinced it wouldn't be my cup of tea. My impression was that this would be yet another bloated studio tentpole with cheesy dialog, a generic story and artificial looking CGI. However, once it opened, a passionate film fan I respect a lot started spreading so much obviously genuine enthusiasm for the movie that I eventually got over myself and watched it.I think it was the moment when Nicole Kidman swallowed a goldfish that I started to suspect I might actually enjoy this movie. That suspicion, however, turned out to be wrong, because I didn't just enjoy it: I ended up ADORING it. The weirdest thing: the film DID contain all those elements I had feared - and yet none of that seemed to matter. It just works. It shouldn't, but it somehow does, which is why I've since come to the conclusion that director James Wan is some sort of genius wizard filmmaker. Don't let the generic superhero tropes and cheesy dialog fool you into thinking this was a typical mainstream movie (though I DO suspect those things managed to fool the studio executives into thinking exactly that: which is probably how James Wan got away with it), because in truth, this is the least generic, most bonkers big budget studio flick I've seen in ages. It's the film 'Valerian' wants to be. It's crazy; it's over-the-top; it's beautifully designed with incredible attention to every little detail in every frame; it doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and yet it fully commits to - and loves - its characters and the world they inhabit.I was awed, literally awed by the design of the Atlantian society and technology; the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original - which caught me completely off guard, because I didn't expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses. When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as ""Aquabro"" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginable, I had a stupid grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn't let up. 'Aquaman' never loses steam; there's no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching 'LOTR: The Return of the King' for the first time.It's true, 'Aquaman' delivers the typical, clich√©d, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they're not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film's greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again, because I was so in love with its bonkers, ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink"" approach to filmmaking. Naturally, I now hope James Wan will also direct 'Aquaman 2', as I'm sure if given the chance, next time not even the kitchen sink will be safe.P.S. (for new IMDb users): In case you don't know whether to trust this review or not, because you have no idea what my tastes in film are, just click on my username - gogoschka-1 - and you'll see what my favorite movies are.","391 out of 630 found this helpful.

The movie is almost non-stop CGI, with little bits of story woven between. It covers the story of baby Aquaman, resulting from the union of a lighthouse keeper and a Queen of Atlantis. And him growing up and then being put on a mission to try to unite the ocean and land worlds under a King. One learns that there are a lot of trench creatures, and that there is a sea in the middle of Earth. With all that was spent on CGI, they really didn't have money left over for a script, so it is a rather generic movie about a hero. But it certainly is entertaining enough to enjoy. No need to think.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'll be honest, Jason Momoa is an OK actor, I've never really been a huge fan of his, but he was good (for the most part) in the movie. Patrick Wilson did a phenomenal job as the main antagonist and Willem Dafoe was as good as always. I will be seeing the sequel to this movie that is coming out in a few months because that's how solid this movie was. I will say one complaint that I have is that the CGI isn't the greatest but eh, I won't get deep into it because it was decent enough.

I am not a fan of how critics write their reviews because it doesn't apply to the general audience. So as a normal movie goer this is my review. Aquaman was a fun movie with a lot of upside to it. The way Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry is perfect. He has an attitude that no other superhero really has. He is witty, sarcastic, funny, but also has his sensitive side. I really enjoyed him as Aquaman, but as for the other actors, they were average. My one rip on this movie is the CGI. DC hasn't really produced a good movie with good CGI yet. And this movie, better than justice league when it comes to visual, still lacks the way a Marvel movie would. So as a fan, I noticed the CGI and acting wasn't very good and the dialogue was pretty poor. I also though adding Manta was just a waste of time and space in the movie. His character was a below average villain who besides his fathers death, didn't show a compelling story as a character. I did enjoy however how fun the movie was and how upbeat and also caresmatic it was. I think as a fan this movie is worth seeing because of it being a super hero movie who we haven't seen much of and how fun it is. I am giving this movie a 7.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

Everyone talks about the GCI in Aquaman,but what moves me most is its style ,so called ""old fashioned fun"" .Here I'll talk about this.(This review is translated from Chinese by google translater.And I'm the writer of it.)First of all, the story of Aquaman is classic enough (that is, the old-fashioned set of some people), which is the journey of superhero treasure hunt. In an interview with James wan in""WorldScreen""magazine, James said that this is a very classic narrative technique. The growth of Arthur is like the growth of heroes in Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas movies. When Wan was a child, he watched the works of these masters grow up and always wanted to make such a movie, so this retro style is intentional. The facts also prove that the classic story will not be outdated. However, we can also understand from another angle that Wan did not try to try the dark and deep story style, but from the direction of being good at commercial blockbusters. In short, even if you don't have interest in the retro story, the level of the plot is definitely qualified in the super-Hero movie.Second, it is the retro feel of the picture. On the one hand, many dazzling special effects brought us back to Avatar and the Lord of the Rings until the shock of the first Star Wars, and the imaginative and fascinating atmosphere of the underwater world is obviously a tribute to the classic fantasy sci-fi movies, like those of Star Wars. Just like classic fantasy operatic movie opens the window of imagination for us. On the other hand, James indicates that the film is expected to be like special effects movies in japan(like Ultraman and Godzilla in last century ). No wonder the friend who watched the movie with me shouted ""The clothes looks cheap"" when he first saw the soldiers of Atlantis. ..... I believe that it is not a problem to add more cool special effects to the soldiers, but James chose a very traditional approach , allowing the actors to fight in plastic armor and add to the film. A little bit of childlike beauty! Seeing this armor design is a little touched. We seem to be able to see james that realize the childhood special movie dreams,hiding behind the viewfinder and snickering.And......To be honest,I'm little worried about Aquaman2,which is said to have been planned by Warner bros because the first episode is too successful,but I don't believe James will direct it again(just like SAW and Fast&Furious,he did once and did the BEST)And I'm also worried about Birds of Prey because the director is too young ...looking DCU(or DCEU) movies is funny ,we must stand some boring films ,but sometimes DC gives us BIG surpriseüòò","467 out of 872 found this helpful.

It didn't work with Batman vs. Superman and it certainly didn't work with Suicide Squad, but they came much closer with Wonder Woman.What we have here is a movie which doesn't try to be grounded and gloomy like before, yet doesn't aim to be clever. Aquaman is proud of its corniness, with all the lame jokes, unexplained phenomena (do none of the underwater folks need gills?), and impressively epic deep sea battles. This last part is where the film soars. I have seen few movies with such a beautiful and grand scale of action that works in spite of its flaws. There are hordes of creative ocean monsters, ancient and colossal predators, Lovecraftian horrors, and jaw-dropping sceneries which make the boring, gray-scale landscape of Justice League almost forgivable.By no means is this a perfect movie. You can expect the usual plot holes and details that don't make much sense. There is little emotional connection due to pacing during dialogue that at times feels choppy and second-handed. The characters are fun and refreshing, but mostly predictable and, except for a couple, one-dimensional. The performances are good but nobody in the cast will be expecting nominations during awards season. I would point to both Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as having the most interesting chemistry simply because of their obviously clashing personalities. Nicole Kidman had some bright scenes with real life in them. Willem Dafoe seemed suppressed in his role. In general, most of the other characters were just ""okay"". One of the main villains (Manta), in all his high-tech glory, is afforded a brief half-assed origin story to make him more relatable.But in spite of this, Aquaman seeks to be FUN, and it does a much better job than any of DCEU's previous endeavors. The change in scenery is even more perplexing than the first half of Wonderwoman. There are so many intricately-designed creatures and characters that I'm shocked the film's budget wasn't significantly higher. Also importantly, Jason Momoa plays a hero who just doesn't really care about behaving like one, which works - at least until a certain very specific turning point in the film. After the first half-hour or so, we are shown scene after scene of gorgeous visuals and battles to rival the most ambitious Marvel projects. It is a comic book movie, after all.There are some not-so-subtle critiques on mankind's treatment of the environment, and though it's a good message, it doesn't strive to go much deeper than ""humans bad, but not all bad"". Don't see Aquaman to have your life changed, but if you want an ultra-fun time at the movies with some significant progress in setting, buy yourself a ticket.6.5/10","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Knowing more about Arthur/Aquaman and the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, while having him rise to be the king of Atlantis with lots of character development by the end of the film.Jason Momoa is cool and fun as Arthur/Aquaman; he was funny and cool in action scenes both underwater and on land. Once he gets the classic orange and green outfit Aquaman wore back in the day, he looks cool especially when he gets his mighty trident to be king. He seems like someone who does not know much about where he came from, but he tries to help people when he can.Amber Heard as Mera was not bad, but Mera's red hair looked like a wig sometimes. I like her ability to morph water and use it as a weapon, it is used in fun action scenes and the effects do look cool to watch. Mera and Arthur/Aquaman work well together, and they slowly start having a relationship with each other by the end of the movie. Plus, in certain action scenes I like it when Mera and Arthur fight together when going up against Atlantean soldiers.One of Aquaman's villains named Black Manta is in the movie, and he was cool to watch; I liked this big fight sequence between Aquaman and Black Manta, which was awesome to watch, but I wish he were used more in the movie or saved for the sequel. The actual villain is Ocean Master played by Patrick Wilson who was a good villain, wanting to rule Atlantis and saying Arthur cannot because he is half Atlantean and half human. The fight between Aquaman and Ocean Master was fun to watch in the third act climax.The look of Atlantis was pretty, and it had a lot of convincing effects; the sea creatures like sharks or any kind of fish looked convincing, and they are all in a big war, it is very entertaining to watch even if it is dumb. The action scenes have great cinematography being quick with no cuts and zoom ins and outs, especially in a great chase scene in Italy that was incredibly fun to watch. Aquaman (2018) was a fun DC movie that I do recommend watching whenever you have the chance, because it does something different than most DC movies.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

* Surprisingly good cinematography.
* Good directing.
* Fight scenes look bit too choreographed.
* Story is nothing new - Its a rip off from several movies.
* CGI everywhere. (but at least this time its understandable why.)
* I don't know if it was the theater I watched this, but the music was bit too loud compared to the dialogue.As far as DCEU movies goes, this is slightly below Wonder Woman for me.

The DC has step up their game - this is another level. Never had I expected this movie will this be good, after the Justice League and Batman V Superman because those movies are trash - and let's forget about those. This is the most ambitious comic-book movie I've ever seen so far. Finally a movie that DC fanboy deserves, this film is just beautiful within the cinematography, visuals, also the action scenes. The action scenes kinda remind me of Romanticism painting, it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I'm not a fan of James Wan movies but he did a marvelous job for Aquaman. The cast are outstanding, badass performances. I don't think any actors can take the role of Aquaman better than Jason Momoa. The atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has high-quality than any DCEU film. Finally we can see the light after those dark days. It has clear motivations for both heroes and villains, pretty solid.But, DCEU really need to fix their poor lines. The writing isn't the best - some dialogues are still cheesy & awkward. Nothing new for the plot, but it is simply enough - almost the same with any superhero film - save the world, family issues, etc. But it has a great message about polluting the water. Also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss. And I don't see how and why Black Manta is the best villains, his story kinda flat and lacking for me. Black Manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villain.Afterall, this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans. Also you have to watch it in an IMAX 3D. Worth it.","317 out of 599 found this helpful.

After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule.
But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end.
Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face.
WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work. It just looks like a parody and not a well done one.","1,612 out of 2,431 found this helpful.

Aquaman does not fall into this category. The film first appeared in China. Then the comments about the movie excited me. I was looking forward to it. It was a movie I really liked.The story of the film is a complete story of origin. We see how a character emerged and how he was a hero. We see what Arthur Curry has been going through since his birth. I mean, you can follow the course of the story very easily and there is no scene you will be surprised. From time to time clich√©s and boring moments can be experienced. When you think it's a story of beginnings, the cliches don't bother you much. I think this is a must for superhero films.While watching Aquaman, you feel a lot more of Wan's touch to the film. Aquaman literally makes you feel like a ""movie"". Because while watching the film, you can see the introduction, development and the result line in a very comfortable way. Everything is as it should be. The characters perform their duties more than enough. In the first 20 minutes, you already feel inside the film, and your attachment instinct confirms this. The origin of Aquaman is generally preserved. There are some minor changes to the film. At the same time, there are critical changes in the Black Manta and Orm. But if you are a comic book reader in general, Arthur Curry's story will give you pleasure. The film also touches on a beautiful subject; People pollute the oceans and nature. Jason Momoa had a successful performance. In particular, he has reflected the character change very well. Willem Dafoe is an actor that everyone will enjoy watching. Willem Dafoe had to have more scenes.The film has technical errors, logic errors, clich√©s. But in spite of all this, the good aspects are much more. James Wan really created a separate world for the film. The underwater scenes were very good. The visuality is tremendous. Sea creatures, underwater conversations, used camera angles, location preferences, costume designs, fighting scenes, visual effects were very good. The music was just as good as the visuals. Even a separate film for Atlantis can be shot. 8/10","326 out of 617 found this helpful.

They're so easy to spot, but I guess it helps to balance things out from the trolls who love to give good films a one rating.Quick review, the first half was a bit sluggish. With a super hero film who either need a bunch of super heroes which helps to move things around or you need a good number of scene changes to keep the audiences interest. Mortal Engines did a very good of moving from one scene to another, introducing new things into the mix. It did mostly fail on the story. So the first half of Aquaman was a bit weak because it didn't move well. The 2nd half did a much better job moving things around the world and introducing new scenery, above the ground, below the ground and beneath the sea. The visuals were absolutely amazing! I thought the score was a bit weak. Some of the songs were thrown into a scene and then crawled away. Felt a bit off. There were some good laughs along the way and as we find out to along the way the creatures that live beneath the sea are a lot more complicated than we might've believed. I found the scene in Italy to be the best over the seas. I thought the development of Mantra was weak and certain parts of that story were a bit confusing. Overall a very entertaining film, in the end.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Even after 5 years since it's release, Aquaman is still Entertaining as it was in 2018. Kudos to Director James Wan and the rest of the crew for making a spectacular film.First of all, Thanks to Costume Designer Kym Barrett for nailing it with Aquaman's Suit. The Orange/Green suit looks so authentic and comic accurate, yet doesn't look ridiculous in any angle or shot. Always wondered how this traditional Aquaman suit could be brought to Live Action without looking like a Cosplayer and Designer Kym has proved otherwise. Not just for Aquaman, even the costumes for Orm, Mera & rest of crew are top notch. The atlantean army suits are so stylish and authentic looking.Casting is upto the point. Jason Momoa owns Aquaman. Hope the new DC management doesn't replace him. Amber Heard as Mera and Patrick Wilson as Orm did a commendable performance.Cinematographer Don Burgess, Production Designer Bill Brzeski and of course the Director of the film James Wan have created a visually spectacular underwater world. I could just simply keep looking at all the underwater shots again and again. I wish they show more of Atlantis and its people in the sequel. The Action scenes (both above and below sea level) are top notch. The stunts are good but the way they have been Captured by Don Burgess is awesome. The overall look of the film is even more enhanced by the electrifying music of Rupert Gregson Williams.The only drawback is the screenplay. It follows a typical Hero's Journey in a Three act Structure. The screenplay is coherent and adequate yet predictable. The dialogues are bit cheesy and mediocre. There's nothing new or extraordinary here.Overall, Aquaman is a visual spectacle with a stellar crew and adequate screenplay.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

The dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible. Silly can be entertaining, but it can also just feel stupid. The female characters only seem to exist to be Aquaman's conscience (because he can't think for himself, as he's boring), they have no flaws or vices (in other words no depth). The villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger, with a few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective. The good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals. It is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed, a literal riot of colour across the screen. I would also say that action is pretty positive, the combat is intense and epic. Overral though, I wouldn't reccomend","898 out of 1,431 found this helpful.

I've just watched this movie for the first time and straight away saw in it a pair of separate anachronisms which might affect how we might look at the film if it was being made right now.Firstly, it commences with the prologue sequence where our hero first crosses tridents with the man who was to become Black Manta but this while rescuing a Russian nuclear submarine. Now, post Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, you might be forgiven for having Aquaman leaving them to their fate.Later, the actress Amber Heard, in the prominent part of Mera, who I confess I didn't know beforehand, has of course now gained worldwide fame after her very public lawsuit against her ex-husband Johnny Depp.Anyway, let's go back to 2018 as if these things never happened and consider this film on its own merits. I was a big DC comics fan as a child although Aquaman wasn't the best-known hero or heroine of their roster. I remember his own original magazine folding in the early 1970's although he continued to be a member of the Justice League and later got his own solo book title back, but long after I had stopped my comic reading.So the question is, could this lesser character sustain a whole movie and do so successfully in the marketplace...? Well, as we now know, the answer was a definite yes and a sequel is due in the not too distant future.Actually, I've just recently visited and enjoyed our local town's ""Sea Life"" aquatic museum and can also recall a Vegas visit where there's an ananimatronic depiction of the fall of Atlantis, both of which possibly influenced my watching of this feature. Certainly the C-Gen visuals are stunning, bringing to life the denizens of the deep in all their varied glory and I also liked Jason Mimoa and Heard as Aquaman and his future wife Mera. As ever, in big budget features like this there's easy money to be made for past marquee-name actors in supporting roles and here Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe cash-in with pretty much phoned-in performances as Aquaman's disappeared mother and the boy's mentor / guardian respectively.Sure, it's pretty much a non-stop SFX-fest, but I was on-board for that from the start, even if several of the fight or battle sequences sometimes looked second or even third-hand. It was however a little odd to see what amounted to almost a promotional film for the Sicilian tourist board inserted into the action before the kick-ass action really took off. Story-wise I stopped early-on ticking off the references to Arthurian crossed with mythical legends and all the things I thought I'd seen before in other fantasy and / or action films, from ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", to anything ""Star Wars"" and ""Harry Potter"".I did enjoy the injections of humour and was happy to follow this particular story arc even if the ecological message was promoted, as I expected, a little too much for my taste.Mimoa is certainly god or at least king-like in the title part and I was pleased to see him finally donning the familiar gold and green colours of the original comic-book character, at least for the climax.Yes, much of the storytellng is formulaic and embellished but I was buoyed enough by the visuals and fighting sequences, loud and long as they sometimes seemed, to compensate for things like character depth or story development. It is a comic-book adaptation, after all.Chances are that I will be on board when the sequel is released.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

But growing up and loving those superheroes I always give those films a go. There were things that worked and didn't work for Aquaman. Sadly more things didn't work. The CGI and fight scenes were often over the top. The biggest issue for me was 'buying into' this universe. If you look at Guardians of the Galaxy we easily bought into into that crazy space journey with funny looking creatures. Aquaman in that respect is more believable but sadly it comes across as far fetched and you're not really immersed or taken on a journey.One positive is the somewhat decent plot. On one side there is a human rivalry and the other is an oceanic empire wanting to strike back at humans. Jason Momoa does what he can with the script but its not enough to carry the film. It tries to pull off too much of the unbelievable and passable. This is not a terrible film but its not memorable. Let's just say if viewers saw it showing on TV years from now they would probably keep flicking channels compared to tuning in for a few minutes. It's passable and not the win that DC so desperately needs to respond to the huge success and formula used by Marvel.

I was one of those who believed Aquaman wouldn't be anything special, and even though it earned over a billion dollar pandering to a select demographic I wasn't wrong.For every step this movie takes in the right direction, it rewards itself a flaw that in the end brings it back to where it started. Let's start with the story, it is surprisingly an almost faithful adaptation of the ""Throne of the Atlantis"" without any of the Justice league; and if you watched the Snyder-Whedon travesty you'll know it's a good thing. A linear but enjoyable storytelling that isn't convoluted with exposition heavy dialogues nor peppered with the 90's laugh track. Being a fairly simple plot it enjoys the freedom of incorporating elementary gimmicks that is enjoyable for the whole family but wouldn't necessarily leave a bad taste for movie purists either. And as a result Aquaman doesn't shy away from taking a hearty approach to make the titular character more relatable and lovable. Aquaman ironically worked best when it pandered to the 12 year olds and played its strong suit of heart, emotion and family.As simple as the storytelling and plot is, the script is indifferent. I would have a hard time believing this wasn't actually written by a 12 year old. You hear a line and if you can't immediately guess the comeback you really haven't been seeing movies much lately. The script has to be one of the most generic stacks of line ever put together in a billion dollar movie.The jokes are minimal and are not bombarded after every 10 seconds, which doesn't make the J-bombs decent though. Most of the time they're not even funny but you'll still crack a smile a few times because your inner 12 year old is still alive inside you. One thing I have to appreciate is how they don't ruin heartfelt emotional scenes with a joke, which has become quite the CBM tradition nowadays.I'm not entirely delighted with the cinematography; it's pretty rough around the edges and really hard to believe this was by James Wan. This is a type of movie that could've been made by literally any director and if you didn't know who it is by, you never could've guessed it. Everything about this movie lacks originality and you can't help but feel it quite often. There are some undoubtedly cool shots here and there like the trench diving scene or waterfall scene but those are too few and far between. The awkward camera pans made it feel like a Hindi TV serial at times. Hugely disappointed that James Wan allowed all these bloated mess of a camera work in the final edit.The score was nonexistent, aside from the Toto remix by Pitbull I can't seem to remember any sound even slightly resembling a theme or tone. CBM's really needs a decent score to pump up the juices, which Aquaman offered none. The pacing as I mentioned earlier is actually quite satisfying, which doesn't drag on and overstay its welcome in the slightest.This is the part where the aforementioned ""one step forward- one step back"" quote comes to play. The costume design for Aquaman, Orm and Manta were absolutely impeccable. Emphasis on the word impeccable as I never could've conceived that they could make the corny looking orange outfit so badass on screen, the prop obviously goes to Jason for pulling it off but I'll come to him in a bit. Mera also had her comic accurate leotard on and not gonna lie looked really well on Amber Heard. But for every good costume design there are also few horrendous ones. The white Atlantean suit looked beyond ridiculous and cheap. It reminded me of those henchmen in the old Power Rangers series, and not in a good way. The terrible wig of Nicole Kidman was too bad to ignore, Amber wore her wig better although it's just the longer end of the same straw.The CGI in this movie was painfully inconsistent; some amazing underwater scene gets totally overshadowed by a stack of utter disgraceful CGI work. I am sure the slow-mo Mera jumping off buildings during the Black Manta chase sequence is a perfect example how rough the edges really were. On the contrary the visuals were actually quite delightful and the backgrounds selected pleasant. The sea creatures looked as good as how bad the CGI looked. The trench creatures played in accordance with James's horror root and looked pretty good.Some of the biggest surprises I got from the movie were actually due to the acting. You got more renowned actors like Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Amber Heard and on the other side relative lesser known creds like Dolph Lungdren (not exactly lesser known, but stereotyped), Jason Momoa, and Yahya Mateen. And guess which side did a better job! I always believed Jason Momoa cannot carry a whole movie himself, and he brutally proved me wrong. He practically carried the whole movie for me. If Aquaman was someone other than Momoa I don't think the rating would've been what I gave, it could've easily been far less. He pumped the charisma up to eleven and even managed to rock that goofy orange outfit like a total badass. Honestly though, most of the points I gave are because of Manta, Orm and Momoa.As for the villains, lets just get it out the way: Aquaman had the best villain adaptations so far in DCEU. Manta was exactly how I know him to be, down to his iconic outfit in a proper adaptation. Although he was fairly underutilized and sidelined I can't wait to see him pop back up in the sequels. Yahya did some sweetass work properly portraying Black Manta and deserves more praise.Patrick Wilson is silently becoming a household name each year and his role in Aquaman cements his case. He naturally blended in with the character like no ones business, and actually added subtle nuances. Orm looked, behaved and sounded just perfect, where he easily could've been a Luther, an Ares or even a *Honka Honka*. Props to the costume design team for the faithful recreation of the iconic facemask and cowl and finally doing justice to the rogues of DC universe. I am also kinda glad he wasn't made out to be a power-hungry one dimensional stereotype (even though he was sort of) right in his first outing.Now for the terrible acting, Dafoe wins it by a mile with his most horrendous acting ever, really hurts seeing such a talented actor just be there to cash in. Nicole kidman was a step up but nothing extraordinary. You can blame the script she was given and I'd agree with you. Mera on the other hand was definitely the better among the trio having more screen time and a better script to work on, but as I said, nothing that speaks volume.For a superhero movie Aquaman doesn't have many fights to showcase. I didn't like any DCEU action sequence other than the warehouse scene in BVS and maybe it's just me but overall it was below subpar. The first Orm Vs Momoa was bland and contained no gravity and the stakes felt artificial. The final encounter was better in every way which unfortunately was abrupt. So aside from the Manta fights there is absolutely nothing that Aquaman offers that begs a rewatch.For all the highs and lows Aquaman was quite enjoyable to me; more than I thought was possible. It had a good heart and was brimming with a weird innocence that I appreciate. I can't stop thinking how better this movie could've been if they paid more attention to the little stuffs. But I can say for sure this was a onetime movie and really has no merit to secure a second watch. But hey lucky for them, it worked out just fine.RATING: 6.5/10","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

For every 'Wonder Woman' there's a 'Batman vs. Superman' or 'Justice League.' Thankfully for fans of these superheroes, James Wan's 'Aquaman' is closer to the former than the latter, at least in terms of entertainment value.While 'Aquaman' is pretty much billed as the Jason Momoa show, the cast actually does an excellent job sharing the limelight, even in the face of typically wooden dialogue. Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman do their very best as royalty from the sea, while Patrick Wilson surprises as scorned Atlantean brother King Orm - a role very different from those he is known for. Not to mention Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren, and a kraken voiced by none other than...Julie Andrews? As for villains, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II takes on the role of modern-day pirate Manta, whose suit looks like it would be a better fit in a Power Rangers movie.But the cast is not the main attraction here - it's the visuals. It's hard to imagine 'Aquaman' being filmed a decade ago when Vince Chase made it the biggest blockbuster in history on 'Entourage.' The level of preciseness required to make the underwater worlds of Atlantis and others come to life without coming off looking cheap is not to be taken for granted. There is such detail included to ensure these scenes are believable that in some instances it comes off as Pandora-like. This alone makes seeing the film on the big screen worth the price of admission.As for the plot, it's your standard comic book fare, with the hero story lifted from numerous films that have come before 'Aquaman.' In this case, the execution actually makes up for the poor storyline and scripting. The soundtrack and score are also above average for a DC Universe film, with the only exception being a ridiculous interruption from a Pitbull song that samples 'Africa' (but why?).'Aquaman' may not come anywhere close to 'The Dark Knight' series, or even hold a candle to some of the better quality Marvel efforts, but it surely is an entertaining ride that should be enjoyed for what it is.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

But it is also how Wan has executed this story in a appealing manner and has elevated the story-telling of superhero movies. It has a Racy screen play and great character development ( since we saw only a little of the characters in JL).Jason and Heard are perfect in their roles and Kidman has done justice to her role... not forgetting u Dafoe !

The music is blended well with the sequences.
Some scenes get cheesy but overall it is a great load of fun!

"7","/10","An imperfect but wildly enjoyable ride","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4531242/?ref_=tt_urv","BatMatticamus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49514126/?ref_=tt_urv","24 December 2018","What's it about?The latest attempt by DC to right the course of their up-and-down cinematic universe, Aquaman, directed by big-name horror director James Wan (Saw, Furious 7), tells the story of the titular character (played by Jason Momoa), mostly referred to by his human name-Arthur Curry-as he reluctantly begins to accept his destiny as the heir to the throne of Atlantis. Amber Heard co-stars as Mera, an undersea princess trying to guide Curry, while Patrick Wilson plays Orm, the main villain, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Black Manta in a secondary villain role. Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren also play smaller but important roles, and Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman round out the list of stars as Curry's human father and Atlantean mother respectively.What works?Given that much of the action takes place in Atlantis and other varied undersea kingdoms, the visuals were where this movie was going to live or die. Fortunately, this is an absolutely spectacular movie to look at-there's hardly any cracks in a really impressive CGI fa√ßade, and the use of color and other visual elements to build an engaging, real-feeling setting is equally impressive. In short, this movie is game-changing in the scope and effectiveness of its visuals; for me, someone who's never read an Aquaman comic, who's never really thought about what Atlantis should look like, this was a wholly convincing depiction of the undersea world. Even the character movements, gliding and hovering through the water, felt mostly natural, and the dialogue was given just a hint of the normal distortion you'd hear underwater.While the visuals were necessary to make this movie work, there's more to making a good movie than just pretty imagery (most of the time). Especially with a superhero action movie, something trying to connect with a very wide viewer base, the movie has to check a few more boxes. Fortunately, it also does a pretty good job with its characters, especially Aquaman himself. The character is written in a slightly unusual way-he's not a classic Superman-type, saving the world because it's the right thing to do, but neither is he a broody anti-hero type. He's free-spirited and energetic but likes to maintain a lower profile in the surface world; he's goofy but motivated and confident. This, of course, makes it the perfect role for Jason Momoa, who plays the role with a perfect sort of cocky charm (he also spends a decent chunk of the movie shirtless, and he's a hunky man). He's also allowed to be a funny character, mostly played as a loose-cannon fish-out-of-water (groundhog-off-the-earth?) relative to the rigidly hierarchical, traditional, rule-bound undersea peoples. It's a line of humor that could easily grow tiresome, but one which is used sparingly and therefore effectively. It's also worth pointing out that the undersea world doesn't come off as too stilted or outdated-it gets some satisfying chances to push back on his behavior in places, which also happens to allow for some solid character development moments as Aquaman tries to learn his place as someone with powerful ties to both the undersea and surface worlds.The other characters are also mostly at least solid. Amber Heard's Mera is probably the next most important of the heroes. She plays the role well, but it's an unfortunate inevitability that a good chunk of her dialogue is just exposition, given that her role, especially in the first half, is explaining the rules of the undersea kingdoms to Aquaman. But in the latter half of the movie she gets a couple moments to shine, moments which she takes full advantage of. Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman are good in their own ways as Aquaman's parents. One standout is Willem Dafoe's Vulko, an advisor to the Atlantean throne and former mentor to the young Aquaman. His character has some interesting moments and good twists along the way.But as is the case with most superhero movies, the true test of its quality is going to be the villain(s). I was worried going in that Patrick Wilson would not be a good choice for Orm, the primary villain, but he is intensely compelling both as politician and warrior, bringing a quiet ferocity in his dialogue-heavy scenes but a vicious confidence in his action ones, building a very strong primary villain, and one who even gets some good character moments. Plus, he looks great in the full Ocean Master armor, once he breaks that out.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is also solid as iconic Aquaman villain Black Manta, though it sometimes feels like his character isn't necessary. He has a commanding screen presence, especially in the excellent opening sequence, but when he's allowed to function as a true villain, he often comes off a bit monologuey and underwritten, though a powerful enemy. He really shines, though, when he's allowed to take off the helmet and do some real acting, giving the character more depth and weight than it needed. I'm also really glad the decision-makers behind the movie were willing to eventually go all-in on the big, comic-accurate Black Manta helmet.The plot is mostly just adequate and generic, but it hits several of its emotional beats with resounding force. The ending is of particular note-without giving anything away, it takes a clich√© framework and plays it really effectively before breaking it off in an unexpected manner, one that leaves the viewer startled by some unusual but effective emotional questions.One last crucial selling point for any superhero movie is going to be the action. Here, again, Aquaman shines. The massive-scale undersea battles are impressively constructed, being sure to maintain some semblance of tactical order while keeping a character-focused perspective, but the CGI overload does tend to wear by the end. The real selling point, however, is the close-quarters combat. Even the opening's expositional setup has a beautiful long-take fight sequence, and it only gets better from there. The fighting is often done with tridents, and the choreography and execution is superb, fast-paced but feeling realistic and visceral, and it always utilizes superb camerawork. James Wan is a director who likes to play with his toys, and the sheer joy of creating some of these sequences is beautifully evident on-screen. Even the slow motion is handled with both care and obvious excitement, showing off some great moments while never becoming quite gratuitous.The music also deserves a mention. Rupert Gregson-Williams, who also scored Wonder Woman, is in solid form here. Several moments in the score are notably strong, and there are no obvious missteps. He might not be ready to supplant John Williams or Hans Zimmer quite yet, but he's definitely deserving of more attention and work.What doesn't work?As I mentioned a few paragraphs before, the plot is mostly just generic fare: find the magic item, beat the bad guy, become the chosen one you were always meant to be. Part of the problem is that this is a movie that had to do a lot of things-develop its main character, establish a massive and complex world, introduce and develop two villains, and give their villainous plots enough weight to feel like a threat to the hero. With all that going on, it's no wonder that the core plot was going to be a little simple. It's not quite Justice League-levels of simplisticity, but it probably is ultimately more of a weakness than a strength, even if it was an inevitability given the volume of other details and characters and subplots surrounding the main narrative.Another problem with a movie trying to do as much as Aquaman is that there is bound to be some tonal inconsistency. The main chunk of the movie feels like an amalgamation of a mainstream superhero movie, a Lord of the Rings-style fantasy epic with Game of Thrones-style fantasy politics, while also bringing sci-fi action and worldbuilding of the sort we should have gotten from the Star Wars prequels. That core combination, though, works surprisingly well. It's when the movie starts dropping in scenes reminiscent of Indiana Jones or Journey to the Center of the Earth that things start to feel like too much, or when it takes a brief detour into otherwise-effective moments straight out of the rom-com or horror genres. Each of the bits, taken on its own, works at least fairly well (especially the horror bit), but there are some inevitable jarring tonal shifts.With any movie of this scale and ambition, there are inevitably going to be at least a couple weak points in the visual effects. While, again, the effects are almost uniformly astounding, there are one or two odd points-an unsatisfying movement here or there, a giant CGI monster that doesn't feel entirely present. An early scene in an aquarium has some uncanny-looking sharks. But really, that's it, and that's just nitpicking.But is it any good?It is! It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it does a fair job with most things, and it does a couple of the big things-visuals, action, main character-exceptionally well. Even the problems are mostly inevitable byproducts of bold, exciting decisions elsewhere in the film that end up mostly outweighing the costs of the unintended consequences. On the whole it's probably not quite on par with Wonder Woman (though there might be an argument in that direction), but it's definitely in the same ballpark-another clear winner for DC and a definite step forward for a universe that finally seems to be finding its feet.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

It is not an easy feat to make a film where half of the action takes place underwater, but here Aquaman excels. Gorgeous visuals, incredible underwater battle sequences, and well-choreographed fights make this film impossible to look away from.That said, the plot is fairly basic. Reluctant hero, doomed mentor, unexpected love interest, bad guy who wants to take over the world, etc. Aquaman is surprisingly likable, much different from his closed-off Justice League persona, but he's not particularly clever. He kind of just goes with the flow, punching bad guys as he goes. There are various attempts at injecting humor into the script, but its not very smart - especially compared with the witty comic brilliance of the recent Deadpool, Guardians and Ant-Man films.One aspect of the film that was done surprisingly well was Black Manta's origin story. Not that he has much competition, but he's the best DCEU villain we've met thus far.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Aquaman has a ridiculously complicated script, is too long and full of plot holes. The film is, at times, visually derivative ripping off various better films like Thor Ragnarok, The Hobbit and The Matrix and is highly predictable. The CGI is also ridiculously over the top in places. Don't watch this if you are expecting anything original.Now the plus side, Jason Momoa is a piece of inspired casting, he has the look and charisma of the 'halfbreed' Atlantean. Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman give their characters some real gravitas and Dolph Lundgren is a natural fit for his role. The dialogue is occasionally clunky but having established actors like these deliver them does help make it not so obvious.I hope we see more of Jason Momoa in the role. He has a charm and lightness of touch that is welcome, much like Chris Hemsworth's Thor. I'd like to see more witty one liners as he delivers the few he has very well.Not a perfect film and Wonder Woman is still the DC high spot in terms of recent films but Aquaman delivers action and character even if there is still room for improvement. If there is to be a sequel I hope DC will improve on this decent first effort.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I thought Aquaman was just going to be terrible and unnecessary in a universe that seemed to be in disarray. I was kind of warming up to it with the new trailers released and the fact that a competent filmmaker in James Wan. I think this is an fairly entertaining entry in the DC Universe and definitely the second best film after Wonder Woman.The film follows the story of Arthur Curry, who is an heir to an underwater kingdom that his half brother is trying to take control of. The film goes into the details of Curry's past and shows how Aquaman eventually became the hero he is today. In this film Aquaman must find a powerful trident and stop a war that threatens his people and all of Earth. The film stars Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, and Patrick Wilson.Wan reunites with a reliable name in Wilson who plays Ocean Master. Both him and Black Manta feel like generic villains as is the case with a lot of superhero films, its also tough to establish a villain with the general unfamiliarity with the Aquaman comics for the general masses. You can tell the film has a big budget as it is exquisite in its underworld fantastical elements and all the action and effects that go along with it.The film isn't anything groundbreaking when it comes to superhero films and its quite cheesy in dialogue and comedic nature. It still works for the most part and is a refreshing change in light, tone, and color in this universe. Its not exactly a huge endorsement as to why the DCEU should continue to exist, but it shows that under the right guidance it can work better than most previously anticipated.7/10","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

But boy if it doesnt put a smile on your face then you probably shouldnt be going to a CGI laden superhero film. James Wan embraces the lunacy of the subject matter and delivers. The dialogue is truly what brings down the movie but Jason Mamoa doesnt let the poor script stop him from oozing charisma. While his chemtestry with costar Amber Heard doesnt fire on all cylinders it is still fun to watch everytime they share the screen together. For all the CGI, and there is a ton of it, the only time it's hard to watch is during the final battle. Other than that we get some of the best the industry has to offer. Most of the cast is working below their talents to be sure but they seem to be having fun and deliver convincing performances.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

Well, I wasn't wrong about that one. I still think his visuals are the best in DCEU but this movie had lots of moments too, those wide angle and tracking shots were a treat. The cinematography was really satisfying, so thank you to Don Burgess and James Wan for that. Underwater CGI scenes were breathtakingly beautiful to look at. Set-pieces makes you forget about the world you live in. Not on the same level as LOTR or Indiana Jones or Star Wars but It's close, and I think that's a pretty tough thing to accomplish. Dialogues were cringy now and then but, unfortunately, that's what makes a super-hero movie ''good'' nowadays, and this probably will continue for the next 10 years. Too bad the days where Nolan's TDK Trilogy gave you goosebumps with just words are gone. Now it's just you have to act weird and say something out of place to create a chemistry between the characters. I can't even believe how people buy these kinds of contrived relationships anymore. Anyways, let me say this, the movie isn't something like Thor (2011) It doesn't make you feel like you're on a movie set. It actually has high-quality different places that set the movie's atmosphere perfectly. If you guys worried about if the movie is just a copycat of MCU film, you can relax. The only similarity between this movie and MCU movies is 9 unfunny and awkward moment. The movie actually harbors multiple layers. Antagonists are actually valued, they're not just background actors or extra performers, they actually have moments to shine. This isn't something like Ant-Man. It doesn't have a stereotype, clich√©, and generic film elements that created for the lowest common denominator. It actually has innovations for its genre. This isn't something like Black Panther, It doesn't have PS2 battle scenes. The CGI is actually well-crafted. This isn't something like Captain America: Civil War or most of the MCU films out there, it doesn't have a dim or bland color grading. The movie actually looks lively and vibrant. This isn't something like Guardians of the Galaxy, the characters don't act irrational or illogical, they actually have good reasons because they have developments. This isn't something like Ant-Man and The Wasp, It's not just a filler movie. It actually has a worth-seeing climax. This isn't something like Wonder Woman, It doesn't fail or fall flat in the third act. It actually fulfills its mission at every level. This isn't something like Avengers: Age of Ultron or any other MCU movie. The tone isn't out of place. The movie doesn't have a recurring and predictable theme. The camera isn't too shaky or it doesn't change in every second when an action scene comes up. The villains don't act out of character when they're in a situation. This isn't another Justice League, it isn't trying to be something else. It actually knows its place. But still, nothing can save this universe, not even something as good as The Dark Knight. But as a standalone, this is something worth seeing in the theaters.PS. It's not better than what MCU offered us for 9 years","492 out of 1,501 found this helpful.

I mean, yeah, Black Panther was mostly Lion King, but it was interesting and fun and the world building was not bad. Aquaman feels cartoonish from the start to the very end. The pointless CGI, Heard's horrible wig, all the fairy tale characters that seek to show us how they are superior to people on the surface who have grown up reading about single dimensional characters like them, the predictability that one can find in children stories only. To be honest, the feeling I have most about this film is outrage. It is condescending and dumb. It's the Hollywood version of Homer telling Bart he's stupid.And then there is the cast. Jason Momoa, who I liked in Atlantis, the Stargate one, because he was supposed to have only one dimension. Amber Heard, who hasn't had a good role in ages and sporting that eye soar of a bad wig, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe getting their paychecks. And Dolph Ludgren? WTF? The main character of this story was Patrick Wilson's, he had the most relevant scenes, he was the only one who actually looked like he gave a damn about his performance. He is the true king of the film!Bottom line, it was so dumb it was offensive.","49 out of 72 found this helpful.

When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as ""Aquabro"" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginableI had a grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn't let up. 'Aquaman' never loses steam; there's no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching 'LOTR: The Return of the King' for the first time.It's true, 'Aquaman' delivers the typical, clich√©d, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they're not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film's greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again7 out of 10","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

That's not saying much, because none of them are generally very good, although Henry Cavill can do know wrong.DC tend to do a lot of reluctant hero storylines these days, with most of them trying to avoid the great responsibility that comes with great power, whereas the Marvel characters all seem to want to save the world or to prove themselves. I will always prefer the Marvel films I think, but this was a good origin story, which was light, fun and entertaining. I didn't feel a want to turn it off as I did with 'Justice League' (2017) or 'Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice' (2016), so that was definitely a plus.Khal Drogo (Game Of Thrones) learned to speak English and swim, but he was still very much the same sort of character and as much as he had that wicked smile and I would probably adore Momo as a potential boyfriend, Jason just didn't have the diversity to separate him from his other roles, in my opinion.In this film he was like an even dumber, beer swilling 'Thor' and he found himself a badass woman with an attitude just like 'Black Widow'. I didn't know if that was how the characters had been delivered in the Aquaman comics, but it felt a little bit like it had already been done in cinema more than a few times.I also had to wonder which barrel they had scraped most of the other actors from? A lot of them weren't particularly good at all, regardless of the size of their part (teehee) and some of the smaller roles were basically amateur. Even Nicole Kidman was a bit off, so maybe it was the director that couldn't get the best from them all? However, it was definitely Dolph Lundgren's best performance. Patrick Wilson, was more than a bit corny though and I also found Willem Dafoe's good guy hard to get.The CGI was very good and I felt that the film as a whole, had a nice quality to it and a definite comic book vibe. One that even some of Marvel's latest efforts have lacked.It was disappointing to see that such an advanced society, as the Atlantean's claimed to be, still solved their problems in such archaic and barbaric ways and the squid playing the drums was a bit too 'The Little Mermaid' (1989) for my tastes.I also thought that, although it was clear that they had tried to update him, 'The Mantis/Manta' was quite ridiculous and poorly constructed.It was the type of film that I would happily watch with my kids, if I had any. I thought that it had that certain something that made it acceptable for people of many ages to enjoy, if it was perhaps a bit simplistic.I might be tempted to revisit the 'Directors Cut' of 'Justice League' if it has more of 'Aquaman' in it and I would be far less likely to dismiss any follow up to this one, now that I've actually seen that DC can do well sometimes.741.91/1000.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think they dropped the ball thoroughly and rushed to make Justice League (2017) without debuting most of the characters first like Marvel did.Now Aquaman is a delicate one, because let's be honest he's hard to take seriously. He was silly in Smallville (2001), he was silly in his own cartoon, all the animated outings and the live action television series never even got past the pilot. It's a dude who talks to fish and once taken away from water doesn't really have a gimmick. For this reason (And many more) I was skeptical of the DCU version and with good reason, sure he was fairly neat in Justice League but here? Really?You see straight off the bat I'll say I like Momoa I'd consider myself a fan, he's a competent actor with a unique look. But he's not Arthur Curry! Aquaman is the blonde haired jock looking character, not long black haired bearded Samoan looking fella! So as much as I like the actor, I struggle to see him as this character who has been around since 1941 and has always had the same look which they've not embraced.So getting over that what do we have? Over 2hrs of CGI laden silliness featuring our beloved fishman, Atlantis, tridents, oceanic life fighting for him and goofy looking villains. In fact it's so CGI-laden and so colorful it may as well have been animated because it practically is anyway.The story is very Hollywood, very by the numbers stuff so no surprise there. The cast is decent enough but people like Dafoe just look so out of place because they're too good for this.I'd like to say this is take your brain out fun but it's not, Suicide Squad (2016) was take your brain out fun this right here is get yourself a full frontal lobotomy mediocrity.It's cheesy, it's tacky, it's over the top, it lacks the laughs that could have saved it (To an extent) and it's done nothing to redeem the DC universe in my eyes especially considering I'd count this as their worst movie yet.Aquaman is one of those critically acclaimed movies that I'll never understand why and can only assume it's fans are (Mostly) made up of children and ladies lusting after Momoa.The Good:Momoa is the personification of ""Cool""A few funny momentsSome very impressive visualsThe Bad:That simply isn't Arthur CurryHard to take any of it seriouslyTacky Hollywood nonsense","39 out of 57 found this helpful.

The scenes are shot beautifully and the underwater world looks really stunning. The cgi is sometimes great, but at other times unrealistic for relatively simple scenes (Nicole Kidman diving off into the water). The main problem with this movie is the script. It's too bloated with concepts:I felt like watching Troy, Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, Wolverine, The gladiator and Godzilla all at once. Not to mention the antagonist looks and talks like a villain from the power rangers.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but it was just too much. The epic battle in the end was great but felt forced in and didn't add anything to the story. With everything that's happening the characters feel shallow.

It isn't original at all and it feels like it took parts from movies I've seen before, mainly James Bond, Godzilla, and Thor.James Bond comparison: The reason these movies are similar is because they have somewhat similar action scenes, although of course James Bond isn't Sci-fi or fantasy. Their difference is that James Bond is much more exciting and less silly than Aquaman.Godzilla and Godzilla King of the Monsters comparison: I'm just going to jump straight to the point where Godzilla 1 and 2 aren't much better than Aquaman. Although the Godzillas have a slower pace it creates a much more climatic ending which Aquaman doesn't have. Plus the Godzillas have a darker tone.Thor Ragnarok comparison: Thor Ragnarok is a movie that is much better than Aquaman. The main thing that makes it much better than Aquaman is it's comedy. You will or have probably found yourself laughing a lot in Thor Ragnarok, compared to Aquaman where there was only a joke or two.At the end of the day I don't really recommend Aquaman for it's unoriginality and small entertainment amount.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is worth to see it in theatre. Although it has something original, we saw lots of cliches and similarities with other super hero characters and movies. What Aquaman did it first is creating a world under water and they did it alright. CGIs are really great. I liked it but sometimes you can easily figure out it is a visual effect because editors have to use these effects every time. And thats the hard part of the job. Even so this movie has the best CGIs in any DC movie for me. Also, Aquaman has a great action. Italy fight, submarine fight, big battle in Atlantis... Casting is great too. Momoa and Heard did a wonderful job on this project. But generally characters doesn't have tough motivations. Especially King Orm, he is not a so intense villian. On the other hand, film is so long. I think it could be better if it would be 15 minutes shorter. Another great thing Aquaman did it great is connection of opening and final sequences. It was enjoyable.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

""Most Beautifully visualized!!! DC movie... so far"". ""Better stuff than what MCU offered us for 9 years!"". I was SOOO excited! I love all superhero movies, MCU and DCEU. I have been hoping for a good DCEU movie for so long, and have gone to each one hopeful. Wonder Woman was a step in the right direction in my opinion. I saw the reviews for this movie and was so excited to see it. And was subsequently let down, partially because I didn't read into the feud between the two franchises's fans.Look, this movie should not be reviewed as highly as it is. It has GREAT visual effects and Jason Momoa is actually pretty good. However the rest of the acting and writing is so so so so subpar. I've been reading reviews all morning, about character development, how it is way less cheesy than MCU movies, just the right combination of funny and serious. Every scene feels forced like a formula: have at least one funny joke, one cool visual effect, and one heroic speech about the importance of what we are doing. So repetitive, the entire movie. How is that revolutionary, or better than any other films the DCEU has produced? I blame my disappointment in this movie based on the DC only fans who are just forcing good reviews on this movie based on their hatred of Marvel. Because while I definitely love DC, and I like Marvel sometimes too, I pay $15 at the theatre for a GOOD MOVIE not a BRAND.I hope my review brings down some of the hype. It is still a pretty good film and OF COURSE I love Aquaman and think that every fan should see the film. But I could have waited until it is cheaper on DVD to watch, because it simply isn't worth it. Please don't let the annoying reviews that praise this film as some above holy savior of the franchise sway you, because it is not that jewel of the DC universe they claim it to be. And if any of those reviewers read this, please, when reviewing movies, leave your anger at the MCU at home so I can not waste money on a film that is by no means, saving the DC franchise. The last thing I wanted was to associate this film with disappointment.tldr: this film really needed a poorer review because the amount of praise it is receiving is unrealistic, and causing people to get their hopes too high about a mediocre film.","829 out of 1,450 found this helpful.

There are exceptions obviously, but comic book doesn't translate from page to screen, or so we were told...And then along came James Wan! What a director! What a movie! This is one of the most accurate comic book movies, like ever(except the lead, who looks nothing like Aquaman from the comics)!So Jason Momoa is great in this role! No doubt about it! And just like Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Zack Snyder cast people(not very good, in terms of acting abilities), who naturally fit to these characters. I mean from the first shot of him onscreen you're like: he look nothing like Aquaman, I've read, but he IS AQUAMAN!Back to comics accuracy. Every other character is authentic esthetically, and personalitywise. Black Manta really is Black Manta(they even explain, why his helmet is so damn Big, Oceanmaster has his iconic Helmet and etc...
Now the Action! James Wan gives the fight scenes in Aquaman a unique cinematic language: they always begin with wide circular shots, that help establish the geography and after we're used to surroundings, James starts cutting to the choreography. And also long take fight scenes! Quite few of them actually!Film is pretty fast paced, but still manages to deliver solid story arcs, and clear motivations for both our heroes and our villains. Performances are solid overrall. No clear standouts, at least to me.I don't even need to say that the movie is visually stunning! You already knew that from the trailers!The score: pretty good! Aquaman theme is repeated quite often, and after the credits roll, it kinda sticks to your brain on a loop. Character themes overall are very good, although Oceanmaster theme is too dark, considering the fact that he is not evil personally.In the end It's a feel good movie for the whole family, with some real heart, and genuine humor!I highly recommend it!9.5/10","101 out of 218 found this helpful.

Hobbled by a messy and overstuffed screenplay, poorly developed characters, and a patchwork of unimaginative action sequences stretched across bloated running time. The film suffers through an identity crisis. It wants to embrace the campy Silver Age comics but it also wants to try to be serious and feels like a patchwork of many films. Yet ""Aquaman"" shows sparks of hope throughout, with visual finnese and one of the most fantastic openings in the genre. At times, ""Aquaman"" contains the hints of a blockbuster ready to engulf the world.
From giant sea creatures swimming around to Dafoe's Vulko riding a giant hammerhead shark, the film doesn't lack In its imaginative ways to transform the ocean .But its default mode is paint-by-the-numbers action, by the time you've reached the finale there has been over a dozen or so clashes. Instead of making one ""Aquaman"" movie, James Wan has made three or four films. Wasting away what could have been great storylines for future films.

If you want a brainless popcorn flick with lots of action, then this is worth a watch. It's visually stunning and the actors try to do their best of a poor script.However, there are many negatives. As usual, DC try to do too much and seem to be in a rush to get as much covered as possible. Aquaman learning his powers should be done in the 1st act, not the 2nd. By this point, it was just assumed he'd learned over time, so no point having his training so late in the movie.The overall tone was all over the place. One minute, it's serious like MOS and BVS, the next it's slap stick like Looney Tunes.Mera was beautifully played by Amber Heard, but there was too much change in the character. She starts off like the Little Mermaid, then progresses to Black Widowesque, then some sort of Jean Grey type character.The movie felt like it tried to take the best bits of the 3 Thor movies (not necessarily a bad thing but would have been nicer to see Aquaman as something different).Overall, not a bad movie but could have been so much better","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

They crafted a very unique and cool world and met my expectations for this, which was the original reason I wanted to see this movie in theaters. Sadly though, the dialogue was very painfully corny and unnatural feeling much of the time; and the acting of some of the main characters doesn't help. I loved Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones, but for some reason he did not appear to be able to naturally perform this role. I will say to be fair that the dialogue he was served to read gave him a massive disadvantage. What he does have going for him is he definitely looks the part, perhaps better than anyone else I can think, I just wish the performance felt more genuine.Another pro for this movie would be that the action scenes were pretty strong. Still I found that the corniness of the dialogue overshadowed this in my mind because it was painfully hard if not impossible to ignore at times.If you're going to see this movie, go in for cool costumes, sea animals, fantastical kingdoms, superhero action fights, and neat visuals. Leave your expectations for good dialogue and non-cringy character interactions behind.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Aquaman is not just the best DCEU film but also the best origin story or solo film in both the Marvel and DCEU universe.I last thoroughly enjoyed myself in a DCEU film when I watched Wonder Woman's ""no man's land"" scene. But in this film one can't seem to pick any specific action sequence that is so brilliantly crafted that it stands out, infact each action sequence is as brilliant as the previous one. The camera movements and lighting effects especially for under water scenes were stupifying i.e. cinematography on the whole was breathtaking.The third act of this DCEU film was a jaw dropping climax. The last time I experienced utter silence was during the third act of Avengers Infinity War. This time the theatre was filled with mind-numbing silence creeping upon every unsuspecting viewer slowly but surely making them move to the edge of their seats due to the burdening weights of anticipation, nervousness and excitement. The film ended with astonishment on people's faces and a huge round of applause.The visual effects were a treat for the eye, mesmerizing and charismatic. Being an aspiring animator myself, I could notice and appreciate the efforts taken in animating the Atlantians, making them float, swim as if they are fishes and not humans and make it all feel realistic. From the mosaic underwater architectures, the finely detailed character costumes, the enchanting visuals, to captivating and horrifying monsters and unforgettable marvelous action sequences, this film offers everything we need and more.Surely it does have the feels of Thor Ragnarok, Star Wars, Avatar and Game of Thrones - All packaged in one. One may think that the story is predictable. But then get ready, for James wann is about to turn your ship sailing event into a voyage far exceeding beyond your expectations.Personally I believe James Wann for the DCEU is propitious and I wish he directs Man of Steel 2 or even more DC films. Aquaman is tenacious, invigorating and a must see film for not only all DC fans but for anyone looking for a good movie for the weekends. Watch it in IMAX 3D on the biggest screen possible and feel the imersive experience of an underwater adventure. In the end it will be worth it.","101 out of 221 found this helpful.

The plot is simply enough but it's the way James Wan makes you care for the Atlanteans and ofcourse Ocean Master, brilliantly but if a little camply played by Payrick Wilson and more importantly how we the surface dwellers have poisoned the oceans with plastic materials and maybe deserve some form of retribution. My concern originally was the acting ability of Amber Heard and Jason Momoah but for me Wan gets two great performances from his leads, especially to my delight, Jason Momoah and the supporting cast are simply stellar. Black Manta is next level dope and the action, film choregraphy and fighting scenes are some of the best witnessed on the big screen. The music score has epic moments but also can have some strange choices at time but overall the score was great. The last act is worth the admission alone and I dare anyway to come out of this movie not being in simple awe at what they witnessed and beautiful the World of Atlantis is.
For the record I'm not a DC or MCU fan but I am now a James Wan fan, can't wait to go see it again on Wednesday this time in 3D Imax!Ps stay for the midcredit scene and please, please, somebody give James Wan the Keys to the DCEU universe","109 out of 241 found this helpful.

The guy who was famous for - Saw, Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle, Lights Out - all out dark horror movies. I mean, if you take out Furious 7 from the list, the guy is almost completely dealing with horror stuff. The only plus point that I saw there was that all of them were 'dark' and the DC verse is supposedly 'dark'. Things got worse when I saw the trailer and saw some 'altered' old school scuba divers as villains. I mean it did look like Black Manta from the comics but to cast something that dramatic from a comic into a movie usually calls for disaster. And in the trailer there were underwater shots of Atlanta that reminded us of 'Avatar' and a Gigantic crab that reminded me of 'Wrath of the Titans' - So now you see my dilemma before watching the movie - it could be an Avatar or a Wrath in the waiting!But my oh my, this fellow blew my mind completely. Right now I believe this movie can bring back the DC movie verse from close to death.After watching Aquaman (due to early release in India) the one word that is still ringing in my head is - MAGNITUDE.The sheer magnitude of the sets, the stunts and the visuals got my jaw dropped. There were a lot of wow moments and more than once did I think about the 'scale' of the underwater world that he is trying to show to us. For instance, there's one scene where a giant blue whale looking like a fish when it swims past one of those fallen Atlantan statues under the sea. At that moment you will invariably compare the sizes in your mind.I would say James Wan has successfully compiled Avatar, the Titan movies, Pacific Rim, Godzilla, a bit of TinTin, Indiana Jones stuff, a pinch of Harry Potter (LOL) - all into one short fun packed movie. There is fantasy, future tech (in its own way), adventure, creature stuff, scary stuff and breathtaking visuals. And thankfully you won't feel that they have made it all too sweet for a PG-13 rating. It is just the right amount of action.Oh thanks for reading that much - As a DC fan, now you are probably thinking like - I know all that from the trailer but what about the Superhero stuff? What about Aquaman? Did he pull it off?My simple answer is a firm Yes.For a start, this was the one of those films where I waited to see who the casting directors were in the end credit (applauds to Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy). Personally I felt all the actors were spot on for their roles - Nicole Kidman back in the DC world as Atlanna and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta steals the show in the opening moments, Amber Heard as Mera was convincing, Patrick Wilson as the rogue brother was a decent choice. And for a change you will get to see Willem Defoe (a.k.a Norman Osborne from MCU) and Dolph Lundgren, Drago from Rocky, in different roles (though it's hard to spot Dolph in his new looks).The towering Dothraki, Khal Drogo - Jason Momoa - to top it off. He is literally like a character walking out of a comic book with those chiselled muscles and the looks along with some pretty decent acting skills (he has a few comic one-liners too). He seems to have understood the depth of the character well and we will see him switching from the ignorant meta-human to the King of Atlantis along the way. There's a pretty decent back story (similar to WonderWoman) and a 'Save the World from Pollution' theme to hold on to. So overall the movie has a pretty solid base.There are some minor flaws like too many things going on in the final fight (but certainly not as bad as Man of Steel or BvS, here it is simply because of the same magnitude that I mentioned earlier) and there are some space-game like action sequences (even the BGM at that time seems odd but I think it might have been intentional) - but those are very trivial ones.Overall it is an entertaining DC movie and we feel like we are watching a true comic adaptation.So now you see DC's dilemma now - In the next JL movie - WonderWoman and Aquaman will be running the show unless the Bat and the Man of Steel proves us wrong.I rate it 4 out of 5. Watch it on a big screen to feel the magnitude.
PS: Just one advice to all of you - PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILERS for DC movies. They simply reveal too much every single time.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

Well after the DCEU started I was excited that it can give a neck to neck competition to Marvel but that never happened.Marvel always got good critical reviews as well as phenomenal box office numbers. And yes apart from Man of Steel the other consecutive movies BvS or JL they both were not upto the mark. Wonder woman was a good movie though.Because of these dissappointments I was not excited for Aquaman. I thought this will also be added to the list of the above movies I mentioned. But I was proven wrong !! How did I forgot that the director of this movie is none other than Mr. JAMES WAN who made The conjuring and Furious 7. But everything aside. James wan yet again proved his mettle. And this movie is a sure shot blockbuster.DC has a bad repo for not giving much freedom to its directors. And that's why its movies become dissapointments. But as Wan claimed that he was given full freedom in making Aquaman we can ourselves see the results of it. And I hope that DC continues this trend in its future movies also.Back to the movie let's talk about pros and cons:-Pros :-1. Wan's direction is fantastic.2. Action director who has designed the action deserves a praise.3. VFX team also deserves a praise. A film like this is quite a difficult task to do. But still these guys have done it.4. Adding emotions in a proper proportion adds a character development aspect which we missed in previous DCEU movies. Though they could have shown more emotional attachment of Queen of Atlanta and Ocean Master.5. Performances by all the actors are fantastic.6. Art director also deserves a praise.Cons:-1. Film gets boring in between especially in Italy scenes.2. If character development of Black manta and Ocean Master could have been done a bit well. Then it could have been more amazing.My rating is 8/10.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, I liked it, it was ok, quite entertaining, had some fun bits and nice action. But it was like 20 minutes too long, most of the time I thought that it couldn't be more over the top, until the next scene actually was more over the top and the CGI sucks. on top of that the acting wasn't all that great at some times and horror of all horrors, Nicole Kidman can't move her face anymore.
Maybe it's the best DC films since 10 years for some, ok, but lets not rate it 10 stars just for that. be objective, because this most certainly is not worth 10 stars. it absolutely can't live up to Black Panther if you are looking for to compare it with another movie. While watching this, I was litterally thinking that there is a reason why it took 15 years to develop Avatar and yet another 10+ years for the sequels. Because the time and money went to good CGI. This was straight out of a cheap bin full of unicornfarts dipped in care bear rainbows. Enjoy the movie for what it is, because it is enjoyable, but lets not go over the top with the ratings. the movie is over the top enough by itself.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Audiences do not want dark, moody superheroes. It might work on the Dark Knight but we want Superman to be well super.Aquaman is enjoyable enough nonsense. It has similarities with Black Panther as well as elements of Thor and King Arthur. It injects fun as long as you do not take it all seriously.The movie begins with a lighthouse keeper, Tom Curry rescuing Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater realm of Atlantis.Two worlds collide, they fall in love and have a baby boy. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father in a small fishing coast. His mother was snatched back to Atlantis when he was a child.Vulko (Willem Dafoe) came from the watery world to mentor and teach Arthur about his heritage and combat skills. Aquaman uses his powers to save people in the land world.Mera (Amber Heard) tells that Arthur that he must fulfil his right to be the heir to one of the underwater kingdoms of Atlantis, even though he is a half breed. His half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is dangerous and plans to destroy the land world.Orm is in cahoots with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who launches a submarine attack on Atlantis, giving Orm an excuse to go to war. Black Manta also has his own reasons to kill Aquaman.However Aquaman in order to be the rightful king, must find a legendary trident once forged by Poseidon. His sword in the stone.Jason Momoa is a limited actor. He is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips. Amber Heard is suitably sexy, Dolph Lundgren has a lot of screen time. Patrick Wilson is not a delicious villain in the mould of Loki.There are a lot of action scenes, some of it is well realised. James Wan has done a good job in pulling off this film.

Another swing and a miss for DC.It was the weirdest experience. The movie started out so well. For literally the first 45-60 minutes, I was really enjoying myself. Then things got a little silly... then more silly... then more silly... then downright ridiculous. I realize this is a comic book movie, but still. Maybe Marvel has set my standards too high.It's not like the movie is a complete disaster. The world building and production design are downright amazing. This has got to be one of the most visually striking films I've ever seen, and that's saying something in today's day and age.The problem is the script. The premise is great: Arthur must find the magic trident to become king of Atlantis and save the world. Classic comic book/architypal awesomeness. Where things get bad is in the execution. Bad dialogue. Bad acting. Over-the-top and unnecessary additions to the plot. Jokes that don't work... at all.I kind of felt like the pendulum has swung too far the other way for DC right now. Man Of Steel and Batman Vs Superman were criticised for being too dark and moody. This one is too silly and childish. Poor DC just can't seem to get the formula right.This film had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it wasn't realized.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I had never seen the comics, cartoons or the weird GameCube game. When this movie's trailer dropped I thought it was just a random superhero on whom DC is making a movie, like Plastic Man or Karate Kid (the DC one, not the popular franchise one). And so I walked in completely blind for this movie. And I'd say this may be a beautiful adaptation of the superhero, but definitely far from perfect.Unlike most DCEU movies which always have a lot going on, Aquaman has literally nothing going on. Or so it seems, because in this movie he has to discover his legacy, find his mother, stop his brother from attacking land dwellers, save himself from Black Manta who wants to take his revenge from Aquaman for having let his father die and also manage his relationship with his father, step-father, brother and Mera. And in spite of having so much this movie has a ton of breathing content, because each of these things barely last for 10 minutes.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. The characters travel all across from the stormy lighthouse, the colourful Atlantis to the Sahara Desert and Sicily. The fight scenes are all well choreographed although they always begin with interrupting the dialogues. Depending on which character we look at, they are somewhat similar to their comic book counterparts. The sense of humour is, well, at least it's better than the 2017 Justice League.I was interested in the movie only because of its visual effects. And I got that. So I have no complaints. This movie was satisfactory, but not really great. I wouldn't mind seeing it again, it just won't be as interesting as the first time. It's pretty surprising to me that this is the highest grossing DC movie of all time, even though it literally had nothing substantial to offer. I hope they add a little more depth to the story in the sequel, because if Aquaman is really a legendary character then they have to make him look like one, and that won't come by just adding visual spectacles.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Were the TV series ""Entourage"" still on the air, they would now need a new recurring punchline. The AQUAMAN movie is real! At the helm, we are surprised to find the master of horror, James Wan, in the director's seat. Mr. Wan is known for such genre flicks as SAW, INSIDIOUS, and THE CONJURING, and his talent for visuals transfers well to the comic book style. In fact, with a run time of almost 2 ¬Ω hours, the visual effects are both exhilarating and exhausting.Sure, we've seen short bursts of Jason Momoa as Aquaman in a couple of previous DC movies, but this time he owns the pool. Momoa plays Arthur Curry as a hunky beer-chugging rock and roll party dude who just happens to talk to fish and breathe underwater. Since it's the first Aquaman movie, writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (ORPHAN) and Will Beall (GANGSTER SQUAD) provide us the backstory.On the coast of Maine in 1985, a lighthouse attendant named Tom Curry (played by Temuera Morrison) discovers Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) washed ashore. What follows is a whirlwind romance, the birth of their son Arthur, Nicole snacking on a goldfish, as well as her first kick-ass action fight scene. To protect her son, she agrees to head back to Atlantis where she faces the consequences of birthing a half-breed with a landlubber.When we first see a grown Arthur - with a classic hair flip - he is thwarting the hijacking of a Russian submarine by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father (Michael Beach, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK). Manta is one of the two main villains - the other being Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's war-mongering, power-thirsty half-brother. Sharing a common enemy, Orm enlists Manta and provides a highly-advanced weapon that, for some unfathomable reason, Manta begins (via montage) to 'Iron-Man' it to another level - one much less stable. It's Orm who gets much more screen time as he plots a massive attack on surface dwellers (humans) who have been destroying the sea for years. You didn't think Hollywood would miss a chance to tell us how despicable we are, did you?The basic story is that Orm must defeat Aquaman to claim the throne and become Master of the Sea. Of course, Arthur is reluctant to get involved and only does so at the urging of his old mentor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard), both of whom wish to avoid a war with humans. The first battle of the would-be kings takes place in The Ring of Fire, a royal battleground missing only the accompaniment of Johnny Cash. The duel ends prematurely, so that an epic battle can later serve as the film's epic climax.Although director Wan may throw a bit too much 'plot' and action at the proverbial wall, it is interesting to note the history/mythology associated with Atlantis, the ruling class, and the missing trident. The legends are fascinating and the journey takes us to all ends (and depths) of the globe ... from the deepest seas to the middle of the Sahara Desert (itself once a sea) to the incredible core of the Earth. We see the ancient ruins, as well as the high-tech futurama Atlantis ... and it's all stunning to watch.Don't tell Marvel, but the film is somewhat a blend of BLACK PANTHER and THOR, and Momoa is every bit the Aquaman that Chris Hemsworth is Thor (quite a compliment). Yes, we find out that Atlantis, like our dry land world, is burdened with politics and power-hungry types, but the underwater world and the visual effects keep us mesmerized. We see terrific dragon-like sea horses, a drumming octopus, and a Kraken-like creature supposedly voiced by Julie Andrews (fact or fiction?). There is an early sequence that takes swimming with dolphins to a level you didn't experience on your vacation, and the lighting effects at times recall TRON and can be a bit disorienting.This is probably the largest scale DC movie to date, and director Wan chooses to make a splash with every element - character, mythology, setting, and effects. We also get appearances from Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as a TV talking head/oceanographer making the case that Atlantis is real and a threat. We even get Roy Orbison singing ""She's a Mystery to Me"", and the IMAX aspect ratio makes the first ever over-the-top underwater spectacle. And what a spectacle it is.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Acting was brilliant and hair and make up was great. The CGI was quite good, not something in particular I would point out but still good. The costumes overall were great except for the last costume aqua man wore which looked...well... different is the word. The storyline was a bit all over the place at times but about a quarter of the way through the movie it becomes a bit more clear. This film unlike most other dc films had some comedy in it rather than another 'seriously dark' dc movie. Most dc films are quite dark and barely have any comedy. It needs that balance of comedy to get the audience laughing but still a deep movie at the same time. Too much comedy and the movie feels like a joke but too much deep stuff and you feel like your eternally falling through a black hole, if you know what I'm saying. There was the 'I'm going to blow you up every five seconds' which is pretty much in every dc film (apart from wonder woman and the original batman trilogy). It was a good film and by any means watch it but if you are looking for a go to dc superhero/hero film, the batman trilogy is the way to go. Or you could look at some of the marvel stuff as well.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

His latest escapades have seen him rescue an underwater boat from a group of vicious hijackers, one of whom is now eager for revenge. Meanwhile, in his underwater second home, tensions are brewing between rival kings Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), plunging him into a desperate inter-world battle, alongside the beautiful Mera (Amber Heard), to discover his true self.Suspension of disbelief is sometimes something you must be willing to engage with any regular movie, but with superhero movies, it's always something of a foregone conclusion, naturally with the inevitable fantasy element that is attached to the story. But, even by these standards, Aquaman, one of the most recent additions to the staple, rather pushes the boundaries. Opening in 1985, Nicole Kidman, as a mermaid, leaps out of the water by some guys house and comes into his life, living as a couple and raising a son (without, it seems, raising any eyebrows or contravening any marriage laws.) But this brief spark of incredulity serves as a sweetener for the lengthy vapidness that is to follow.Jason Momoa was a guy I'd never heard of before this film, and who on the back of it, it would seem, suddenly garnered the star power to charge ¬£95 for his autograph at Comic Con. He certainly has the physical frame to fit the title role, and within the constraints of it, pulls off the grunting, edgy, wise-cracking tough guy in a perfectly serviceable manner, but nothing more than is required. The support cast is littered with big names, from Dafoe, Heard, Wilson, Kidman, and Lundgren making a pleasing big screen return in a none fighting role, all of whom are pretty much equally perfunctory.The film's big saving grace is it's magnificent visual spectacle, with some amazing CGI capturing a wonderous underwater kingdom, along with some snazzy costume design and amazing action. But it's at least twenty minutes too long and over indulgent, with a threadbare, unengaging story and empty, soulless performances. And that renders all that pretty meaningless. **","38 out of 59 found this helpful.

It offers one of the best stories produced so far by DC's cinematic universe.The visual effects in Aquaman are spectacular. The film is reminiscent of Tron, Avatar, How to Train your Dragon and Star Wars in its creation of the world of Atlantis on screen. As a fan of the comics, the vivid colours and comic accurate costumes are so pleasing to see cinematically. It is clear to see that director James Wan has done his homework. However, the de-aging effect used on Temuera Morrison is a little bit distracting. This is only a small criticism though, as otherwise, the effects are something to behold.James Wan brings everything that's good about the original source material. However, he also brings his own flare to the property, adding horror elements that merge beautifully with the world he has forged.Jason Momoa was born to play Aquaman! In recent years, Aquaman has been treated as something of a laughing stock. However, these times are over! Momoa has brought gravitas to the role and has made the character very cool. Amber Heard is also fantastic in this film adding a really interesting dynamic to the film. Her character surpasses the typical damsel in distress that superhero films typically have, instead giving us a powerful and stylish equal to Momoa's Aquaman. Patrick Wilson's portrayal of King Orm is good, but in the grand scheme of the film Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's portrayal of Black Manta shines out, offering a very compelling villain for future films. I must also add that Willem Dafoe's Vulko really helps add authenticity to the world of Atlantis with a subtle and considered performance.Overall, I would highly recommend the film to fans of casual film goers but also to die hard fans. The film's visuals are spectacular and are also supported by a strong storyline that will keep you totally invested throughout. I would give Aquaman 7.9 out of 10 as nothing is watered down!","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

The running joke is finally put to rest. Not only has accomplished director Wan created a decent superhero film in an extended universe that feels tonally convoluted, but possibly its strongest entry. That's not to say it's perfect, there is dampness in the far corners of Atlantis. But ""my man"", what a ride! Set after the events of 'Justice League', Arthur must step forward to be king of Atlantis and stop his half-brother from creating a war with the surface world. There's a phrase that has been circulating within the inner workings of the Internet. ""In Wan we trust"". A director who singlehandedly modernised the horror genre, entered the 'Fast & Furious' to create its best entry and conceptualised 'Saw', one of the most renowned horror franchises of all time. He is what makes Aquaman work. He is what gives life to the seven seas. He is why he is often the secret weapon in franchises. He understands any genre that is given to him. This solo endeavour, that rarely references other DCEU films, conforms to the cheesiness and blockbusting entertainment of earlier successes. From cringe-inducing one liners (""Permission to come aboard?"") to humour that often falls flat (""I could've just peed on it""), it often seems like it sets itself up for failure. However, because of this it surprisingly gives charm to the film and personality to its characters. It's so light in tone, purposefully juxtaposing the darker narratives of other entries, that it feels fresher than freshwater. Wan's eye for visual spectacle and intrinsically immersive action proves that it's not trying to be the next 'The Dark Knight'. Grand in scope, yet a personal tale of leadership for Arthur that enables his character to develop from a careless brute to a genuine role of idolisation. Considering the 143 minute runtime, it was paced methodically. Never did I feel the need to look at my watch, a rare achievement for any lengthy blockbuster.As the trailers suggest, the primary insight into Wan's ambitious creation is the use of visual effects. There were one or two scenes that physically gave me goosebumps. The design and architecture of Atlantis was awe-inspiring. Each building upholding a sense of modern personality, and each inhabitant spreading ancient history. Vivid neon colours invade your sight, as you sit back holding your breathe whilst being submerged into this otherworldly fantasy. With the help of Gregson-Williams' euphoric score, the world of Atlantis truly came to life. These visuals are then utilised during action sequences in order to stylise them. Wan tends to experiment with his camerawork (switching from POV to 360 rotational panning to ambitious one take shots) which invites you into the combat. Simple choreographed fights involving tridents soon escalate into kingdoms battling each other on giant crustaceans and hammerhead sharks. The range is splendid and maintains the entertainment. Momoa, Heard, Wilson and Kidman all getting involved within these sequences. The performances, for the most part, were good. Momoa is in his element and embracing every opportunity as the leading actor. Both his physicality and demeanour suit the role of Arthur Curry. Heard was also decent as Mera, the two interacting with each other often to create comedic moments. Although the end relationship is somewhat predictable, it was still pleasant to watch. Wilson also held his own (as always) as the primary antagonist. Kidman and Lundgren though were slightly dry and probably needed more time in the water.There are however faults that makes this a wet affair occasionally. The screenplay needed more work and is the weakest aspect to the film. Often relying on exposition, it never truly embraces its characters and instead settles for scope rather than nuance. For example, the secondary antagonist Black Manta was horrifically underdeveloped and unfortunately felt like an afterthought. Only showing up during action sequences and nothing more. Even the Ocean Master himself wasn't particularly developed enough to make you understand his viewpoint (aside from humanity destroying its waters). Wan has so many ideas, so many locations that he wants to showcase, that the narrative occasionally feels like shallow set pieces rather than a deep story. The ""Ring of Fire"" challenge fight sequence does accentuate the often poor human CGI, turning a pivotal moment into more of a distraction. I also found the conclusion underwhelming and rushed, in a bid to open itself up to a sequel. Still, in Wan we trust and fortunately his trust was justified. Aquaman is a nautical adventure that is sure to reinvigorate the extended universe that crumbled before it.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

Aquaman is easily the best film in the DCEU (or whatever they're calling it now) - yes it's even better than Wonder Woman; controversial opinion, I know! DC has finally found its winning formula - using Australia.
Whether it's Director James Wan, actress Nicole Kidmam (among other lesser known actors), filming in Queensland and New South Wales, government funding/offsets, or using Australian film and visual effects crews; Aquaman is the best of Australia on show for the world.Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

The humor, action, acting, editing, all are spot on for a change, and Jason Momoa as Aquaman is as inspired a choice as Gal Gadot was.This connected universe thing is not DC's cup of tea. They never established the characters well enough to connect them like Marvel did, and each movie was tonally different. DC's 2018 shift towards independent, disconnected universe way is far better than them copying the Marvel way. Aquaman though, introduced in fine style in 2017's Justice League is a remnant of their connected strategy. Momoa isn't the only guy bringing the house down though, the key guy here is James Wan. Wan has injected a sense of fun that helps entertain a wider audience, which DC so far lacked. Not that he has given up on his horror roots- some of the sea creatures and inspiring visuals will not look out of place in the Conjuring universe.Watching a comic book movie requires you to enter into the theater with an open mind. In this case, that is an underwater world, complete with shark and whale riders, highways for turtle-cabs, sea horses that are quite literally sea horses, bongo playing octopuses, giant prehistoric monsters, pink haired Dolph Lungdren- you get the idea.Aquaman picks up where Steppenwolf is defeated in Justice League, and people of earth know of a sea dweller who is out to help them. A backstory gives Arthur Curry's origin- eldest son of the queen of Atlantis who fell in love with a lighthouse keeper. She was apparently executed for her infidelity, but you know DC movies are all about mommies, so hold that thought. Arthur's half brother Orm wants to unite all the undersea kingdoms (yes, there are 7!) and wage war with Donald Trump and the rest of us genteel land dwellers because of global warming, ocean trash, pollution etc. Only Arthur can take him on, but for that he needs the Trident of Atlan. He is helped by Mera, daughter of Sir Pink Hair Dolph, and Vulko, counselor of Atlantis, while in his way stands Orm and his dreams of becoming Ocean Master, and his comic book nemesis, Black Manta.Arthur Curry: I'm no leader. I'm not a king.
Mera: Atlantis has always had a king. Now it needs something more.
Arthur Curry: Well, what could be greater than a king?
Mera: A hero.In one fell swoop, Wan provides an exciting origin story for both hero and villain, a believable romantic angle, and an emotional family drama, replete with epic battle scenes that shade Star Wars, and thrilling expedition sequences that match up to Indiana Jones. Momoa plays Aquaman as he played Khal Drogo- brashness and physicality that he has made his own, along with doses of humor and charm- no lasso of truth required for him to lay out his feelings for Mera. Speaking of whom, Mera is perhaps Amber Heard's first big budget role, and she fits the Atlantean princess to the T. Nicole Kidman is the most charming DC superhero mommy, and Yahya Abdul Mateen is a passionate Black Manta. Patrick Wilson as Orm is probably the only miscasting, but he too gamely plays along.Many thought this year's greatest spectacle was Avengers:Infinity War but do watch Aquaman and you may be pleasantly surprised.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Comparisons are bound to be made with the franchise's other arguable hit, Wonder Woman. Personally I think Aquaman beats Wonder Woman in that it had a final act that had a battle that was so visually appealing and interesting to look at that it absolutely blows Wonder Woman's failure of a third act out of the water.Which really is the story of Aquaman's success, it is a film that is wonderful to look at, the visual aspect of this film is that of a completely new level, with underwater shots and CGI that is groundbreaking and something that audiences have never seen before. The film had an interesting villain in Ocean mater, his motivations were well justified as the best villains should.Both Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were brilliant as Arthur and Mera as director James Wan excellently blends the actor's own traits into the characters. Utilizing Momoa's culture in the form of war cries and tribal tattoos to establish this new and modernized version of Aquaman.Aquaman is bound to wow audiences, while it's not the most interesting story wise it definitely sets itself apart as a fun and thrilling explosion of colours and visuals.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It has sentiments, humor, fun and serious. Aquaman should be watched in theatre for great experience. First of all James Wan is ""The Man"". He had taken the risk and courage to bring this superhero to life. Aqua man was the least appreciated superhero before. But now it has changed. Wan did the magic making the character lovable like how Robert Downey Jr. made us like Iron Man.Now to the main part
The script is simple. It doesn't mean it is bad. It is simply good. With this simple script, Wan had delivered an extraordinary way of storytelling which is enganging and makes us glued to the seat till the very end. The narration, the vfx and whole are in the next level. We don't feel any lag as the story is taking us to an whole new adventure.
The actors did their part very well. Especially Mamoa and Heard. Patrick Wilson and Yahya did their job well. No words to explain how good they are.The chemistry between Amber and Jason is very well executed. I didn't feel the jokes were forced. Even if it is, it doesn't matter much.As I said the movie has the perfect balance in emotion, love, action, adventure, humor and serious. This movie won't be a let down for anyone who had watched or who is planning to watch it thanks to James Wan.""Praises to the whole casts, vfx team and one and only JAMES WAN for giving us the wonderful ride.""And to those who are degrading the movie.
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself for degrading a movie which is good in every way.To the people who are reading this.
Don't listen to the critics. They are giving lame execuses for not liking this movie. Follow your instinct and don't judge the book by its cover.

She's Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), The Queen of Atlantis. They have a son together named Arthur. In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Jason, if MCU calls to offer you Lord Namor take the part. You will do the Lord justice.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

First, yes, there are a lot of spectacular visual shots, but too many wide shots with too many little details that take away from the main protagonists, and after a while, they become stale. Second, the story is weak, the last fight is completely anti-climatic, essentially to win a fight in Atlanta, you need to get the better weapon to break the ones your opponent has. Third, the actings are subpar, Momoa and Heard cannot deliver more subtle emotions like Gadot and Pine, and Dafoe and Kidman are underused, the only memorable one is Abdul-Mateen's Black Manta (or just Manta). It's a fun ride, but nothing more. However, Wan's camera work is really next level.","21 out of 68 found this helpful.

Visually incredible, epic set pieces and tonnes of potential for more out of this character's universe. James Wan's direction and the cinematography is brilliant during the fight scenes and the spectacle of the large battles (the final act of the film is mind-blowingly epic, with sea creatures fighting alongside armies etc.). The performances are good from everyone, Momoa has managed to make Aquaman cool, Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe are spot on as Mera and Vulko, and lastly we get two of the DC universe's coolest cinematic villains with Ocean Master and Black Manta (the latter having one of the best action sequences in the movie) and costume wise everyone is straight out the pages of the comics. Few minor issues, the humour just isn't funny at all, some of the dialogue is awkward and not well delivered. Also some of the licensed music used is dreadful (the score is good though).

But that didn't happen, despite it being over 2 hours long. (well maybe I rolled my eyes a bit somewhere in the last 10mins after the 'final' sibling battle)Superhero movies should be all about bringing a certain magic to the screen, a spectacle that you can marvel at and simply switch off and enjoy. And Aquaman does exactly that. Plenty of beautiful locations, lots of action/fighting, some awesome effects (especially all the under-water stuff) and a nice mix of Superman and Indiana Jones type adventure.
The kind of movie I could watch with my kid one day (when he's old enough) that will give him that sense of wonder and magic that some older movies from my childhood did for me.I also think they did some justice to the whole Atlantis mythology here. Great stuff.
And having 'good guy' Patrick Wilson play the villain to good guy Willem Dafoe? A welcome and interesting choice.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a pod of second rate b-list celebrities that are phoning in their performances in front of a green screen. There has to be bigger fish in the sea than the mess they managed to bait for this deep water grave.The music is absolutely horrendous. I think somebody got the wrong fish on the hook. They hired Rupert Gregson-Williams, brother of the respected composer Harry Gregson-Williams. And it's apparent. The music switches between Jarre inspired synthesizer and stupid little guitar motifs that feels more at home in a 1990's Zimmer soundtrack.
There is no originality in this wreck whatsoever and all you get are the leftover chum and clich√©s from other composers and movies. It's insultingly amateurish.The whole movie follows that pattern. And I'm not surprised. this movie has 5 writers, 1 director and over 10 producers. it lacks a strong captain.
At no point does it feel like a coherent story. It's more like 3-4 different scripts was shoot 3-4 times by 3-4 different people, and then they pasted together the ""best"" parts. When ever the story tries to float it sinks like an anchor.This movie is an absolute assault on taste and intelligence. It's mindbogglingly bad.

"","","The Story is Boring and Everything Looks Incredibly Fake","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4540422/?ref_=tt_urv","andrewestrella","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60343557/?ref_=tt_urv","28 December 2018","If I am being honest, I heavily dislike CGI, superheroes, and pretty much any mainstream films that are trying to be the blockbuster of the year. Well, Aquaman features really fake CGI, more annoying superheroes, and fails at being a blockbuster for me because I was bored, uninterested, and kind of disappointed half of the time.Aquaman is such an uninteresting character who is given no character development. Every other character does not matter because I could not even remember their names, which heavily implies that the writing was just awful. The CGI took me out of the movie so much, that I felt no spectacle at all, but I felt like I was watching humans stand in front of a green screen. Nothing felt real, and it annoyed the hell out of me.I wish I laughed more. I wish there was more cringe scenes, but honestly, this film was just really boring. I fell asleep tons of times and there is just nothing left for me to say. I mean, the enemies were horrendous, and I didn't care about one single thing that was going on. There was even this one bad guy (a pirate) that was given a montage scene with heroic music for what reason? It was so out of place and made no sense. He is supposed to be the evil person. The mother of Aquaman also annoyed me a lot. There is a decision that involves her in the film that could have happened so much sooner, and what ends up happening is so dumb, that I was really wanting to walk out.All in all, not even a red-head showing off some cleavage could spark my attention in this bloated, boring, and really ugly looking CGI-filled atrocity.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

There a lot of cliches and few forced laughs too.But they don't matter much because the very next scene it's something fresh as the editing is super fast paced.

Has there ever been a more maligned, ridiculed character in comic hero history? As a member of television's Super Friends, he was the least used or seen. Although he has been around since the early 40's and even spawned a more popular Marvel rip-off (Namor), he is probably been one of the least popular super heroes in comics, having canceled title after canceled title. Even Raj, one of the comic loving guys from ""The Big Bang Theory"" famously said ""Aquaman sucks!"". But in recent years, writers have taken him more seriously, making him more powerful and even gaining the public's respect. In ""Justice League"", he was one of the bright spots in the film and because of it he gets his own solo film. I never thought I would see the day when Aquaman would have his very own major motion picture but it is now out. The question is can it help the fledgling DC movie universe or (forgive the pun) sink it?
We learn that Aquaman'a parents were from different worlds; his father a lighthouse keeper from Main and his mother the princess of the underwater nation of Atlantis. He discovers her on the rocks on the seashore, badly wounded. After nursing her back to health, the two fall in love and they have a son, Arthur. When Arthur is an infant, they are attacked by soldiers from Atlantis and his mother is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis. As Arthur grows, he discovers he has powers to communicate with the creatures from the seas. He is taught by his mother's loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko, who trains Arthur to become a warrior, but is rejected by the people of Atlantis because he is a half-breed. After the events of ""Justice League"", Arthur has become a celebrity of sorts and considered a hero in the eyes of many on the surface. But Arthur's half-brother, Orm hails himself as Ocean Master and plans to build an army consisting of the armies of the 7 seas to destroy the surface dwellers for the harm they have caused to the oceans of the world. The daughter of one of the army's leader, Mera reaches out to Aquaman to help her stop his brother and reclaim his rightful birthright as king of Atlantis.
""Aquaman"" is a film that suffers from illusions of grandeur. It wants to be an epic superhero movie but it grinds itself down with silly and clich√© scenes and characters. It often tries too hard to be an impressive, all-time great superhero movie and ends up becoming laughable and over-the-top. Director James Wan, who is best known for his horror films like ""The Conjuring"" and ""Saw"" gives us too many jump scares for a superhero movie. I counted four scenes in where a huge explosion or a monster was supposed to incite a reaction from moviegoers. But if you can get through some of the film's major weaknesses, there is a true gem in this film... Jason Momoa. The Hawaiian actor is a star in the making. Just like Gal Godot from ""Wonder Woman"" the producers found a relatively unknown actor and gave him a role that will define him for awhile and one that he brings a lot of charisma and natural screen presence to. Momoa can be funny, truly entertaining without really trying. Early in the film, he has some great fight scenes, which is what he excels at as an action star. The script is not always the strongest, but Momoa makes the best with what he is given. Amber Heard is also strong as Mera but some of the other supporting performers are oddly cast with veteran, capable actors like Willem Dafoe & Nicole Kidman seeming like they are out of sorts and maybe uncomfortable in this film. Patrick Wilson as the main villain, Orm isn't bad but he also won't go down as one of the best comic villains of film. Most exciting is Black Manta, a personal favorite of mine who also provides one of the film's best scenes with his fight against Aquaman. I really wished he was the main villain, but I have a feeling if there is a sequel, we will see him again. The art direction and special effects are also a strength, and the money they spent on those aspects were well spent. But, like so many popcorn films if they had just delivered on a stronger script, this film could have been something special.
""Aquaman"" is not the strongest film of its genre, even though it really tries. It has a great actor to build a solid series around if they can just come up with a better script instead of going with old, tired plots and ideals. I would suggest they make it simple & subtle, not loud & predictable. I had a good enough time to recommend this film for a matinee, but you may find yourself rolling your eyes from time to time. No Raj, Aquaman doesn't suck, but his writers do.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Or Guardians of the Galaxy or most of the other super hero movies we've gotten. Jason Mamoa is a big presence, but not the best actor, so DC surrounded him with great actors. This is a super cast, and a pretty good story, though it's pretty much what I expected, and a lot more stuffed in, just in case they don't get another chance. I think they will get to do another, but it's going to be hard because we've seen so much in this movie. This movie is fun, and well done, and also clearly a James Wan movie-for those Fast and the Furious watchers, there is a scene ripped right out of Fast Five. The main flaw, and it's hard to fault an underwater movie, is the overuse of CG effects. This is a problem with all DC movies, especially in the third act, and this one overly so. Marvel does CG too, but don't rely on it as much. But it's hard to help it, as I said, with so much under the sea. A lot of it looked great (hair flowing around, some of the huge explosions) Now that I've seen this movie competently done, I can't imagine what can't be done in movies, in the right hands.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

What a DC movie should be. Aquaman was my favourite character in DC and he's done justice in this version.However, it works and it is entertaining. A stellar cast including Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson do a great job with the source material. Jason Momoa is solid as the title character but far different to the Aquaman I remember as a kid back in the 80s. Amber Heard plays a pivotal role as the Princess and holds the movie together. Looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson.Directed by James Wan who specialises in horror films the styling of this films was my major concern based on it being mostly underwater but it's done well and after a while you get used to the visual aspects of the movie. Whilst watching I felt aspects of movies like TRON, Guardians of the Galaxy and Flash Gordon!As usual with superhero films the running time at 140 minutes is probably 25 minutes too long.6.9/10Couldn't quite give it 7 but good option at the cinema with the family ( probably not small children).

I thought the direction and the acting waswere really good, and the Visuals were amazing. This is definitely one of the best looking comic book movies. It almost looks like a comic book that came to life.Now that all the positives are done, let me tell you why I didn't like this movie. First of all, I just didn't like the protagonists in the movie : Aquaman & Mera. I thought the actors did a fairly good job but I just couldn't connect with their characters and that just took me out of the movie. Secondly, the non stop barrage of action sequences which would have felt awesome if I had time to pause and take a break after each sequences. It almost felt like the director was putting on one action scene after another to make up for Aquaman and Mera. By the time the movie reached it's climax I was completely exhausted and I couldn't focus much on the the battle with the Ocean master. Thirdly, they could have done a better job with the Ocean master. The actor who plays him is such an amazing actor, and I thought they kind of wasted his potential.Aquaman IMO is not a terrible or a bad movie but just that I didn't find the central characters appealing and that just made the movie mediocre for me.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has everything I'd want in a superhero movie: background story, comedy, romance, action, and most importantly, quirkiness. I'm not saying it is perfect because it obviously isn't. The jokes felt somehow forced and very lame sometimes, and the romance was a bit stiff and very predictable, but I still enjoyed my time. It felt more like an animation film than a live action movie honestly, which is great.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Therefore the beginning is made to reaffirm arthur's motivations, reassuring the audience trust on the character, and to introduce new characters whose archetypes have already been seen plenty of times, wich its not a bad thing.In the second act it's clear to the audience that Aquaman is a action packed movie who tells the storie of a long gone heir to some throne that comes to save the kingdom from a mistake, slash uncontrolled tyrant. Nonetheless Aquaman delivers a visually stunning experience and, even though its hard to fear for the life of the characters, its easy to be engaged with the narrative and crave to now what comes next.The third act, at last, is amazing in so many aspects, the climax is setup with such finesse that it is hard not to be lost on your own thoughts while processing the amount of Aquaman that the movie deliversIn conclusion, Aquaman, is easily one of, if not the most comic book like movie ever made. James Wan delivers a amazing movie full of good fight scenes, heartfelt moments, realy good cinematography and inspiring art. Most importantly Aquaman seems to be made of comic pages, something that every movie who adapts a comic book should have as it ultimate goal.","32 out of 73 found this helpful.

Embarrassingly bad. This is particularly evident with Amber Heard, who hasn't developed the skill of more experienced actors like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe to find a way to speak drivel with conviction. Amber seems terrible in this, but I don't know how much of that is her and how much is the wretched verbiage she is forced to spew.People are going crazy for the muscly Momoa. I was underwhelmed by him in Justice League, and while he certainly has some amount of charm, he fails to make Aquaman particularly memorable.The story is predictable. Some of the action works, some doesn't. Everything that's not action is painful to sit through.I did notice that the movie is very much filmed for 3D. Perhaps that's why I was underwhelmed by a lot of the action; it was more designed for effects than fun. I do suspect I would have enjoyed this more in 3D. I also probably would have enjoyed it more if dolphins dubbed in all the dialogue.","14 out of 21 found this helpful.

It has a lot of very deep bass in many scenes and often rattled the glass doors covering the fireplace.The star is Jason Momoa as Arthur, the product of a union between a lighthouse operator and a mysterious injured woman from the sea. He is destined to become Aquaman. Momoa has the looks and at 6'-4"" has the stature to be legitimate in that role.His nemesis becomes Patrick Wilson as the underwater King Orm, the half-brother of Arthur. Their mother is Nicole Kidman as Atlanna. Each very effective in their roles. The general thrust of the story is Orm is unhappy with how humanity has been treating the world, both above and below the waves, and wants to conquer all to make things right. Arthur, being of both ancestries, seeks to instead promote cooperation. So naturally a mighty battle settles that issue.The computer graphics and special effects are really great, but for my tastes there is just too much frantic battles and destruction in the scenes leading up to the conclusion. I most enjoyed the first 1/3rd of the movie plus the last couple of scenes.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is one of those times.I'll start with the cons:
The CGI/special effects/costumes are REALLY bad! Some reviewers mentioned that they look like the Power Rangers and I agree, they really do. I also think there should be some physical differences between underwater people and regular people. They didn't have any fins or scales or anything like that. The only thing that was different was their wardrobe which, as mentioned, was really bad!The script also needed a lot more work in my honest opinion. I wish they'd put more emphasis on the way the two brothers were raised and their claim to the throne instead of on all those stupid wars and fights.On the plus side, the actors did a great job! I really like Jason Momoa! Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe also did a great job. There's a lot of action and fun moments in the movie so if you're in a mood to see a fun cheesy superhero action movie, go for it.
Just don't forget the popcorn!7/10 is probably a little too high of a score but I watched it on TV (meaning I didn't pay anything to watch it) and I did enjoy it so I'm feeling generous. Enjoy!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sadly, his mom Atlanta had to leave for safety purposes. Years later, Arthur uses his powers like talking to sea creatures and breathing underwater for good. Meanwhile, in Atlantis, King Orm wants to start a war between his own kingdom and land. And now Arthur, known as Aquaman has to time up with Mera, find an old artificat and prevent this conflict. The first half reminded me of Jupiter ascending, due to the fact that the protagonist who seems to be a regular person turns out to be royalty, and they also meet their siblings, that are actually the antagonist of the film. However, this one was way too unoriginal. It also reminds me of the Legend of king Arthur, where he's the chosen one to find and use the artifact, in this case, it's a trident. However, I can't say it's boring all the time. I liked the fighting scenes a lot, especially with all the atlantic technologies, which combines the underwater and outer space styles. And you can feel for the characters during these scenes. Not to mention, that the movie itself is a delight to look at, both underwater and on land. Despite mostly being done with CGI, Atlantis looks believable as a lost civilization set in a hidden place, where no one could reach. As for the land, I liked the desert, and a small Italian town. Both are really immersive and creative in their own way. Not to mention, all the animals and creatures look awesome!The cast isn't really terrible, in fact, it's okay. However, they aren't special. Aquaman is a brave protagonist, who isn't like everyone else, by being half blood. He actually got bullied by Atlantians there for not being pure. However, that only makes him stronger, as he serves as a bridge between two worlds. Mera is a love interest, who is actually the one, that warns Arthur about the danger. Despite her actress Amber Heard dealing with controversies, which I prefer not to mention, her acting was pretty solid. Orm was a villain, who is related to our hero, and despises humans for polluting oceans. His motivation is pretty unique, since it does address some modern issues of the real world. There was also another character whose name I don't remember, but he was also against Aquaman, and even teamed up with Orm, just to find him. However, he wasn't so important, as the plot progresses. Lastly, Vulko was the mentor, that taught our hero lot's of spells and tricks. He is against the war, and believes that only peace can resolve everything. He's a wise man, that honestly reminded of Shi-Fu from Kung Fu Panda, and his acting by William Defoe was great. Still, none of the characters were hateable, but none of them were stand out.My favorite scene was the backstory of Atlantis. It showed us that before, they were an advanced civilization, and how it was sunken. I loved how it explained everything in many details and how it executes the ideas of Atlantis and the lost trident.I actually thought that this movie isn't really the best, in fact, it was boring, however, I still could appreciate it. It has great graphics and world building, solid acting and even decent backstory. Not exactly my cup of tea, because the plot was generic, however, you can watch it in case you need a movie to turn off your brain and enjoy nice views of both worlds. But at least, I can appreciate effort that was made, and the creators tried their best with a simple material as a comic.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I've seen better acting from an old Polaroid photo of a Totem Pole (I'm being generous).The Mera actress looked like she forgot her lines and was looking off screen for queue cards half the time. Showed zero chemistry with the lead and wow was that red hair ever fake looking. Like why did everyone else including Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren and Nicole Kidman ALL have beautiful natural looking hair pieces and Mera's all standing around with something they found at a Halloween pop up store?When you combine that with the atrocious acting, lack of chemistry, unexplained origin story etc the film needs a reverse Snyder Cut treatment and they need to remove all of Mera's scenes and replace them with still shots of coral reef or Patrick from Sponge Bob saying her lines instead.Just my opinions.I'm probably not going to see the sequel if the casting director makes the same disappointing choices again.On the plus side, maybe someone will make a fan cut of it and remove all those wooden scenes with Mera the way they have with Jar Jar and Ewoks.","30 out of 51 found this helpful.

The IMAX 3D experience was just outstanding! I won't be lying if I say I enjoyed the film to the core. It's a complete visual spectacle with lots of action and adventure. Great performances and direction made it stronger. If you like superhero movies, this is a must watch.One of the best things about this film is that while most superhero movies do justice to the action aspects and the adventure aspect often gets overshadowed, AQUAMAN is a complete action adventure. You don't just get breathtaking action set pieces but also a lot of enchanting locales. The entire CGI work is impressive and that's another reason to watch it in IMAX 3D.Jason Momoa is very impressive, as is Amber Heard. Their combo makes the story more fun as they go places. Willem Dafoe is back with another solid act. Nicole Kidman is quite good, as are rest of the cast members. James Wan has done a great job with the direction by sticking to the plot and not resorting to unwanted subplots. The background score is also very impressive.I had seen and liked BATMAN V SUPERMAN, JUSTICE LEAGUE and MAN OF STEEL but not on the big screen. There was no way in which I could afford missing AQUAMAN. It's a treat to the eyes and a perfect entertainer for the big screen. From the action sequences to the adventure moments, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

Aquaman has a different tone than other dc movies before it, it is more light hearted as can be told by the brigh colors in the film. The film's color grading is not dark and gloomy like Man of Steel and BvS, the film takes it self less seriously and it benefits from it, Aquaman isn't the type of character to be the lead for a dark and gritty movie. Aquaman does follow a lot of superhero movie stereo types such as losing his first fight with the main villian and having his main weapon destroyed and having to go on a journey to find a better one and then defeat the main villian the second time, but I'd Arthur losing his first battle then winning the second battle is justifiable. Arthur fights Orm and loses under water in the first battle because Orm is a trained Atlantian super soldier and the movie shows us that Arthur is good at fighting regular people on land. Arthur then fights Orm out of the water in the second battle and obviously wins.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There, he was clean shaven and had blond hair. He was also bland as were the other heroes considering they were on Saturday morning which were mostly kid shows at the time. Here, he has a beard and has much darker hair. He also has something of an attitude which is refreshing to see! But he's very much the good guy and he has many great adventures here. Jason Momoa is aces in the role and it's also nice seeing that guy who was Green Goblin in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man film (Willem Dafoe) play someone more sympathetic here. In summary, Aquaman has such a fine story and great action set pieces, that I heartily recommend it!","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

A grown-up Arthur wants nothing to do with his mother's kingdom but is called upon to stop his half-brother from starting a war with the surface world.And Mamoa's got this, turning what is a silly looking character into a true Son of Anarchy. He checks off all the boxes, the physique, the brood, the macho rough-necking, and the funny.Really the whole cast is excellent here. He's got good chemistry with Amber Heard, who trades comic barbs and personal lessons with him, and fights well, but will be remembered most for this.Willem Dafoe shows up sporting a man bun as Arthur's former mentor, Nicole Kidman plays Arthur's mom.Patrick Wilson plays the half-brother, he does a fine job, but runs into the problem that usually plagues Marvel villains of having nothing to do after a while.I much preferred Manta, a villain with a legit reason for wanting revenge on Arthur.Most of these fish people talk perfectly underwater, which is silly, but the way they're able to see underwater is a gorgeous effect that rivals Avatar.Really everything from the action sequences, sets, costumes is a fantastical visual. Is it going for realism? Well at one point we see an octopus playing bongo drums so you tell me.Point is- it's pretty zany mix of things you might see in a Thor film and Pixar film and it's fun.Much of this focuses on a magical trident and fish people angry over pollution. Do we care? To a point. 2 hours and 20 minutes of this is a little much though and there should have been more of an effort to curb that.Overall this is fun, thrilling, and a visual pleasure with a real star turn from Mamoa. You'll want to see it on a big screen.If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm not afflicted with a childish prejudice against any superhero movie that isn't made by MarvelB. I'm not going to trash a movie just because the lead actress is involved in an ugly dispute with her ex.That being said, Aquaman is a great action movie that delivers impressive special effects, a coherent story (no planet-hopping or multiverses) and competent acting. Anyone coming to a superhero movie expecting high art and Shakesperian acting is somewhat delusional. Also, the reviews citing the scientific implausability of certain aspects of the film are laughable. When we live in a world where we easily accept boy wizards, Hobbits and spaceships that roar and make ""pew-pew-pew"" sounds it seems disingenuous to criticize a movie about an underwater kingdom. Aquaman is a movie where it is necessary to suspend disbelief - not unlike any offering by Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or Marvel.This movie is a fun spectacle with lots of entertaining visuals from giant ships being thrown ashore to armies mounted on sea creatures facing off against each other in grand battles. Jason Momoa and Amber Heard will never win any acting Oscar's, but they turn in decent performances. Momoa makes a suitable conflicted hero and is certainly built like a superhero. It was fun to see the usually delicate appearing Nicole Kidman kicking ass with some convincing martial arts moves. To me, the most convincing visual effects involved making people look like like they were actually underwater. Their movements looked natural and even their hair moved convincingly.So if you can relax a little and remember that you are watching a comic book movie, you'll find Aquaman a pleasant experience.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Are some of the battle sequences just computer animators getting paychecks while the audience has a seizure? Absolutely.Still, it was aight. Check it out. It was as good as Wonder Woman probably.

A cheeky grin and swagger to match.
Great casting in Amber Heard as she's in 90% of the movie and makes Mara as powerful as she's meant to be.
The whole cast did an amazing job and should be commended.
The CGI is top notch and REALLY REALLY needed to be for this film to stand any chance.
James Wan made a film thats up there with all the other superhero offerings.
DC are finally on a role with Wonder Woman and now this,so PLEASE DC keep it going.

But i will say that the world building is great and Atlantis is beautiful. But everything else is kinda a mess. The cgi was over the top and looked extremely unrealistic in some scenes, the lighthouse scenes in particular. The pacing was bad and went really fast that for me didnt allow me to keep up with the story. Although the movie had one of the coolest action scenes i have ever seen. Would recommend you go see it though to make a decision for youself and the movie is better that some other stuff DC have put out. Not as good a wonder woman though.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Aquaman. I've been a fan of comics and comic based movies for a long time, and a character that i found quite odd and interesting at the same time was none other than Aquaman. The way James Wan had depicted him on the big screen, is the best way possible to potray the character. Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, most importantly James Wan did WONDERS with this movie . Atlantis looks so dreamy and beautiful, the sea creatures, to be honest deserve their own movies, and everything else is just.. no words. Absolutely amazing. It'd be absolutely amazing if the next Aquaman movie had another member of the justice league, cant wait.

Granted, the world-building is impressive & the costume & set design really are a sight to behold but all of these things simply add to the slightly superficial feel... Purely aesthetic.
Won't however deny it it was fun to sit through - it's watchable - & Jason Momoa & Amber Heard have great on-screen chemistry but that doesn't excuse the paper thin plot & its total lack of substance underneath, not to mention the plot conveniences which had my eyes rolling, the cringey choices of music, wasted villain with great potential, weird score, forced humour & one-liners etc.
It's messy, convoluted, inconsistent & tries desperately to distract you from these flaws with its only reliable strength or selling point: the CGI.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even characters like Black Manta became campy with him saying some weird dialogue. I wouldn't say the second act is terrible but compared to the first act of the movie it's just not as good.Luckily the movie comes into focus in the last third of the movie with some very good action, compelling story and surprisingly great CGI throughout the movie and some of the best I've seen in a long while.The best characters in the movie were undoubtedly Aquaman and Mera. Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard had nice chemistry with each other even in the goofy scenes, Aquaman's journey to becoming King was well done as the movie made you understand why he reluctant to be King and how Aquaman's character grew throughout the movie especially with the help of Mera who also has a good mini arc in the movie and she had some badass scenes in the movie and again her best moments was with Aquaman as they went well together.The villain Ocean Master played by Patrick Wilson was bland, I mean they could have done much more with him but as the movie went on he became just another generic bad guy. Earlier in the movie he had some decent reasons for wanting to have War with the surface and had some good interactions between him and Aquaman since their brothers but you never got to see more of that. Patrick Wilson's performance wasn't even bad it was actually decent but the story involving him didn't have anything significant to do besides being evil because he is a bad guy.Like I said earlier the visuals were incredible and very colorful especially with the scenes under water and the sea creatures i never knew James Wan was capable of directing a movie with such incredible visuals and great CGI so one thing you could say about Aquaman is that it was truly a spectacle at times. Atlantis and other sea kingdoms looked pretty good and contributed to the story well however sometimes these under water kingdoms like Atlantis felt empty at times I mean it looked interesting but you never got to see more of it besides action scenes and water battles which was kind of disappointing.The action was also very good again the visuals helped make the action good at times especially the final battle it wasn't the best thing ever but it was very nice.The story is pretty solid and Aquaman's journey is interesting as he deals with responsibilities he doesn't want to have but he grows over time into a hero and despite being campy at times the movie has some pretty funny scenes so that's another plus.So I enjoyed Aquaman it's DC best movie since Wonder Woman not as great but still a pretty good movie with a solid story, great CGI and visuals and characters despite a bland villain and silly second act. Hope this continues for DC movies.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The love story,
The sea world trying to destroy the land would,
The revenge plot,
The environmental aspect of what we are doing to our oceans,
The search for the missing.........(no spoilers),There dig at Trump about the bridge (no spoilers)There is a lot going on and the entire film keeps your interest from start right to the very end.Only 1 criticism, it is a very very long film but the way the stories interact even though there is a lot happening the separate stories are easy to follow allowing the film to culminate.Rating and I honestly can't recall me ever giving a superhero film this score.........Rating 9 out of 10","45 out of 113 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman was the starting point and Aquaman was meant to put them back in the game! Alas, they messed it up with a bad storyline, some random ""OceanMaster"" brother and a wasted Black Manta. There are some good parts in this movie, though. Jason Momoa as Aquaman is a great pick, and he does a great job as the funny beer drinker that enjoys a swim from time to time. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking, and some of the best I've seen in quite some time. This movie would've been much lower in rating if it weren't for Momoa and the gorgeous visuals.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The main plot point of the movie is a cool idea, but the execution of it is all over the place and occasionally cringe-worthy. It's also an odd take on Aquaman, in general. I don't remember him being a brute-force kind of superhero in the comics or show and I think it ends up making his character pretty dry and uninteresting. Bottom line, if all you're after all cool cinematics and explosions, then you probably won't regret watching Aquaman.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Gone are the days of DARK epics and COMPLEX anti-heroes that fall over their own motives. The DCEU has realised it's better off trying not to emulate Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy and Aquaman strikes a much finer balance because of it. As far as origin stories go (if you can call it one after Jason Momoa's equally strong performance in Justice League), it's much larger than the usual efforts that aim more precisely to establish rather than finish anything. Instead, Aquaman has loftier ambitions and though the pace can border on unrelenting at times, it's forgivable given how big this world is and how thoroughly the filmmakers immersed themselves in it. There's enjoyment to be found in simply being along for the ride, even if most of it was clearly computer generated. Aquaman knows that we aren't going to take everything it gives us with the utmost seriousness and it's refreshing that the film doesn't try to play its sillier moments with a straight face. It's definitely a fine instalment into the ever-growing panoply of superhero movies and absolutely worth watching on a Friday evening with handful after handful of popcorn.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Beyond that each film has had some sort of issue in the filming process before its initial release. Rather that be Suicide Squad with all of the Joker scenes being cut or Justice League with its infamous Superman mustache issue. All of these factors and more led to these films getting poor reception from critics and a few fans. So going into Aquaman there were many who were very skeptical.However with James Wan at the helm I had little worry. The man was known for making films that were commercially viable. The Conjuring 2 film made 320 million dollars on a 40 million dollar budget. Saw made 103 million on a meager 1.2 million dollar budget, and Furious 7 made over a billion dollars on its big budget 200 million dollar production cost. So there was little doubt that the film would do well. As far as quality Wan usually churns out quality work. His Saw series is beloved by many fans, his Conjuring work had been exceptional, and Insidious while not as beloved as Saw is also its own franchise. So I was pretty optimistic on him taking on the visual spectacle that was ""Man who can talk to fish: The Movie.""In regards to visual effects the movie isn't all that spectacular. There were areas that I found to be very clunky. Mera from a purely special effects standpoint never looked real, there were a lot of water effects that looked fake. The designs of the home where Aquaman lived were nice looking, but still needed a bit more rendering to be done. The fight scenes I will admit are pretty bad ass. Every fight seemed to find a way to surprise me. The ones underwater seemed to impress me the most with their visual flares.Jason Momoa also bolstered a lot of confidence and charisma in the role. His flirtatious attitude with Mera and his audacious approach to to his brother always put a smile on my face. He was defiantly perfectly cast in the role of a superhero.Additionally the film tends to be very funny. It always knew how to make you feel good when you watched. There was a lot of great chemistry between Aquaman and other character that allowed for some really enjoyable sequence that made me grin from ear to ear. It was just a good, upbeat, and fun experience at the movies.But my favorite aspect of the film was Black Manta. He was a marvelous villain. From start to finish he always kept me interested in the pain he was feeling at the loss of his father and how Aquaman chose not to save him. This anger fuels the antagonist and pushes him to vengeance. This desire makes the audience feel sympathetic to his plight and his desire for revenge.King Orm wasn't nearly as compelling, but I did like his character. He was more your standard bad guy who wanted to become king for his own selfish reasons and hated the people on the surface. There is a part of me that wishes this was two movies instead of just one. Perhaps then King Orm would be a little bit more three dimensional than he turned out to be.I really loved Aquaman and Mera's relationship. It was really sweet and funny. Jason played it more in the tone of him seeing her as a sexy catch and she was the sassy redhead who wanted him just as badly, and when looking at it through those eyes then they really work well for each other.Overall though there isn't really anything surprising here. It pretty standard superhero stuff. There a big awesome fight at the end of the movie that was cool to see. Mera and Aquaman have a overly dramatic kiss, and the movie ends with Aquaman giving a hopeful monologue to the future. So it was good.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The CGI is beautiful. James Wan's vision for this new cinematic world was ambitious and bold.
The Bad. The dialogue is just horrible in several spots. Jason Mamoa had the better part of the dialogue but Amber Hurd, Kidman and black Mantas suffered the most. Casting aside from Mamoa was weird. I felt like they sought out actors to be unique rather than fit the chemistry for Mamoa.

Knowing that James Wan is more of a horror producer than an action movie director, he did a good job tackling this installment. Bringing in Patrick Wilson as Kind Orm was a good tribute to having him be familiar within Wan's work. In general, the movie was great action packed adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the idea of Atlantis and how the characters looked underwater as well as their relationships with the different characters to see how they played within the story line. However, the CGI has been getting slightly more noticeable within the last couple movies that I have seen. Some of the stunts preformed in this movie that should have either injured the character or end up in a fatality, to return a few scene later didn't feel authentic. If you have seen Avatar, directed by James Cameron there is no doubt to where Wan got his inspiration from. Aquaman's Atlantis has the same feel as if you were in the land of Pandora, but just underwater. All in all, a great addition to the DC universe and can't wait to see what comes next.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's impressive how they were able to bring all those fantastical battle scenes and underground scenes to the big screen with modern technology, a true dream come true for comic book fans. The story is a great standalone movie but doesn't feel like it serves any greater purpose like those Marvel films, I guess for both better and for worse. Also unlike Marvel movies or previous DC films, I think the movie finds a good balance between being dark/deep and comical. The build-up is a little long, but the content within doesn't feel like filler and makes the world of Atlantis more interesting, it's impressive how so many integral elements of the film was integrated. The biggest problem with the film are the dialogues. They are painfully simplistic and uninspiring to the point where it feels awkward, someone needs to tell the writers that writing movie lines are not the same as writing comic dialogues!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The ones on land too are very good. For me the ones in ocean were crowdie and blurry. The same appeared when I saw finding Nemo. I guess that happened to portray a reality (in the sea) more precisely. I wished if they were clear even after being in Ocean. Despite that they were nice.

The story was predictable and formulaic.
The actions of the characters made little sense.
Massive plot holes (and is inconsistent with events of the other DC movies).
Much of the acting was stilted or 'phoned in.' (Then again, with the poor dialog they were given, perhaps they were doing the best they could.)
The action sequences were boring.
Terrible CGI.
There was no chemistry between the two main characters/love interests.
And... I was bored. I started looking at my watch less than half way through.This was a clearly movie conceived, written, and directed by a committee. It had no direction, no soul, no purpose. I honestly rank this at the bottom of DC's recent crop of movies, I would watch Batman v Superman again before I would watch this.The BEST scenes were between his parents. I would have been happy to have just watched a two hour movie with Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman's relationship.My kids loved it.

The best DC movie so far. The movie is moved from being a child friendly superhero to a more mature and serious story, where it matters who you are, and
The actor play is just phenomenal. All of the movie characters are really well developed. They have a really solid story behind them and the viewer gets attach to their story and who they are, and this is made in a really clever ways.
In the whole movie everyone grows and develops.
Another great aspect DC implemented was that heroes has also some weaknesses, and are drawn closer and closer to the average person, and that not superpowers are important, but the thing who we are. The feelings we express.
The cinematography is just stunning, and the special effects was the best i have seen in a 3D movie so far. Just amazing to watch. A lot of effort was put into the underwater world. They successfully recreated the beauty of the deep.
I have some minor complains about Mera. In some shots she was presented like an innocent explorer of the land, and in other shots she was presented like a provocative and super experienced badass girl. I dont really know what made this very rapidly change in character but who knows.
But the movie is absolutely amazing and it is a must to watch preferably in 3D.
DC made a shift in the right direction and presented us a great story about love and a real king.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not bad, DC. Not bad.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4528751/?ref_=tt_urv","BenWollmuth","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60421842/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2018","The DCEU, or Worlds of DC as they are now calling it, have released another standalone movie, this time with the character of Aquaman. Now, DC has been pretty good with their standalone films; the only films that I have major problems with are Batman V Superman, Suicide Squad, and Justice League. Justice League wasn't even that bad of a movie. It just felt rushed. One of the best parts about that movie was the character of Aquaman, a character that everyone thought of as weak and stupid before that movie was released. What Justice League did, however, was turn Aquaman into badass, so I was really excited to see how they would expand on his story in his standalone film. Luckily, he is still a badass.
Aquaman is not the best film in the DCEU, but it is definitely not the worst. I don't think this is James Wan's best work, either. However, I still think that is is a very enjoyable movie with a lot of stuff to love. It's weird to think that this movie belongs to the same universe as Batman V Superman, Man of Steel, and the like. It's so much brighter; so much more colorful. It is beautiful to look at. All of the CGI, makeup effects, and costumes look amazing. It is the most colorful film in the DCEU by far.
Aquaman is an awesome character, and Jason Momoa brings a lot of character and comedy to him. Mera was a very likable partner for Aquaman to have, and she also knew how to kick butt. Willem Defoe's character Vulko was fine; nothing great about him, but also nothing bad. The villains were actually quite good, and you could really reason with almost everything they were doing. Orm, played by Patrick Wilson, bounced off of Aquaman very well. The seriousness of Orm and the goofiness of Aquaman meshed together very well. Black Manta was a fun villain, too. I liked every scene he was in, and his on-screen suit didn't look half bad. I just feel that for being Aquaman's most iconic foe, he wasn't in the movie enough.
Now, this movie had some very cringy dialogue that took me out of the movie at times. There were also some shots in the film that made it seem like the movie was trying to be too mainstream. At one point in the film, Aquaman and Mera walk out of the ocean onto a beach in slow motion, like something you'd see during a swimsuit ad. While this is happening, a horrible - and I mean HORRIBLE - cover of Africa by Toto, being performed by Pitbull, was playing in the background. It was such a ridiculous shot, and it took me out of the movie. The film also had a lot going on, and I feel with a little more cutting, it could have been shortened without ruining the plot.
Overall, I think this is a very entertaining movie. It adds a lot more color and character to the DCEU, which is something it much needed. It's not better than Wonder Woman, but it definitely is better and more well put together than the other films in the DCEU. I'm excited to see where they go next with the character. If you are skeptical about seeing this movie, just give it a try. It's very entertaining, whether you like the DC films or not.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Having made his first appearance in last year's Justice League, Aquaman (Momoa) returns in his first stand-alone adventure that is both ridiculously corny yet ludicrously enjoyable. Aquaman, A.K.A Arthur Curry (half Atlantean-half human) is the rightful heir to the throne of Atlantis, and is reluctant to leave his human life behind in order to face up to his true destiny. With the help of warrior Mera (Heard) and Atlantis counsellor Nuidis Vulko (Dafoe), Arthur must fight to overthrow his malevolent half-brother Orm Marius (Patrick Wilson, a frequent collaborator with Wan), who is preparing to wage a cataclysmic war with the surface world.The DCEU, in a nutshell, is a complete misfire of a cinematic universe. Although Wonder Woman (2017) showed great promise for the franchise, even the most hardcore fans can't ignore the disaster that was Suicide Squad (2016) or the total mess that was Batman V Superman (2016). With Aquaman, James Wan makes the most of a clich√© ridden script and delivers a surprisingly fun film. Momoa leads the film with great charisma; his performance holds the film together entirely, and it is clear he's having an absolute blast in the role. Patrick Wilson was a fitting choice for Orm; he's menacing when required, yet his performance at times is corny beyond belief. Both Heard and Dafoe were also excellent casting choices, although their characters aren't as developed as they could have been. It is the action sequences that work best in the film. In previous DCEU films, the action sequences have ranged from excessively dull to criminally forgettable (with the exception of the terrific No Man's Land sequence from Wonder Woman), but Wan crafts sequences that are thrilling in execution and epic in scope. A fight sequence with side villain Black Manta (who makes an appearance more in the name of fan service rather than plot) is particularly awesome, and the final conflict may be an overload of CGI, but it's certainly epic and absurdly entertaining.Aquaman is definitely one of the stronger entries of the DCEU. It's cheesy for sure, and the writing is clunky in parts, but with Momoa's excellent screen presence and Wan at the helm, Aquaman manages to pull off all its absurdity. If the DCEU continues in this direction, it could finally live up to its full potential and even rival the MCU.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Or was it just the overall power of Marvel that just seemed to squash DC? With James Wan at the helm who got famous with being one of the minds behind the Saw franchise (one of the most important ones that is), there is experience at the helm. And he really brings a lot of humor into it - like the bar scene which goes against what people would expect from that.But for every scene like that, you also have a scene with one of the movies villains who is so over the top, you would suspect him to be comical (no pun intended), but he is dead serious. Shame for missing out on something that could have been really great. Jason Momoa on the other hand is having a lot of fun. And all the cast is having a lot of fun (maybe even the crazy villain in between takes, definitely not on camera). A lof women (and some men) will love this regardless of story, just being visually ""attracted"" to it and that is ok.

""Aquaman"" tells a story that's actually quite similar to ""The Legend of King Arthur,"" and revolves around half-human/half-Atlantean Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) becoming Aquaman in order to prevent war between the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and the human world. ""Aquaman"" is much different from James Wan's previous films - of course, ""Saw."" The film (especially in its underwater sequences) looks fantastic and is beautiful to look at, but that's really all I got out of it. (I'm not a fan of Aquaman and perhaps if I was, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.) It's really no different from many other big-budget superhero films of late, especially those produced by rival Marvel.

The visual effects, the music, and the acting are all top notch.It is not a full set up of him becoming Aquaman but it is a setup of him becoming King.

If a company decides to do then they better give me something to make the wait worthwhile. In this case they didn't come through for me, I was anticipating something better.I will say I kind of liked this movie but I expected more, it left me feeling kind of disappointed. I think they sacrificed too much of the story for more action. It felt like they were trying too hard to include too much for 1 movie. I think it might have been better served splitting it up into 2 parts but then it wouldn't have been as exciting. This movie really needed a good writer, someone who could have condensed the story into something that flowed more smoothly. The dialogue was at times silly and out of place. Momoa trying to be funny is like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to be funny as the Terminator, awkward. Momoa is a great straight man, he has good comedic timing and had some really funny moments in Stargate Atlantis when he wasn't trying to be funny. If they wanted humor in this movie, they should have used the same technique vs. using corny jokes.Maybe because I'm older and grew up watching movies with incredible actors and dialogue but the CGI stuff doesn't impress me that much. Some of it was incredible some of it was just off and made the scenes look fake. I knew it was CGI and what they were showing was inaccurate, it took me out of the movie. I admire the movies that use CGI but don't make me aware of it. There were times I wished I'd had a remote control so I could fast forward through parts that were just way too drawn out. I wasn't crazy about the music, at times it didn't enhance the story and sometimes it was downright distracting. I think the music and background noises were overpowering, making it more difficult to understand what was being said.I like Momoa as an actor, he is visually impressive but I still can't wrap my head around him being Aquaman. It was like he as an actor didn't believe he was Aquaman? Nicole Kidman's performance was not all that believable either. Maybe it was the CGI or lack of great dialogue but it didn't pull me in. The antagonists were the worst, their lines were laughable. I'm reminded of a quote from W.C. Fields ""If you can't dazzle them with Brilliance than Baffle them with Bulls##t"" they tried to dazzle us with Brilliant imagery so we didn't notice all the Bulls##t.I love Super Hero movies but the biggest problem I have with them is they try too hard to be epic. Yeah I want a Hero and action but I want a good story as well. Too many times the story gets lost in the struggle to make it more Epic than the last Super Hero movie. I hate that they're always trying to outdo each other with action and special effects at the cost of the story. If you have a good story you don't need epic battles. I think this movie really sacrificed story for action. It's like when you go to a buffet and you eat a little of everything but you don't get enough of the few really good things. When you leave you're full but not satisfied. Although there were some great moments in the move it left me unsatisfied.","11 out of 40 found this helpful.

This movie felt a bit long considering it's run time of 2hrs 23 mins as the epic scope of CGI scenes battled with trying to keep a simple plot refreshing. It is a film of royalty and myth which rewards this film by giving it the grand scale other DC films lack. Sure this film does follow the typical formula, but there are a few twists which keep the film from being an absolute bore. Visually this film is looks pretty as the nearly endless CGI serves as mostly pleasurable to the eyes. The various environments of the sea vary from illuminated wonder to dreary darkness but it is satisfying to see how broad film is with creating kingdoms of the sea. There is a scene where Aquaman spins his trident with terrible CGI but I'll ignore that. As for character development, this film has had more than a lot of past DC films and as an audience we learn enough about Aquaman to understand his motivation. This could go deeper but in an already long movie it would be quite difficult and would most likely become a snooze fest. There are moments that are bound to make you smirk in the dialogue and the characters are likable enough that you don't end up hating them and might come to enjoy them during the film. However, this is an action film and deep dialogue is the last thing you'd expect. There are moments which can be a bit cheesy or over the top but it is satisfying to follow Aquaman through his journey though the sea. His relationships add a layer of richness which somewhat invests you in his motivations and endeavors. If it wasn't for his companion Momoa, his brashness and over the top nature would be unbearable and annoying, but she provides an acceptable balance. Overall, this film entertains with its adventurous feel and monumental battles but it falls victim to a lengthy run time which is unbalanced in pacing. I would recommend and I feel cinemagoers will feel some sense of satisfaction from DCs oceanic epic. It is a refreshing take on a system which is formulaic (both Marvel and DC) with a unique setting and royal grandeur which sets it apart from its predecessors.","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

The character has always been treated with disdain and has even been the target of jokes in several TV series and even films over the last few decades, always in a pejorative way. The character debuted in More Fun Comics # 73 (November 1941, despite appearing on the cover ""November"", More Fun Comics # 73 hit the US newsstands on September 25, 1941.). Initially a secondary hero in DC anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes as the main hero.
With the expansion of the DC universe in theaters and the advancement of technology, it was possible to bring to the screen through the hands of one of the most daring and talented directors that have emerged in recent years, James Wan. The Malaysian / Australian director emerged in the mid-2000s when he impressed the world with the iconic horror Mortal Games (2004). Responsible for producing the following chapters of the franchise and for being ahead of other contemporary horror classics, such as the 'Invocation of Evil', 'Supernatural' and 'Annabelle' franchises, the director had already proved himself capable of venturing into other genres typical of blockbuster cinema in the acclaimed 'Fast and Furious 7 (2015)' and now arrives with all the merits to adapt Aquaman's comics for Warner / DC Comics. And in the hands of the director, the final product achieves an unexpected and surprising result.Being the sixth film in the Extended Universe DC and with a screenplay by Will Beall and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, the plot features Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), half-human and half-Atlantean, will have to stop his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who with a vast army at his disposal, plans to conquer both the other kingdoms of the ocean and the world on the surface, becoming the Master of the Oceans to attack the surface. Along with Mera (Amber Heard) he will have to recover Atlan's lost trident and accept his destiny as protector of the depths.
One of the great successes of this film was in the construction of the characters. After having previously appeared in 'Justice League (2017)', Aquaman has its story told in greater detail, since when his parents met, and why Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) had to abandon her young son and husband and return to Atlantis. Soon after, we saw Arthur grow up as a great partner of his father who raised him and being trained by Vulko (Willem Dafoe) both at sea and on the surface, until one day he could take over the kingdom of Atlantis. At the same time in which he presents the character's past and present, he already inserts the hero into the action, in an excellent sequence in a submarine, which even nurtures a feeling of an enemy's rematch for Aquaman.
One of the great successes of the film and that could have a totally opposite effect is the visual and visual effects. Just as James Gunn can create and dare with the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' look on a risky endeavor, so does this DC adventure. One of James Wan's great merits was taking on the fanciful tone and fantastic elements that are inherent in the character's story. The mission is not only to present Aquaman, but the entire mythology of the Seven Seas, including the history of their largest kingdom: Atlantis.
Building an entire universe in the underwater world was not one of the easiest tasks and the transposition of Atlantis from the comic books to the cinema is impeccable, showing all the financial power of the time when the city sank in the sea. They are a symbol of their time with voluptuous monuments and, at the same time, rich and highly technological of a society that was destroyed by their greed, but that also gave them the skills to breathe underwater and to evolve. The city, practically all built in computer graphics, is a delight in the eyes of those who watch. In addition to the city's architecture, the human costumes and the representation of dozens of marine lives are also perfectly done. The fact that the poetic license regarding the ability of the people of Atlantis to breathe and speak under the water at the same time that we see hair and clothes reacting to contact with water does not bother us at all. In addition to visual excellence, Aquaman's greatest asset is being bold enough to bet on a tacky yet mesmerizing aesthetic. Below the water, we see a parade of colors in the costumes and lighting. Feeling in Atlantis is a duty more than fulfilled, as well as the credibility achieved in the diversity of species in that world. The film is not ashamed to come out in this way and manages to take this fantasy to a heroic level thanks to the urgent and exciting direction of James Wan.
Jason Momoa has a natural charisma and clearly has fun playing Aquaman. If, during the casting, your choice was even criticized for not physically looking like the hero of the comics, when we see Momoa in 'Justice League' and now starring in your film, we can no longer disengage from the character's actor. Momoa forms a good pair with Amber Heard, sharing good romantic moments, which is not repeated so much in the most comical part. The actress is bestowed with the best and most relevant female character within the superhero films, with the obvious exception of Wonder Woman within her own film. Mera is the conductor of Arthur's journey to the throne, and although he is his romantic partner, he escapes the common helpless maiden clich√©s. Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman, even in minor roles, prove to be extremely efficient, including a super action sequence from the character of Kidman right at the beginning of the film.
The villains are other good hits of the feature. Patrick Wilson denotes the exaggerated tone of the film with his great Orm. The Master of the Seas next to the Arraia Negra lived by Yayha Abdul Mateen II. The first incorporates the megalomania of a son who was denied the throne, while the other is the embodiment of simple and pure revenge. Both work well and represent major threats to Aquaman, from the waters and land. Both are so well constructed, so that one is shown to be responsible for the hero's inability to refuse the call for his journey. Aided by the impeccable look, built from the comics of Ivan Reis and Geoff Johns - a good part of the people, in fact, are inspired by the duo's arc.
Some themes are discussed throughout the plot, citing the interference of man in the environment, in an inspired observation that the first act of the sea war against the land was to return decades of garbage thrown into the ocean. Xenophobia is also addressed in this same tone, with the superior underwater races seeing humans as minors.James Wan shows all his ability by merging scenes shot on a green background, combining all his ability to direct actors and create ingenious action scenes, which was already evident in the seventh adventure in the cinemas of the franchise 'Fast and Furious'. There are several scenes with interesting elements of transition, continuity, flat action sequences (highlighting one involving the character Atlanna, the duel to the candidates for the throne of Atlantis, the incredible sequences in Sicily, Italy and the entire final stretch after Aquaman took over the post of the true heir of Atlantis capable of wielding the trident of the former King Atlan).
'Aquaman' has an excellent look, action with scale, impact and tension, but it sins when it comes to creating true relationships between the characters. One observation is that the film makes it clear that Warner has freed itself from the shadowy bonds in which its extended universe was established from Man of Steel. The created world is well structured and has such a particular identity that such defects are superimposed. The work is full of references, the passage of Arthur and Mera on the surface includes a sequence that refers to the games, not only by the scenery, but also by the color table, by the conduct of the action and the temple, which resembles 'Indiana Jones', while the hero's first foray into Atlantis refers to 'Star Wars', when Jar Jar Binks takes Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to Gunga in 'The Phantom Menace'. James Wan has the courage to laugh at his own ridicule, putting the hero to talk to fish or riding a seahorse and, aware of the fantasy he proposes, the film of the King of the Seas has fun like no other DC hero has had in years.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Very conflicted about this film!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4522916/?ref_=tt_urv","Lewis_Heather787","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47231689/?ref_=tt_urv","20 December 2018","To be totally honest and up front I am personally suffering from Comic book film fatigue at the moment, there is just an over saturation. I'd even go as far to say that I am getting less and less bothered or interested in them, the more that come out. I am more of a DC fan than Marvel but I have enjoyed films from both however I really couldn't care less anymore. Maybe thats just me.With that overly long intro out of the way onto the film itself, which I have to say I am very conflicted on because there are parts I really enjoyed but that there are also parts that were just ok for me. Unfortunately though that is the overriding feeling after viewing this film is that, it is just ok. Which is a real bummer because I go into every film hoping to love it.Lets start with positives firstly, James Wan. Wow can that man direct!! This probably from a visual standpoint one of the most amazing and breath-taking comic book films you're going to see. Some of the visuals underwater in the world of Atlantis are just incredible, and more importantly the camera work throughout some of the action scenes. Idea of showing two different action scenes going on simultaneously, switching between the two without cutting away is a brilliant way to give perspective on the overall area and scale of the action. Overall though it is nothing less than I expected from Wan because he is an uber talented director and he definitely added something fresh to comic book films in that respect.Strangely I thought that Jason Momoa was a good as I thought he was gonna be nothing spectacular but not terrible either, however I think there are couple other performances that really stood out to me. Firstly Nicole Kidman, she is one of the best around today period. So it shouldn't really be a surprise that she is really good, but you do worry now and then when you here about a huge name staring in a film like this. Are they just doing it for the pay check?? I thought her performance was really strong and is the heart of the film even though she has ""limited"" screen time. Every time she does appear on screen she is a scene steeler. Overall top class. The other scene steeler and this one was a shock is Amber Heard as Mera. Now this might be just me but I'm not the greatest Amber Heard fan, don't actually think she's that good an actress, average at best, maybe a little harsh. Wow has this got to be her best performance of her career as of yet. She commands the screen whenever she is on and I think she does a better job of carrying the film than Momoa. As soon as she is introduced to us you immediately warm to her or just latch onto her character and her motivations. However the best thing and probably the most harshest thing I could say is that she wasn't playing Amber Heard, she was actually playing a character......Do you get what i mean? Maybe my bar is set really low for her and actually this isn't really that good but who knows really......each to your own.All the other performances are really strong Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe and even Dolph Lundgren. They all do well in there respective roles.Now onto the negatives. Firstly the tone of the film, which needless to say is all over the place. In a way it sort of reminds me of the tone of ""Justice League"" or some of the Marvel films, one minute begin serious the next second being light hearted out of nowhere. There are so many ups and downs with the tone that it never really felt like an overall theme or tone to latch onto........Is it just me or am I going crazy. I can't quite put my finger on in it, but there was just a strange tone.Did we really need the character of Black Manta and he's sub-story? There is a lot going on in this film and I just think it might have been helped a little with a bit more of a simpler story with less characters. The character of Black Manta, although there was nothing wrong with the character itself or Yahya Abdul-Mateen II performance its just felt a little shoehorned in.Finally there wasn't anything in the film that made my jaw drop or was really fascinated by. Erm.......................can't find the words to describe it really, the film was just fine there was a lot of it that was forgettable not because it was bad but it wasn't really that great. Ah thats it there was no great moments in the film for me plenty of fine/ok moments, some good directing and performances but nothing......great.Overall this film is just 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out 10 it is ok/average, which is a real bummer because if you'd told me that about 2 and a bit years ago I wouldn't have believe you. I'm just a bit worn out with these films whether that is Marvel and sadly even DC now, and boy have I given DC some passes recently.....I'm looking at you ""Justice League"", ""BVS"" and ""Suicide Squad"". Some good directing from James Wan, two standout performances from Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard but as I said nothing great.......just fine.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Like the other films in the series, it's long, action-packed, and often a little too cheesy. However, it's also tremendously entertaining.Indeed, I've had a surprisingly hard time deciding how much I like this film. While on the one hand, it has great visuals, fun action, and it's wonderfully entertaining. On the other hand, it has fairly poor CGI, cheesy and stupid lines, and pacing that, for the most part, feels odd. However, at the end of the day, movies like Aquaman are meant to be entertaining. And being completely honest, I had a great time with it. By the time it ended, I was cheering for Aquaman, just like I'm sure many others did. And it's that sensation that these films strive for. And if they achieve it, they tend to be quite good. The best example of this, and one that will most likely never be topped, is the Avengers Assemble moment in Endgame. It's a moment of triumph and joy, and no matter how much one might dislike superhero movies, it's hard to dislike a moment like that. And so when I see a new superhero movie for the first time, I always look for that moment of triumph where I can cheer for the hero. If that moment exists, and everything else isn't complete garbage, I really have no reason to dislike the film.The story is what bothered me the most about Aquaman. It follows Aquaman as he starts coming to terms with who he is. He learns that his half brother is planning an invasion from Atlantis to the surface, intending to teach us 'surface-dwelling' humans our place. However, Aquaman, who has lived his whole life on land, has grown quite fond of his home and wants to protect it from the impending invasion. To do so, however, he must claim his rightful place as the king of Atlantis, even though he never wanted to do so.
It's as much of an origin story as an origin story can be. Along the journey, we learn about his past, his powers, and his true destiny. Since it is an origin story, there isn't much to say about it. However, there is a lot to say about the way it was done. You see, stories like this should be simple. They should focus on the character being introduced, and that's it. However, Aquaman doesn't do just that. Not only does it introduce the character of Aquaman, but it also attempts to introduce others, like Black Manta. While I'm sure that it seemed like a good choice, as my understanding is that he is a bit of a fan favourite, the resulting product was needlessly complicated. It added extra to an already long runtime, and it added a plotline that had nothing to do with the actual story being told.Indeed, Black Manta is one of the most useless characters in the whole film. And one of the reasons why it was so difficult to decide how I felt about it. While I'm sure that the character is interesting and even powerful in the comics, the way he is treated in Aquaman, makes him seem weak and pointless. You'd think that a war between worlds would be enough of a threat and plot for a film like this, but alas, it wasn't. However, it's not just the character of Black Manta that bothered me. One of the most striking things was the surprisingly poor CGI. Especially in scenes with close-up action, or just close-up shots of people underwater, it felt cheap and looked weird. I understand that a big part of the movie taking place underwater adds its own challenges, but in a movie like Aquaman, that relies on looking good, I was expecting to see top-notch CGI. And, certainly, some moments look absolutely stunning. Shots that pan around the city of Atlantis, especially, look great. In fact, every time the CGI isn't up close to the camera, it looks fantastic.But, despite all my complaints, I had a great time with Aquaman, and it's certainly of the better films in the DCEU. While the ending, which really is the highlight of the film, comes quickly and out of the blue, it still delivers a satisfying and triumphant conclusion. And while there are elements that shouldn't be there, the focus always remains of Aquaman and his story, amounting to what is fun and entertaining superhero film. Just what it was meant to be.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Beneath all of the cheesiness and the clich√©s you can tell there was heart put into it and that those behind it were very passionate about the project.The underwater setting is quite unique and leads to some visually stunning scenes, the scene where Arthur and Mera enter The Trench for example is particularly aesthetically pleasing. I also quite enjoyed the scenes with young Arthur and his parents, as well as those in which he is being trained by Willem Dafoe's character Vulko.This doesn't however negate the issues the movie has. The plot is convoluted and exposition heavy, they build up Black Manta (Aquaman's answer to Joker or Lex Luthor) as a major antagonist only to have him show up for a five minute fight scene in which Arthur easily disposes of him.There are some attempts to make jokes which often fall flat, as well as strange moments that feel out of place such as a scene in which a weird cover of Toto's Africa by Pitbull is played (What was that about? Because they were in the Sahara Desert which is in Africa?).Perhaps the biggest problem is that they portray Arthur Curry at times as being a complete idiot who is incapable of working anything out by himself, this is to seemingly make Mera's character appear more intelligent and competent than he is.Overall it's a visual spectacle and a fun time but not without it's flaws.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now we have a hydro-hippie who looks like a young, well fed, Willie nelson. This is a good film but is overlong and contains some terrible dialogue. The general acting and effects make up for this though.The wonderful undersea city of Atlantis could be a submerged L.A. from Blade Runner as mini-subs ape the actions of flying-cars. There are Merpeople, Lobster lads and lassies, even creatures from the Trench who resemble Giger's Alien. These are regressed tribes of Atlantis who exist alongside the Human tribes. We see the fall of Atlantis in thew distant past when man's hubris brought about it's destruction. Striking back at te surface-dwellers the Atlanteans send tsunamis crashing ashore, wrecking naval ships and returning decades of pollution to the land.Aquaman wants to prevent war between the occupants of the land and the denizens of the depth, but to do this the half-blood prince will have to claim the throne of Atlantis. Meanwhile he's managed to annoy a pirate who pursues a blood vendetta against him. All good fun if a tad drawn out. 7/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The kaleidoscope of colors in Aquaman are stunning, but are a complete departure from the rest of the universe it's set in. Jason Mamoa is a fun guy to watch and has real potential as an action star but, Bro-seidon of Justice League still lingers in memory.Were this a stand alone film, it might rank higher for me.

I grew up on comics and Aquaman was never an easy character or world. And thus was never really popular or interesting on his own. Usually coming to life when in a role with another character or big story.
But somehow they managed to pull of something amazing, that actually made me really see the character and world in a way I had never thought.
I can absolutely see how critics and those that are so into dissecting and criticizing movies and forgetting that its movie goers who matter. And if they want escapism and fun then who cares what your checklists and technicalities are.
The visuals are awe dropping and I did not even see it in IMAX. They did an amazing job in creating the whole Ocean World, and easily the best SFX so far in the DC World.
The Black Manta character was a bit off and I im not sold on him, found myself more irritated by him than anything. But I think they were trying to must seed him into the future story lines.
If your put off by the critics, ignore them and go and see it. Apart from the real sticklers you will all love it. Just sit back and prepare to be awed and go on an emotional roller coaster.
Its so not like a conventional Super Hero movie, and that is great as why have the same things over and over. It felt more like a Clash Of The Titans journey with an Avatar world of escapism mixed in.","14 out of 30 found this helpful.

I was expecting the story to take a different route but it didn't. Also, it's fast paced and that can be a bit jarring because at times the way it abruptly cuts to a scene that explores another subplot.It feel like it's just another superhero film with just another okay pair of villains. But it's an entertaining one.Why was I entertained and engaged regardless of cliches? I cared about the characters of Aquaman and Mera. I was rooting for them and was invested in their adventures. They learned from each other and what they went through. This is how a character arc works and while it is a pretty simple form of character arc, it works.There are some really awe inspiring visuals in underwater scenes especially near the third act. The use of bright and vivid colors in some of those underwater moments is so good that the same cheesy Aquaman moments in some of the old comics pre-New 52 that you would've thought will never work in live action somehow look great. Action scenes are fantastic as well.While it is beautiful at times, at other times, it looks very very cheesy and artificial. This is one of the negatives that I'm going to discuss in detail. Maybe it's a personal preference but at times the comic book-esque costumes don't mesh well with the world they're inhabiting. This is one of the reasons I don't like visual aesthetic of some of the MCU films. Their worlds look too plain and the costumes end up looking silly.And talking about silly, I have to say that Aquaman should've taken itself a bit more seriously than it did. Jason Momoa is constantly trying to make you laugh, villains are making cheesy entries in slow motion like Bollywood films. It feels DCEU is giving in to MCU's approach in order to please the critics.. I'm not saying MCU films are bad but DC needs it's own signature style. But Aquaman does not feel like it belongs in the same universe as MoS, BvS or WW.I preferred Zack Snyder's dark and gritty style. Snyder knew how to balance realism with comic book visuals. Zack Snyder also brought that sense of ""gods among humans"" to these heroes. In his films, you felt the weight of their powers. How the world reacted to them also added to that but in Aquaman it seems like they have kind of nerfed these powers and brought him down to earth in order to make him more human. Yes Aquaman does a better job at making you care for it's hero than Man of Steel did but it doesn't quite treat it's hero like the godlike being he's supposed to be. I preferred the latter approach (with good writing of course)Back to the pros. Surprisingly, Amber Heard is pretty good in this, I was skeptical about her but she was very charismatic and charming in the role. Jason Momoa did a decent job of carrying the film as well considering he has never really led such a big blockbuster all by himself. Nicole Kidman put on probably one of the best performances in the film. Patrick Wilson was just okay.My verdict is that Aquaman is a flawed but decent ride for film goers. I will not say that it's a step in the right direction for DC because I want them to at least tone down the humor just a little bit especially with characters that are not entirely comedy based.Even with the flaws, it pleased me with heroes that I could root for, certain moments of sheer badassery and nicely tied up character arcs. I hope they improve upon the flaws in the sequel.I give it a 6.8/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Wilson, Dafoe, Kidman weren't enough to save this train wreck. The only likeable character was Temuera Morrison. I was surprised to see Dolph (not a fan) doing a reasonable job.

Ahemm, red-head Princess Mera (Amber Heard) is hot and sexy too, while the secondary villain Black Manta looks exactly from the comic book... a very funny big headed black ant to me hahaha.I tend to agree that 145 minutes is a bit too long for this movie but one thing for sure... it's full of actions and never boring.

One of the founders of the justice league and the butt of all jokes since 1941. Following the events of the justice league film, Arthur Curry(Jason Momoa) is still saving lives and visiting his father on occasion. One day Mera Princess of Xebel(Amber Heard) arrives and tells him that his half-brother Orm(Patrick Wilson) has waged war on the surface and he needs to return with the trident of King Atlan and claims the throne. Jason Momoa is still enjoyable as Arthur however of going for a more relaxed funny Aquaman. There are just moments where they just have jokes and moments that make him just slow & dumb. I understand that they went more for the 90s Barbarian Aquaman, However, there are points where he's just slow. Though his personality does still offer a likable charm given his past with his mother and doesn't care about Atlantis. Mera's with Arthur throughout the whole of the movie. While she does have her moments, she never really does anything to convince him into the mantle of the king the entire time. The film also doesn't warrant the romance between them they hold hands once and have one moment. This is one of the instances where a romantic bond needed to be there for leads. This is Aquaman's Queen and one of the most popular couples in Dc. Orm is pretty good you can tell that the director wanted to go for a more comic over-the-top villain, but still make him come off as a threat. Naturally, he's a more skilled fighter in the water than Arthur. He's meant to have the best interest of Atlantis in mind, but it doesn't show. It just makes him feel less like a guy who feels he's doing is just and best for his people. More just a crazy fanatic who hates the surface. Last, there's Black Manta(Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), having the whole throne war plot with orm wasn't a bad choice, but at the same time, they knew that had to fit Black Manta in there somewhere. He is a pirate who wants Aquaman dead for not saving his father. The problem is that while his suit looks great and the fight with him is done well. The problem is how they did his character where it suffered. This is Aquaman's arch-nemesis and the history between these two is soaked with the blood of loved ones on both ends. However, want they do with Manta and his father doesn't cement that hatred he should have toward Arthur. Honestly, you kind of forget about him for a while. The production design is beautiful and creative from the costume design, even giving Arthur the goldfish armor. Atlantis itself looks good considering the major of this movie takes place underwater, In most movies, you can't see a thing. Everything's bright may be too bright in certain areas. The idea of the 7 kingdoms is a nice expansion. The trench, Brine, and fisherman are welcome additions. The only uncalled-for scene is the deserter kingdom it helps leads to the trident but is that what you expect from Aquaman a desert. Overall despite its flaws, Aquaman is a fun entertaining film that shows off the creativity and quirks the heroes have been denied all these decades.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But the voice in dubbed version is really no match for this superhero guy. I mean take a look at Marvel franchise! It's not hit due to its graphics and cool action sequences but the dubbed version had that impact over the mind of audience. I strongly suggest to redub the voice of Arthur and everything else is just fine. Scenes and sound is great. It has potential to uplift a new franchise. No more darkness and DC likes colors as well. üëç","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, that was not the case.
If i were to write this story, i would write it such that it brings out the part why Arthur deserves to be the King. I would imagine he stole the Golden Trident, with the Trident rejecting him by burning his hands. I would imagine the evil brother declaring war with Earth people, both ready to destroy each other, and then Aquaman stood between the two worlds to stop the war! He sacrificed his own life to shield Atlantis from the attacks of Earth's leaders. His Trident would then be the magical weapon it deserves, and stop the rising gigantic tidal waves in suspension, leaving the homo-sapiens in awe. Hence learning a very important lesson: don't screw with Mother Nature! No more pollution! The Atlantis people would recognize him as their true King, the Earth people developed trust with this half-breed, and the Trident accepted him as it's rightful owner...
Nope...none of that.
However, the CGIs are great, the fighting scenes are quite intense, and all the characters used for this movie are beautiful.
DCU's Aquaman got a chance to shine in this holiday season, since MCU is hanging in suspension...well most of it's characters are half dead...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But let's be real: This movie is objectively bad. The visuals are pretty neat, Momoa is likeable and Manta with his suit is pretty sweet. This however cannot outweigh the ATROCIOUS writing, poor directing, bad directing and poor acting.
One thing at a time: the writing is so lazy, there is no explanation of character relationships (specifically Willem Dafoe & Momoa), the lore is hastly given, and the super hero cliches are bad. This is all on top of THE WORST written script I have ever experienced. Every line of dialogue explained everything that was going on very blatantly. That's not how dialogue works! Additionally there was absolutely zero character development.
Basically everyone outside of Momoa and Herd should be replaced in this movie. The movie was littered with actors who stood out like a sore thumb. Herd was pretty bad too but I have a little faith.
In essence the movie is reminiscent of Green Lantern: neat visuals, likeable leading actors and a cool, promising secondary villain, and an overall trainwreck.","39 out of 74 found this helpful.

Aquaman. The only depth the film had was that it had scenes deep in the ocean. Every character is very superficial and you can tell this was not due to bad actors, but due to the whole script itself. It lacked any kind of originality, which is great for anyone just looking to watch a classic superhero film. Its lack of depth is actually pretty surprising when you remember that it has a run time of 2 and half hours. That would be plenty to write a complex story.But if it didn't have any depth then what did it have? Visuals. Lots of action, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard. Its like the same genre as Transformers really. You just basically go to watch a huge pile of cash. All focus is on being entertained by something happening and looking good, and this it actually does pretty well. Not once was I bored when watching the film and especially the scenes when they are sailing, the ocean looks really good and Amber Heard's hair is super red and shiny.So if you want to see this then at least you are gonna know exactly what you're gonna get and Amber Heard is really hot.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But The king of Atlantis stands apart from all the other DCEU movies to be one of the best DC movies ever made. Visually rich, with a great cinematographic experience and Vision of James Wan, Aquaman is a rebirth of DCEU.
Scenes are spectacular, Acting is at its top with this movie. Jason momoa as Aquaman was perfect in every sense, so as patrick wilson, Amber heard and Nicole kidman.
But the reason of success of movie is a wan himself. Wan's vision to show the world with a vibrant color is noteworthy and to be very frank, deserves a nomination at most of the awards show.
Altogether, VFX makes it so rich and exprerience in 3D makes the deep ocean and action sequence much more vibrant and rich.
World of DC is much more imaginative than MCU and tough to represent. To show the hope of superman, justice of wonder woman, darkness of Batman, speed of flash and brilliance of cyborg, Aquaman gave a base on which Epic mega-structure of DC is possible to be made.

The plot is weak, predictable and dull with no sense of threat, and the few moments of awe or surprise are fleeting. There's a variety of settings and scenes, but they all end in the same way. The special effects are mostly sub-par, and the costumes look cheap and tacky. The acting is good, but there's no real character development and the forced humour is awful.","40 out of 77 found this helpful.

In a kingdom by the sea . . . ."" Edgar Allen Poe's Annabel LeeWhile the women in the audience for character Aquaman/Arthur can ogle Jason Momoa's fit pecs, the men can enjoy the young Amber Heard 's beauty as Princess Mera and for a bonus, that of the nicely-put-together Nicole Kidman as the matriarch Atlanna. And that's all there is folks, at least for adults. For 8-year-old boys, explosions and fights excitingly occupy almost all the film.
Aquaman/Arthur's reluctant struggle to find the magic trident (think a sword in a stone and claim his right to be king of Atlantis follows the usual mythical arc which includes fighting the evil brother, King Orm (Patrick Wilson), and finding the trident. Like the legendary King Arthur, this Arthur must wrest the trident from a monster, not a stone. Otherwise director James Wan can cut back to the lighthouse and Arthur's real father, Temuera (a fit Tom Curry), who waits patiently for the return from the sea of his mermaid wife, Atlanna.
Usually some relief can be had in the CGI setting under water, but here the scenes are so dense with creatures and ruins and, yes, explosions, that you can't digest it all and may end up not appreciating any. Nor can you possibly give a pass for Willem Dafoe, the true actor, with Kidman, in the whole lot. Because I just saw Dafoe play a memorable Vincent van Gogh in Edge of Eternity, I am miffed that he would play the king's vizier, with one line worthy of his acting ability and not any another.Jason Momoa, formerly of a Conan remake, is a physically-appealing choice, for previous iterations have him blonde, blue-eyed, and Thor like rather than the more interesting smoky-eyed, long-tressed surfer/biker dude here. Beyond the physical attributes, Momoa is given next-to-none smart lines or anything to help develop his character.Oh, well, 8-year old boys win this round. Yet, a fetching Kidman can be its own reward for us caregivers.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Aquaman takes place underwater the hole movie and they do a good job with the CGI everything looks Beautiful the movie it has some great shots as well. The movie does kinda follow the same story as Black panther but it's still good. The movie has great 2 villains and a compelling story.Jason Momoa takes on the role of Aquaman he shows a version of Aquaman who doesn't want anything to do with Atlantis he could care less what's happening there. He then becomes more caring for his people and is a badass. Amber Heard is also in this movie and she is terrible in it idk why people keep giving her roles. Patrick Wilson plays Aquamans brother and main bad guy he plays a villain who wants Atlantis to rule. Willem Dafoe does a good job playing the wise man who trained Aquaman. And Yahya Abdul-Mateen 2 plays the secondary villain who is way more badass than the actual Main villain can't wait to see more of him.Overall Aquaman was one of the better Dc comic movies and I hope Dc can continue to make good movies like this one.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Underwater scenes are those non ever seen on screen and a cinematic experience is a must for this one üòç.Plot & StoryThe begging is a slow start and somehow hints that this would be another disappointing DC film as scenes are rushed. For me Narration is just a lazy style of story telling(not a fan) and it does turn me off, but they added present day narration and flash Backs which make it kind of Unique and i would give it a pass for that. The other thing is that the story is plan simple and straight to the Origin story of Establishing the Plot.Action & HumorAction packed film with good fight scenes and well directed Camera Shoots üò±üò± There is one you already saw in the Trailer and it Is well done. After Watching this Film Aquaman ranks Just after Superman and Wonder Woman(sorry Batman but its true) Watching this film makes me Hate Justice League even more as Aquaman is very Powerful and should have been utilized in that film. In terms of Humor 11 out of 20 jokes are funny is all i will say.Where does it stand among DCEU films?Maybe some will disagree, but There is Batman The Dark Night and then AQUAMAN. Yes i said it, it second best.Conclusion.You dont need to be a comic book or Super Hero fan to enjoy this movie. Dear Parents you and your Children will never forget watching such a film, take them and yourself this coming weekend at Fresh View Cinemas I WILL REPEAT, ITS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SUPER HERO FILM EVER.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The next Justice Legend to get his own origins story is Aquaman, but quite when this origins story is set is massively unclear apart from a line of throw away dialogue. However, a quick search online informs me that events in Aquaman take place after the events of Justice League but it would be difficult to tell because events of Justice League seemed to have very little bearing.Anyway, the underwater realm of Atlantis is being pushed to its limits by the surface world's endless polluting of Earth's oceans. This leads to a political discourse where Atlantians decide whether to launch an assault on the surface world. When the surface world (debatable) attacks both Om/Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Doplh Lundgren) the tribes of Xebel and Om join forces to destroy the surface world.The only man who can stop them is Arthur Curry, half man, half Atlantian who harbors a strong resentment towards Atlantis for the execution of his mother as punishment falling in love and having a child with a human. The only way for Arthur to stop Om's destruction of the surface world is to find the Trident of Atlan which is will give command over all ocean life.Such is the legendary and mythological status of these superhero characters in their own universes it is not perhaps surprising that the story is Aquaman is inspired by some of the most famous mythological tales in literature. The most notable being the Legend of King Arthur (the two even share names) where King Arthur is the only one who can pull the sword of Excalibur from the rock much like how only Arthur Curry can wield the trident of Atlan.Other inspirations include Jason and the Argonauts as our heroes face deadly monsters in their quest to retrieve the legendary item - be it the Golden Fleece or the Trident of Atlan. It's here that fault in the movie can be found as the various epic set pieces don't feel tired together by a strong script which, in fact, is as weak as soggy paper. It feels too unconnected as the movie bounds to from epic set piece to epic set piece with the only breaks from the action used as exposition so that we can keep up with everything going on (even if some of it was painfully obvious).The script's jumpy narrative makes the film the bloated mess that it is. However, helping us through it is director James Wan whose experience at helming massive franchises has been of great benefit to him. Working with a massive $200,000,000 budget, Wan has helped create some stunning underworld citadels that retain an element of awe even in his GCI dominated movie universe.Jason Momoa (less said his teenage counterpart the better) is charming and engaging enough in the lead role, but much of the actors' performances are lost in the tidal wave of GCI which, whilst impressive, just leads the actors (and some great ones too) to be swallowed up by the oceans of GCI. With nothing to anchor the film with a strong identity it just gets cast adrift in the vast ocean of superhero movies","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's really creative and a great experience. The fight scenes were also fun and the jokes were good.

There are many movies that themed underwater but not with a massive empire at the bottom of the sea. Many viewers are hating this movie based on their personal opinions like bad story, few superstars, Jason Momoa's bad acting, slow SFX etc. It is true that just like tipical Marvel or DC movies, the count of superstars are very less in this movie and that didn't made this movie bad in my view.
Jason Momoa is a big guy, and his size perfectly fitting with his character. But he couldn't 100% blend with that character in terms of acting, some tweaks are required.
About the movie, I like the underwater empire. It supposed to be huge and massive. But throughout the movie play, we won't get a feel like that. That is the main flaw of the movie. More of a budget empire üòÖ I think. I enjoyed to watch the water creatures that the soldiers are used to ride. The Trench Monsters, Sea Dragons, Battle Lobsters, Tylosaurus. Especially the Karathen, wow! That gigantic creature is almost a nightmare. The director had every possible chance to make this movie great but the limitation of time and may be budget made the move average I guess!
One of the things I more like about this movie is less cracking jokes and more of a serious attitude of all characters throughout the movie, mainly the main actors. In the Thor movie sequels, we can see, the first movie is the best of all. Thor the son of Odin, is really mighty! His talking, attire, actions are exactly resembles a true son of god. But after that movie, every characters are making things less important and making jokes. Thor and Loki didn't seem that concentrated on their respective characters behaviour. This is happening with all the superhero movies nowadays. Cracking jokes irrespective or their characters. Especially in fantasy and mythological movies. But Aquaman is better than that. All the actors are serious in their corresponding roles.
I had great expectation on the coronation at end for new king, but nothing was there. Another flaw in my view. I am not going to be a complete critic about this movie. To be honest, it is better than Spiderman movies (not the old ones), some Avengers and DC movies with too much hype.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Between its messy script, bloated stature, and the fact that it is just too freaking long, you think it would be a total miss. However, what Aquaman lacks in all of these categories, it makes up for with trying actors, and jaw dropping action scenes. The film is predictable at time, and has quite a few cliches, but even with a hard to follow setup (or hard to watch, depending on how you look at it) Aquaman leaves you cheering at the end by a pure sense of an underdog story line. The film has flaws, as does its protagonist, but by the end it'll win your heart, even after the struggles it has made you deal with along the way. The first half of the film can seem like a drag at times, but the second half makes up enough for it. It isn't perfect, but it's a decent try for DC studios, and one that will definitely not be forgotten.My Rating: 6.3/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This one had great elements - directing was good, visuals pretty well done considering, and I did find the main lead actor playing Aquaman entertaining. But and this is a very very big but, aside from him, the worst acting I've seen in a long time. Amber Heard was awful. I mean I couldn't even stay in the plot when I saw her on screen - I just kept thinking about her being Elon Musk's ex. That's pretty far off from the movie's plot. Is she supposed to be a beauty? Because aside from a little cleavage there's just nothing going for her in my opinion. Nicole Kidman a little better but not great and the 2 main evil opponents don't even get me started either. Just bad.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think mostly this is down to my age. I had hoped the movie would be slightly more adult than it is.Jason shines in this role and is by far my favourite aquaman. Yahya also did really well in his role as black lantern. Unfortunately I found the cgi used on other actors facial features somewhat distracting. They all looked like they'd had bad plastic surgery at times.The underwater scenes were fantastical and the movie is visually beautiful. But for me that isn't enough to justify adding stars. I came for the story and to be entertained. In this respect it failed for me. I felt there were a few holes in the story and his abilities seemed inconsistent.Another failure was in marrying the comedy with the serious. At times I was watching a dramatic action film at other times a cheap comedy sketch. It never quite pulls off either. I think this was to please the younger audience (since the jokes were both childish and predictable)One aspect I loved was the ocean throwing out its garbage. Pollution was a theme throughout the movie and I loved this. Hopefully some fans will take note of the message being sent.Overall I think kids, teenagers and young adults will love this movie. But those of us hoping to finally see an aquaman for grown ups will be disappointed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A tale of underwater kingdoms at war with top tier melodrama and an Indiana Jones style treasure hunt in the second act for good measure. It's achingly sincere, unashamedly silly and visually exciting in a way this genre is supposed to be but frequently prevents itself from being.Jason Momoa makes the role of Aquaman his own, even managing to pull off the classic outfit. Completely reinventing it to fit his lovable personality and it's all the better for it. Amber Heard makes for a great co-lead and her chemistry with Momoa is definitely at its strongest when leaning into the comedic rapport rather than any romantic connection.The villains aren't as strong whilst still serving their purpose well enough. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is introduced well enough and given ample motivation to be a worthy rival; however the film doesn't really know what to do with him. Patrick Wilson fairs a little better with a commanding presence and more than enough shouting.James Wan's direction stays true to himself within the franchise studio system yet again. The camera rarely stays still in the action, delivering some trademark oners (or Waners) and his horror sensibilities get to make a brief appearance. The CG struggles to convey that everyone is underwater but for the most part it's really impressive with Atlantis itself being a vibrant highlight.Rupert Gregson-Williams really leans into the melodrama for his score. It's very varied with synth flourishes, a bit of generic rock and roll and that glorious melodrama, which kind of holds the whole thing together. On the other end, the soundtrack just dials up the insanity with a random collection of songs that always come out of nowhere.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's a wonder why this fella never got one theatrical release pre-2018, because so many iconic characters out there are just busting to be featured in these kinds of movies. Aquaman feels like it could have been released in 2004 and still would have had a similar response at the box office. It's got water, action, photogenic people populating the world it's set in and pop-music ranging from the 80s to now. It's got all the hallmarks of a blockbuster that's trying to cater to EVERYONE it possibly can. I guess this is something of a course correction for DC Comics Films.Aquaman is a step in the right direction in that it's more confident in its direction than Justice League or Suicide Squad were, but it's not the near-perfect movie-comic-mythology synthesis Wonder Woman had going for it. However a step in the right direction is better than a gigantic step backwards. I'm eager to see where the rest of Arthur Curry's story goes from here.Here's hoping that the rest of DC's upcoming movies can have the same self-confidence Aquaman does in its story and bombastic action.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Other than that, really enjoyed the movie, my advice, turn off your brain and enjoy this movie for what it is, big action in a visual marvel of an underwater world.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

No? Flat? Tepid? Too reliant on computer-driven effects? Lacking in logic? Overlong? My bottom line is that it was a fine movie, one that doesn't hinder DC's continuing effort to make movies. It does feature some strong performances (Momoa, Heard, Kidman, Wilson), but there's way too many myths and legends crammed in. In fact, there were times when I felt like I was watching an Indiana Jones movie than a superhero movie. There were more Maguffins in this movie than there were human actors. Also, while one certainly must suspend one's disbelief for these movies, it's counterintuitive to proclaim certain rules for a new (to the audience) setting and then either ignore those rules or break them outright. It's also not a good idea for a hero or heroine to forget they have certain abilities until the plot says it's time to wrap up the scene And let's try to ignore the cliches, while we're at it. But, all in all, I'll give it a B for effort.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jason Momoa was not exactly the perfect selection for the lead role but he was still able to deliver. Nicole Kidman really sold it in this film. She is phenomenal in every role she plays.

All the best jokes were in trailers rest of it was cringe. Movie was a drag at times but my main problem is that they misused Black Manta. Either use him properly or don't have him in the movie. Because we spent alot of time in the beginning to see Black Manta's story to only have a half arsed end(but his suit was awesome ). People are saying that Aquaman didn't focus on setting up sequels or anything, all the scenes with Black Manta were shit and a setup. Movie could have been great If you cut Black Manta out, make Ocean Master's intentions true to his cause, the only way to survive is to finish surface dwellers instead of using the fu**ing inside job villian again.
Best fight sequence was the first fight in the light house. It was the best directed sequence of the movie along with Trench dive scene.
Sound track was awful.
And don't say Aquaman is cool now. Geoff Jhones had already done that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Never a dull moment as it moves quickly and without long winded character expositions that have dragged down previous DC films. The underwater visuals are the gold standard here, much like Avatar did eons ago, and the action is just as breathtaking. Most of the dialogue was uninspired hero encouragement (like lesser ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and without the same emotional weight). There are a few questionable scenes/concepts that may cause some brain cells to drown themselves.My main complaint is the audio mixing, primarily with the dialogue being way too low compared to the bgm most of the time. Compounding this, they add an echo-like effect for underwater scenes, which sounds like an immersive idea but only makes the words less clear and not easily understandable.But if you see one last film this year, you can't go wrong with this.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I thought the plot was utter thin and way to predictable. There was almost no character development and all the jokes fell flat.
The dialogue consisted of oneliners and over-dramatic stuff. Like, not every dialogue needs music!This movie has also one of the worst sub-plots i have ever seen and goes nowhere. The movie would be the same without it. I laughed a few times at the many cheesy moments in this movie.

The character design and world building are great. My one gripe is, like most DC/WB movies is way too heavy handed.

The action scenes are well depicted in CGI infested sceneries. Just like in his previous works, calm scenes are often interrupted with loud noise that introduces action; too often, that it appears repetitive.PLOT: In summary, it's a good adventure that takes enough of its time to deliver an enjoyable story. However, more could have been done on the character development with the time that was put in.CHARACTERS/CASTS: we have a hero that offers very little apart from his seductive charm. He is very quickly on top of things even as his challenges become increasingly difficult. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard were charming.
The villains are somewhat deplorable. We have an ever grumpy Black Manta whose role is unnecessary; working with a power hungry, warmongering King Orm whose tender looks simply do not match his malevolence.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Though he wasn't the main villain. It's a great take on aquaman, though they definitely have room to grow with the acting. Not perfect by any means, but it was so fun to watch that I couldn't help but talk about it all night with my wife during the drive home. Will definitely buy when it comes out.

YOU WONT REGRET IT. CHARACTERS ARE RICH AND GOODLOOKING. THE STORY IS SIMPLE AND CLEAN. THE PICTURE AND COLOURS ARE GREAT.
I seriously can't stand some crazy marvel fans' behaviours. Some people did not even watch the movie and gave one star and said some shady things about DC. Having a stereotype, refusing to give a great movie a chance and simply giving a judgement by some silly things like team DC or team MARVEL. That is the definition of being stupid.","25 out of 61 found this helpful.

He was always that weird cousin that everybody just kinda puts up with and halfheartedly oohs and aahs when he tells a dolphin to pull a rope. So, firstly, props to Jason Momoa for bringing the grit and toughness to this superhero. He makes Aquaman cool, if for the first time ever. Also, the movie is beautiful. The fight scenes are well shot and the CGI makes every land a picturesque landscape of color and flash. Also, Amber Heard is absolutely gorgeous in this movie. Her red hair and outfits pop every time she's on the screen. The story, however, is kind of all over the place. How do they stop pollution? Isn't it a bad thing to let someone die? What are these people's motives? The film feels like its a bit too long as well. Did I enjoy the experience of the movie? Yes. Would I watch it again like I would other current superhero films? No. Still, great job making Aquaman a cool and valuable character again in the DC Universe.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule. But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end. Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face. WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work. It just looks like a parody and not a well done one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I expected a good movie (based off of the 10/10's on this site) but was let down after the screening. This film is essentially black panther, another fairly average movie, but killmonger and T'challa have switched roles.The first and most important thing to address is the ""romance"". Aqua man and Ariel or whatever her name is have some of the most forced development I have ever seen. They just stare at each other and hold hands/kiss to show they are falling in love. They don't have a great dynamic or anything, it just kind of happens because the movie wants it to happen.Another thing to address is the costume design. I feel like I could see these at a comic convention. Pretty solid for some random guy to design, but terrible for a movie with this budget. Everything looks like plastic with scales engraved in them. The worst part is the villains who aren't Atlantian. You would think they could've escaped the terrible costumes and they almost did. Then they come back dressed as one of the bad guys from power rangers.Something else I have to mention, the clich√© of it all. I know it's a super hero film, so it's bound to have something familiar but nonetheless, I hold this to the same standard as every other film. The underdog story resembles that of something from a Cars film, A boxing movie, a super hero movie, or literally any movie with the ""Protagonist loses first major stand off and becomes better to beat the villain the next time. It's a played out way of representing character development and conveying a story. Superhero movies have done without this. Logan, The ENTIRE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY, and Watchmen to name a few.The CGI. It's a DCEU film. That's all I have to say.The action scenes are glorious (sarcasm). I kid you not, every five seconds, BOOM, an explosion from the side knocks a character off their feet. The bad guys come from either above or below, and mediocre coreography ensues. If there isn't an explosion to start, it's not an action scene. At least not to the poor saps who wrote this movie. A superhero movie should deliver on entertaining action and I was laughing, so props for that.All in all, this is a film for kids looking to see the Stars wars to hit the ocean floor. It's not average, it's fairly below average and even laughable at times, but go watch it if your into cheesy stuff. It's a fun movie and you won't be bored. At least not during the action sequences. 4/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

For those that care, everybody plays their respective roles pretty well and any Hammond's only adds to the overall feel of joy.The sound in the imax cinema was thunderous, chairs shaking.... music was equal parts over the top and dramatic, again much like the rest of the film.Effects are stunning, albeit some of the de-ageing effects are great but still a little too unreal to completely sell the process.See this on the biggest screen available to you.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

this is not a masterpiece. its a above average movie because story was fully predictable, trailer contains most of movie best parts and the main problem for this Movie was that it contains many comic movies Cliches which it should have some of them but not this much.
at all this movie is good entertaining and exciting in the level of black panther or a little lower. its not in a same place as The Avengers series or guardians of the galaxy but as I said befor its a good Movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Acting all round was shocking. Patrick Wilson as the bad guy??? COME ON!!!!

However I decided to give it a go and must say I quite enjoyed it. It has a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe in that it's very colorful and over the top. Action sequences are extremely well done and quite a few scenes are just stunning in terms of lighting and effects. The story is fairly basic but unpredictable enough compared to the standard superhero movie to be a bit more engaging. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out more but Jason Mamoa was a perfect casting choice and really steals the show. The pacing is ok, I was never bored but some scenes felt a bit rushed and others seemed to go on for a bit longer than was really necessary. I found myself wanting a bit more humor and a little less campiness (the costumes especially were a bit much for me) but overall I found the film to be enjoyable and refreshing compared to the rest of the DC movies. Aquaman is essentially a big 80's cartoon brought to life with truly stunning cinematography and a strong cast. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's not bad but it's not goood? Let me just give you the bad first. This movie is too long. I kinda felt the same about Wonder Woman as well, but I really felt it here. You could've easily cut down a half hour of this movie and nothing about it would've changed. The story is serviceable but not new. It bears similar resemblance to a Marvel Phase 1 movie so like: Thor 1, Captain America 1, but it lacks the performances and charisma of either of those. I like Patrick Wilson as an actor but King Orm is no Loki. He's pretty one note and cliched as the movie's villain. The visuals were a double edged sword so for the bad I would say it just got way too distracting for me. Infinity War had tons of cgi too but I was invested enough to ignore what wasn't actually real. And lastly, I'm just gonna say it, Aquaman's story is NOT interesting. Call me a hater but I've never liked Aquaman I'm sorry! There's a reason Family Guy keeps making fun of him all the time. Ok but what's good about this movie? Actually there's a lot of good things. The movie's visuals while distracting were colorful. The DC cinematic universe has stumbled with the Zack Snyder look that's just gloomy, lifeless, and boring. Aquaman actually tries to course correct the ship by creating a really bright and well animated world through Atlantis. The action is epic and ambitious because I can tell James Wan is a confident director. He definitely gave this movie a nice look so kudos to him on that. And lastly Jason Momoa, I can't deny how much I love him in the role. His character isn't written as well as it could be, but he does what he can, and he's so goofy I love it. It sounds like I hate this movie but I actually don't. It just feels like it's trying to get out of their past mistakes by making a safe and marketable movie. Which is fine. But I wanted something new and different. Here's hoping Shazam can give me what I'm looking for from DC. Should you go see it? Well.. If you're not into superhero movies you're probably not gonna care for this one either. If you want to see some good action and Jason Momoa doin his thing then I'd say it's alright. 7/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Great Entry in DCEU but Too Long & Too Convoluted","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4854697/?ref_=tt_urv","MinistryofDoom","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29945421/?ref_=tt_urv","15 May 2019","Through DCEU's Aquaman, I discovered that there is, in fact, such a thing as ""too much"" when it comes to movies. Aquaman is nearly two and a half hours in length. Even though it is shorter than the ridiculous 3hr+ run time of Batman vs Superman, it still feels like too much. Normally, I wouldn't complain. I'm an avid movie-goer and would generally enjoy watching a lengthy story, but the 2.5hr length of this film made me groan and wonder when it will be over. Had it been a better film that kept me on the edge of my seat in excitement, I wouldn't even have noticed but this felt like all the epic grandeur of a Star Wars adventure minus the thrills and excitement, and that risks the onset of boredom. The story itself is needlessly complex and burdened by the weight of too many secondary sub-plots. We get it. Aquaman is discovering his destiny. He's on a mission to reclaim his rightful place as heir to the throne of Atlantis. That's a pretty straight forward story. Go with that. Why they had to introduce all these extra elements and side missions is beyond me.
It genuinely seemed like the producers wanted to incorporate as much of the comic book mythos as possible in the span of one film. It felt like they went out of their way to get all the locations, all the characters and species of creatures and mortals alike, in the comic books and highlight them in the film. It's almost as if they anticipated the criticisms of comic book and superhero purists who would challenge them on their choices and sought to go out of their way to ensure that those groups would catered to, and as a result, it felt forced. For instance, not only did you have Aquaman's plot to reclaim Atlantis, but you also have wars between several different races of underwater people resulting from the politics of this imaginary place we're only briefly aware of, as well as a sub-plot focused on the revenge of a black-ops mercenary turned laser-faced super villain named Black Manta (who just felt tacked on and unnecessary btw). The film also features gladiatorial combat involving sea creatures (which post-Thor Ragnarok felt like a rip-off). Heck it even had a giant Octopus playing tribal war drums. I'm not joking. The story was silly. Basically, Aquaman must reclaim his rightful place as the heir to the throne of Atlantis but in order to do that he has to go to a particular place to find a thing, so that he could take the thing to the other place to do the other thing. All the while fighting Atlanteans, and humans, and super-villains, and naval sub-marines, and simultaneously remembering all of the super-secret training he received from Willem Dafoe, to become an Atlantean Warrior, which we are slow-drip fed via flashbacks throughout the film. Oh and he falls in love. Of course.
Frankly, I would have preferred if they had split it into 2 films or condensed it by cutting out a lot of the extra stuff that did not move the film forward at all. Aquaman can talk to animals, he can ride waves, he can summon sharks and whales, and control the element of water and do cool stuff with it but none of these special powers are ever used when the need arises. If he can summon a school of killer sharks to do his bidding, then why doesn't he just summon them to eat his enemies and be done with it?
As far as acting, Jason Mamoa, just doesn't have any skills. He's good at flexing his muscles and looking intimidating, which, I guess, is good enough for a superhero film. His best asset is his looks. It's when he has to deliver lines that he looks awkward and out of his element (no pun intended). His portrayal of Aquaman is a very sharp contrast to the traditional look of character. One wonders where the line is drawn on the look of a superhero. For instance, Batman looks like Batman. He has a cowl and pointy ears and Superman has a red cape and blue tights, much like how Superman is traditionally supposed to look. So then why did DC/Warner opt to portray Aquaman as a tattooed biker that probably smells like fish instead of dressing him in green and orange tights with fish scales on them?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

James Wan while I don't like him, has his own directing style that makes this movie so much different from the rest of DCEU. Plus, the underwater fight sequences are quite enjoyable.
When I said that: ""Aquaman is very flawed"", I was referring to the acting performances and the screenplay. Momoa and Patrick Wilson are doing a decent job, but the rest of the cast, even Dafoe and Nicole Kidman are atrocious in it. There is not much to say about the screenplay other than it is plain stupidity.
For the reasons that I mentioned in the first paragraph, Aquaman is probably the second-best DCEU film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Greatest movie ever! Ignore the haters! Ten out of Ten!Here is a real review,.This is a CGI overblown, loud, badly written, badly directed and with a few exceptions, badly acted movie.The hero of the film was better off in Game of Thrones where he just needed to look mean most of the time, and flex his muscles.William Defoe is badly miscast, the story is confusing, there are many, many locations, and there are three seperate bad guys. It is a terrible mish mash and a shining example of why, if you write the script, you shouldn't also direct it!At the start of the movie I thought I was going to enjoy what looked like an over the top, humourous paradoy. Then I realised they weren't joking.Because I was given no interest in what happened to the characters I found the countless fights and battles boring. I spent most of the movie closing my eyes and listening to the sound effects. At times I was lucky enough to fall asleep, which made this way too long film, feel slightly shorter.At this movie I had my first Choc Ice in many years. An ice cream that can't be beat. It is made to a consistent formulae. Given the amount of money and the top actors dedicated to this movie, it left me wondering why they hadn't used a similar tried and tested formulae and kept it simple. Instead, we have one big watery mess.","25 out of 47 found this helpful.

The story is engaging and the characters are fun and interesting. The visuals were also stimulating, what with all of the different fish, the drumming octopus, and the beautiful city of Atlantis, just to name a few.
The jokes often seemed a little out of place however, which throws off the viewer slightly. Jason Moamoa does action and drama much better than he does comedy.
All in all, this was a surprising movie. The acting was good, the story was original-ish and complimented the characters nicely, and the visuals were beautiful. 7/10 only because I can't bring myself to give Aquaman anything higher.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Wan has created a world rich in colour, vibrance, and depth. The details are astounding. Best visually insane movie since Avatar.Story: Predictable, a bit yes. But which superhero movie is not? Is it predictable from the beginning? - NO.Humor: Not cheesy as some reviews say. The humor doesn't feel forced, like with some Marvel movies. The movie will give you 2 hours of joy ride, and you'll never regret the money or time spent on it.Emotional Depth: The movie already has an emotional core(The connection of Arthur and his parents). Although it's not that much emotionally resonant, it does a good job of balancing the tone.Villain: The Villain has a real good reason. He's also right, in some ways, although not in his solution plans. All his rage can be felt with his words. I'd compare his character to MCU's Killmonger, who also lives and fights for a cause. And while in the Black Panther movie, for some people, some things feels like a racial agenda and see's the white people as the bad guys, in Aquaman, all the surface dwellers are seen as the bad guys in the view of the villain. There's no feel of any agenda or anything.
Verdict: 10/10. Everything is awesome and purely mind blowing, while still delivering a message which affects the real world.","28 out of 72 found this helpful.

He goes on a quest to retrieve the legendary Trident of Atlan and protect the water world.I thing this is the time when the film makers making the film on the superhero genre needs to come out of their shell and try something new in this genre apart from saving the world and mankind type of scripts. I will not say that the film is bad but the film is too simple and predictable that there is nothing much exciting.Acting is good and in my opinion Willem Dafoe was little under used and Amber Heard is little overused (Not getting prejudiced against her due to ongoing Johnny Depp case) but she sometime irritates.Screenplay of the film is cliched, plain and gets boring and doesn't excites much. Climax of the film is equally predictable. VFX of the film is superb and deserves an appreciation.Overall another plain and predictable superhero film which runs on safe path of film making.

Screw you if you're expecting me to dunk on this, I had fun with it. A hell of a lot of fun, in fact. It's hands down the most purely enjoyable film from the DCEU so far, but I also think that it might have the most legitimately good things going for it too.For some reason they got James Wan of Saw and The Conjuring fame to direct this, and while that was an...unconventional choice, let's say, I really feel like he tried, and mostly succeeded, to give it some personality. There's genuinely some memorable and nice-looking shots in this, which is far more than I can say for anything in this series that came before this.You know what else this has that the rest of the franchise sorely lacks? A sense of bloody wonder to it. I actually really like the designs of the kingdoms of Atlantis, because I just can't argue with things like a city of giant crabs, people riding domesticated sharks into battle, or a goddamn kraken playing the drums in a coliseum battle. And yeah, the politics of the kingdom isn't terribly interesting, but I really did find it nice to look at.Oh don't get me wrong, the CGI is as awful as it ever is in these films, but that didn't change how I felt about the locations in concept, even if Black Manta looks like a cartoon character awkwardly plopped into this world.You know who else really felt like they were trying? Jason Momoa. I wasn't lying when I said he was probably the best part of Justice League, and he brings that likable energy and then some to this role again. He actually manages to make Aquaman, the long time punching bag of the DC universe, pretty cool, and that's no small feat as far as I'm concerned.For a film that's nearly 2 and a half hours long, it's really well paced, because the time absolutely flew by and I was never bored, and oh my god the main character in this DCEU film actually has something of a character arc that makes sense. Fancy that.By no means is it great though, all I said is that I had fun with it. While nearly all the actors feel as though they are trying, and mostly succeed, Amber Heard could almost have been replaced with a literal fish and you could have got a more convincing performance out of it. I know we already have enough reason to hate her, but she really isn't good in this. And who could forget teenage Aquaman...I know he's only there for two minutes, but what a memorable two minutes he makes it, for all the wrong reasons.The story isn't overall anything special, the soundtrack is godawful, and some of the dialogue is really cheesy, but screw you and the shark you rode in on, I thought it was just as much, if not more fun than I had with Old, and you should all watch it.

It seemed there was too much happening at once, and after seeing the movie, that's exactly the case.The main storyline is clear and easy to understand. It promises a good movie for sure. But the main storyline gets clouded with unnecessary side-plots, which aren't thought out very well. This wouldn't have been a problem, hadn't there been as man plot-holes.
I get that DCEU wanted to make it about pollution of the Earth's oceans, but it felt forced. The wannabe Ocean-master just seems like he wants to rule.The movie was very one-dimensional. The dialogue is the worst I've ever heard in a fiction-flick. Too much CGI. The soundtrack was beautiful though, sometimes a bit misplaced maybe.Momoa's performance was great, he is very well suited for this role. The cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful as well, true eye-candy.It isn't a superb movie, but it's a lot better than Justice League, and it's certainly a step into the right direction for the DCEU. I'm sure that there are great moies coming.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He then grows up to single-handedly avert maritime disasters, foil modern-day pirates and pal around with the Justice League.It's Jason Momoa, of course, in a fascinating bit of casting that's worked out very well despite (or, perhaps, because of) his total dissimilarity from the classic character's original design. Aquaman probably should look different from the rest of the JLA, and in addition to his Polynesian appearance, Momoa sports a natural grace and fluidity in the water that pairs well with his brute physicality. Not everyone can look smooth and cool while hefting a nuclear submarine from the ocean depths, but this guy makes it a dynamic spectacle.That's where this standalone Aquaman shines: inserting its star into spectacular poster-friendly moments, pumping up the jams and capitalizing on the easy returns. Those action scenes succeed where most of the story does not. The plot, a disjointed mix of political maneuvers, vengeful sons and mythic treasures, is a wishy-washy mess that stumbles and bumbles from one predictable turn to the next. It's exposition central, a cavalcade of breathless details, but still manages to leave dozens of gaping logic holes untended. There's no flicker between Momoa and his female counterpart, a stiff-lipped Amber Heard, so their romantic connection feels sudden and empty. Even Willem Dafoe struggles to make anything of a rather large supporting role, saddled as he is by bad dialogue and a bland character arc.I enjoyed the big and loud and shiny bits, appreciated the vision of a science fiction story where all the dazzling technological advances have taken place beneath the waves, rather than overhead in the stars, but couldn't overlook the flimsy fabric holding it all together. There's something here; we can't quite see it yet.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

I will get into that later. However, there is some impressive work done in this movie that does deserve credit.The visuals of the whole film are pretty well done. Most of what I am referring to takes place in the under water CGI world. Director James Wan has always liked soft blue's and strong red's in his movies. It is cool to see how that transitioned into an underwater action film. The visual world can SOMEWHAT be compared to the visual world of James Cameron's Avatar.
The action was another crowing jewel in the film. The section of the storyboard which was action did better than any other DCU movie. Everything about it was entertaining and left my attention closely tied to the screen. The fighting choreography was very impressive.
When you combine the amazing visuals with creative action- you really do find something to awe at. If you watch this movie for any reason, watch it for this....and I guess Jason Momoa is a pretty fun actor.Now for why I did not particularly love this move...
Did anybody else feel like they were watching a live action anim√©? This film had every clich√© moment and cheesy line in the book. The whole thing is built much like an anim√© piece. Corny screen play, corny dialogue between characters, rushed dialogue, rushed story board, and corny movie scores that come on too often and too hard. Not to diss on anim√©, I just don't think it works well within live action hero movies.
Its tasking for the audience to take any serious moment honestly serious. This film was just written with too many cheese filled lines. It is easy to feel like you are watching a Disney Channel Orignal Movie.
With a cool actor like Jason Momoa, you have the opportunity to have some pretty good comic relief. Though the writers of the film did try to capitalize on this, they failed epically. To make it worse, any funny part of this movie was scored with stupid piano Disney style music.
The movies cheese and corn meter sky-rocketed as the film went down the montage check list. The ""falling in love montage"", the ""training montage"", the ""bad guy gearing up montage"" and enough surprise explosions to make a montage.Over all, I was pretty disappointed with the film.
If you ever find your self just wanting to watch a popcorn action flick, this one isn't too bad. If you ever find yourself wanting to watch a well written and creative film, avoid this one at all costs.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is a lot of stuff thrown in to try force humour into DC that doesn't land or is just awful.There are some good elements - fight scenes with Aquaman are good, his parents relationship actually means something, Dolf Lundgren being 100% Dolf, etc.,I would rush to see it but would watch if it was on the TV.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

DC needs to do what they are doing now. Make the second tier characters (yes Wonder Woman is part of DC's trinity, but still a far third to Batman and Superman) special and save the big guys, Batman and Superman, for Justice League and team up movies. Aquaman hit on so many levels too. Fantastic visuals. Great action. And even a tight story without being overly dark. Well done DC, well done indeed!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Solid main lead with occasionally well placed humor, good use of ancient mythology, sick action scenes from everyone involved in the movie and absolutely beautiful cinematography with a diverse world that has been created under the water.The best part is that unlike any other Marvel/DC movie, you forget that Aquaman is an actual super hero because of how immersive the story is.Bad part is that some of the scenes feel like they are stapled together instead of having a smooth flow. Oh and the song selection leaves more to be desired; however, the music that was used in the movie is good.Overall, this is no Wonder Woman but still a very good DC movie that is enjoyable in the cinema just for its sheer cinematography, action and a good cast that gels well together.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

There is plenty to be excited about and its visually spectacular. Hell if we went by the first ten minutes this would be a ten. DC always does what DC does, thats take itself too seriously. Ant Man and Deadpool are perfect examples from Marvel where you practically take the piss out of yourself and still be great. DC are known for darkness are mystery, Aquaman is meant to be light hearted.
This movie in particular as stated earlier starts off excellent, character development and storyline. Also off the bat Jason Momoa is perfect for the role with his wit and general persona. The actual main plot is very thin though (even for Dolph Lundgren standards). Im by no means saying dont go, however just lower your expectations a little bit. Its overly long for what it needs to be.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That was surprising because the movie didn't have a dull moment, and was visually amazing. But maybe that was part of the reason: an overload of CGI, anti-aging, and failing to slow down long enough for us to really connect to the characters.
The pros:
Colorful visuals and unique underwater effects.
Fast pacing.
Diverse characters and creatures.
Some fan throwbacks, like the Aquaman telepathy rings.The cons:
Too much cgi, making it too unbelievable.
Acting was mediocre.
Plot was predicatable.
Time was irrelevant and not respected.
Faces looked almost animated and unrealistic (if that's what saltwater does for aging, I'm in!)
The distinction between humans and meta humans was not always respected, as humans thrown and beaten severely often get right back up and continue the fight. And the unclear rule about who can or cannot breathe above water was not well thought out (they all evolved from land, but then devolved?)Overall, it was entertaining, but nowhere close to Wonder Woman. I may have even liked Justice League more than this one. Go see it in the theater for the visuals, especially if you have passes or discounts. Eat some popcorn and turn your inner critic off, and you'll enjoy it enough!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

When you watch Aquaman, you are left with the newly emerging (and very real) condition of CGI-fatigue. Nothing you see before you registers as real, in your brain, because nothing that moves a certain way in water moves that way in this film. One exits the long, dizzying experience feeling like they've just watched a long video game. Nothing is scary anymore. Nothing is exciting or suspenseful, because the filmmakers use no visual restraint in their storytelling. The excess of CGI use in films like Aquaman have just made us stop caring.Jason Momoa mumbles out his words without any charisma or life; he comes across like an early and unpolished version of The Rock, and his lack of acting experience stands out in stark contrast to veterans like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe.Where Aquaman fails in engaging the audience in a compelling story through its weak acting and visual diarrhea, it does make up for in one area - costume design.","22 out of 41 found this helpful.

Bring on Justice League 2 with the original cast and Wan in the drivers seat.

It has lovely scenery , beautiful colors and an interesting plot.Jason Momoa is a perfect casting decision to play Aquaman. I feel like he could carry this movie alone on his shoulders.Unfortunately , he cannot fix a bad script.Aquaman overall feels to me very uninspiring. There was absolutely nothing unique to his story. The plot in general was interesting enough to enjoy it but a battle for throne could have been much more.It just feels like Arthur doesn't deserve the title to be Aquaman unlike his comics. Even he says the same thing in this movie.He is not a bad guy , he is fighting for what he thinks is right but there could have been so much more to say about us humans and Atlantians ( who see us just as polluters and killers ) .In that way this movie feels like a missed opportunity.CGI is well done and there are some pretty nice looking effects but after about 45 minutes it just looks like a CGI noise. It gets to the point where you are sick of looking at Atlantis and just hope the movie changes the location.Black Manta villain was definitely interesting and a good casting choice but the movie once again missed a great opportunity to make HIM the main villain.Overall , Aquaman was a fun adventure with a light hearted humor that doesn't always land but fills the blanks , exactly like this movie in DCEU. It exists for me just to fill the blank spots.PlatinumanYT 6.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Aquaman created 70+ years ago when science (crude compared to today) for young adults was poor at best. A time when ancient myths such as Atlantis held sway in people's imaginations. Atlantis a city w/humans? Living at the bottom of the ocean. Never mind pressures & its effects at different depths, and even how cities could be constructed;. How human Atlanteans could breathe w/out gills or any other mode of O2 absorption; how they could talk at any depth & in perfect English (try talking under water and see how H2O density makes speech unintelligible). How there could be a paradise of trees & waterfalls at the Earth's core (forget pressure; thousands of degrees heat; molten iron).Usual script hooks of bullying of young Aquaman; lots of lasers & martial arts kicks (also found in recently released Bumblebee); lots of strength displays like lifting a submarine out of the water, but oddly it takes more effort to just toss a human about. Lots of stereotyping of characters - formula good 'n' bad. Our underwater humans say they have the greatest military on the planet yet they're riding around on giant seahorses & sharks. The one positive to the movie was the justification for war against the surface because our plastic pollution (millions of tons per year) is destroying their habitat. Appropriately we get a real scene with hills of plastic garbage being thrown back at us.","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

It's just so basic.Awww, James Wan. How you've been bought out. I mean, good for you, as a director and creator, you've come so far...to earn so much. But, you've also left your soul behind in that dirty SAW basement to enter the depths of the oceans and sell out to DC.But, anyways, I didn't hate this movie. It was so much like Black Panther - just OK. So mediocre, so bland, so formulaic. There was nothing new here...aside from so many swear words that were just added in for ""depth."" The edge! Now, I'm no prude. I swear up and down, but here it felt forced.Anyways, we have reluctant Aquaman who's hell-bent on not being the King he's supposed to be that he journeys the entire movie to become said King. Oh, and insert sets, conflicts and villains A-B-C on his journey. And lest, I forget, his relationship with Not-Scarlett Johansson plays a part.So this Fish-Outta-Water-Film is the classic tale of self-discovery with a 1000% CGI. Though I am NOOOO CGI fan, I guess there's really little alternative here. We have The Little Mermaid made into a live-action battle, √† la The Phantom Menace.And now, back to knocking the lands across the ocean. They see 1 movie for every 100 I see, so yeah, I have a right to say this was bad overall, though still watchable. It's just not great as: let's earn a billion and become the greatest DCEU film. It's certainly not the best, but I can see where people connected with it.Just wish they would've explored the whole pollution thing a tad farther. Yeah, us humans suck and it's only briefly mentioned here. Stand up, stop polluting the oceans and it's sooo beyond those damn straws.***Final thoughts: Yep, this is the highest grossing worldwide DCEU movie, but far from the best one:1. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition
2. Man of Steel
3. Wonder Woman
4. Suicide Squad: Extended Cut
5. Aquaman
6. Justice League","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

Nicole Kidman's performance as Queen Atlanna who falls in love with the lighthouse keeper Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) was a great start. The birth of their son Arthur and his eventual maturity into our land and sea hero Aquaman (Jason Momoa) was very entertaining as well.Willem Dafoe who plays Vulko, as both the principle advisor and conscience of the self-annointed King Orm (PatrickWilson) as well as the battle weary instructor to King Orm's half brother Aquaman is also a key role in the storyline.My interest started waning when we were introduced to the cartoonish raven haired sea queen Mera (Amber Heard) who although she was promised to wed King Orm, is obviously smitten by Aquaman and his constant grunting. It is about at this juncture when Mera and Aquaman are teamed up with Vulko in an effort to stop King Orm from proceeding with his diabolical plan to join all the sea kings under his leadership against the earth's surface humans to wipe us off the face of the world when we realize a battle is brewing. Up until this juncture the use of CGI was utilized sparingly and with good taste. As the two half brothers King Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Aquaman (Jason Momoa) are pitted against each other both feeling the presence of their missing mother Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) the film takes a sharp turn to the left and the writer/producer/director's take the cheap way out and rely mainly on CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) to complete their epic story line. So much of the same crash and burn CGI as in many other prior Marvel films it is quite frankly a bore.As the last ten (10) minutes of the film ending kind of redeems the preceding 45 minutes of far too much CGI, if a sequel is to be made Jasom Momoa as Aquaman, Patrick Wilson as King Orm and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna are worthy of a repeat, but I strongly urge the producers to forget about Mera (Amber Heard) and replace her with a more energized and realistic female lead that can act (boy was she baaaaad).I have assessed the overall film with a decent 7 out of 10 rating. The first half is exciting - the second half is mostly CGI and a bit of a let down, not like in the ocean but similar to a stinky toilet flushing.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well, it's not perfect but it's actually better than expected. It seems the character has gotten some justice now with a grand scale movie that's solely about his story. Jason Momoa still goes around with his ""surf"" attitude but he ends up growing by regretting some mistakes and assuming responsibility. However, there are cliches and storytelling tropes which can't be escaped. Luckily it doesn't bring everything down as the action is fun and the visuals are a feast to the eye. It's a movie that will entertain to the max. An element I was happy to see was the usage of mythology (especially Greek mythology in this case). I've always been endlessly fascinated by what legendary mystic stories could be explored in the profoundness of the sea. And that tone was transmitted nicely to the screen. I loved the depth in the cinematography. You'll see the sunlight reach the corals while the characters swim across. It's vibrant, warm and full of life. So the visuals were big standouts. The story was decent yet formulaic. I could have gone with less explaining and skipped of some of the obvious jokes. But most surprisingly it finds moments where clear human purity is brought out. The tale about Arthur's parents, his training with Willem Dafoe's Vulko, even his relationship with Mera doesn't come across as annoying (considering it's super obvious that they're gonna be together). It somehow works on plain simplicity. It's nothing too much, just clear and simple enough that you can see the sincerity there.It's bloated given how grand James Wan wants to go with the story. You better stay awake for two hours because this thing moves like sharks chasing their pray. The action is always energetic, except for when they decide to throw a character into a wall. The parkour set-piece was a lot of fun. Partly with how well thought out the shots were and where the next part of the sequence would lead to. And this is coming from someone who thought it looked stupid in the trailers. Loved the look of the bad guys. Manta has been one of my favorites and it's amazing to see him adapted properly on the big screen. I wanted his part in the plot to be even more integral. Ocean Master is OK at best. His costume and helmet are great but the guy's a bit of a Shakespearean villain cliche. I will give him credit for at least having a motivation I understood and agreed with. His solution to his problem however... That's where the villain aspect comes to play. I would also have trimmed out some levity that felt pandering. Some of the characters didn't get enough development to make you undertand their place in the story. I was kind of confused as to who Mera was and what she was up to during the first act. But to be fair, that may have been because she looks so otherworldly it drew me away. Anyway, it is a fun movie and a lot more decent than I thought it would be. Just be ready for some stupid bits here and there, or very convenient plot points. But the visual spectacle delivers with some imaginative underwater worlds and creatures. Better than ""Justice League"" which doesn't say too much, but I see this being very enjoyable on repeat viewings.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That is also the downside to this movie - it feels like a string of comics smashed together; it was missing a solid overarching thread to keep everything pieced together. It also felt like they missed out on some scenes that really would have added some depth if they lingered on them a bit more, but instead they raced to the next action scene. I think they wanted to keep things moving, but they missed out on some major scenes to connect with the characters. There was a heavy use of CGI in this movie (as is common with DC movies...), but it was definitely blended better and not as much was used as has been the case in previous DC movies. It was better put together than many recent marvel movies which are beginning to just feel like cliche michael bay films (I'd rate all recent marvel movies between 4-7 out of 10 stars for perspective).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not like I was for the rest of DC pantheon. The TV cartoon was part of the Superman Hour (with that guitar dahh-ranggg! sound effect). On the Big Bang Theory, poor Raj was left being Aquaman because everyone else had their hero choice first. The character was a real #luser when it came to popularity.

He's intensely loyal. And he's very powerful.Visually, it's brilliant with incredible action scenes. Patrick Wilson plays an arrogant leader who rules the Kingdom of Atlantis and has a plan to unite the Undersea against the surface dwellers. Amber Heard is the beautiful daughter of an allied Kingdom. Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman play Arthur Curry's parents. Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren round out a name cast lead by Jason Momoa. And yes, CGI is used. And the CGI is extremely effective. It gives a dreamlike appearance to underwater sequences which would be impossible to do as practical effects.The story is top notch: it follows a path that at times makes effective use of flashbacks while advancing the plot. It's very satisfying and concludes heroically. Yes, it's a fairy tale ending, but what did you expect?

I so wanted it to be great... but I found this one to under utilize the potential of Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson.The good stuff? Beautifully visualized underwater universe. Gorgeous colors and interesting use of sea creatures. Cool CGI effects. Kids will love that!The not so good? Lazy dialogue, uninspired score, and most melodramatic villain we've seen, well since Justice League. Patrick Wilson is a stellar actor and even he couldn't quite elevate the character of King Orm beyond a ""dun-dun-duh"" villain. I had really hoped for some great smart aleck comedy from Arthur/Aquaman, but his character seemed too overwhelmed to deliver on that.At first, I thought it was just me, but my teen son, i.e., the fan base, was bored.

It's lively tone and layered action scenes won't leave you bored with its swift pacing.Otherwise, it's by no means perfect. The film is your standard superhero narrative with not much changes to the formula other than some ties to adventure genre. It's mood is quirky, and character motivations seem one-dimensional.

It seems that DCEU have learned from their mistakes and understood the taste of the common audience, the movie follows a medium tone which is a heartwarming visual treat.Aquaman makes a slow progress in the first half where we get to understand Altantis and its people but it is not at all boring due to the beauty of Altantis which is a major highlight in the movie. The second half is the heart of this movie filled with action sequences which have the potential to provide goosebumps especially the classic suit scene and climax fight is one hell of a fight.Jason Momoa has brought Aquaman to life. His performance as Aquaman cannot be defined in words. William Dafoe And Dolph Lundgren have served their purpose of portraying two strong supporting characters of Atlantis. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard succeds in enhancing the beauty of the movie and proves their might as Atlanna and Mera. Patrick Wilson(King Orm) and Yahya Abdul -Mateen II(Black Manta) provides the seriouness that the movie deserves at some point. They are excellent in their roles.On the whole the movie is a must watch in 3D for its visual effects and strong acting performances. James Wan have provided us with a visual feast which is filled with action sequences, comedy and Wan also adds his special touch by adding some horror element using the Trench Monsters. The movie has a mid credit scene please don't forget to see it.Rating:75%","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Fun, Spectacular, but Horrible Script Though","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4551156/?ref_=tt_urv","coolcleangreen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15684398/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2018","I loved the movie! Don't get me wrong. It was a thrill ride! However, the lack of script development was unfortunate. I also have to note that some of the musical selections were glaringly out of place. Bright spots were scenes between Aquaman and his father, because I actually felt history and deep connection between the characters that resonated in me. Momoa has a way with improvisational speech that works to anchor the bad script but everyone else seemed to be reading sparsely populated cue cards. Lots of eye-rolling cliches all over the place. Meanwhile, the action and visuals were spectacular, including one breath-taking scene of extreme peril near the end of the second act of the film. There was plenty of fun and funny moments and even the cartoony stuff was on the good side of ridiculous. So yeah, 7/10 because the movie does its job in the superhero sphere, bringing some camp, some heart, and some awesome visuals. But can we sprinkle some ""Whedon dust"" on the next installment please?!? I have a feeling he can craft the more complicated dialogue that should have been explored in this origin story.I saw this on IMAX. I highly recommend watching this film on IMAX.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The storyline was well written and everything was well explained. The filming location of the movie was mainly, the ocean and it was really good. The characters were TOO many, of course they were very interesting and well-developed. The opening scene of the movie was very intense and kinda unexpected. Actually, the whole movie was super intense, full of chase and battle scenes. Gladly, everything was well portrayed and all the effects were well edited. It wasn't a boring movie, even though it was a really long movie. Moreover, the casting was amazing and the acting (especially, Jason's acting) was incredible. The worst thing about that movie is, Amber Heard. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie, full of action scenes and epic battles. Last but not least, the ending scene was expected and I can't wait for the sequel!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The characters are all shallowly depicted, nothing to relate with, dialogues don't go beyond clich√© banters, no communication, heartfelt message conveyed among the main character s at any point.
Acting is poor as well, mainly influenced by the lamest lines I guess.
The story is hammered by continuing meaningless action scenes sustained by B movie music score.
Willem Defoe is the only exception in the general acting disaster, he manages to build a credible if minor character. The teen versions of aquaman are also much more articulated and credible than the adult grunting hipster.
Kids cartoon level CGI completes the package of this parody of a superhero movie.

The story is told well without jumping too quickly or skipping over important character development. It's got good moments of humor and sufficient action scenes.

If Aquaman went gross I'll pay your ticket but if you hyped/surprised/amazed after seeing Aquaman, you'll pay me for another round of Aquaman but in IMAX 3D and buy me a Full Lunch after seeing Aquaman."" and I did it. My friend (who bullied me after Justice League), he surprised when he was diving to Atlantis for the first time (my friend is a total MCU Fan, this is the first time he watched DC Movies), his face was WOW-ed, he told me that he HYPED, he told me that Atlantis is better than W*k*nd*. And he lost the deal.James Wan was right. See AQUAMAN on the biggest screen YOU can. It will not disappoint you, literally, not as disappointing as Justice League.Thank YOU, James Wan.

But before he can do that, Arthur and warrior woman Mera (Amber Heard) must first retrieve the Trident of Neptune.More action-adventure than superhero saga, this adaptation of the DC Comics character is all style over substance, thanks to its rudimentary plot, childish dialogue and corny villains.

It looks like they're going to make a movie of every possible comic character and I have no problem with that as long as I'm entertained. Aquaman, based on a DC Comic this time, is for the major part just CGI's like most of those movies. There are some terrific action scenes but sometimes the CGI's looked also a bit fake, that would be the only minor point to me. As for the rest the story is easy to watch and has a high entertainment level. Jason Momoa is candy for the eye for women (if I have to believe my wife) like Amber Heard is candy for the eye for men. And Nicole Kidman looks like she never ages (the Botox did help in her case).

Wooh!!!! Honestly this was a bit better than I thought it would be. Jason Mamoa does a solid job here, Amber Heard is a goddess, literally and figuratively, and James Wan shoots a beautiful looking film aside from a few weird CGI uses. The story is pretty similar to Black Panther, but it's not that derivative. There were some cool action sequences and I'll admit Aquaman's official suit was pretty fricken sick, but the music choices were baffling at times. I'm not ready to say this film or character can save the DCEU, it's a very solid superhero movie, but if it was set in the MCU it would certainly be one of the lesser entries. Kudos for not making a film that sucks though, choosing creative directors like James Wan will be key to DC regaining some of its former glory.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The main villain, Orm, was written straight from the source material and brought to screen by stellar performance by Patrick Wilson. Orm is that kind of villain, that you want to hate, but you just can't, he is a major badass and you can see that shred of goodness in him. Supporting villain who completely takes the screen in every scene he is in, Black Manta sets the foundation for his very bright future in this franchise, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II truly does justice to the character. Amber Heard does very well as Mera, you can really see that chemistry between her and Momoa, which results in a great relationship on screen. Willem Dafoe makes a surprisingly good Vulko and Dolph Lundgren is playing a typical Dolph Lundgren character, and of course, he does it just right. Nicole Kidman was good, but missed something, the scenes seemed a little bit too much, or other times too little, not that she didn't do a good job, but the rest of the cast did brilliant, so at least to me, she was a little bit underwhelming. Momoa is definitely the man for the role, he plays Aquaman that you wouldn't want to mess with, but also the one who you'd share a drink with. Throughout the film he transforms, and shows us that he can be much more than a tough, beer loving dude. Can't give it a perfect 10 because of some cheesy scenes , which were put just for the sakes of humor, but even those scenes seem to fill the movie in a good way, so you don't feel bored for a single moment. In the end it's a really fun ride, that will take you through an amazing world, with astonishing visuals, and a great story to hear. The movie sets up the stage for the next instalment in a great way, and takes Arthur to a whole new level, which will be interesting to see in next JL movie.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

He owns the funny, badass and emotional (well, his father too) scenes. Beside of that the CGI is well, somehow it looks amazing and totally childish at the same time. It's better than Batman v. Superman or Justice League. It also can hold up to some MCU flicks like Ant-Man or Thor.

"8","/10","This was rather impressive...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4613045/?ref_=tt_urv","paul_haakonsen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22654354/?ref_=tt_urv","28 January 2019","Alright, well for starters I must state that I am not one overly keen on watching superhero movies, because they all just seem to follow the same doctrine and blueprint. But I was forced into watching the 2018 DC ""Aquaman"" movie together with my family.And it turns out that it was actually a good thing that I was forced to watch it. Because it turned out that ""Aquaman"" was actually one of the better superhero movies that have been made. Not that I am in anyway familiar with the backstory of the character and haven't read the comic books or anything.Initially I was a little bit hesitant about the movie, but it turns out that director James Wan actually managed to turn the written material of David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Will Beall and Geoff Johns into something truly entertaining and enjoyable. The movie was driven by a good story, where one quickly and easily got submerged, no pun intended, into the setting and into the ongoings on the screen. Plus it was also a plus that it had some rather interesting characters in it to help it along as well. Needless to say that the CGI and special effects also had a major role in making it a visually astounding and enjoyable movie.Now, normally I am not much fan of Jason Momoa, but I must admit that he really carried himself formidably in this movie and he really owned up to the responsibility of playing Aquaman - although I have no idea how much pressure would be on him to play that character. But he did it phenomenally in my opinion, regardless. It was of course a treat to see Willem Dafoe in the movie, despite it being somewhat disturbing and unsettling to see him made young and vigorous. Patrick Wilson actually was so well-cast for the role he had in the movie, and he brought so much grace, charm and wits to that dark character. I had initially not thought he would be up to the task, but he proved me so wrong. Then you have the likes of Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren whom also actually were fun to watch in the movie, despite them not having an abundance of screen time.The pacing to the movie was fast and upbeat, and the movie kicked off into a high octane speed right from the very beginning and it never really slowed down. Which was a very impressive accomplishment in my opinion, and it really made the movie all the more intense and enjoyable to sit through.As for the special effects and CGI. Well, there is just really just a single word necessary to summarize the entire movie. And that word is: wow! Are you kidding me, this movie takes you in for a tour de force and really showcases some rather impressive feats and accomplishments in the visual department and also in the audio department. Prepare to be blown away.With that being said, the movie is not at all flawless. Personally I found it a bitter pill to swallow the whole thing about the Secret Sea and what was going on there. It was just too far out there for my liking. And also the fact that all the marvelous, magnificent, malignant and spectacular aquatic creatures, vehicles and settlements have remained from the humans living on the surface is just beyond me. It makes absolutely no sense at all.Now, I was praising the CGI and visual effects just before. There were some scenes when we have the characters floating around and supposed to be appearing as if they are submerged and underwater, it just came off as being ridiculously fake to look at. That was a shame, because the rest of the 95% of special effects and CGI in the movie was just spot on.If you enjoy superhero movies. Wait, let me rephrase that. Even if you have no particular interest in superhero movies, then you should actually take the time to sit down and watch the 2018 ""Aquaman"" movie. It is definitely well worth the time, effort and money.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The result was a corny, and even for fantasy standards unrealistic (yes.. I am talking fantasy realism here) CGI overdose.
Okay, what I liked: Jason Momoa who has a great sense for self irony and comedic timing. Casting him in this role is one of the most creative and inspired decisions and it pays off. He is truly great and part of the reason why Aquman is one of my absolute favorites of the DC cinematic universe. But not even he could save the often awful dialogue this terrible screenplay offers. Another thing I really liked were many of the actions scenes were very well put in scene (save for all the slow motion moments). Also the first half of the film really promised a great fantasy tale with its own mythology. I gave up on that thought in the middle part when many things, motivations and actions just became ridiculous ( and yes.. again for fantasy standards). The ending was an overblown CGI fest (with some really nice visuals ... not the effects, those were mediocre, but the imagary was nice). I really liked the score and loved the soundtrack decisions which were top notch.
About the other actors. Amber Heard was better than I expected but I could imagine many other actresses who probably had given her role the bite it deserves and was intended for. Nicole Kidman was fine but she obviously did it for the fun (yes she gets to kick some asses which was delightful) and of course the paycheck. But having her here gave the film something majestic. Willem Dafoe was very boring - or bored. I always felt he was not really feeling good about being into that CGI mess. His facial expressions made you believe that he is constantly thinking of doing awful things to his agent. Dolph Lundgren was fun and Patrick Wilson servable as a villain. Oh and that gets me to another thing: Black Manta is probably the most useless villain in any comic adaptation ( except maybe Paul Giamatti in the second Spider Man of the first Spider Man reboot).
It was fun (yet overlong) as long as it lasted but caused many head shakes from me.. and not in a good way.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

An underwater story of King Arthur, borrowing elements from Thor (2011) & Black Panther (2018), that brings us an entertaining adaptation of the New 52 Aquaman storyline by Geoff Johns & Ivan Reis. It's impressive how much Atlantean history they were able to include without bogging down the narrative. The underwater sequences are really impressive with the scale of this aquatic world brought to life, with nearly every bit of the film shot in IMAX. The acting was fine, although the stiff & expository dialogue made it obvious how much they are banking on the foreign market for this film. The CGI is well done, but it still suffers from some shoddy green screen work that seem to plague the DCEU. The score by Rupert Gregson-Williams stands shoulder to shoulder with his work on Wonder Woman, but some of the soundtrack choices are distracting. All in all, an impressive entry from DC Films & a fun super hero flick.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Oh, and the black Manta looks like he's out of the power rangers. And I'm sorry, but if the villain has to say 'you can call me Black Manta' then they really need a kick up the backside. And there's an A-Team esque moment in there that makes you want to beat yourself to death with your own eyes.Despite all of these negatives, it's an enjoyable movie. No, it's not the best DC movie ever made, as much as I wanted it to be, but it's a fun movie. The Atlantis scenes are beautifully visualised, and the action is very well done. But the brazen attempts to copy the humour of Thor Ragnarok and combine it with the upbeat, music driven abandon of Guardians of the Galaxy just doesn't quite hit the mark. Its too cheesy, too obvious and it's been done better elsewhere. If it can't decide if it wants to be serious or light hearted, then how is the audience supposed to decide. I came out having enjoyed a visual feast that had just a little too much ham and cheese.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Right?Not exactly. And it isn't quite so simple. Don't worry, I don't drop spoilers.I mean, yes, we're definitely following the hero journey story line because it's a superhero movie, but there isn't much typical about this movie, much like there isn't anything typical about Jason Momoa. ""Aquaman"" is filled with comedy and drama, love, exceptional action and horror that throws some fantastic jump-scare at its audience. The backstory is well done and touching. The comedy is timed perfectly, in my opinion, and quite hilarious. We're faced with more than one bad guy but also shown consequences of our actions. And by ""our"" I mean 'we the audience' as well as the characters.We've already seen Momoa in this role in ""Justice League,"" but this film, this movie, expands on that, and he is outstanding and was meant to play Arthur Curry. Of that, I have no doubt. Kinda like Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. Nicole Kidman as Atlanna kicks ass, Amber Heard as Mera gives a great performance, and Willem Dafoe...what can I say? The man playing Vulko has been in both Marvel and DC movies, and his acting is stellar as always. Patrick Wilson gives a fabulous performance as the entitled King Orm, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II shows us a glimpse of Manta's humanity, albeit brief, and what one will do to exact revenge.

Accompanying him is bottle-ginger Mera (Amber Heard), a warrior-princess with the ability to manipulate water in whatever way the plot requires. Needless to say, the two Atlanteans 'meet cute' and then follow the standard relationship trajectory from swapping insults to swapping spit. While agreeable eye-candy in her fishy catsuit, I found the 'Mera' character to be the worst part of the film and the quippy, trite relationship with Aquaman to be more irritating than endearing. Momoa is fine in a not particularly challenging role (the standard-issue, wisecracking, gruff, heroic demigod) as is the rest of the cast (William Dafoe as trusted mentor Nuidis Vulko is given a little more to work with than the rest of the 2D tropes). After a reasonably good first act, the film begins to stretch even the most generous suspension of disbelief when Aquaman and Mera jump out of a plane and hit the ground with no more than a grunt and a couple of quips. There are lots of heroic poses, three point power landings, overly choreographed and unconvincing fight scenes, all set to a pretentious soundtrack and cumulating in the expected climatic showdown between a bunch of characters that we haven't been given enough time (or reason) to care about. The film is spectacular to look at and the 3D cinematography in the version I watched was reasonably effective. I probably would have rated the film a point higher if I had watched it without sound but a point lower if I thought about it more. I am surprised at the scarcity of points in the 'goofs' section, considering the extreme cartoon physics of most of the 'underwater' scenes.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

In that one way it's the polar opposite of the dark and glum Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad. Director James Wan has decided to throw the kitchen sink at us, with giant armored sharks, supergiant weaponized crabs, fleets of manta rays, armies of mermen, magic tridents, and even wilder fantasy flights of imagination. What makes this work, which it pretty much does, is that it has the big advantage of being new: we haven't seen this before, by comparison with any other action-driven movies that are usually on the ""surface world"", as the Atlanteans refer to it.But as writer Ursula LeGuin once said, if the only thing we see happening is unrelenting physical action then it's a sure sign that there is no story being told. And that's where Aquaman teeters on the edge. It's got a storyline, which is actually quite simple and barely adequate to support all the action, but in a sense the real center of interest is the spectacle itself largely because of its new and unfamiliar setting. The overall feeling I got was that I was watching some kind of stylistic combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Pacific Rim, Star Wars, and King Arthur all piled together. My (adult) daughter says it's like a cross between Tron and Little Mermaid.About the acting: Jason Momoa is -- OK. Maybe a promise for better things to come. He and all the rest suffer from having to deliver a pretty simplistic script with stereotype dialog. I was generally pleased with Amber Heard as Mera; she got more to do than I was expecting and they gave her a distinctive water-control superpower that was fun to see and came in handy at certain points. Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe stood clearly above all the rest, however, just for their quality of diction; i.e. they didn't mumble. Why has slurring your words become a 'style'?? As a last comment, I thought Rupert Gregson-Williams' musical score was kind of a disappointment. It was workmanlike and did the job needed for an epic like this (essentially telling us how to feel at every moment) but it was nowhere near the standout work he did for Wonder Woman.Bottom line is that you'll get your money's worth for an evening's entertainment. For Worlds of DC it's a step up in production values. Now let's just add some serious storytelling to go with it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The cinematography is alway great, but there's something about the way they piece these together in post that is slightly off, even the way they record the dialogue that takes away from the weight of any performance - or maybe it is simply that they don't cast well?Wonder Woman was a huge improvement for DC and I had high hopes that this would learn from those lessons, but IMHO we're back to weak story, characters I don't ever get asked to care about, terrible pacing, disjointed and jumpy transition between acts, and a terrible script.Casting wise, if i was Jason Momoa's wife i'd be overjoyed that there was zero chemistry between the incredibly boring, but pretty to look at Jason and equally lacklustre and boring Amber - the best casting here is definitely Dolph and Willem!Much like Jason and Amber, this movie is very pretty to look at, but ultimately boring and a waste of time.So many bad lines, so many holes in the plot, so much content crammed in that they forgot to mention some of it, so many pointless bit of action, and at leat 20 mins too long.skip it!","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

* Action
* Acting
* GFX
* CinematographyHowever, the overall package failed to impress due to the overly futuristic portrayal of the underwater world (seemed like an outer space setup) and the non-uniqueness of the story.Most people from my country have already seen Bahubali - The Beginning and are kinda aware of the story. I'm wondering wow is Aquaman's story line any different..No spoiler alerts, but you'l know when (if) you go and watch the movie yourself. I bet you'll come out linking Aquaman characters with Bahubali's (just for fun!)i'd give it 6/10 and recommend you watch only for the Gfx and some of the action sequences.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

James Wan successfully competes with Snyder's visuals, but without offering questionable plot twists and ""Oh, Martha!"" scenes. Yep, main plot is pretty much the same as Black Panter and dozens of others about outlaw king must accept his role as a real KING with a help of a bunch of friends. Yes. even evil brother is here, a hidden, but powerful contry (or countries) and old tradition of hand-to-hand combat as a political argument.So why ""Auquaman"" makes ""Black Panther"" look pale? Answer is pretty simple - director & screenwriters successfully adapted character's canon without disturbing ""modern approaches"". Classic suits, classic names, minor race changes Yes, Orm in the movie looks way much like blonde Aquaman in comics, but it was not Wan's descision to hire Momoa as a title hero.We see a very classy old-school adventure, Wan even cited Inidiana Jones as a reference - and, yep, spitit of Indiana is indeed here in a good way.Acting is solid, without spectactular perfomances, but Patrick Wilson can be names as the most remarkable actor from enseble. His villain delivers belivable emotions and motivation is not so dumb, as like Thanos, for e.g. under similar circumstances.Jason Momoa plays a cool biker-outlaw-style guy, the only problem with him - he cannot act really good, there is a big potential, but he definitely needs to improve. Momoa made his comeback in smal roles (like Drogo). but he is not a leading man material (see his Conan, for e.g.). With Momoa, directors are facing the similar problem as with Gal Gadot: a beatutiful human being, looks incredible on posters, but impression fades once they try to act. Wonder Woman was saved by Chris Pine & his team - they delivered most of fun, but ""Aquaman"" was not able to offer something like that. Amber Heard is a bad actress, her red wig looked really cheap, zero chemistry between Mera and Arthur - nuff said. Love part of the story is a hit-and-miss, without a question.Soundtrack is ok, but Aquaman really, really delivers the exceptional underwater wold. It looks incredibly amazing, with love & care, with many details for comic geeks. A spectacular journey, with a secondary villain for sequel - yep, Black Mantha should really shine, his motivation is pretty understandable and actor definitely needs more screen time.WB, You should negotiate with James Wan immidiately. You know, right now You have Your own Lucas/Cameron - class director.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The acting all around is excellent. Jason Momoa is an excellent Aquaman, and the action scenes are some of the best I've seen from a comic book movie in a long time. Another good thing going for this movie is that it's very self-contained. It's no Batman v. Superman or Suicide Squad. It doesn't try to set up 2-3 spinoff movies, which DC movies are sometimes known for. The villains weren't half bad. You could understand them, and they weren't evil for the sake of being evil. Finally, James Wan creates a fantastic world, which for me was
breathtaking at times.But that doesn't mean there aren't negatives. The movie is clocking around 2 hours and 23 minutes, and you can feel it. There were so many scenes that were unnecessary, and so many of the jokes just fell flat and didn't land with me or the audience that I was with. Besides the action scenes, everything was lackluster. The Arthur and Mera relationship was cringy at times, but that's not something that's going to ruin the movie for you. Aquaman is also very predictable; which takes the fun and suspense out during certain moments of the film.A film with great acting, excellent fights, and a fantastic setting are ultimately brought down by its dragged on runtime, bad jokes, and uneventful/unnecessary scenes.Aquaman gets a 6/10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Words: beautiful to look at (visually kind of reminds me of 'Tron Legacy' but underwater), funny/fun/entertaining, cool looking characters/costumes, great art direction, cool score that reminds me of Vangelis' Bladerunner.
I'm a fan of all comic book movies but here is my take:
Marvel movies are ""safe"". They are entertaining but reminiscent of USA Network shows like Burn Notice (there are fights/weapons/guns/explosions- yet no blood/death/bad language) to me there isn't much to be surprised about yet great to watch.
DC movies are more ""crazy"" - almost like AMC network shows like Breaking Bad/Walking Dead (WITH some gore/blood/death/sexuality & nudity/foul language/etc.)
Aquaman is almost a bridge between both worlds Marvel/DC.
That being said, I LOVED Aquaman - it's my favorite comic book movie to date.
I'm in my mid-30's and I remember reading the character's comics/cartoons a little as a kid - I had the Super Friends/Super Powers(?) toys and the producers got the character perfect for current pop culture here (Jason Momoa is an actor that you'll like immediately on impact- like when I was a kid watching Schwarzenegger flicks).
The only annoying thing about this movie was the people in the theater around me kept gasping and getting very excited (in a good way) at the action/scale of what was exhilarating them -it was distracting and this movie pulls you in/engages you.
It's the first time in a long time that I remember saying to myself ""I really don't want this to end!""
That's how much I enjoyed Aquaman.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I just watched this movie due to recent popular subject we all talk about :)
I find the acting is so fake, the movements etc. But again, I am not familiar with superhero movies. Jason should act more seriously I think. He is really charming but could act in a more serious manner. This way it seems rather fake and you do not believe the character. I like Mera, but could be more scenes with close ups, would really appreciate focus on her more. It seems the focus is not on the character's mimics much so maybe this is normal. I liked Patrick Wilson's acting. The only one I enjoyed in this movie. <3.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

Aside from a few fleeting (and forgivable) moments, the visuals in this movie are lovely. Objects feel like they have the scale and ""weight"" that they should, which can be difficult to get right from a CGI perspective. I found the movie's humor hit-or-miss, but mostly enjoyable. Some lines felt forced, but Mera's first ventures onto land included numerous clever moments.Dialogue was sadly predictable, but generally delivered well. Amber Heard's performance was at times engaging, and at times distracting. She didn't seem particularly well suited for moments of powerful monologue.As other reviewers have noted, character development was rushed, but they certainly made an effort to add a bit of depth to at least a couple characters. I wanted to like Black Manta, but came out disappointed. Maybe they'll do something more clever with him in the future.Numerous plot elements just sort of happened for no real reason, other than to tie up the loose end of a joke left hanging from a setup ten minutes prior (Pinocchio, for example). The ""National Treasure"" sequence on the quest for Atlan's trident seemed out of place within the scope of the rest of the movie.Overall, this is a great popcorn movie. It'll end up in my collection, no doubt, but likely won't merit another viewing until its sequel is released.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Kind of a quick bite to fight the hunger before the feast that is cooking behind the kitchen door. After giving the trailer a look I thought 'Aquaman' was going to be a bit different and has a potential to stir that stiff dark matter that we call a universe.Fairly enough we can call it an origin story but the character has been on our radar before, which means that the basic knowledge is there and we don't need a fundamental course. I really like Arthur simply because he is down-to-earth guy: not nerdy as Barry Allen, not pompous as Bruce Wayne, not inconspicuous as Clark Kent, kind of like Diana Prince but male and for sure not metal as Victor Stone.Will not hide anything from you by saying that in the end the plot as usual goes down the drain and as always, we can observe some particles of good ideas getting stuck on the exit. 2h23m was the amount of actual time, although if we take out all the slow motion and sugaring of viewers' eyes with abnormal amount of visuals we are left with a common 1h30m or even less.The most confusing and disgusting point of the movie was the build-up of the villain that has never been finished, which can only mean the path for a sequel, and on this the curse of abruptly cut stories continues. A lot of actions that should have borne major consequences were just forgotten and walked on by like a beggar on the street.You know what they say: each Hollywood project has two wolves - Visuals and Story, the one that you feed most eats another - here we have the first one already gnawing the latter but the poor thing has a few breaths left. Going back to the conclusions I would say that Jason Momoa has been training all his life and is worthy wielding the Trident, however, as the rule says - if it's not planned as a one-man movie then it cannot be carried like that. I hope DC will understand it and put a little bit more effort next time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I would really like to see more people calmly describing their experiences in the theater rather than voting for their favorite team with a 10/10 (actor, director, comic book franchise, whatever). The same is true for people voting with a 1/10 against another group.I had a good time at the theater watching Aquaman but I did leave at the end feeling disappointed in many aspects of the film. No need to get into these now because they are described in detail in other reviews.I admit, my first impulse was to rate it a 1/10 to balance-out all the 10/10 reviews but then I realized that I would be doing the same thing as they were - providing an inaccurate review based on things other than the movie quality. So, I am rating Aquaman a 6/10 . Maybe it deserves a 5/10 - not sure.Anyway, let's get back to accurately reviewing the movies to help others decide whether to go see them or not rather than trying to tilt the balance of the other votes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's more like a series of bright and colourful individual scenes loosely tied together by a handful of characters. The thing is though that's both a positive and a negative. It's very easy to criticise this movie. Structurally it's all over the place. There are far too many storylines going on and at times it does feel like we're watching our hero work his way though levels of a computer game, going from place to place in order to get what he needs to move on to the next level.The dialogue was beyond cheesy. it was nonsense that was coming out of their mouths most of the time. This wasn't helped by some of the most hammy performances from the likes of Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren and Willem Dafoe.The Black Manta character was also disappointing. The character seems as though he could have been good, had he been fleshed out more. The problem was that he was really only a side character when in truth he could have been the main baddie. They probably should have saved Black Manta for a potential sequel; or had him be the main villain of this film, then saved the Orm storyline for the sequel. Unfortunately Black Manta got lost in the madness of everything that was going on in this movie.In terms of the visuals, on the one hand it is a humongous CGI extravaganza, which at times feels like it's covering up the weaknesses of the screenplay. On the other hand however, it was fun to watch. Additionally, the experience of being in thw world, being thrown about and covered in water, was entertaining.There were a few positive things about Aquaman. First of all, the fight sequences. The choreography for those was fantastic; as was the direction. The way some of the fights were filmed looked like they were from a proper action movie. That's another thing. The action in this film was non-stop entertaining. It was completely over-the-top, but that was to be expected from James Wan - The man, known mostly for his horror movies, didn't produce anywhere near his best work on this movie, but I did love his action sequences. Two of the best scenes involved Kidman fighting near the beginning, and a rooftop chase sequence somewhere in the middle. In terms of performances Amber Heard and Nicole were badasses. Jason Momoa's Aquaman, who was charming but there's little interesting thing going on with his character. The rest provide good support.Overall, one can't deny being entertained after watching this movie. There are some positives that can be taken from the film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's not his fault, but the lines he's given are painfully childish and one dimensional. Although there's improvement compared to other DCEU entries, childish style writing in some scenes is still one of the main problems in the DCEU.
Manta's doing a better job as a villain, but he didn't exactly drew me in either. Still more complexity than Orm, for sure.Now, the film's a bit allover the place at times, there are a bit too many subplots that are rushed in the the final act and a couple too-obvious-cliches we didn't need (but didn't hurt us either). Still as a whole it is more consistent and definitely more enjoyable and well executed than BvS and Justice League, so it's safe to say that DCEU is finding what it needs.
I liked Heard's Mera, Kidman was also ok as Atlana, but I found Kidman's and Mr Curry's young selves awkward. Too awkward. I most definitely needed a bit de-aging effect.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Between the success Wonder Woman had and now Aquaman, there is some light at the end of the tunnel after all. The DCEU now has room to restructure their semi folly flicks/runs via the Justice League & Suicide Squad. Or does it? The reason why I say this is that it looks as though the DCEU movieverse does better with their standalone character driven films than it does when they're relayed as a team. Perhaps it was a matter of bad timing. I humbly think they should have introduced their primary standalone character films first before rushing in team collaborated feature films. Trying to catch up with marvel seemed to have been the plan, the folly there was marvel has been good at their movieverse craft for quite some time now. DC should have just paced themselves one character at a time.But enough of the loom and gloom, this was supposed to be a positive review and thus it shall be. To be frank I didn't expect the film to be as good as it was. And admittedly had my doubts and reservations. Don't get me wrong I thought it was going to be fun but fun in a goofy way (not that I was expecting the whole thing to be goofy, just more so than not). But to my surprise there was less goofiness and more straight up fun. Not only that, but there were dark yet mystical elements to the film as well, supplemented with a dash of wittiness and character. Albeit the style that was presented in this film wasn't over the top, nor was it lowly either, but in my humble opinion, done just right (from a comic book world perspective). From the telling tale of Arthur Curry (Aquaman) to the general creation and lore of the world around him, I really didn't want it to end and yearned for more. And it made me feel like that slightly more so than when I watched Wonder Woman (as much as I also greatly appreciated that film).Now it's no secret that to portray Atlantis properly, there would have to be some heavy CGI. And I will say it was done just right - considering current CGI technologies (plus budget allowance). The architecture presented both modern Atlantis and old sectors as well. To describe the way it was done would be harder said than seen. The rich textures and lush colors at so many turns, let alone the style of structures utilized created a mythical magic about Atlantis unlike seen before, part of which included Atlantean technological advancements. Of course I did see some areas that I thought needed more attention to detail, but my overall admiration of what was presented far outweighed my nitpickiness. The only real way to describe what Atlantis is like in this movie is to go see it yourself.The actors did an admirable job! As someone who reads Aquaman comics, I had a tough time seeing Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Let's face it, Arthur from the comics and Arthur in this film look very different. And although I've been a fan of Jason Momoa's roles in both Stargate Atlantis (no pun intended) and Game of Thrones - I just couldn't visualize Jason hitting the mark as Aquaman. And to my surprise he did just that, especially as a DCEU extension of the character, he did a fantastic job! Just as Arthur, Jason delivered a bold, conflicted and sometimes misunderstood Aquaman, whilst showing us a prideful 'not easy to uncover' loving side as well.The supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do & quite the impressive cast it was. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Amber Heard as Mera, and even Dolph Lungren as King Nereus and more... Sometimes it's not the actors alone who make or break a film no matter who the actor/actress is, oftentimes it's the synergy of how the characters coalesce to one another that's an integral part of the process. Hence is why I reiterate this supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do and delivered a successful Aquaman film.I must admit, when I see non comic book readers critique a comic book film, it makes me cringe (not always but a fair amount of times). Which is why in my humble opinion when seeing a Superhero film, don't rely on such critics too much, and sometimes this includes comic book reader critics too. Go in with an open mind and judge for yourself the world that's being presented to you. A comic book movieverse is one of those rare exceptions where relying on your own critiquing is a much better way of validating your liking or disliking of any one of these films over other critics themselves.As for me, I really relished this film. It had all the elements required to portray Aquaman and the world around him. From the storytelling and the lore presented to the characters themselves and the laid out visuals. Go see it, and lean on your own genuine open minded critiquing when you do see it.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

I have to be honest I really didnt think an aquaman movie was going to be that great when it was announced, they did such a bad job with both superman and batman and considering how much better I considered those characters to be I didnt see they could do much with aquaman, I was very very wrong.This is genuinely excellent, it is a superhero movie and of course therefore hits all the same sort of high points of any superhero movie but just does it all brilliantly. They gave aquaman himself a really fun and interesting character, they had an excellent story with really well written characters and a lot of laughs along the way too. The story is a real spectacle on top of that so really what more could you possibly ask for?If you want a good action adventure then this is a top class example of it.","14 out of 34 found this helpful.

Personally, I don't think Aquaman is a great movie, definitely far from the best, except the VFX.If you compare Aquaman with BVS or Watchmen, you'll find that this story is like a children's fairytale. It has no reflection on our reality. It just tells a hero becomes the hero, defeats the villain and finds the love one. It has no ""soul"".Of course the VFX is epic. But we already have an Avatar.

But Aquaman is a well litt hope for the DC universe, and I definately want to see more of him! The good:Arthus/Aquaman is a cool guy. Straight out, and hands down. His character also has a great backstory, and great development in this movie. In my opinion. And I must say that DC did him justice (no pun intended) by the way they presented this backstory. I believe Batman Vs Superman went a little too deep, and too far back with a lot of backstory/buildup - but Aquaman did it just right for me. Deep, emotional, thorough, but not wasting anyone's time. Just the important stuff that hits you in the heart.Then there is action, cinematography, CGI, colors and all of the above - and the movie is pure eye candy. Maybe not the coolest fighting scenes, but definitely cool fighting scenes. Some original camera handling/rotations made for a nice little twist to certain close combat scenes. When it is not close combat, it's underwater Star Wars. I... think I can dig that.The bad:
I'm sure this is all very true to the original material and all, but I'm not all that into having 2 bad guys in one movie. Not like this anyhow. One of them was great, the other was not (hint: it's Black Manta). A massive cliche if you ask me, and (and watch this get down voted by the comic book nerds! :O). For the record, I do recognize that he did play a significant role in the plot development. But I still didn't like him - so there!
To me, Black Manta got the same effect on this movie as Team Rockets gets in every pokemon episode (if you get that reference).Furthermore, while the plot is good ""per se"", it is utterly without plot TWISTS, so you will probably never go ""Whaaaaaat?!"" anytime during this movie. You'll predict most of the movie plot development and ending by the time 20 minutes have passed, and you'll most likely be correct in all your major predictions. But this stuff is totally possible to roll along with and enjoy despite of, and most movies these days are just like this. So, I'm not pulling too many points because of it.If there is one more tiny setback I feel the need to mention mention, is that I find some of the humor misplaced. The movie has good humor, and strong emotional scenes, both frequent, and well done. Separately. But sometimes the movie just missed my emotional state - which itself is responsible for putting me in. I'm brought half way to tears, then served a joke that feels inappropriate. And visa versa. It's not like this the whole movie, but enough times to for me to make note of it.All in all: 7 / 10 is GOOD. It's Aquaman, he's cool, and its all pretty. Many good actors btw - I forgot the mention that. It's worth the watch, but no minds will be blown out of the park.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So I was delightfully surprised to be completely entertained for most of the movie. The underwater CGI was MUCH better than I expected, cinematography was gorgeous and hallelujah for a female lead capable of taking care of herself, kicking a** like the queen she is. Enjoyed most of the main character portrayals too. Momoa was charming and smoldering, Heard was gorgeous and acted her part very well- maybe Willem Defoe was a bit of the odd man out but still did his job like a pro, and everyone else was solid as well. Sure the dialogue was spotty in places and some of the scenes ludicrous, but no worse than many if not most of the superhero movies dominating the screens lately. But for the love of mike, would someone please tell them to quit making these movies so lengthy??

Making the costumes for especially Orm, Mera and Aquaman's final suit absolute true to their comic book counterpart. It was also great cast, having a well known ensemble with names like Amber Heard, Willem Defoe, Dolph Lundgren, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman that all portray their characters in a accurate and great way. Jason Momoa blew me away, he's actually a believable Arthur Curry except for the long brown hair and beard. My favorite characters have to be Aquaman and Mera like they were in the graphic novel, great duo and amazing characters!Something that kept me interested at all times were the action sequences and plot, making it flow together nicely. The Sicily sequence and the final battle being my favorites, making this movie rewatchable more than the great characters and actors they have in store!
It's epic and has a lot of heart, thanks to James Wan and everyone else that helped make the movie.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Not that good as the hype.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4596668/?ref_=tt_urv","batuhanakcaygs","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89215480/?ref_=tt_urv","20 January 2019","This movie has many good reviews compared to better movies, that get bad reviews.First of all, why this movie isn't as bad as the other DCEU movies:
This movie has great visuals and a good cut. This movie is a difference to the really dark DC universe. This is very refreshing.There are many actors who are very sympathetic and play well. I found Jason Momoa and Amber Heard very likable and they had good chemistry between each other. What I found sad was that Willem Dafoe did not have enough screentime or influence. He could have had many meaningful influences on the plot, but this was not realized. But that is not so tragic, because the film can convince by the sympathy of the characters. I want to see more of each character.Why that movie is not that good:
This movie copies many elements from other movies. I know that most Hollywood movies are copying, but this movie is an embarrassing combination of elements. For example, the Post Credit Scene is mimicking the Post Credit Scene of Black Panther. Or, for example, the Trident of the Trident is imitating some other beings from other franchises. I do not mind, but it was painful to see how some of the movie elements were taken in a bad way.Speaking of, Black Panther. This film has many parallels to Black Panther due to the royal theme. The difference, why Black Panther is better than Aquaman is simply that you experience many emotional scenes like important deaths at Black Panther. Black Panther shows many parallels to royal dramas like those of Shakespeare, but Aquaman has few scenes that really carry emotional weight. I had expected a superhero movie with parallels to royal dramas and elements of love, but was disappointed with a complete romance movie with CGI.I know that the comparisons with Black Panther are exaggerated. But do you still know in what point Black Panther is better than Aquaman: the music. The Marvel movie had a soundtrack, especially composed by Kendrick Lamar in collaboration with other artists, while Aquaman has songs that are not compatible with each other (like Two Steps from Hell - None Shall Live and a Pitbull cover from Toto - Africa) a female singer) and can not make a uniform sound.But what you can notice is that the dialogue between the characters is really very stupid. The producers should have allowed themselves time for production and had to revise the dialogue. Some statements from characters are sometimes exaggerated cheesy or ridiculous. Then you realize that they wanted to copy Marvel, but unfortunately failed, because most ""jokes"" have failed. With every joke, no audience laughed.Towards the end, the film was so cheesy and so predictable that I was bored and expected the end of the film. The film was usually very predictable, especially at the end of the film.Maybe some people think I'm overdoing my criticism because it's a DC movie. But that's not true. I'm a big fan of DC Comics and I grew up with DC Comics when I was a kid. One of my favorite movies is The Dark Knight. I watch every DC movie, no matter how bad it may be. I'm not saying that this movie is a disaster, but for me it was very predictable and towards the end I was very bored. I will wait and I would be happy about an Aquaman 2, but hopefully it will be better implemented.
In summary:
I think, I would give this movie user-defined 6.7 points from 10 points. There are plenty of better superhero movies, but this movie is one of the best DC Extended Universe movies. I found the movie more exciting than Wonder Woman but not so exciting. If you judge him as a very ordinary movie, he is average and nothing special.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Disney couldn't hold a candle to this film and not one Marvel movie has the business or respect to be compared to Aquaman. Not one!Aquaman was outstanding! It had a great plot, great villains, awesome fight scenes and action, romance, comedy, and it was powerful. Back in the day, people would laugh at Aquaman and call him the most worthless hero. Ignorant is bliss. Those people were ignorant and I'm getting all the bliss laughing here because the joke was and still is on them. The King of Atlantis and one of the co-founders of the Justice League really took off with the visual effects and how awesome it was to see a movie take place underwater. You get to see Arthur's superpowers early on in the film so you know what Aquaman is made of and just how durable the King really is. I do hope these ""critics"" don't get paid to write reviews, because their reviews are very biased, opinionated (obviously), highly arguable, and even some are incorrect. The movie had an outstanding cast and is one for the whole family to see again and again. I believe Rotten Tomatoes gave Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse a 100 and yet, only gave Aquaman like a 70? Aquaman was a WAY better movie in every way. So, that is one example and reason why I urge EVERYONE to go see the movie and judge for yourself...and why I believe Disney/Marvel probably ghost owns RT.DC has put out great movies like V for Vendetta, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman (extended cut), Wonder Woman, Justice League, and Aquaman. All within the same Universe excluding V for Vendetta, but the films, nonetheless were REALLY, REALLY good. Yes, DC is darker and that's good. They are not Disney and I like that they don't pretend to be.10/10 Final Score","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

His narrative is full of the cliches expected in any film, however it is something forgivable, but reaches a point where we simply want a break from observing the same thing over and over again during these dialoguing scenes. I think this is the weak point of the film, in contrast to the very good action it has, it lacks a strong narrative or structure in which we can be interested enough about the story of the film, the motives of the characters or the characters themselves.In spite of this, it is finally a healthy and well-received attempt in the action genre, apart from a good movement on the part of DC. Although the movie was entertaining, the reality is that it was simply ""good"", nothing outstanding or anything excellent, but even so, it is worth having a look at it if someone is interested in the DC film universe, this is probably their best movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

BUT, I've always knew how Marvel has the upper hand when it comes to a cool, awesome, 10 stars worthy movie.

I prefer DC when I read comics, but I think they have a lot to work with when it comes to movies. DC are taking the right direction with their movies though. After Superman v Batman and Justice League, I think they've learned a lot and are starting to make there solo movies to maybe make something greater later in their universe.Back to this movie. I think the writing of the conversations are a bit poor. I'm no filmmaker, but I really got so little from Arthur/Aquaman in this movie. His lines was so short. I wish we could see more character development (event though this was a origin movie).I also think there was a lot of cliche moments, which I feel is typical DC to do. The bullying part and the kissing in the middle of the battle to mention some.Lastly I think the CGI was too much. I know this is under water, but if Marvel manage to make good Thor and Guardians movies with great CGI, DC can do it to. The CGI in this movie kind of reminded me of JL, which was reeaally bad.As I said, I feel like DC is on the right way, but still a lot to work with when it comes to writing and CGI. I haven't seen Shazam yet, but so far I've heard only good things about it, so maybe DC have learned!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I had hopes but it just didn't live up to the hype. Jason Momoa was great but Amber Heard really dragged this movie down. She can't act. Of the little emotion she shows it felt forced. She is emotionless and boring. As I said she can't act. Just eye candy for the men. Glad I didn't pay to go see it in the theater. I love superhero movies and have been known to watch them multiple times but this is not one of those movies. Amber I feel actually ruins any excitement that this movie has. She drags it down. No chemistry what so ever.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

What the film lacks in terms of complex plotline, it lavishly makes up for in cinematography, stunt choreography, visual effects and pretty much every other department.Jason Momoa is a spot-on choice for Aquaman/Arthur Curry and he carries the role on his strong shoulders with swagger and panache. He oozes charisma in every scene and the scene in which he comes out armor clad for the final fight scene gave me chills.I would strongly recommend to go and watch the movie in theatres.

All the 10 star ratings, it's crazy.I absolutely hated this piece of trash. Jason is cool, but it ends there. Amber Heard is just a terrible actress and it showed, especially when she gets cheesy dialogue. Nicole Kidman is amazing, but didn't have a lot to do with the overall feel of the movie. The jokes made no one in my theater laugh, literally no one.CGI is understandable to create the underwater world, but there were lots of moments when the characters where replaced with CGI and it looked terrible. There was only one moment where we actually saw Patrick Wilson, besides that he looked CGI'ed the whole time.The movie dragged way too long, after a good opening start we get no introduction to Atlantis, but we suddenly need to care for it. Even the establishing shots of Atlantis seem dull, because there is no back story or whatever. Almost to the end we get some backstory, but it's not enough to make you care about Atlantis.A big CGI battle, where the bad guy fights a not introduced opponent, who is also completely CGI, how are we supposed to feel any connection to that?Don't even get me started on Black Manta, he was pushed aside and suddenly came back during the whole National Treasure part of the film. He looked so silly in the suit and acted even worse. He has a big death beam, but after using it starts to actually fight Aquaman... It made no sense.It really had potential if they replaced Amber Heard, opened with a better explanation of Atlantis, kept Aquamans intro short and then started with the actual story. It took more then an hour to really get somewhere in this film and by that time I already knew where it was going and was already bored.","16 out of 30 found this helpful.

Aquaman is very crash, bang action and is good in parts but is far too long. There has been a lot of cgi finales in previous DC films and Aquaman does the same, admittedly Atlantis needed to be heavy cgi. The big plus in this film for me was Jason Momoa, charming and very likeable, definitely embodies the roll. If you enjoyed Justice League this is as good but it's no Man of Steel.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The actors are all great - even Amber Heard, who is not the best actor in the world (far from it) comes off as a believable and likable character (and she looks stunning in that outfit!) -, specially Jason Momoa who absolutely rocks as Aquaman. I mean, the man was born to play this role, it's that simple. The visuals are amazing, the CGI is virtualy flawless, the action scenes are relentless and perfectly staged, the humor is perfectly timed to release the stress from the action scenes without feeling forced. What more can I say? It's the best film in the DCEU, pure and simple, followed very, very closely by Wonder Woman, and it rivals anything Marvel has ever made. Let's hope WB/DC have learned their lesson and hire James Wan to reboot Superman - now that would be awsome!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

With that in mind don't pay attention to any 'critic' who compares this movies. Especially that family comedy movies Disney creates using the Marvel logo!
Now, Aquaman is a fresh take on a heroe that's been around for so many years that became kind of a parody.
James wan and the crew created a breathtaking word of Atlantis!
Full of mythological creatures!
If you want to see something fresh and new action packed full of emotion movie then Aquaman is the movie you should go see this Christmas!
I won't spoil the movie.
Take you're family and go enjoy this","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Aquaman is the embodiment of a superhero movie, buffed up protagonist, lots of special effects, plenty of fisticuffs, and most importantly very predictable. Jason Momoa's incredible body (more shirtless scenes were needed) mostly distracted from some very cliched scenes where dialogue was so predictable I felt like I'd already seen the movie. In fact, all the original content was used in the trailer, and the rest of the film felt like obligatory filler. That being said, the filler was pretty good, and there's a reason why super hero films are so popular. However, Aquaman couldn't deliver on any of the novel elements that made Wonder Woman so good, so I was left a little wanting. But also Momoa's abs, so yeah.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Zero story, non-sensical plot, one-dimensional characters, cringe-worthy dialogue, horrendous production design, costume design looked like they ripped-off the Power Rangers, and the visuals weren't even that great! The ""young-ification"" of Temeura Morrison and Nicole Kidman at the beginning of the movie was absolutely laughable. Manta's - actually all the costumes - looked so cheap and plastic-y it reminded me of those kids' costumes that you get at the Dollar Store. Momoa does his best impersonation of Thor, but ultimately fails to draw any laughs or garner any emotion. They absolutely ripped-off every sci-fi fantasy concept out there, mixed them together and hoped something would stick. It was just a loud, chaotic, brash, flashy, low-brow, seething mess. I think even Sharkboy and Lava Girl did a way better job!

Atlantis is the place to be. Aquaman has a richly-realized superhero fantasy world build from the ground up and full of life.
It's the story of Arthur Curry, a child of two worlds who must make peace between them when his evil half-brother seeks war. Long derided by folks unfamiliar with the comics as ""the guy whose superpower is talking to fish"", this movie should show the non-fans what comic fans have always known: that Aquaman is a certified badass.
Comparisons with Black Panther are inevitable: both are movies about superheroes who are the hereditary kings of hidden, super-advanced societies. But Aquaman is superior to Black Panther in every way. Atlantis, unlike Wakanda, is a true ""lost world"", a place hidden from outsiders by isolation, not politics. And Arthur Curry is a much more engaging hero than T'Challa. Whereas Black Panther and his sister are confident to the point of being insufferably smug and unshakably convinced of their own moral superiority, The Aquaman (like The Batman, he is no longer referred to as just Aquaman, he's THE Aquaman, now!) is conflicted and full of doubts. For all of his manly swagger, he knows it takes more to be a king than just inheriting a title, and his story is about his journey to become king. His story also tells us that there is more to him that just a title. As his mother says, ""King fights for their country. You fight for everyone."" Take, that, T'Challa!.
The special effects are top-notch. Atlantis is not merely rendered as a place, we get tantalizing glimpses of its ecosystem, with Atlanteans using trained sharks, whales, hippocampi (giant seahorses) and even Mosasaurs (which is not the only thing about this movie that will invoke Jurassic Park). There's also a sea monster that talks with the voice of Julie Andrews (I'm not making this up.).
As per any superhero origin story, this film introduces major members of the hero's Rogues' Gallery. In this case, Orm, the Ocean Master who is Aquaman's evil half-brother, and Black Manta, DC Comics' first major black supervillain.
Aside from a quick reference to Arthur's role in defeating Steppenwolf in Justice League, there are no other references to the overall continuity of the DCEU, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this a 10/10 rating. Since it takes place after the formation of the League, it would have been a nice touch to mention that Arthur and Mera were getting a little financial help from Bruce Wayne while trekking across Africa and the Mediterranean, instead of wondering how they got from the middle of the Sahara to Sicily. It also precludes that the Altanteans' greatest weakness in the comics - they can only survive out of the water for brief periods of time before risking death from dehydration - doesn't apply to Atlanteans of royal blood, like Arthur and Mera.
But small issues aside, Aquaman proves that Wonder Woman wasn't a fluke, and that Warner Brothers can produce superhero films on a par with the best of what Marvel can offer.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Each time when things seen to calm down and the protagonists are left in peace for a while, new monsters and robots turn up to start making trouble again by atrocious and reckless fighting for nothing, and although the violence is perpetually extreme with abundances of casualties, no one ever seems to expire, not even those fish men who when having their water helmets smashed to pieces are suffocated by air for want of water, as even the worst of them is revived long after having lied unconscious on land for a long time. It's a massive array of absurdities, but it can't be helped that it is visually impressive and fascinating from beginning to end - you will never be allowed to doze off. Also the acting is interesting, Nicole Kidman above all but also Willem Dafoe and Amber Heard, and even Dolph Lundgren, while Aquaman himself (Jason Momoa) is just the perfect stereotypical superhero with no nuances at all. Nicole Kidman at least has human feelings. It's an ordeal for 2,5 hours, but you will be satisfied if you find it entertaining and at least partly interesting, while few will ever try to watch this film a second time.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

But i felt something was missing. In every superhero movie its important to shown how the character is built, how he becomes more responsible after discovering superpowers, strugle, sacrifice, relations (Black panther is great example). None of this was part of the story. It was pupil's entertainment and followed chronicle of batman vs superman and justice league.
If DC really wants to compete with Marvel then they need to focus on these aspects.
And for God's sake please keep your uniqueness, dont try to sumulate marvel comics.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

James Wan, thank you. Some of the camera work is like sitting on a roller coaster ride. Just 'Bad ass'.

They thought that the success of Wooden Woman would do the trick... and they were right, clearly there aren't enough pirates in the world to show that making bad movies is bad for business.The first thing I'd like to say is that this movie is extremely dumb. Painfully. Clinically. Not Gravity level, not Prometheus or even Martian. It is Logan level of dumb. The absolute abyss, it is technically impossible to watch this movie and think rationally, so the only survivors either have their brains disabled by default, or had to. Luckily, unlike Logan - this movie is more like Avatar. It's probably the most visual since Avatar. Yes, both Nibber Panther and Infinity Quip were stunning, but... not really visual. The difference is like a game with good graphics and... Subnautica. This makes Aquaman more or less easy to swallow. Indeed, if you do NOT think about what you are watching - this is a fancy popcorn-muncher. Perhaps even worthy of going to some IMAX.Another very important feature about this movie - is that, unlike Nibber Panther and Wooden Woman, or even Captain Feminist - this movie doesn't seem to have a deep agenda. Sure, there are a few allusions and suggestions, but... I'd hardly compare it to the modern world, because we don't have a ""Karathen"" and any attempt to replicate such a scenario for politics would hardly be done in CGI. Agenda, propaganda, the things that pollute Martian, Wooden Woman, Nibber Panther, Zootopia, Frozen - they are the first and foremost things that inhibit the suspension of disbelief. Because you are almost ready to give in, when the writers remind you that ""hey, this is kinda relatable, dontcha *think*?"" The same goes for pretentiousness. Logan, The Shape of Water - when movies actively try to pretend to be something... that also tends to itch for people, who have problems turning their brains off. And that's the thing - Aquaman doesn't have any of that. It's a perfect example of a visually brilliant, sort of fun, filled with action superhero flick. For that - I can sort of agree that it's worth 6\10. It's nowhere near the first Avengers, it's not half as thrilling as the Dark Knight and it doesn't even begin to scrape the surface of the Watchmen, these movies were first of all ""whole"" movies, with superheroes and CGI being sort of... a background. And that's what truly deserves the peaks of the rating.Aquaman isn't insightful, it doesn't show anything new. In fact, its plot is even more stupid and painful than Logan. Its characters - a copypasta from Wooden Woman. Most of the ""memorable"" scenes have a ""Blue Steel"" face in them, just like Wooden Woman(sorry, Galya Gadot, a model ain't an actress), so you can't really feel the characters, you don't feel anything towards them. There is no danger, no real drama, everything is as artificial, as superficial as it could be. Nichole Kidman washed up ashore? Well, let's get busy. She was hiding? Well, but how does Aquaman learn to do things? Oh, apparently he is trained already. He's fighting the bad guy? Oh, well, skip that part. Then there's some desert quipping, property damage in actually better parts of the world, then they go where they need to go, do things they need to do, chop in a CGI battle and voila - that there's a movie. I've watched a full-spoiler review of this movie before watching, so if you consider this summary a spoiler... I feel sorry for you. Someone has to.The villains make Lex Luthor look good. I guess Patrick Wilson signed up just because he was told there's an Annabelle cameo. That nibber with his father... That whole scene makes Martha look painless. There are two absolutely, clearly and unmistakably a-hole guys, one of them is allowed to live. Then he gets a chance for revenge. Then he also lives. Okay, I am a racist, but casting him as a Black Manta after Black Panther... seriously, writers, YOU make the world racist. YOU do. Either way, the perpetual survival of this absolutely E-level villain that makes Malekith and Ronan look impressive(and that's saying a LOT) - doesn't help this movie, it only helps to establish an even more stupid sequel.For all intents and purposes... An effort should've been made to turn Aquaman into the Ocean Master. Because clearly there haven't been any for a while and it's not like anyone but Momoa can do that. Ocean Master... that resounds. That's somehow more meaningful than Starlord. Aquaman? That's a Seaman joke bait. Good for a movie title, I suppose, people wouldn't have 1\5th of a brain to figure out what is the movie about otherwise, but for the movie to end with him accepting the name ""Aquaman"", a moniker given by hell knows whom, when he clearly has a title... Again, I suppose the target audience wouldn't understand what ""Ocean Master"" stands for.Speaking of target audience, I guess the shareholders at DC figured that DC has only one set of powers - the As-Man. So no matter who that is - Cyborg, Batman, Wooden Woman, Aquaman - all heroes need to be some sort of bullet-proof, need to be crushed into buildings and stuff, need to occasionally bleed, need to fly and be super fast. Sure, Aquaman doesn't fly or run. But somehow the only identifier that the movie sort of happened underwater - was the visual background. Otherwise it's absolutely, 101% no different from ... Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. People talk, things fly, sounds are heard, you know, bullets, battles, physics and all that. So, yes, Aquaman is about as original as Drax. Okay, scratch that. Drax is a memelord and an actually good character. Aquaman is just Jason Momoa, and his enemy is just Patrick Wilson.Maybe in a few years - DC would learn to flesh out their characters. Plots. To imagine heroes with more abilities than virtual invulnerability and lasers out of their eyes. Maybe origin stories would have some moments, where the audience would feel something for their heroes, when heroes do actually incredible things. Instead of pulling the sword from the stone. Until then - Seaman is a decent movie to download, worthy of some popcorn and IMAX. But it's not something to write home about. People, who praise it... clearly have abyss-bottom low expectations for DC movies and, in DCEU, ignoring the Dark Knight trilogy - yes, Aquaman is definitely the best movie so far. Sadly, a hero in town is only a commoner in a city, and most people live in cities...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But I wasn't very happy with the Movie we receive last time. Was not bad but definitely we expect more. And this movie is precisely that. It gives all what we were waiting in previous DC movies. The storyline is nice and have a faster pace that made the movie everything but boring. Has very nice visuals to the point that Avatar need to bring something very stunning to surpass these water scenarios. There are some very nice details in the lights the shoots and the general mood of the movie. Is lighter than previous DCEU but not shallow. The main characters the villains, the weapons the rides all of them are ensembled so nicely that is very enjoyable. And of course that red hair ... Amber looks sooo gorgeous in this movie that it almost make you feel sorry for Johnny Deep. CGI on faces are remarkable to the point you can't decide which one is more beautiful if the Nicole Kidman in this movie or the Nicole Kidman of Days of Thunder. I really think Wan has the Midas touch for action movies and this one is no exception. Totally recommended. And most important I believe this will give a good push to next installments as apparently DC found the formula. Finally.
My grade will be 8.5/10","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

My initial question was: ""is he related to SpongeBob?"" I've grown up since then and do not associate Aquaman with the Krabby Patty generator, but also don't associate it with great films.""Aquaman"" is a good film for a lot of reasons, but there are a few that prevent it from being a great film. While the plot is good and allows for Jason Momoa's Arthur Curry to evolve and mature, the film struggles to hold two important villains up throughout its runtime. Bringing Black Manta and Ocean Master was not a great idea as these influential villains don't get time to develop and for us to make bonds with them. Black Manta's origin story takes about six minutes and despite the emotional weight it carries, fails to deliver and leaves you saying ""dafuh?"". Ocean Master is treated even worse, with his character having no time to develop at all. A split second transition turns Arthur's brother from spraytan-to-mailman and we're once again left saying ""dafuh?"". It doesn't help that the dialogue tends to be shallow for the most part, cheesy one-liners and cringey jokes being a part of Arthur's arsenal.""Aquaman"" is a decent film (especially great that it finally brings Aquaman to the big screen), but its shortcomings make it hard to like and leave us needing more to fill those gaps. It's definitely a cheesy movie and can give you more than a few laughs, but it takes on more than it can handle and falls apart quick.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has fully predictable plot, full of cliches and bad jokes that don't fit in. Acting is also situationally awkward and many things feel so forced that it is already cringey.

I would've liked to of seen a lot more depth between Aquaman and Mera with their relationship too, the way it is in the comics. The third act of the film is boring as well. It feels like you're watching a Pirates of the Caribbean type movie or a Disney made film, which probably makes comic book fans upset considering this was an origin story about a super manly dude. The villains are both great though which helps the story.

Jason Momoa dives headfirst into the role, exuding the rugged charm and charisma of Arthur Curry. The film editing takes us on a whirlwind underwater adventure, but at times, it feels overstuffed with CGI spectacle. Its strength lies in its portrayal of the undersea kingdoms and the exploration of Arthur's internal struggle between two worlds. However, it falters with a somewhat predictable plot and a few hammy performances. The music adds a grandiose flair, and the cinematography immerses us in the breathtaking underwater landscapes. ""Aquaman"" may not be the deepest dive into the superhero genre, but it's a visually stunning and entertaining ride through Atlantis that manages to stay afloat.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

High Box office number for a flashy movie. The issue is however if you are a true comic fan you will walk a way with mix feelings.I'm don't know DC as much as I know Marvel but I had few obvious problems with the movie.. Big one was the power ranger costumes of Atlatis and then somewhat subpar script and acting. To be honest I would rate Justice League more than Aquaman any day.. At least Justice league carried more DC essence in the movie. You can clearly see that Aquaman is made for better entertainment experience than focusing on DC attributes. Somewhat similar to recent Thor Ragnarok, Black Panter etc in MCU where they were really pop cone movies made for general audiences to talk away with a relaxed feeling.End of the day studios need to make $$ and this movie is made to do just that. DC's darker attributes didn't work so well to attract a larger audience in any recent movies. You can't achieve big box office numbers by trying to impress the comic fan base. You need everyone to watch the movie. So, for that you need a movie with good CGI, flashy story line (not necessarily a good script), good action and happy ending.I rate Aquaman 6.5. It is watchable and entertaining at most parts... But then as a comic fan I walk away little disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Despite the film's ambitious underwater setting, the reality is far from the grandeur expected. While Jason Momoa commands attention as Arthur Curry, the film falters significantly in its portrayal of other characters, hindering its impact as a superhero film.Momoa's portrayal of Arthur Curry is undeniably charismatic, infusing the character with roguish charm, unwavering courage, and a profound connection to both land and sea. However, beyond Momoa's compelling performance, the rest of the cast struggles to rise to the occasion. Many supporting actors deliver below-average performances, lacking the believability and nuance that are crucial in the superhero genre.The film's acting, aside from Momoa, feels subpar, failing to achieve any sort of depth or spark any emotion. This deficiency contributes to a narrative that appears one-dimensional, robbing the characters of the complexity necessary for a truly engaging story.Aquaman's visual journey through the underwater realms continues to disappoint. The CGI and special effects, which were expected to bring the aquatic world to life, fall short of creating a convincing and immersive experience. The landscapes lack the realism needed to captivate audiences and elevate the film's overall impact.The lack of originality and unexpected twists prevents Aquaman from standing out among other superhero films, with the villains, especially Black Manta, failing to inspire the necessary menace associated with iconic superhero antagonists.In conclusion, Aquaman struggles to tread water, with Momoa's strong performance unable to salvage the film from its below-average supporting cast and lackluster visual execution. The film's failure to achieve depth in both acting and narrative prevents it from making a splash among superhero classics, leaving audiences with an ocean adventure that falls short of its lofty ambitions.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Too bad amber heard was cast in this movie and every other move she had ever been in. By far the WORST attempt at acting I've seen since Mariah Carey in Glitter. Their was a lot of cgi in this movie, maybe just a tad too much. Lots of fighting and under water scenes. The story line is about the same as every other superhero movie, so the lazy writers must have had hangovers or just didn't care when they were writing this because their was nothing new or extravagant in it. Basically all the main characters were casted with all the wrong people except for Jason Momoa who played Aquaman perfectly! I give him a 10/10. Amber heard scenes made me want a refund. She gets a 2/10 and I'm being very generous. Patrick Wilson was acting a little over the top and it was hard to ever take him seriously he gets a 6/10. Nicole Kidman started the movie with poor acting as well but surprised me towards the end by finishing very strong. (I think it was because she was standing next to amber heard and, a turnip acts better than her) she get a 8/10. William Defoe player a lesser of a part than I had hoped and wished to see him a little more within the story. He always gets very ""into"" his characters and performs stunningly. He gets a 9/10 for his role. I literately will never want to watch this again because I could not stop laughing at how bad amber heard was. It just made me irritated they would cast a potentialess hack In a massive film full of professionals with her barely high school drama-like skills set. Shame! SHAME!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The thing is children shows like Peppa Pig (I watch it with my 3 years old nephew) or Ladybug (I watch it with my 6 years old niece) are hundred million times more mature and more suspenseful than the average superhero movie. Not to mention that the many animation movies out there have some of the best storytelling you can find nowadays. So why Hollywood? Why does it have to be so ... dumb? I don't get it. I'm a writer myself. How hard can it be to write some good dialogues? I was never a DC fan, but I always thought the DC Universe would be more mature and darker. Maybe the whole atmosphere is ""darker"" but sure the stories aren't more mature.
So talking about Aquaman: I like the character and the actor. The movie was not terrible, but it was like 99% CGI (even the hair in the water was animated), some superhero things happened, there were a lot of fights going on and yeah ... he became the king of Atlantis. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm writing this review. I just wonder why Hollywood cannot make a blockbuster movie with a good and intriguing story. Do good stories don't sell anymore? It's just sad.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Most of the people already knows the story, The movie's success will be based on the way it is presented. I noticed one key point for the success of these superhero movies- Tell the story from the beginning. Deliver it slowly. Say it like you tell to a kid during his/her bed time. Most of the successful superhero movies are falling under this line. Batman triology, MCU Avengers Universe, Man of steel, Wonder Woman all succeeded because they told the story from the start and they told it slowly. If they decided to hurry things up then the result will end up like Batman Vs Superman & Justice League. Thankfully Famous horror film director James Wan made it slow and had patience to tell the story from the start.Aquaman is not so well known character for Indian Audience unlike Ironman & Batman, atleast for me, I dont know Aquaman much. I just know he is a member of Justice league, king of underwater universe called Atlantis, he can control water and he talks to fish. What is his origin? How he became the king of Atlantis? what is his Power and weakness? His emotions, his family everything is explained clearly in this movie. As STR said in vinnaithaandi varuvaya ""Avaru epadi ithukulla vantharu, avaru epadi Don aagi Billa aguraru"" Thats what the Aquaman is all about.Visuals, Graphics and Locations gives a pleasant watching experience. This is the main plus point of this movie. Throughout the movie we can witness the eye pleasing experience specially with the 3D glasses on. Be it an isolated light house, underwater shots, Sahra desert, a village in italy, fantasy worlds beneath water everything was captured excellently. It was like seeing the dreams without even sleeping.Slow paced screenplay and telling the story from the start can be considered as both pro and con of this movie. Though we get to know the character very well, the movie feels lengthy and without much twists and turns, so most of the scenes are predictable. Background score gives life to the visuals. Bgm's are good in all scenes.Similarities between this movie and ""Thor"" are really surprising. Be it the fantasy world, the story and the characters, this movie reminds us of MCU's Thor in many scenes. The scope and screenspace given to Female characters in this movie are something what Indian directors should learn from. So summing it up Aquaman with its bed time tale kind of story is a visual experience to be enjoyed in theatre once.Rating: 3.25/5","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So this film had to be better than Justice League, right? Not so much... I found the film highly predictable. The humor used seems forced and is more rolling-of-the-eyes cheesy than funny.

It should enhance reality, not be so far removed that it becomes ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, Amber Heard's character, Mera, is absolutely awesome... so why did they dress her up in an unspeakably old-fashioned catsuit that's all cleavage and high heels? Plus Arial hair? Who the hell goes out to fight dressed like that? Even superheroes need some self respect. This to me seemed totally outdated, particularly post me-too. Grow up, Hollywood. Women need to see cool women in films too, you know, and they don't all need to be the same 1960s stereotype. 52% of the world population is female and here we have only 2 female characters (amazing actresses, both) and thousands of men. This is so tiresome.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

From the beginning of the movie until the end the movie throws BRILLIANT action scenes at audiences that are directed masterfully and overall paced great to keep audiences ""glued to the screen"". These range from one-on-one fights to GIANT army-on-army battles against the visually diverse settings of the seven seas and the surface world. These different settings for the narrative and spectacle allow for audiences to distinguish the different cultures across the seven seas and allow the film to maintain colourful and vibrant, unlike some DCEU movies. Like stated, though, the directing is truly where the film shines. James Wan brings great impact, scale and intricacy to the way the action and other moments of the film are shot, with a memorable example being a chase scene, unfortunately revealed in trailers for those who have seen them. However, where the directing adds a layer of great spectacle which carries audiences' enjoyment from beginning to end, those critical with story will surely find faults. The narrative's biggest issue, after watching the film, is its underdeveloped and simplistic nature. Characters from the protagonists to the villains lack deep and complex motivation for their actions throughout the film, making some ""confused"" as to why the characters are so persistent in their goals. Also, the film, for some with perhaps lesser knowledge of the character and the world, appears incoherent when ""jumping"" around to different Atlantic civilisation, inter-woven with flashbacks which simply distract from the plot at hand. As for its simplistic nature, it follows a clich√©d formula of a ""road trip"" of sorts, accompanied with ""fish out of water"" humour which varies in quality. Finally, there is a revelation in the final act which is predictable and irrelevant. That being said, the film does occasionally hit emotional beats and manages to encapsulate much of the character's heavy law in its run time, though it doesn't balance screen time for some characters as well as most would like. Overall, despite the MANY story problems which may frustrate critical audience members, the pure spectacle alone is a master to behold and the thin plot is overshadowed by the ""fun"" and enjoyable nature of the film which embraces its absurd routes, similar to James Wan's work on ""Fast & Furious 7"".","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Easily the worst dialogue of 2018 but also a contender for best artistic vision. Worth watching but only barely.
Visually excellent, Wan's direction clearly focuses on Momoa outshining the other characters, which he certaintly does, and individual artists being given liberty to amaze the audience with stunning details. With set pieces spanning multiple genres and a rather broad scope on Atlantean culture, DC almost makes this film above average but fails in almost every other category aside from these few specific areas.Part of what makes DC comics and animated features so great is their willingness to not oversimplify complex themes. Ocean Master is a phenomenal and complex character but the writers in this film made him a one-dimensional stereotype. This pattern is repeated across nearly every character as each speaks exactly what is expected and nothing more. Momoa is the slight exception to this as he brings humanity (lol pun) to the derivative atlantean dialogue. This decision was clearly taken out of fear that creating multiple complex, logical characters would overcomplicate the plot and ruin the experience for the lowest common denominator. Whether or not this is a positive is up for debate but with such depth in source material, I personally believe we should hold DC films to higher standards.Is it awful? No, but it does have very poor execution in a few areas which are highlighted by excellence in other areas. It is my sincere hope that future DCEU releases focus on character depth primarily and visual artistry secondarily. Without a change soon, the opportunity to rival marvel may be gone and the complex characters we love will be confined to the small screen permanently.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He is also the rightful heir of the kingdom of Atlantis and now he has to do his best in order to prevent a war between the world of ocean and the world of land.I liked this movie because it was very interesting and very new for me since I had not watched an underwater superhero movie like ""Aquaman"" before. The direction which was made by James Wan was very good and I believe he succeeded on creating a bond between his main character and the audience, something that helped us follow the plot of the movie. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Jason Momoa who played as Arthur Curry / Aquaman was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Patrick Wilson's who played as King Orm, Amber Heard's who played as Mera and Willem Dafoe's who played as Vulko. Lastly, I have to say that ""Aquaman"" is a nice, interesting movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Maybe Infinity War can compete. Probably. But that's it. James Wan is an artist, at least visually.There are problems, of course:
The humor is hit and miss.
The way the story is told is a bit too repetitive.
Some songs are jaw droppingly bad.
The villains too basic.But the good is great:
The emotion works (barely, but it works).
The arcs of the characters feel totally earned.
Parts of the score are actually pretty awesome.
The villains while basic, help to force our protagonist to become the hero and define him.
Did I mention that the action is insanely good?I often don't care that much about the action.... but there are exceptions and this movie just blew me away without being complemented by an awful story (like Valerian, for example)","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

This is meant to be a fun action film it's not meaningful and deep like Wonder Woman, and it's no where near as bad as Suicide Squad and BvS.

It is the Batman trilogy, Wonder Woman, and then we have to travel back in time decades to Tim Burton's Batman films and Richard Donner's Superman.What is the difference between DC and Marvel? How come there is such a gap in their movies as far as writing? The SFX make Aquaman a tolerable film to watch, and that is basically it. Jason Momoa has charisma, but the dialogue is so expositional, so on the nose, so boring and irritating, for every character.And where is the character development? Jason Momoa's Arthur/Aquaman has an arc, but everyone else is one-dimensional. In Wonder Woman, we saw what could be added to the story when the supporting cast have backstories: the Arab with Hollywood dreams but he is the wrong color, the Native American who has had everything stolen from him by people who look like the leads, the PTSD sniper who can't shoot anymore.A saving grace for this film, I think, would have been a little more focus on the pollution affecting ocean life, the damage to the environment. What is wrong with raising the IQ level of a blockbuster film, so it isn't just popcorn entertainment?Yet Aquaman is almost all visual effects (and I guess it has to be since it mostly happens in a fictional underwater world). There is barely a coherent story: a special trident, the surface world is evil, war must be waged. The mythology doesn't work for me, and once again the dialogue is painful.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

The Gods are somewhat merciful and give us a few eloquent visuals that make us forget, if even for a moment, that this film is just an Exxon Valdez away from a full fledged dumpster fire. Yes, it's a movie. It's supposed to be entertaining and entertaining it is. There are numerous fighting sequences (can you say overkill?) And a few good laughs at the expense of the character's (or actor's) dignity, but there is so much more at stake here. DC is drowning beneath the riptide of Marvel""s success and if they want to break the surface and breathe again, DC has got to stop spending money on sinking ships.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

With a huge army at his command, he plans to conquer the oceanic people before taking on the rest of the world. Arthur Curry, the human-born heir to Atlantis, embarks on a quest to stop him.Standard comic book adaptation featuring DC's Aquaman is visually striking, the CGI effects is good, bringing to life the underwater city and the vast underwater tech and creatures. Didn't expect to like this, but it's a fair adventure with some good action, dialogue and nice battle in the end. Jason Memoa does well in the lead hero, though he looks like BeeGees' Barry Gibb's lost son who was conceived at Woodstock festival circa 1969. Cutie Amber Heard looks fetching in that green outfit. Downside is that there's too much songs interludes, a weak main villain and some dull spots.

Flashbacks are thrown in seemingly at random and practically give you whiplash. Character motivations are never quite explained. The movie plays out like a bunch of different cut-scenes from an Aquaman video game played out in random order. The cheese level at some points surpasses Power Rangers (the TV show!) levels and the dialogue drops down to the level of the bad guys yelling ""RRAARRR!!"".While still entertaining, there are some awesome scenes, it definitely drops down a cog from the Aquaman we were introduced to in Justice League and left me disappointed.

James Wan's direction works very well, the fight scenes are amazing and the whole look of the film is very interesting. Some costumes are too cheesy and don't work like Suicide Squad, for example. The other uniforms are really pretty, that is, they are not balanced. This is reflected throughout the film, nothing is perfectly balanced. He wants to try to be a critic, but at the same time he doesn't want to step out of the comfort zone of superhero movies. What's missing in those two hours is the courage to criticize what you want and try to do something new. A film doesn't need to be innovative and revolutionary, it can have a simple story and entertain the viewer. However, what the story offers is so basic and sometimes so predictable that it really rubs you the wrong way. The soundtrack sometimes doesn't work, but the movie is fun and the visuals are fantastic, so it's worth a watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Also nothing with Jason Mamoa can ever be a complete letdown. I was also surprised by Nicole Kidman being the love interest because in my head I thought she was Lois Lane but turns out I was just remembering her as Batman's girlfriend and I was very confused as to why one supers gf was another moms for a little while.

And this draws you out of the action ruining the immersion.This film also falls flat with its villain, Ocean master, who lacks any good motivation unlike the black manta villain placed in the subplot, manta is an expertly executed villain who deserves to be the main villain. All the actors pull out decent performances apart from Wilson, who feels out of place despite looking the part.

Another worthy movie from DCEU besides Wonder Woman. Never have I expected the movie to be turned as good as this, especially since the director James Wan is famous for mostly horror movies such as Saw, The Conjuring, and Insidious.You can also call this movie the Black Panther version of DC : the plot which is battle for the throne, the lost and advanced city of Atlantis which basically is Wakanda, and the powerful villain of King Orm which basically is Killmonger. Surely there are some point which different but those elements are the most that standout to me and basically feels Black Panther enough for me.There are some things that I must say Aquaman did better than Black Panther : the beautiful tough and badass Princess Mera portrayed by Amber Heard, a badass mother Queen Atlanna portrayed by Nicole Kidman, and a better 2nd villain in the form of Black Manta rather than Ulysses Klaue. Besides that, Jason Momoa is standout as Arthur Curry and Aquaman is a truly energized fast paced action superhero movie since the beginning that will keep you amazed until the end and not realizing that the movie duration is almost 2.5 hoursSo why the 4.5 and not the perfect 5 score? Well since basically I am a Marvel fanboy and I watched Black Panther 3 times in theaters, which is a record for me, this movie cannot have a better score than Black Panther LOL. Wakanda ForeverScore : 4.5 of 5 stars","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

The movie I watched was sickeningly corny, terribly scripted, punctured full of plot holes, had some downright useless characters, had the weakest story ive seen in a film for years and was plauged with awful acting.
If i wasnt to give this movie a 1 out of 10 it is because Patrick Wilson was a great villain, the visuals were stunning and just less than half of the action scenes were really well done.

There wasn't a good villian, and the minor villian was pointless. Most bothersome part for me: besides a 20 second kiss, there wasn't a genuinely romantic relationship between the two characters.

I am a fan of Superhero movies so thought why not catch up with this one after not seeing it at Christmas time. All in all it passed the time and I left having enjoyed the film but I won't say it's the best I have ever seen. DC tends to be a bit of a darker side of this genre but this one felt a bit more lighter and fun. Back Story is quickly sorted so you can watch as a stand alone movie and we find out it is set after Justice League during general chit chat.No real spoilers as our hero goes off on a quest to save the world and reluctantly claim his rightful thrown. The plot as you would expect can be picked through but all of the stars in the movie have a bit of fun. Jason Momoa is a bit wooden but he fills the role well. There are plenty of good CGI moments and loads of bright colours whilst not to my taste and sometimes a waste of screen time I am sure the younger people will enjoy. Fight sequences get bigger and bigger as the movie goes on as Aquaman goes on his travels.All in all a fun film certainly not the best but certainly not the worst. Shame no other DC characters didn't make a guest appearance but I guess being mostly under water kind of rules that out. Will I watch Aquaman 2, yes probably. Worth a watch if you have nothing better to do.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is not the best movie ever made but it is very entertaining and I never got bored by the running time also.Kudos to James Wan who created a mesmerizing world for Atlantis. The visuals are really spectacular, some of the best I have ever seen on screen, and you really must watch this movie in a cinema to appreciate the art behind it. As I already said, the direction never feels too slow or boring even thought there is nothing new to the plot. It is effective in it's simplicity and I was entertained throughout the whole movie. The performances by the actors are good especially by Jason Mamoa who portrays Aquaman effectively.My only minor issue with this movie is the script which I found a bit weak and cheesy. Although I do not mind some humor, in certain scenes I felt that they went a bit over the top with some dialogue and it was distracting for my liking.All in all, this is a very entertaining movie with really impeccable visuals and great action sequences.

Jason M (whom I hate in 90% of his movies) does a GREAT job and presents a charismatic version of Arthur we don't generally get.Though it should be said, the jokes about it being ""wet Thor"" are pretty accurate.

There's no doubt that DC has interesting characters, considering how often Superman has been rebooted and how successful Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy was. Even Wonder Woman (2017) had its great moments, despite also feeling derivative influences from movies like Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Aquaman (2018) seems to continue this trend, despite again having a strong leading character (both physically and in backstory/lore).I will give DC credit for their casting decisions here. For decades, Aquaman has been the butt of the joke amongst many superhero aficionados. The fact that Jason Momoa is a badass, snarky, and overall entertaining actor to watch in the role speaks to their awareness of ""image management."" Perhaps featuring him in previous films like Justice League (2017) also helped to get audiences interested in seeing this superhero in a standalone movie. Needless to say, my interest was piqued, and I finally went to see this film. Knowing little to nothing about Aquaman, I was in for an experience.While the movie overall wasn't bad, it felt a little too long. I think the Black Manta storyline was a bit distracting, especially as a setup for a future sequel. After all, when there's this huge Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars conflict going on, there shouldn't be time for these other plotlines. I'll also say that the plot felt a little derivative of Black Panther (2018), which only had the advantage of being released earlier in the year. There was also a bit of a Tron: Legacy (2010) aesthetic in this movie that I liked. I did feel the Little Mermaid (1989) nod was perhaps a little too obvious, though.A Jason Momoa vehicle crammed full of plot and aesthetics from other films, I give Aquaman 3.5 stars out of 5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Okay it's not that bad, but it really isn't that much better. It was incredibly cheesy and cringe throughout. The acting was pretty horrendous, which is too bad because I like a majority of the actors. The two leads are not much more than eye candy.Essentially this was a 2 hour plus CGI fest. Don't get me wrong, the CGI was fairly top notch, but when it's the only redeeming quality and 95 percent of your movie, then unfortunately the movie is just not that good. Viewers have to suspend their brain from actually thinking to even consider any of this believable. Yes, it's a comic book movie but come on it was all pretty ridiculous.I'm actually happy it made a ton of money, just in hopes that it will save the DC universe. I would still like to see DC figure their mess out and get on track, but if I'm being honest this was right near the bottom along with Suicide Squad for me.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Big praise for Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson Dolph Lundgren and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II for their incredible performances in this movie.James Wan manages to deliver an amazing action film with unbelievable and beautiful visuals and leaves you wanting even more.

It's not good, that's fair to say but I've a strange feeling it's about as good as its ridiculous source material would allow it to be.Jason Momoa is Arthur Curry. Hilariously he's supposed to be 29 years old. He's also the son of Atlanna, fleeing queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) and Tom, a lighthouse keeper, played (in unconvincing de-aging CGI by Temurea Morrison). His half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens to unite the undersea kingdoms and wage war on the land dwellers, so Arthur returns home to challenge his brother for control of the undersea realms.So, whilst it's not really acting as such, Jason Momoa is always watchable and his charisma will carry you through quite a distance. The film also has a few decent action sequences along the way, particularly the underwater battle that concludes it and the opening fight scene on board a submarine. That's about it for the positives though.On dozens of occasions, ""Aquaman"" is laugh out loud hilariously awful. The plot is terrible, a clich√© ridden McGuffin hunt, a painfully obvious twist towards the end and some awful foreshadowing plot points. It has, noticeably, terrible music choices throughout - a horrible score of pretend wonder. The rest of the performances apart from Momoa are dreadful, particularly Willem Defoe and Dolph Lundgren but nobody else comes off particularly well. It's the script though, that should have been drowned. From ""This was your grandfathers knife, he was a frogman in World War 2, then they turned their back on him"" onwards it's a terrible collection of recycled everything you've heard before in action movies for the last thirty years. It's painfully unaware how unfunny it is too.The CGI is patchy, happier with real creatures and vehicles than it is with fictional characters. It often ignores its own internal logic too, at one point Curry hangs onto to a building to avoid a ten foot drop - but before and after that he happily falls hundreds of feet and shrugs it off. Conventional weapons can't damage Curry, until towards the end, where one can. Nobody runs away when a shark starts to crack an aquarium wall.Sadly, I'm not convinced there is a better ""Aquaman"" movie possible than this one but I'm not sure that's any reason to pretend this one is any good.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Packing a slap with a wet fish; this one opens being silly and gets more silly.
So I took it at face value and tongue in cheek movie for the almost cartoon superhero.
But even that was too much for this. The special effects were so poor, I tasked myself with finding the worst ones! Who morphed the faces onto the cartoons did well, but it was so OTT that you cannot take it seriously.
Bright lighting/lights take your eyes away from the scenes, but it is so poor; I swear Willem Dafoe is laughing while he says his lines.
The narrator made me laugh - how silly and far fetched - too far fetched for people, maybe in a cartoon.
The storyline was created ad-hoc during the movie, seemingly, to fit in and add something to this POS.
It really is steaming, you can taste it the smell is that bad.
It is BORING and unintentionally funny' it's that bad..
My daughters school play had lines delivered better than this - seriously.

It feels like a mish mash of everything. It's a nice fun for popcorn eaters, but not more than that. Jason Momoa, while somewhat likable, got the role only because of his looks and not because of the acting (I can never forgive, never forget, how he raped the character of Conan... Whose idea was to give a Samoan chance to play a barbarian clearly inspired by the people of the north?! And don't even get me started on Khal Drogo...), so he can be eye candy. And I'm OK with that, but let's just please not commend him for acting, at least not yet, until he hasn't acted in something demanding. Movie was fun to watch, but it fails to be anything more than a fun blockbuster you watch and then forget about it, until you see it on TV 10 years later. It's a shame, after memorable Suicide Squad, that we had to come to this. Do I recommend the movie? Yes, for fun, it can serve it's purpose. Is it a masterpiece or worthy to be talked about or even remembered? Most definitely not. 7/10!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I would've given it a 10 but it has it's flaws from time to time, but for a DC Movie? it's a 10 for sure!I loved the Visuals, after seeing so many movies with fights on Earth or in Space it feels refreshing (no pun intended) to see a movie underwater, as a big sucker for Atlantis Stories and the idea of a Underwater Civilisation I am glad I got to see it on release date in the UK, the battles and plot were pretty good for a DC movie, again I loved Wonder Women compared to previous DC movies (Excluding the Dark Knight Trilogy as I do not consider that the same as the Cinematic Universe they created after) this is a HUGE upgrade, some people said it was funny like Thor Ragnarok from Marvel, I agree, but my oh my was the Cinematic on point, this is probably the most Marvel while still being DC that I can imagine DC going, and that is great, really hope to see more from the people involved in this Movie, as they did a great job! The villains put the Justice League and Suicide Squad to shame, seriously, I can't believe it, they actually finally got proper villains in a DC MOVIE!As I said, No spoiling the movie, so I am just going to end my review here, GO WATCH IT NOW!","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

Lots of action scenes which were well done. And plenty of humor throughout. The CGI effects were well done, but a bit too much of a ""neon"" effect in places. Atlantis was lit up like Las Vegas.Whatever shortcomings the plot had, the ending made up for it.

But for a movie like this it doesn't matter as it's ment to be a bit over the top and fun.
The cast did an amazing job and was really well put together. I didn't know before the movie that stars like Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Williem Dafoe, Temuera Morrison and Dolph Lundgren was in it. So i was amazed just by that. And to see Dolph Lundgren in a movie like this again was great. Jason Momoa as Aquaman really works. Played by anyone else i think it would have just felt silly.

But even he can't do it justice to much. The film was OK visually and action, and acting is was all good. this isn't James Wan best work but he did the best he can. The invasion is seen a bunch of times and we don't get to see other things other than Arthur Curray, we don't see to much Atlantis or Athlatians, we just see how much the visuals have done through.

Don't get me wrong, deeper more artistic movies are fantastic, but not every movie has to be one of those, some just need to be entertaining and take you on an action packed journey, sell you some escapism and just be fun.
This movie was cheesy, yes, but a good cheese, the Brie cheese of superhero movies. It made me laugh, cry, gasp and loose my freaking mind! Honestly it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in terms of pure entertainment value, I know I keep repeating that but here is no other way to describe it.
Jason mamoa is engaging and fun but also gave some depth, not to mention absolutely stunning. Amber herds Mera was a great character and was an absolute doer and not clich√© at all. The love stories weren't forced and one was particularly beautiful. Also, for the DC and comic book nerds like me out there so many fun little Easter eggs to the comics and animated movies so that was just icing on the cake.

I am disappointed by the acting and empty expressions of Temuera as well as Nicole Kidman esp in the 1st half. Some of the scenes where Manta is tweaking the Atlantic technology seems ridiculous as the only background that was shown is that he was a pirate. Many scenes seems rushed and just feels like out of order.What works for movie is it's speciall effects and also Jason Momoa is terrific.

Well definitely, it has bad things in it I do not deny it, but in my opinion details that can be done aside, if something makes clear is that when Warner allows his directors to work on their stories something good comes out of it, to my personal taste Aquaman seemed infinitely superior to that seen in Wonder woman, which is highly recommended not to lose it","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now that I have seen it, I have never been more low key dissatisfied.
Let me start off where the movie itself started off, the conception of Aquaman. Tom Curry (Aquaman's father) looked like a cartoon. They were trying to make him look younger, and it looked like a similar past mistake like the horrendous ""mustache"". However, looking at all the other CGI (with minor mistakes that make it look completely awful), it looked very, very good. Just being underwater was incredible, because we really do know more about Mars than our own oceans. Therefore, it was welcoming to see how the underwater features would work, and they definitely worked well.
Now let's talk about the script. This was one of the most laziest scripts and quite predictable. A 6 year old would quite enjoy this movie cause he wouldn't have to think at all. However, a knowledgeable person would get considerably bored.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Where they come short is the writing, as some scenes are so over the top that they are almost groan-inducing (like the one on the Italian island), but it seems like they almost embrace it. On that note, I liked how they tackle & try to explain all the illogical concepts from the comics before people can criticize them.There are some good action set pieces, however it seems like we're just going from one to the next and the scenes in between are treated like filler.

Aquaman maintains masterful storytelling and gripping action throughout the entirety of its 2.5-hour runtime, with the exception of the last 15 minutes.

All of that don't take away really from the cliche script , the terrible dialogue , the bad performances all over the place and the stinking jokes other than some it is so bad it is funny moments it didn't make me even chuckle .

That being said, what followed up could very well be their most creative endeavor yet, and that is the cinematic stand alone flick centered around Aquaman. It also happens to be the only addition to this franchise that grossed over a billion dollars worldwide. After finally having watched it, I must say that it is arguably their most epic and rad flick they have made thus far.The main storyline revolves around Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry, who is the heir to the underwater kingdom called Atlantis. However, he is destined to step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world. From that premise alone, the film has a very predictable narrative, and its not hard to figure out what happens throughout the runtime. In addition, the film has a rather pointless subplot centering on Black Manta seeking revenge towards Aquaman, and it barely has much connection to the progression of the film as a whole. Also, many of the other characters are two-dimensional at best, Arthur's relationship with Meta lacks the proper chemistry needed for a romantic arch, and the film may really didn't need to be nearly 2.5 hours.However, where the film may lack in originality, it more than ever makes up with a huge epic scale and some amazing action. It really feels as if director James Wan was having a field day with all the different set pieces the film displays. From the underwater regions, to the vast Sahara desert, to the coastal villages of Italy and more, the overall scope of the film really creates the feeling that were are viewing an epic globetrotting adventure. Not to mention, the CGI is highly imaginative and the vast amount of creature designs are enough to inspire plenty of animators and visual effects artists. All these different areas and monsters the film plays around with make me feel like I'm experiencing something out of this world, something that even some of the best superhero movies don't offer.Now admittedly, the film does feature unnecessary slow mo angles like the former DC films, but at least they don't rely on it. Also, most of the acting is relatively good, even down to Jason Mamoa seemingly having fun with his character. Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Temeura Morrison and Nicole Kidman are serviceable enough, whereas the likes of Amber Heard and Dolph Lundgren seem like they're underacting, and even the younger actors playing past forms of Aquaman come off as laughably bad. More often than not, trying to act bold and stoic doesn't really lead to an appropriately convincing performance, but then again, this movie isn't even about Oscar worthy performances. If anything, that Oscar goes to the catchy and upbeat rendition of Africa by Pitbull.Never in my life would I think I'd be enjoying a movie from this franchise solely out of its production values and creativity than the actual story. Despite its cliched storyline and hit or miss characters, Aquaman might be the most entertaining DCEU venture next to Shazam, although this one is more entertaining from how nutty it all is. Where Shazam was amusing and fun intentionally, this film creates such a crazy world of its own that it might as well be in the history books of biggest blockbuster superhero hits. Even if you're not a DC fan, I would actually recommend this movie due to the epic scope and highly imaginative visual aesthetic. It may be more brawn than brains, but as pure campy popcorn delight, you won't be disappointed at all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie features bright, vibrant colors; well-done CGI; and amazing fight sequences. But in terms of plot and character development, I don't think this movie was the best. The characters lacked the depth that would generally cause you to fall in love with them and I found myself experiencing very little emotion for the entirety of the film. Everything seemed to come really easy to the MC and the plot was predictable. Like REALLY predictable. By the end of the film, only people I cared about were the parents of aqua man. Another thing that was really annoying was the gross over-use of music. You know that powerful crescendo movies use whenever the main villain hits the screen? Well this film used it. Like Eleven Times. Every time ANY antagonist came to the screen you'd hear the loud minor chords, and every time aqua man accomplished the tiniest feet the music got loud and majestic. After 30 minutes of the film the sounds will really start to annoy you and you'll be begging for a quiet scene. In general this was certainly not the worst film, but wasn't the best either. If you go see it you'll enjoy it, but it won't be memorable.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And once again it's due to it straying away from the usual DC/Zack Snyder/Christopher Nolan clich√©s. This is a colourful action blast full of good humour, interesting locations, bright lights, majestic set pieces and enough eye candy to paint a house with. True, the story is still bit of a mess, it's trying to do perhaps a thing or two too many at once, but it's more than entertaining enough to rise above such petty concerns.Two great things to single out. First is the direction of James Wan. Mainly a horror director before this, he brings with him this great energy and passion. This feels like an epic. Like a great superhero film should. He also has a really good style when it comes to action scenes. Like in Wonder Woman, all the action scenes in this film are easy to follow, mostly shot at wide view, with very little shaky cam employed. And surprise of surprises, it makes it really entertaining to watch when you can actually see what's going on and can appreciate all the effort that went into making it.The second great thing is Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, the eponymous Aquaman. Amazing physical presence, very good with action scenes and practically made for the role, despite his looks being rather far from the original character. And he has some serious comedic chops, which this character sorely needs. Because, let's face it, a superhero who talks to fish is not the easiest sell in the world, but Momoa makes it work.Granted, the villain side of things is still a bit lacking, the story is messy, some of the side characters are rather weak, and there are more than a few hiccups scattered throughout.But, the film still delivers. I walked out of the theater with a big smile on my face and I'd more than gladly see the film again. And that's the most important thing.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it much more than the recent movies based in this universe. First, the pros- the visual effects are aesthetic and absolutely stunning. The action scenes are also great, and the amount of CGI work on this actually shows. It looks really good. Jason Momoa is also a big asset in this film, because, to be honest, he makes Aquaman cool. Aquaman hasn't been one of the most-liked superheroes in popular media, and many have previously made fun of the character. But, Momoa here really flips the script. The way he carries himself in the film has really changed the way I look at Aquaman, and I'm sure he has done the same for others too.The supporting cast were good, and I liked Nicole Kidman's portrayal as Queen Atlanna. Patrick Wilson was also good in his role as the antagonist.Moving on to the cons, I thought the script was a little weak. It seemed like a rehashed plot and was very similar to other superhero origin stories and a little cliched too. I especially thought the movie was awkward at times. Without going into spoiler area, I thought some moments didn't make much sense. Black Manta also was not so well-used here. I wish we could have seen a little more of him. I am expecting better for the sequel as this movie really makes me want to get into the DCEU. This was fairly good; one extra star for the CGI effects, which were very well done.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jason Momoa is a fun actor. There's no denying that. He tried his heart out to make the best of what is certainly the worst dialogue in the last 10 years.Nicole Kidman is always a charmer, however this movie somehow dulled her usually effervescent glow. The actress can deliver a line, the problem here is just that there was nothing good to deliver. Amber Heard is lovely yet quite boring in the role she hoped would define her. Still, Johnny Depp didn't deserve her.The most confusing fight scenes ever seen on film are present throughout, and this is probably the weakest storyline since Independence Day 2.I can't fathom how anyone saw this movie and thought ""Wow! That's the best thing I've ever seen!"" My teenage daughter, who is a lover of all things superhero, agreed with me wholeheartedly that the CGI work on this film was substandard, horrible dialogue seems to have been made up on the fly, and the giant Seahorses knocks you off scale because we all know Seahorses are just a few inched high. At one point my daughter turned to me and said ""dad, how big are the Altantians, like 4"" tall?"" We both cracked up at that mental imagery.The DCEU still does not compare with the MCU. It just doesn't. It never will. I loved Wonder Woman, but that was in spite of the story, not because of it. Gal Gadot is just fantastic, and wonderful to watch.This movie had me looking at the clock. That's never a good thing. I wanted to give this movie a 4, but my daughter said it had more redeeming qualities than that.

The movie uses this to justify the possible existence of fantastic things in the ocean such as Atlantis.Aquaman is a half-breed: half man, half Atlantean. When his half-brother starts to threaten with a war between the surface world and Atlantis he is needed to take his rightful place as king. Being a half-breed he has a difficult time being accepted and has to find the legendary trident of King Atlan to seal the deal.There are some cute messages: The movie deals with racism. Even if we are not born the same, we shouldn't treat the other as a lesser being. Being multicultural is not a punishment, it's a blessing to connect different cultures.Being of a movie of the sea, it also of course has the chance to convey some problems in us polluting the ocean. That's one reason the Atlanteans detest surface people but there are not that many hints of this.The movie had beautiful colors and some nice scenes but the story was mostly quite bland. The comic relief scenes in between when Mera escaped with Arthur were good and a gateway for a breather. But all in all the movie is not super spectacular.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The amount of action packed sequences in this movie is too much. And everyone of them is done absolutely amazing . The Vfx/Cgi is one of the best you can experience . You would definitely fall in love with the camera work that James Wan has pulled off. The script is also good , not great. I missed the amazing dialogues and one-liners from Zack Snyder movies. Also the background scores were also not as per the scene. The place where they should have put an epic score, they put a pop music. I know the taste to mucic is different for everyone , but still I thought it didn't fit right. Also sometimes the actors were doing some over-the-top acting. Once you watch the movie you can see it.That been said, the overall movie experience is just awesome. You would definitely get the value of your money.

JL was a huge flop IMO as it was simply rushed and there was simply no character growth at all! Besides Wonder Woman, Batman & Supes, I had absolutely no inkling or any form of connections to the other heroes.So lo and behold, fast forward a year later and the trailer for Aquamam came out. I have to admit, the trailer was very intriguing but even then I was kind of doubtful if Aquaman could even entertain me with a decent plot or even some half-solid action sequences. MY EXPECTATIONS WERE TOTALLY SHATTERED.The cast was great! Jason Momoa killed it as Aquaman. He brought Aquman to life perfectly with his outgoing and rambunctious personality and physically he nailed it as well. Amber Heard as Mera was perfect too as she displays a sense of pride and strength that we are all too familiar with the Mera in the comic book universe. Patrick Wilson as King Orm was convincing as well and he truly made me dislike him from the moment he appears. The supporting case (Nicole Kidman & William Dafoe) was solid too and even the antagonists were considerably interesting too. This is what truly set Aquaman apart from JL. There is a proper cause and Aquaman has a legitimate underdog journey to obtain the throne/Overall, I think all DC fans and any average moviegoer should go watch this. The CGI isnt bad at all and James Wan has perfects cuts and edits so not a single scene feels to dragged out. The action scenes are all very neatly done and u can feel a surge of adrenaline pumping through you when the musical score hits during battle scenes.Most importantly though, there is an actual plot that you can relate to and you can submerge yourself in the absolutely dreamy and surreal world of Atlantis while enjoying this roller coaster of a movie.I am definitely hoping for a sequel and I hope the DCEU can continue building on the success of this movie.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, Marvel has done a fairly good job with making comics come to life. DC is failing in every aspect with the latest super hero movies. I understand it is much more difficult to make a man who commands the sea more ""realistic"" than it is a billionaire with a vendetta, but this movie was flat out ridiculous. I literally laughed out loud when one of the guys showed up riding a shark like a horse. Even "" The Boys"" had much better execution of the Deep which is somewhat of a parody of Aquaman. The villains were just as stupid. The casting was also horrible. Jason Mamoa did a decent job as Aquaman and the man who played his father was believable, but everyone else was poorly casted. Kidman did not fit the roll of Mamoa's mother, the brother was a joke, Manta was a benign villain, and the worst of all was Amber Heard. Heard (though I don't like her because of her recent abuse debacle, I'll give my unbiased opinion) is a horrible actress. She is undeniably beautiful, but I could not take her character seriously. The movie made her character look like Ariel from the Little Mermaid underwent combat training. She didn't have chemistry with Mamoa. I usually love superhero movies but with this one, I asked my husband twice if he wanted to leave the theater. We finished it because we paid for it, but staying is still a regret of mine...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Some of the comedy beats in this film just didn't work for me personally and tho his suit looked awesome Black manta just wasn't as exciting as a future villain, his hate for Aquaman is understandable but seems like a very underwhelming villain for now, I'm sure he'll improve come the sequel.

'Wonder Woman' is still the benchmark, but only just. The film works well as both an origin story and a coming-of-age story. Arthur (Momoa) is the offspring of Tom (Morrison), a lighthouse keeper, and exiled Queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (Kidman), making him half-man, half-Atlantean and the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis.We see Arthur trained by Vulko (Dafoe) in flashbacks and helped in the present by Mera (Heard). To stop his step-brother Orm (Wilson) from starting a war with the ""surface dwellers"", Arthur has to embark on a journey to track down an ancient trident that will make him King of Atlantis and unite the two realms. There's enough tongue-in-cheek-ness and charm from Momoa to help you past some of the daft moments - Manta's suit (overall a weak villain), octopus drums, plesiosaurs, underwater fire and giant seahorses.It's not too long (just over 2 hours) and is fast-paced and much of the story makes it feel like a cross between 'Indiana Jones' and 'Lord of the Rings', with many of the underwater colours reminiscent of 'Avatar' - none of which are bad things. The battle at the end is all a bit absurd, but there's so much colour, action and humour to make it worthwhile. Wish all DC films were as joyful as this!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

You can tell DC is doing things differently with aquaman, they are not afraid to use the fantastical elements of Aquaman's comics.
What that means is, instead of a dark, gritty, rooted in reality movie; we have a colorful, vibrant other world under the sea movie. It is unique from other movies in its style and story elements while still maintaining familiar superhero elements.
Having said that, I personally found the movie quite predictable. Perhaps it is the way the movie plays out very similar to many video games i have played. What I mean is that the movie, while quite good, feels like it is made based off a video game story campaign.
Many scenes of dialog end with sudden violence, the main character is repeatedly told that they have only one path they can make without the world ending, even a kind of tutorial scene and well established powers.It really felt like it was written by a video game story designer, but in a good way. I hope DC can remember what worked in Aquaman in future DC movies.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Their sets of films have generally left me personally, with mixed reactions. I enjoyed Wonder Woman's refreshingly emotional narrative and Justice League's lighthearted chemistry between the main cast. Films like Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad however suffered strongly from overly convoluted stories and unlikable characters. Aquaman luckily succeeds with the adventure formula, presenting a exciting, fun and action packed narrative headed with a charismatic lead actor. When a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) shares a romance with the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) results in the birth of a half blood son, Arthur (Jason Momoa). The Queen is forced to return to Atlantis where she is sacrificed for her treachery. This fuels the hate within Arthur's half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to wage war with the surface world. In order to protect humanity Arthur is trained and helped by Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard) to go on a deadly mission to dethrone Orm. A story that has been seen a zillion times in superhero movies I feel. But what makes Aquaman so much fun is it's fast paced energy, charismatic performances, production design and action scenes. Jason Momoa really puts his stamp on the character of Arthur Curry, a drifter who has no will or ambition to become the King. He shares great father / son chemistry with Morrison where the audience really buys their loving relationship. Unfortunately the character becomes less significant as the story gets going. Kidman for her limited amount of screen time shows off prowess, strength and beauty. Patrick Wilson is a competent villain, certainly the best in the entire DCEU, there was potential at the start to make him more than a two dimensional bad guy. Unlike Killmonger this arc feels unfinished and the villain loses the initial interest. However unlike Steppenwolf, Ares, Zod and especially Lex Luthor, there was a actually a sense of threat that functioned about Wilson. His ambition and blood thirst makes him effective but nothing special, he is a standard MCU villain. Willem Dafoe also has great chemistry with Momoa as this mentor figure and it was certainly nice to see Dafoe in a superhero film again. However there also were some let downs in the acting department, Amber Heard is wooden and shares no chemistry with Momoa. I fully understand why Wan decided to cast Dolph Lundgren in this movie, but he unfortunately is an incredibly stiff actor that doesn't even possess this guilty pleasure 1980s charisma (something that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris or Christopher Lambert perfected). Some of the cgi effects still look unconvincing especially a deaging effect used on a certain actor. The story is contrived and thin and is only supposed to lead from one action scene to the next, from one exotic and interesting location to another. And as this, Aquaman succeeds. Fans of adventure serials and lighthearted superhero movies look no further. For those who look for something with more depth (no pun intended) should perhaps stay away. This is not comparable with The Dark Knight, The Winter Soldier, Logan or Infinity War. But for fans of Brendan Fraser's The Mummy will feel right at home.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I am not fully against DC movies ( although I prefer Marvel) because DC does have really good ones, Batman, Wonder Woman, and now Aquaman. The cast was very good, Jason Momoa did a fantastic job, he fit the part really well and he is not hard to look at which is a win for DC. The casting of Aquamans evil brother however could have been better than Patrick Wilson, his usual type of movies ( insidious, and the
conjuring) are very different from his part he played in Aquaman, his acting was not bad at all I just had a hard time seeing him fit the part. Overall this movie was very fascinating to see with all of the underwater special effects since it is something I have yet to see in movies before, great color, great action. I would say it is worth it to go see Aquaman while it is still in theaters just because your television at home just can't quite capture the action and special effects that a movie theater can. Is this movie perfect? no, but really no movie is, but I would recommend you seeing this movie as it was an enjoyable fun experience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It easily one of the best two DCEU movies along with the first Shazam. It takes place after Justice League, though you don't need to watch Justice League to have a deep understanding of Aqua Man with an exception of one reference that can be easily be blown off. The visuals are phenomenal and the story is good. The story is about going out and fighting for what you think is right, even if you don't think you're worthy enough. All I have to complain about the story is that the ending could feel a little rushed. I feel like the story does an alright job at setting up a sequel. I am definitely hyped up for the Lost Kingdom. It is the only DCEU movie to earn a billion dollars in the box office and it definitely deserves it. I don't feel like it deserves all the bad reviews I immediately see when going to the reviews section.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Aquaman (2018) doesn't offer anything interesting to the DCEU, or the superhero genre. It's as bland as it'll ever get. The only remarkable thing about Aquaman was the visuals. It's a very pretty film to watch; it has a vibrant color palette, good cinematography, and decent CGI, for the most part. The camera movement in the fight scenes were by far my favorite part about the film. Other than that, it's either bad or average. None of the characters were interesting, not even Arthur Curry/Aquaman. His character was just written so terribly. At first he's down to Earth and serious, then halfway through the movie he starts acting like a dumb kid and cracking childish jokes. I don't know if there was a giant rewrite, but it was jarring to watch.There are two villains of the story, Black Manta and King Orm. Both of these villains are so forgettable and bland. The only thing that's unique between the two is Black Manta's armor. The antagonists are by far the worst part about Aquaman. The plot is generic, too. It doesn't do anything thought provoking, it's just a cliche superhero story.The only good part about the movie is the action and cinematography. The film is entertaining for the most part. It's a decent watch, but it's incredibly generic. I just hope that the sequel learns from the first and improves the screenplay.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The underwater world looks fantastic and especially the animals like sharks are lovely. The quest that leads the main character and his female sidekick across the planet includes stunning locations like Sicily and Morocco that offer a welcome change from the seas. The settings are carefully chosen and cleverly mixed with computer animations. Director James Wan filmed everything calmly, extravagantly and precisely. Even the dramatic action scenes like the breathtaking escape sequence in Sicily avoid shaky cameras and exaggerated special effects which makes the film enjoyable to watch from start to finish. The final duel between the courageous half-breed protagonist and his sinister half-brother is visually spectacular and emotionally engaging.You will get exactly what you expect from this movie: shallow but gripping entertainment for the whole family with a big budget. It's pleasant while it lasts but also quickly forgotten because of predictable tropes, an overall tiresome story and mostly average acting performances. Up next, let's create another exchangeable superhero movie called Airwoman, Earthtransgender or Firetiger.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Generally speaking, a movie with a visual special effects theme can always make me look forward to it, such as Frozen, How to Train your Dragon, the ice and sky from the beginning to the end, how to do it in the same material but with a colorful change?It is a test of the skill of the production team.
One of the scenes that I felt particularly stunning was that the male and female protagonists encountered many monsters in the trench kingdom. When they jumped out of the sea and broke through the monsters, the feeling from a cross-sectional perspective was really wonderful! The people who are intensively phobia will surely feel Uncomfortable and pleasant. Anyway, this scene is the main reason why I admire the visual effect of this movie.
In addition, the female characters in this movie are very cute. Whether it is the mother of the main actor or the main actress afterwards, their interaction with the human world is really innocent and cute. You can see that they really can't hate humans, which is why there may be a way to make the land and the sea people live in peace.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Aquaman falls into a second place, it is mainly a decent film with several flaws. I can't get over the fact of how dreadful the CGI is. I mean, I can understand that in the DCU's first movie they may not get it right, but after several releases and millions of viewers complaining about that same aspect, why wouldn't they try to improve it? Aquaman fails to deliver a believable proportion of action and visual effects, in terms of how realistically they should go together. Black Manta was such a weak rival, poorly acted, unlike the rest of the cast whom I thought did a pretty good job. Jason Momoa is fantastic as the titular character; Amber Heard and WIlliam Dafoe properly delivered Mera and Vulko; Nicole Kidman was fairly good in her portrayal of Atlanna; and Patrick Wilson did a phenomenal task in giving life to King Orm. Some visuals were cool, some of the music was not (Pitbull); the scene in Italy was fantastic, I had a blast watching that.I am almost certain that if the CGI had been great, it would have changed my vision regarding the picture as a whole, but to me it was entertaining nonetheless. The cast is what does it for me, the story could have been a lot better, or it could have been executed in a more non-generic fashion. I have to give it to Jason Momoa, from the moment he was cast we all knew he had a difficult task in playing a superhero that has been a laughing stock for decades, and yet he made Aquaman cool for nearly everyone! Although, the Arthur Curry from the DC Animated Universe is badass as well. Decent effort from DCEU, but I expect much more, as I'm sure many other fans do too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not amazing not horrible. I really want DC to get back on its feet and I was hoping Aquaman would get it there... but honestly I still feel like the franchise is in limbo. The move IS visually stunning. The colors are incredibly saturated,the camera work was really nice, the CGI was well done. However the writing was often cliched and cheesy; jokes fell flat for me(which happens in most movies) there was no money left in the budget for amber heard's wig and last but most importantly it had a horrible score. My god. They had a cover of Africa (by Toto) sung by Pitbull... why. The score wasn't background it was heavy handed and brought me out of the movie often. Very similar to the newest fast and furious movies (obviously) the score works at making moments feel badass and fails at every other emotion. All this aside the movie is simple, don't go on there expecting anything particularly poignant. If you don't think too hard you can just enjoy it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The superhero with the odds-on worst reputation of all has been redeemed by a talented leading man and a sound director. James Wan's work with this script managed to blend high action, character development, and tremendous visuals, with a smattering of utter ridiculousness for good measure.Jason Momoa is the star, but Amber Heard cannot be overlooked, as her character is the one that drives the plot, and not as the love interest. Wan did his homework, and ensured that Mera was more than eye candy or a damsel in distress. She is a butt-kicker, and more intuitive than Arthur is for most of the movie.Arthur is done consistently with what we got of him in Justice League, but fleshed out more, and Momoa is up to the challenge of doing more with a guy who to this point had been a hard drinking nobody who could fire off the occasional wisecrack. The backstory he is given is less tragic than many other superheroes tend to get, complete with one guaranteed living parent. Kind of an odd fact in this genre.Patrick Wilson is definitely committed as the would-be Ocean Master, and brings a hammy gravitas to the role, as though he understands how ridiculous he is and plays it up at every opportunity. This should make him cheesy, but instead it makes him more distasteful, adding to the strength of the performance.Black Manta is another good choice, and his part in the film is helpful at moving the plot along, and bringing more action. His anger, and unfettered rage for revenge makes him a good, gritty villain to counterbalance the others.The action is fantastic, and the scale on which it is done in many scenes is great. But at no point do you lose track of Arthur or Mera as they get through it all.Like Wonder Woman, this is an example of what the DCEU can be when it is given to directors and writers who are of quality, and there's less Zack Snyder.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

We can see the film has a mega-budget, but at the same time, unlike many of the Marvel Universe films, it just doesn't look real, even during the rare times in the film where the action is on land and not in the sea. You always have the very real sense that what you are watching, was primarily played out against a green screen.The cast do their very best, whilst being saddled with some uninspiring dialogue, especially many of the Atlantean characters who just sound unintentionally (I'm sure) pompous. Jason Momoa is fine as the title character and Amber Heard is appealing as Princess Mera, his developing undersea love interest. But I would have dearly loved to have seen their characters, as well as those of Nicole Kidman and Temuera Morrison for instance play out a few more scenes on dry land.The best I can say about the production is that it is imaginative and very creatively put together in a cross-generic fashion. But herein lies one of the major problems with the movie ... its weirded out storyline. Much of this so called origin tale, seems to be an excuse to create a hybrid of styles, which I personally had great difficulty in subscribing too. The whole idea of 7 civilisations living under the sea, with advanced technology and amongst mutant species of fish and the like, which land-based society has no idea about is just bizarre (to be kind).Imagine a mix of Star Wars, with The Abyss and Clash of the Titans. Yes, Star Wars; at the bottom of the sea. If you think that'll rock your boat, you'll probably love Aquaman. Me? Much as I like a good super hero film, Aquaman just doesn't fit the bill. I'll take The Avengers before this sort of cartoonish stuff any day. The action is better choreographed, the villains more serious, the dialogue is far more consistently funny and things do seemingly appear to be occurring in the real world.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As I watched this in 2019, this is definately the highlight of my year so far.Beginning:
The story was amazing especially with beginning as both Nicole Kidman and Temuera Morrison completely dive into the role and put in there all as you can feel the love and connection they have in such a limited amount of screen time. Because of this they did great with what time they had to make it believable on screen. Nicole Kidman completey kicked ass in this movie and honestly didn't expect any of the amazing fight chreography from her and was really impressed and overwhelmed.The Story:
The story was really good with some amazing writing and some unique and imaginative world building especially for when we are entering the city of Atlantis and seeing the amazing under sea world. It really reminded me of avatar with the overall designs.I really enjoyed the feud and rivalry both Arthur and King Norm have for one of another but I wished that there was some brotherly love like we have with our marvel characters Loki and Thor but for reasons that are brought up I can see why James Wan didn't go in that direction. I think that Patrick Wilson didn't a phenominal job as King Norm. I didn't realise it was him from the trailers so seeing that he finally got a big role since watchmen as Owl man for me is awesome.Third Act:
The third act is the most insane thing we've had for a battle since man of steel in the DCEU in my opinion as it was a chaotic, suspenseful and visually stunning. The kiss both Mera and Arthur had in the third act was kind of a ""YEAH FINALLY"" moment as you can feel they have feelings for one another throughout the film and even in Justice League so for them to drag it out and then do that was a cool moment. Amber Heard did a phenominal job as mera and really felt like a 3 dimensions character instead of an actress doing a role. Everyone did awesomeOverall:
The film was visually stunning and the entire cast did a phenominal job. How James Wan and the design team made aquamans iconic yellow and green suit look great in a live action film I'll never understand. Perfect Story, perfect cast, perfect visuals, perfect writing and perfect direction.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I have no idea why the beautiful princess would treat him differently from the beginning? Probably every hero has a hallo, and only heroine can see.

Instead of the dull, dingy worlds of films like Batman Vs Superman or Suicide Squad, Aquaman provides a sequence of visually stunning settings with colour palettes that help to set the scene. Gone is the failed attempts to make the series dark and gritty, instead here's a film that accepts that the audience of a modern superhero film is there for an exciting and light-hearted action film, then proceeds to hit the mark. It even subtly acknowledges the common criticism of the DCEU that they're just copying Marvel with a couple of visual jokes!

There were a few other other solid performances, but nothing anyone should be putting out there as their shining moment.Special effect blockbuster with over the top CGI. While it was indeed visually stunning in spots I think they would have been better off investing in some better writers. CGI should not take the place of a good story.Which brings me to the tired plot, lifeless dialogue, mostly 2D characters and much recycled, cliched script.Directing and pace...well this one dragged. This one would have had slow spots at 1 1/2 hours, at almost 2 1/2 hours lets just say the editors should have gotten a bit busier.I'm a comic book geek and don't claim otherwise. I would love to see DC get their act together and start putting out great movies on a regular basis, but I don't think this is one of them.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

2. There may be a CGI artist who also deserves an Oscar for making Nicole Kidman look ... not young, but younger.
3. Jason Momoa is a pretty good actor, and kept up with Patrick Wilson, Charles Beach, and Kidman. Dafoe was obviously the best, and Dolph Lungren was surprisingly good!Special effects were good, but while technically marvelous, the director seemed to have put little thought or effort into making the effects coherent or supportive of the story.And the story, well, that's the real problem. There were half-a-dozen stories crammed into this movie. Maybe a better writing team and director could have pulled it off, but this group of moviemakers wasn't up to the challenge. The audience was silent most of the movie. I was the only one who laughed at any of the jokes, and I laugh at anything. Well, there was one funny joke, but I won't spoil it.Basically, it was pretty lame for 85% of the time, and while Momoa, Kidman, and Dafoe did rally around the reunion story, I don't think anyone cared much about the rest of the plot. Maybe they can pull off a Justice League movie if they hire Joss Whedon or one of the good Marvel directors.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I mean come on DC it really is time for you guys to up the ante and become serious contenders to MCU. So far MCU is way ahead of DC.

Some subtle jokes were okay, but the blatant ones, trying to be a funny action hero blockbuster flick just didn't work and detracted from the experience. Just don't and stick to the epic story.3. Cringe music choices. Like a remix of Toto's ""Africa"" when entering the desert. It's so disruptive to the rest of the experience and uncalled for.So I wanted to give this a 7 or even consider an 8.

It is definitely a blockbuster film aimed at getting us to the theater!This is not a film to watch because the acting is good or the plot is great or because you are a serious film buff. This is the type of film you go to see when you just want pure entertainment with lots of special effects and visuals. Aquaman was not so great, in my opinion, as a comic.The film's first scenes made me gag a bit at the over abundance of makeup on the actors to make them look younger. They almost looked like dolls and the acting was quite dull. It gets better once you are past that.But again, it's a blockbuster film aimed to satisfy your eyes with big colorful visuals on a big screen. I gave it a decent rating because it was just what I expected when I went to see it.

The action sequences were also above average (this is coming from me, a person who think almost every fight scene in Hollywood movie sucks 'cause I compared them to Jackie Chan and Jet Li movies in the 90's). The acting was good in MY opinion, but I'll get to what overshadowed the acting in the Cons section. The storyline was decent, they at least TRIED to make it relevant and that the foe had a purpose, compared to Steppenwolf in the previous movie that we should no longer speak of.Cons: The amount of cheesiness in this movie almost killed me. I mean this is pretty close to the first superman movie where I just laughed for the entirety of the movie. Given how good some of these actors were, I truly felt bad that they had to deliver some of these lines, and I honestly don't understand how they could've delivered these lines on set without bursting into crying laughter. The second con is the story. Yes it was better than justice league, but that's not saying much. Yes they gave the villains a purpose to do what they did, but they didn't explore the characters or even try to make them more unique. Too many dramatic scenes with explosions out of nowhere and people walking out of the water slowly. This is not Bay Watch or 007.Overall: I didn't go into the movie with high expectations, and I came out not surprised in any way. I am happy with the visuals and actions in this movie, but I suggest the writers put more time in making the dialogues better in the future DC movies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Aquaman has provided one of the most fun movie going experience I have had in a while.If you read my 2018 retrospective you will know that this film reminded me of many other films, that is one of the things that fascinates me so much about this Aquaman. Really this should feel kind of fresh and new given the director's previous work and the less serious tone within the DC movie universe but so many scenes feel ripped from other movies.The special effects are absolutely incredible throughout the movie, the attention to detail with the underwater world makes watching this on the big screen feel rewarding, every action sequence in the kingdom of Atlantis feels like the exact opposite to the one on Wakanda during Black Panther. In that movie often the special effects and action choreography felt like an after thought so that the movie could focus on other things while in Aquaman they are given the time they deserve to leave an impact. Having said that the other moments in the film are also polar opposite to Black Panther, where in that movie slow dialogue heavy moments felt like they had real weight here they are usually laughable (and not when they mean to be).James Wan is a great director and their is no denying that. He has had an impact on the horror genre with greats such as Saw, The Conjuring and Insidious and his mark will felt on that genre for years. But in recently his foray into the action genre has had interesting results. There is no doubt that Furious 7 was more than a little goofy but with Aquaman Wan has outdone himself. None of the character arcs are memorable or interesting, the two leads have no chemistry, there is no real villain of the movie but there are two side villains and about an hour into the film I lost track of the plot and started laughing uncontrollably for way to long.I am seriously finding it difficult to put into words how bizarre this movie is because on paper it sounds almost par for the course with comic book movies but really this is so much more than that.I have to recommend checking this film out but as I said earlier I don't recommend it as a good movie, just a fun one. Like a lot of people I hope that Wan will return to his horror roots soon and stop dragging Patrick Wilson into strange action films, they both deserve better than Aquaman.Also they play the Pitbull's version of Toto's Africa in this movie right when Saw co-creator Leigh Whannell makes a cameo. That might be my favourite moment of 2018 cinema.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Starting from the story,action,cast/acting and visually it's just so freaking awesome my god! u just need to WATCH IT!
Another big plus point for Aquaman is that story didn't suck at all & it was really addicting and little to none plot holes.Everything folds pretty smoothly with Aquman origin,Childhood and recent event is just a real treat to watch. Especially the theatrical experience of this movie is just so AWESOME with amazing sound effect, crowd reaction and if u are a big Thor Ragnarok fan than u must watch Aquaman!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I've been putting it off constantly and it's really annoyed him lolThe reason I put it off is because I'm really really not a fan of DC.
I very rarely watch them anymore because over the years I just can't get along with them at all. Batman, Superman, even Green Lantern which wasn't all that bad.
I'm definitely a Marvel guy.However. After watching this I felt really pleased! Don't get me wrong it's not the best film in the world but it was so enjoyable.The story wasn't too bad, the cast were impressive and the graphics were brilliant.
The action sequences were also fantastic and the little elements of comedy were just right.I can't really think of anything genuinely negative to say about it. It does what it says on the tin, if you know what I mean.Overall I generally judge films on whether I'd watch them again and I would definitely watch this again in a heartbeat.
I recommend that anyone who is in two minds about watching this simply because it's DC to reconsider.
It's well worth a watch!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

DC had a hard job to make a good film out of a not so respected horoe (Speaking for myself, I didn't know much of aquaman, just the basics that everybody knows) and it worked very well.
The cast is really good, There wouldn't be any other main actor as good as Jason to play the role and James Wan managed to make one of the best super heroe movies of the year for me, only behind avengers.

I hope so...because that's really the only explanation I can understand. Who would give this a 10?The movie isn't bad. You'll be entertained if your expectations aren't too high. But there's some bad acting and really cringe worthy lines. Some of the plot doesn't make sense, and the parts that do are 100% predictable.Ordinarily I would give this movie a 6 or even a 5, but there are two redeeming graces that make it stand out.First, the visuals. Yes, about 80% of what you seen on screen is CGI, but it blends very well and does not look out of place. If you don't notice it, who cares?In the age of Marvel, Star Wars, and other spectacles, it's not easy to impress me with visuals alone. What really pushes this one over the edge is the art direction. It's creative, beautiful, and sometimes frightening.The second redeeming aspect of this movie is a very heart warming love story. It's not even close to the focus of the movie. A second love story gets much more time, and falls completely flat.But the first love story is a surprising spot of tenderness in a blow um ups blockbuster.This movie is a solid 7. The people giving it 10s are raising your expectations way too high. If you believe them now, you'll probably be very disappointed when you see it.Don't expect too much and you'll enjoy yourself.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

With the mentorship of Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the revelations of Mera (Amber Heard) he discovers that he is the half-breed heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.""Aquaman"" (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It's reminiscent of ""Thor"" (2011) and ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make ""Aquaman"" 'thrilling,' but less compelling story-wise.Still, it's very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur's mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public's generally weak perception of Aquaman.The film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).GRADE: B/B-","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I just don't understand how DC just can't quite capture the lightning and write a good story. A bad guy who wants to take over the world is just not enough anymore - DC is stuck in 1997 as far as their writing is concerned.But the biggest disappointment is the dude himself. It feels like the writers were like ""ehhh just make something up"" and he ad-libbed half of his dialogue...and it was goofy even in context. I realized...Jason Momoa seems like a great person and I like him, but dude is a mediocre actor.It's a silly movie that doesn't decide whether it's campy ridiculous or serious action, and it loses the game at both.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's full of superhero movie tropes. Because it's a comic-bookey movie brought to life about one of the most over-the-top superheroes out there. And I'm sure that's exactly what the creators were trying for, which is why it gets a perfect 10.To be clear: Aquaman has been my favorite superhero since I was a teenager. When I heard about this movie, I was both excited and nervous--WB has a bit of a shaky reputation when it comes to DC movies (late '90s Batman, Green Lantern, etc.). So I don't think my worries were unfounded.From the outset, I was sucked in. Visuals are great (lots of CGI, but a lot of things happen underwater. What do you expect?), and acting is solid. Although there are some disagreements with some versions of Arthur Curry's backstory, this brings a good flavor to the canon (curry? Flavor? Pun very much intended).Takeaway points: visuals are great, story is interesting and moves along at a good pace. Editing keeps things feeling natural and acting helps characters come to life. Very high score is very deserved, even if Aquaman isn't your drink of choice.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Aquaman does not blow the man down. It's a visual spectacle and an entertaining superhero story.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4545614/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","30 December 2018","I've said before that the difference between Marvel and D.C. is that Marvel is humans becoming gods and D.C. is gods becoming humans. If there was a character from D.C. that embodies this type (at least on Earth), that would be Aquaman. Not only is he the king of Atlantis, but like a lot of people within the D.C. universe, he already has god-like powers. His story seems more classical then Superman or Batman; one in which he may have grown up amongst humans only to find that his connection to the sea makes him a king. Tell me this doesn't sound like something that fits along with Homer's Odyssey.Aquaman had already been featured in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, but he had never gotten his own movie. Come to think of it, he's a character that hasn't been seen within a live action. Given how expansive the comic books have shown Atlantis and the majority of his powers, I can't imagine how this guy would have been portrayed without computer effects. It almost seemed that the D.C. universe was doomed after the negative reception to Justice League. Let's see how things have improved in the standalone movie Aquaman.As shown through a flashback, a lighthouse keeper Thomas finds the queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (played by Nicole Kidman) washed up on shore. The two fall in love and have a child, Arthur. When Atlantis comes looking for them, Atlanna returns to the sea, leaving Thomos to care for his son. Cut to years later when Arthur (played by Jason Mamoa) has gained reputation as an ""Aquaman"" who stops pirates on the high seas. After coming home one day, he's approached by Mera (played by Amber Heard) who asks that he return to Atlantis to dethrone his stepbrother Orm (played by Patrick Wilson) who is ruthless and wants to become Ocean Master of all kingdoms. Arthur declines, but agrees to accompany her to find his mother's trident.From here, Arthur and Mera return to Atlantis, meeting with his old teacher and a confidant of Orm, Nuidis (played by William Dafoe). While getting information, their ambushed and Orm attempts to fight him, but they escape. Traveling to the Sahara and Sicily, they figure out where the trident is, but the battle rages on as Orm wants to declare war on the surface world and Arthur has to fulfill his destiny as the Aquaman to stop his brother from becoming Ocean Master.For the most part, Aquaman is the movie that Warner Brothers had needed to make in order to compete with Disney's Marvel brand. Is it a perfect comic book movie? No, but it was a lot more entertaining then I expected it to be. Director James Wan (The Conjuring, Fast 7) seems to have thrown out the brooding darkness from the previous movies and embraced the more fantasy elements of the DC universe. Aquaman is not a bad movie to do that with, given that the majority of the story is set underwater and the kingdom of Atlantis.Environment is one thing, but it's all for nothing if the characters aren't interesting. The good news is that Jason Mamoa is not only charismatic, but he's also a welcome change to the typical, all American or strong women we see. He's more like the former jock from high school whose at least nice and willing to make a friend. Mamoa not only fits in well with his position as the son of a lighthouse keeper, but has a noble pose, giving him more of a royalty ambiance then I felt with Chadwick Boseman from Black Panther.His journey is also interesting, as the goal is not only simple, but is genuinely fun. When we see him in Sicaly fighting high-tech pirates, im invested. When he's in Atlantis talking to his brother, I want to see where things so. When Arthur has to fight, I'm curious to see how the movie will incorporate the various elements of the ocean. Most of it is played out well, though if I had a problem, its that the movie is a tad too long. Without giving anything away, there's a second villain they could have cut, as the story is mainly setting him up for a sequel. Not to mention there are exposition bits of dialogue that could have been shortened.I'll give this eight Aquaman comics out of ten. It's crazy to think that while Superman and Batman were not done well, its Wonder Woman and this that are the better movies within Warner Brothers. This is likely to help those who've been dissatisfied with the previous DC movies. All I can say is that Aquaman does not blow the man down. Go check it out.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now I know full well that Aquaman was created in response to Marvel - then Timely Comics- Namor. But this Aquaman; the big, strong, kinda dumb hunk with the beard, the magical weapon and the goofball sense of humor, he's DC's Thor. And this movie, this equally goofy, fast paced, action driven blockbuster about a heroic fish out of water character (pun intended) fighting his brother for the throne; it feels a lot like the Thor franchise. For better and for worse.Like Ragnar√∂k, this whole production Is so cheerfully goofy. For instance, when Aquaman first faces his brother in a gladiatorial arena in front of cheering crowds, there's a holographic display of the fighter's stats, just like on ESPN. Later, Aquaman actually suggests peeing on something to properly hydrate it. Yes, it's that kind of movie. So naturally, the plot, such as it is, is completely predictable and exists mainly to string together the fight scenes and comic relief sequences.And these are very good. I especially enjoyed the showdown with Black Manta that featured so heavily in the trailers, while the submarine fight in which they first meet made for a refreshingly serious change of pace. The gladiator fight is a lot of fun, and the massive final battle with multiple undersea fleets shooting it out even more so, though both scenes ended a bit too soon for my taste. The comic relief meanwhile is nonstop and pretty much all good, especially when Aquaman and Mera are bickering. They're a lot like Emmett and Wyldestyle from the Lego Movie, only with stronger romantic overtones.It would be an understatement to say that Aquaman has tight pacing. With the exception of one inexplicable Semi Obligatory Lyrical Interlude, this is not a movie that believes in slow build-ups or stopping to catch its breath. Towards the end things keep speeding up more and more until everyone's rushing through every plot twist and expository speech like they've gone way over schedule and the crew is about to kick them out of their sound stage. And it's a good thing the pacing is fast, or else the numerous plot holes would be even more noticeable.Like why doesn't Atlantis send emissaries to the surface to deliver a warning before declaring war? Why did Mera sneak Aquaman into Atlantis to show him something that she could easily have taken to him? How can the instructions for finding an ancient treasure involve something that wouldn't be built for millennia to come? You don't get to ask these questions, because by the time you get to them Aquaman is punching a bunch of monsters in the face.While the plot may not be anything special, the visuals certainly are. This is an absolutely gorgeous movie. From the impressive set pieces and location shots in Sicily, to the futuristic, glowing Atlantean weapons and armor, to the massive battle sequences, every bit of this movie is a feast for the eyes. The production design is honestly Oscar worthy, which is the only that phrase can be applied to this movie.Much of the dialog could easily have come from a Saturday morning cartoon or a high school play. Sometimes that's clearly intentional, meant to establish how clueless our protagonist is. Other times it just feels like no-one bothered to review the script or read the lines aloud before shooting, and the laughs are entirely unintentional. Sometimes I wonder how the actors are able to recite their lines without cracking up. Or why they didn't write new lines on a napkin between takes. But hey, I guess that's just part of the cheesy goodness.Overall, this movie is dumb as all get out, but fun enough to mostly make up for it. Aquaman may not be Wonder Woman, much less Avengers, but it's no Dawn of Justice or Suicide Squad either. It's a step in the right direction for DC, and a pretty good popcorn flick.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The entire plot is I have to fight my brother to save the planet from going to war with a couple of little minor side tangents. It's probably much more geared toward men who enjoy a good battle and special effects because there was plenty of that. Not enough meat in the plot for me and the whole thing just seemed to drag. I literally wanted to walk out but kept hoping the ending would be worth it. The ending would have been much more worth it if it happened about an hour earlier.

After reading reviews on here claiming it to be 10/10 and the best DC film to date, I was excited to go see it even though I do not have any comic book knowledge.
The film started off interesting. A story was building to a point, and then it fell of the wagon completely.
Characters were very poorly introduced, and since I have no real knowledge of some of these characters, it was very difficult to form connections with them. The background of the characters, even of some of the main characters, is very vague and this made me lose interest early on into the film.
The storyline was very predicatable. Also, very 'unrealistic' and not well thought out. In some cases, it's not really known why characters do certain things or how they get from place to place. It's very wishy washy. Unfortunely, I grew bored very quickly. The movie did not grab my attention. The fights were average, and long winded. The writers tried to incorporate jokes and humour, but it was not very good. The imagery was confusing at times - in the end, it was just a grey blur.
I don't know man. I wanted Aquaman to be the next Wonder Woman - it had the potential! But irritating villains, villains that looked like Ant-Man and predictable plots ruined it for me. I won't even spend money on Aquaman 2 if it was ever produced.","17 out of 34 found this helpful.

It started out mind-numbingly predictable, but I thought 'well, it might still be a fun, colourful bit of disposable fluff regardless'. But then it got worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.Not one single 'character' behaved in an interesting, believable or relatable manner, and the script appeared to have been written by someone who had never actually seen a movie before but had instead been raised exclusively on World of Warcraft.And actually, the experience of the 'film' was more like one of those youtube videos watching someone else playing a video game, passively observing someone else constantly 'unlocking levels' and being fed endless new challenges (""now you gotta get the OTHER trident!"") with no reason for any of them to matter to the viewer.Every attempt at humour fell flat and seemed out of character for characters that paradoxically had no character, and every time any of the actors (and particularly the actresses) had to do anything but walk forward in a straight line, they were replaced by terrible computer game CGI animation. I was trying to figure out if ANY of the scenes were not just shot in a big green room but I could only count about four.The only positive thing I could find to say about the whole embarrassing affair is that sometimes the pretty coloured lights looked sorta nice, once in awhile. That really is it. For a $200,000,000 budget.My GOD, it's bad. Even Captain Marvel has to be better than this(!)","14 out of 27 found this helpful.

The special effects looked amazing!

It's comic accurate enough and not afraid to look weird or silly.. and it does also bring it's own updated concepts and ideas in the right places. The hero is likeable(a fleshed out version of ""Aquabro"" from Justice League is actually a damn cool guy) and has a definite arc during the movie where he grows and changes, in fact most of the characters do! The villains are believable(one is maybe a bit cliche but it's that kind of story) and have reasons for their actions besides just having cool powers/designs! Speaking of design.. the visual styles and design choices for characters, creatures and places are amazing. It's a joy to journey from one awesome looking place to another in this movie, and while it's a 2hr 23 min movie it never drags or feels long, it's a fast paced, action packed ride from start to finish. It does everything a comic book movie should with style. Definitely recommended!","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

I haven't been this captivated by a universe since the Harry Potter movies. Every single scene, whether on land or in water, is absolutely breathtaking. And don't even get me started on the sea creatures, for a second I felt like I was watching Jurassic World: Underwater. But for real do not sleep on this insanely epic movie.

I'll talk more about Jason's portrayal of Aquaman but the biggest thing Aquaman has going for it is his casting in the central role. He wills this movie past some of its worst moments. I liked the design of some of the creatures of the deep, the CGI is all over the place but there were moments in the movie that the look of Atlantis and the underwater kingdoms were pretty cool. The action set pieces also had their moments, there were some fleeting bits in the final fight that caught my attention. I also thought there were minor character turns that made the characters easier to relate to (the one that comes to mind was when Arthur and Orm were about to do battle in the Ring of Fire and Arthur mentions that all he wanted as a kid was to meet his half brother and tell him that he wasn't alone and that they could get through it together).There aren't going to be many positives for the rest of this review. The first thing that I didn't like from Aquaman was how the movie expected you to be emotionally invested in things without any setup. So much of the dialogue (much of it coming from Mera played by Amber Heard) is just an exposition dump, the movie shows you very little but insists on describing everything. Orm wants a war with the surface people because of the damage they are doing to the ocean, maybe showing us some of the problems the surface people are causing would bring the audience around to seeing things from his point of view instead of some CGI flashes? Orm's goal is to bring most of the oceanic kingdoms together but they have deep seeded grudges against the Atlanteans, could we see some of the problematic backstory that caused the clans to break apart? Why should we be invested in these things when we were just introduced to them and have no context? Seeing some of that would have been better than the whole desert sequence which had nothing interesting except more terrible one-liners. Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is just a hired gun for the enemy when you boil it down, why do we need to spend so much time with him when you could cut him out of the movie completely? Lastly, why should we care about the budding romantic relationship between Arthur (Jason Momoa) and Mera when the characters have no emotional connection when she shows up and they haven't spent more than a couple of days together? I could keep going but the movie acts like we already have a deep connection to Arthur Currie and Atlantis but minus a few moments in Justice League, this is their introduction.About halfway through Aquaman, I realized if the cast didn't include so many actors and actresses I liked, I really would have turned hard on this movie. Jason Momoa has a bunch of charisma, he's easy to like and that carries over into this movie. There are times where his enthusiasm is so infectious that I started to get distracted from how cringe-worthy his dialogue was. He can't save the movie with the terrible jokes and lines he has but he did what he could. I felt sorry for Amber Heard when I watched Aquaman. She seemed like she was one big break from hitting the big time for a while there (to reach the Jennifer Lawrence, Brie Larson or even Anne Hathaway level) and this still isn't the right vehicle. Just like Jason, she's saddled with bad dialogue and an uninteresting romantic subplot, but she gives it her all. I thought Patrick Wilson gave the most committed performance, he's a regular collaborator with James Wan and while he's far from a memorable villain, he really delivers his lines like he was reciting Shakespeare. He's the type of actor I like even when he's not in great stuff and that continues in Aquaman. Temuera Morrison was my next favourite character, the best parts of the movie are when he and Momoa are hanging out in the beginning and they really feel like they could be father and son or at minimum friends. Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren and Willem Dafoe showed up for work but just went a little over the bare minimum when it comes to the energy in their performances. The most over-the-top acting comes from Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Manta, I almost was laughing when he had his big dramatic moment early in the film. Manta is a hugely unnecessary character in this however, so I'll give him credit for doing the best job he could even if he was chewing the scenery.I'm not a DC hater I really enjoyed Wonder Woman and I enjoyed Suicide Squad despite its peaks and vallies in quality. I also like BvS, it got better with the ultimate cut but its a mixed bag of a movie. I went into Aquaman with low expectations, but the decent Rotten Tomatoes score gave me hope. I don't think this movie was as all over the place as Suicide Squad or Batman v Superman. It stayed at one level consistently, but it was consistently mediocre or bad. The likeable cast couldn't save this and while I didn't outright hate it, between the terrible dialogue, the embarrassing score (covering Africa with Pitbull? Really?) and the script elements that feel way too familiar or were covered better by better movies (think about the similarities between the arcs of Atlanna and Janet Van Dyne in Ant-Man and the Wasp), this is a disappointment and when I left the theatre with my friend and we were laughing at the movie. This is a 5/10 and I feel like I'm being generous.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Poor Julie Andrews was disgraced by voicing a faceless monster while her legacy as Mary Poppins was shrouded by the new Mary Poppins Returns which opened just days before.

The truth is imho this is the most effectively executed film of the extremely polarizing DCU, and is filled with an array of epic moments throughout, as well as a fantastic portrayal of the comic story. While it might stray away from comics in certain aspects, it thrives with its own distinct identity. The attention to detail from Wan is impeccable as usual and the visuals in this are mind blowing to say the least. The world building through the diversity of colors, environments, creature designs, costume designs, and the overall perspectives are spectacular. The CGI was heavily utilized but never looked cheap or unrefined and is some of the best work I've seen. The characters are all acted well besides Black Manta's character which I thought was a laughably bad performance though maybe it was just how his character was written. Momoa did well enough and was extremely fun to watch, but Patrick Wilson stole the show with an incredible role as King Orm and added a whole different dimension to the majestic story that I did not see coming. It's clear to see why James Wan casts him so much in his great films. I also thought Willem Dafoe did a fantastic job as Vulko and it was cool to see him once again in a comic adaptation. I did think some of the dialogue and forced comedy was hit or miss at times, and bordered on ridiculous to where i laughed in absurdity. There are some really oddly placed songs in the soundtrack that also add some laughable ridiculousness. Luckily the story thrived so much with its triumphantly heartfelt core and exciting high octane action, that some of the more cheesy parts can be overlooked. It's satisfying to see that Wan took the time, effort, and heart and broke away from tired formulas of the DCU for the most part, to procure an epic original adaptation that sets up a bright future. I just hope the Black Manta character/actor will improve, because if he will be the main villain, he will have to be more convincing and slightly better written. Overall this is a fantastic film that needs to be seen in theaters to truly savor the details and grand scapes.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It seems rhe movie makers have one goal: show how much CGI they can put in, it's somehow annoying, they'll start a fight out of nowhere and it's just too much.Also the lack of creativity is apparent, for example the star wars like costumes, the evil dude outfit that looks like antman meet predator and the scene where they slide on dirt ""cough cough prince of Persia""But nothing is more annoying in the whole film like the explosions tgat take place every time characters are talking I mean I literally screamed ""come on"" at the screen.Overall, the movie started well but just went downhill in my opinion, the acting is bad and the CGI get on your nerves after awhile, the only positive thing is that now am inspired to read more about Atlantis, sea creatures, and human bad affect on marine life.","19 out of 40 found this helpful.

You will be entertained 95% guarantee.Memorable and emotional with an intricate plot.The action? Some of the very best, rivaling any Marvel movie to date. Jason Momoa is a stud guys.Visuals and sounds? Comparable to Avatar if you have seen it (The Trench and Karathen/Trident scenes alone are worth an Oscar my goodness) The soundtrack is addictive and amazing probably my favorite in the DCU.Acting was great and fitting especially Patrick Wilson, Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe.James Wan is simply a genius. Made Black Panther and Ant-man look like B-movies in my honest opinion.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Mmm, because I didn't quit catch anything AT ALL that has logical meaning or sense of reality!The CGI was so weak if we are talking cinema, I don't think that the CGI crew have ever been to a cinema school and studied how to mix fiction with logic and make real fantasy, lively one! You are gonna imagine the green screen behind them, you are gonna feel you are standing between 4 green walls with the actors. Put that away from your mind, you get a beautiful picture.Acting and who to blame!.. The director of course, the guy has a good cast, and still he can't get them to perform well, Momoa can't even figure out his character's dimensions to get involved, so you find him changing depending on the situation, a new character each scene, not a character to follow; is he a leader to follow? The story should tell you.. story? Mmm...Story and the corruption of screen play writing in DC! Story line is broken, there isn't any actually, it's just a typical clich√©e kind of story that you can always predict its events, or atleast never get surprised with any of it because you have seen it 1000 of times before!So the plot is weak and everything you already know fron the beginning, and you are waiting for it to either happen or not, nothing new will appear after the first 15 mins! And guess what, the infamous Black Mantis, the cool guy from the trailer, could have been so easily kicked out from the movie and you wouldn't even care, him and all his scenes, but the director wanted to strech the movie!Video editing is so bad, disturbing and not meaningful, repeating some things twice as if they're legendary or something, you feel the editing, and that's why it is so bad!!!Comedy and hell those jokes were not funny! I liked the comedic ironies and actions that occured that were related to the story, but why throw jokes? What grown up superhero does this? Not even spiderman!So Aquaman's origin story is full of jokes, and I will always remember that, it's taking some of Black Panther and some of Thor: Ragnarok and that's a stupid mix!Oh yeah and one last think, people of Atlantis kneel for who ever is king, which should be the big joke but it wasn't, LOL!The movie has a beautiful image, not logical sometimes, it's a perfect popcorn-movie, and perfect for DC fans!","21 out of 45 found this helpful.

Almost couldn't find a difference between reality and CGI. James Wan is a very good also talented director with his amazing idea that make underwater is beyond our minds. Very proud with DC and Warner Bros to choose him to made this movie. Can't wait for the next surprise from DC and I know they have hidden potential with their characters and just need to find a perfect director.

For fans of DC its obviously the best DC Film since Dark Knight Rises in terms of the overall experience!In terms of fab moments it's the best one since BvS!Pros-
VFX are better than Black Panther and Ragnarok Combined! Honestly the best since Avatar and Life of Pi! If this doesn't win the Oscar for Visual Effects I don't know what will!Pacing...Wan does not treat you like a 4 year old baby...he's to the point in every scene and treats you like a mature audience!Female characters! Honestly the way Wonder Woman was stupidly shown being a badass by deflecting bullet..I mean what!..Here Wan actually gives amazing contextual scenes to Mera and Queen Atlanna...Especially showing Mera as smart and powerful in ACTUAL BAD SITUATIONS and not for the sake of it!
And Queen Atlanna as a protective and powerful Mother and Wife!Realistic Action Sequences! I mean the sensibility of the fact that Arthur jumping from a rooftop and not landing on his feet almost all the time shows that being a hero does not mean you can do it! Also there are scenes where Arthur also gets beat up and hurt as he should...REALISTICALLY SPEAKING!CINEMATOGRAPHY IS OTHER WORLDLY!CONS-
If you have to honestly nitpick anything then I would say it would be the music in some scenes and the little backstory of Black Manta and King Orm.I felt they should have been given more stuff...but since its James Wan I believe he will unfold more about them in Aquaman 2!!Finally try and watch it in IMAX 3D if possible with your friends and family its the most entertaining movie of the year!","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Three things stick to mind though:1) CGI, CGI and more CGI - I know that that's the norm for movies nowadays, but in this movie, nothing felt real. At one point I remember starting to imagine what the scene really must have looked like with green screen everywhere2) Aquaman on Steroids - In the traditional comics, Aquaman had the physique of a swimmer, not a bodybuilder. I like Jason Momoa and he certainly has charisma, but I just could not see him physically as Aquaman. Mind you, in recent Aquaman comics it seems as if the character has been physically jacked up as well3) Mera would have been better off casted by a crash test dummy - Seriously, Amber Heard is an appalling actress, her expressions are plastic, her chemistry with Jason Momoa was non existent and she makes the character of Mera as dislikeable as the actress herself.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

If you want to go and just be entertained that is all it is. I was so excited to see it and I am a huge fan of Aquaman but sadly i was dissappointed. Weak story and no development. Yes stunning CGI but they spent millions. Fantasic actors and cast but it lacked something. If I wasn't with my family I would have walked out during my many trips to the concession stand for refills.
So ignore the high ratings its not worth it. Wait and see it on Blu-Ray. Since DC has not realized the formula for great story telling like Marvel I will wait for any other films to be released for homeviewing except Wonder Woman follow ups. Seriously DC how can you expect moviegoers to support your overblown budgets when you cannot deliver a deceit movie to watch.

"8","/10","Aquamantastic! Swimming In With Lots of Visuals, Story, and Action. The Right Direction For DCEU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4515305/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","16 December 2018","In the realm of comic book and superhero movies, DC once sat atop the throne as the champion of the real life, action films about our favorite paper bound heroes. As Marvel studios fell into stride though and secured it's regime, DC has struggled to find the same quality in its work for one reason or another. Despite whatever source of struggles, DC has been limping along from film to film, only shining once with Wonder Woman last year that renewed life. Yet, coming to shore this holiday season, is another beacon of hope in the form of Jason Momoa as the champion of Atlantis Aquaman. With the coming tide of movies, can this film restore faith in the franchise , or does it fall short once more of the glory of superhero films. Robbie K here with a week advanced screening of Aquaman to give his thoughts. Let's get started:Movie: Aquaman 2018Director:
James Wan
Writers:
David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (screenplay by), Will Beall (screenplay by)
Stars:
Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem DafoeLIKES:Acting: Momoa's talents as the gruff warrior continue to shine through, only this time much more in your face. It works well, brings the heart of the film in all it's wonder and glory, and really makes for an entertaining hero to watch. As the character develops, Momoa is able to go with it and it works quite well to entertain the masses, plus his abs didn't hurt as the women in my showing were swooning. His sassy partner in crime, Heard did a wonderful job stepping up into the major role, bringing sass, class, and looks that felt in tone with the movie and a great opposite to Momoa's rantings, and again the looks didn't hurt either. The rest of the cast did extraordinary as well, Dafoe's prowess as the vizier and mentor was like something out of a Shakespearean play. Nichole Kidman's performance held regality and love for the time she was in. Patrick Wilson did his job as the grandiose king, extreme in direction, but having enough salt to back up his madness.The Visuals: Leave it to Wan to come up with his own version of Atlantis and bring with it the same flair that he leaves with his other works. The studio's design of the underwater kingdom is solid, a blend of technology, magic, and biology that may seem a bit stereotypical, but captures the prowess of the mighty ancient realm. Past the city itself, the characters have a unique and fantastic design to themselves as each kingdom gets its own look to show a common origin, but still give their evolution different. Other costumes for the warriors had their own edge to it, and I personally liked Mera's costume feeling it was on point compared to her current modern-day image. And when it came to battle scenes, the effects worked quite well given Wan's flashy approach to his films. It feels like a comic book world brought to life and accomplishes the immersion into the nerd culture we love so much.
The Story: It's the classic Aquaman story that we've come to know, a greedy kingdom filled with headstrong rulers whose focus on the one approach drives their goals, while the other tries to find a way to his own identity. For the most part it works, and this Aquaman has enough features of his comic realm to appease most fans with the introduction of Black Manta, the family dynamics that are almost as warped as Game of Thrones, and the developing relationships Arthur has itself. What I liked the most was that even though it is part of a bigger universe, this film was able to tell its own story and stand alone, without relying too much on the other films that came before it. Again it's predictable and clich√©, but the tale should be enough to rope people in regardless of what arc you enjoy the most.The Action: You saw it in the films and you know this is meant to be one for the big screen before I even wrote these words. Aquaman is all about the fights and trying to imbue it with some diversity to break away from the other films. It accomplished the goal of bringing a variety of styles to the mix that feels part Fast and Furious, Part Game Of Thrones, and Part DC meeting kung Fu. Special effects lit up the theater in a thunderous display of sound editing that had the theater rumbling like an earthquake. I was drawn into most of the battles, and felt that on some of them they hit the target in the center to really have people jumping in their seats. As such, despite the nearly 2.5 hour run time, there is so much action keeping it moving you won't feel to bogged down by the time constraint.
DISLIKES:The Episodic presentation: Wan jammed a lot of things into this film, and while I appreciated the completeness, I felt the movie was a little too episodic for me at points. Transitions between clues were a little too fast for me, relationships progressing a little conveniently and quickly for my tasted to get the realistic factor. While complete overall, it lacks the polish of story that Wonder Woman held and I think it was because of the action focus of this movie (which I do like, but still do appreciate good storytelling).Action Scenes needing more depth: Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the action component as mentioned above, however, I also appreciate action scenes that are longer, more developed than what we got. Much of Wan's vision was very cut and dry 5-minute sequences that were impressive, but short lived, or sometimes more running than actual combat. While I loved a few of the battles that really captured the spirit of the combat, others felt too short lived. I agree with some fellow colleagues that there was more choreography needed, but perhaps giving a little more integration could have made these scenes shine for me.CGI Overuse: We know these movies are all about CGI making imagination come to life, but what we also know is the importance of balance and not diving too far into the realm of artificial imagery. Aquaman's visuals were a little heavier than most, like George Lucas in the prequels, the reliance on CGI made for some cheesier moments than I think intended, where some writing lapses helped amplify the artificial feeling to it. Like the end fight of Wonder Woman, the effects didn't quite add up to the picture I had in mind, and when you get to how fast they skimmed over some of the battles, it left me feeling I wanted a little more though to the battles at hand.The VERDICT:I could go on for hours about this, but let's wrap this up. Aquaman is definitely one of the better installments for this reviewer, finally getting out of the convoluted, too focused on darker themes that the DC universe went to and instead getting back to the basics of the superhero film. It is a visually packed joy ride made for the theaters, as this action-packed journey is all about showing off the technological, imagination driven ride Wan is famous for. I had fun in this movie and enjoyed the complete tale, despite how episodic the presentation felt. In addition, the action was very fun, but I wanted a little more coordination and investment to the sequences, so quality vs. quantity. Aquaman has bounced back to the superhero movie quite well, and with a little more balance, it may finally reach the intended levels they set out for long ago. Definitely worth a trip to the theater my friends, and potentially the biggest holiday bash of the bunch.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The most beautiful cgi that I have ever seen in a movie. I mean everything looks real.When you compare Zack footage of Arthur, Mera and Vulko, you will notice that it is cheap compared to the great costumes James has given us (Sorry Zack, I love you.. but your Mera looked ridiculous).The characters are strong in this one, not a single character was bad. The actors did an amazing job especially Jason Momoa, Amber Heard and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.A lazy director would cut some of the fight scenes but James is not lazy. Almoat every few minutes there is an epic scene. He also added some of the elements he used in his previous movies. The Horror element and the use of song made me feel that I am watching Fast and Furious.The score is wonderful, especially Black Manta's theme and the Kingdom of Atlantis theme...I don't usually say this, but Aquaman is the best comic book movie in 2018 and it is better than Avengers: Infinity War.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Unfortunately it is so long that it was exhausting to sit through. Everything about it is super over exaggerated it is ridiculous. It is like it was made for children or something. And it is also extremely over-produced as well. I went there hoping to get sucked into a fantasy land of the ocean and what I got was a fantastic atrocity. I was so relieved when it finally ended.

However, I put an exception on this one. Aquaman (2018) is a mind blown! Simple and powerful performance from the cast is enough to inspire tears or at least goosebumps. This is my third time watching in the theatre, and I rated this movie deserves 9 stars out of 10. The movie is deserved to get my money, and I think I will continue to support it until the 4th time. If u guys know me you guys know that I'm a movie aficionado aka cinephile and a film that has a good combination of cinematography and music will certainly make me enjoy it to the higher level.I love and enjoyed our Kuching-born underdog Director, Mr. James Wan. I've followed his work since Saw film, and his work in The Conjuring universe is exceptional, his skills in directing is well respected.Even though DCEU is a ""Second Class"" or B-List while MCU is a ""First Class"" or an A-List type of film, Wan, however, proves that it's possible to rebuild DCEU to a quality film on-par with MCU. Kudos to Mr. Wan because moving towards a right direction, after flops from Justice League (2017), BvS (2016) and Man of Steel (2013), I can guarantee that any DC fanboy will love Aquaman film, and possibly they will cry because of the mind blown cinematic experience. Aquaman (2018) is best rated film (soft reboot) after The Dark Knight (2008), a 10 year progression.I like the myth of Atlantis, the idea of an advanced, Utopian civilization is intriguing. Some people view Atlantis as fiction while others believed it's real. The mystery around it makes me think deeply there could be a technological advancement that was wiped in history - nothing is lasting forever.I'm not superheroes/comic fanboy, but Aquaman is a type of movie you'll never miss. Aquaman is one of the masterpiece from DCEU, an emotional ride, and a family drama. James Wan nailed it! Thank you, James Wan! I'm not interested to spoil it, so, Go watch it now!! üî±","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought The Conjuring films were excellent, so I went to this thinking it would be as good. I was wrong. The movie feels like it was made for DC fans only, who may have some knowledge of his back story. How exactly did Arthur become Aquaman? What's with the tattoos all over his body? Was he born with them? Did he get dragged to a tattoo parlor in a drunken stupor by his friends? How are Aquaman and the others able to breathe underwater? There seems to be no cohesive story line either, something to do with becoming king of Atlantis. Also, plenty of gratuitous explosions occurring throughout the movie, like watching a video game. The movie just seemed to consist of randomly strung together scenes, without any semblance of a story.

Nicole Kidman was a fantastic as the mother of Aquaman. (She would have made a much better Pepper Potts).
Visually the movie is best in IMAX. 2D nor 3D does justice to the special effects.Some of the fight scenes are horribly violent so obey the picture rating.Movie has scenes that reminds one of Pacific Rim, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and the game Halo!Lastly, to Raj from the Big Bang Theory - Aquaman DOES NOT suck!!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","This movie is so much better than Fresh Tomatoes and critics would lead you to believe!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4556583/?ref_=tt_urv","DreamBliss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7434844/?ref_=tt_urv","2 January 2019","For some reason Fresh Tomatoes and I believe many critics are leaving reviews of this film that lead you to believe that it is not very good. This is not true. This movie is almost as good as Wonder Woman. It stands head to shoulders in quality with Wonder Woman, the recent Batman movies, and the recent Superman movies. It is truly that good.The way James Wan (the guy behind Dead Silence and other horror movies) and crew have brought Atlantis to life is simply amazing and epic in scope. It reminds me of the depth and quality of Valerian. I felt the same way, watching this, as I did when I watched the first Iron Man movie. I enjoyed this as much as I have enjoyed Iron Man, the Batman movies and Wonder Woman.It is not perfect by any means, and both my parents thought it was slightly cheesy in parts. I did not. I was thoroughly caught up the scope of the adventure here. I enjoyed this even more than Mortal Engines, yet another gem. I am not a fan of Momoa, and Lundgren is not much better as an actor. Neither of them could act their way out of a wet paper bag. But both were at the top of their game here. Did you even recognize Dolphie in this?Sadly this movie is being railroaded in my area. They tell me it is brand new, yet they have only one 3D showing, at around 11am -12pm at Regal Cinemas and Cinetopia. Look it up for yourself. Writing this on 1-2-2019, and am in the Vancouver, WA. area. There is some sort of concerted effort between local theaters and the folks at Fresh Tomatoes to destroy this film, to sabotage it, and I have no idea why.If you have been hesitating you better go and see it in 3D for yourself right now. avoid IMAX if you can, Real 3D has the most comfortable glasses. If you are stuck with IMAX swallow the price tag and uncomfortable glasses. You will not regret it. Trust me. If you loved Wonder Woman, if you enjoyed Valerian, then you will certainly love this movie! It is backed by a number of excellent actors and actresses, and everyone is doing their best in their various roles. This movie is an absolutely stunning epic you do not want to miss.And if the theaters in your area are not providing afternoon and evening 3D showings, or even 2D showings, you need to speak up. The only way to stop them is to break the silence. Check the disparity in user reviews to the Fresh Tomato score. You will see something is fishy here, no pun intended.I wish they had let James Wan handle Justice League. That movie truly was a flop. But this one just about makes up for it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

With Aquaman, DC has finally done a great job imitating the tried and true recipe for quality Marvel films... not taking itself too seriously.Aquaman isn't supposed to be an overly dramatized superhero. He represents what Batman and Superman don't; a sense of humanity in an otherwise sideways world. With witty humor and a star who you'd be stupid to not want to grab a beer with, Aquaman hits in all the right notes.James Wan brought to life a completely new vibe for DC films. From the masterful cinematography to the outstanding use of vibrant colors to bring to life the deep sea, nothing feels recycled or over the top.If I had any drawback at all, it would be that the film kind of feels like a typical superhero movie that's hard to connect with on a personal level. It didn't do an incredible job of demanding your buy-in and emotional connectivity with the characters, and the final battle takes place in a relatively meaningless location, leaving a lot to be desired here.Overall, the film was brilliantly well done and should quickly become a standard bearer for how DC films of the future should be made!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy. But I won't be looking at it again.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The narrative was disjointed, and the costumes looked ridiculous.It was like it was aimed at the under 10s, or written by one.Jason Momoa is easy on the eye, for sure, but he lacks any of the charisma or panache that might have elevated this movie to watchable levels. Perhaps it was the script. Perhaps it was the odd story. Perhaps they relied too heavily on prior knowledge through reading the comics. There was no believability. There was no build up of tension, or chemistry between any characters.I gave up watching, which I rarely do with any film. I came in with no expectations and I still came away disappointed.

Patrick Wilson as Orm is my favorite part of this film, he really captured the character flawlessly, and his Ocean Master costume was perfect. All the costumes in this film were amazing, along with the visual effects, the world building, and of course the trident's or quindents.This film in my opinion has a great mix of heart, humor and adventure, all though admittingly some of the dialogue does make me cringe at times. Like when Arthur meets the Daroca or however it's spelled.The score was incredible all the way through, it reminded me of Tron at times, and I'm a big fan of that. The action was amazing, the final fight is one of my favorites; even through Arthur breaking Orm's trident the way he does doesn't sit as well with me as when Orm breaks Arthur's.Amber Heard as Mera is pretty good, Black Manta is very well cast, King Nerious was cool; and the plot was simple and well focused; it helps when time limits are not applied!! I'm looking at you WB.A billion dollar title well deserved, liked it so much I went and saw it twice in the cinema's.

Yeah - we get it - Ya read the legend of King Arthur and thought you'd base the whole movie around it complete with jousting, rightful king and all that goes along with it.
Jason Mamoa is actually the very best thing about this - taking on an absolutely abysmal script and somehow still making Aquaman seem cool.
Big budget special effects - so that's kinda cool - hence the two stars - but other than that - this is definitely a kid's movie. They should have employed the writers of Shrek, Toy Story or a docen other movies to write this instead. So overall, casting was an absolute joke; script (like Inception and Batman Begins) tries WAY too hard to be clever and just fails miserably (it's like watching 5 unrelated episodes of ""Aquaman The Series"" back to back.); the badly cast actors all overact their roles and are supported by some terribly poor acting - and WTF happened to Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe's faces?!?!? Did y'all think that would look good? It's like when they colorized movies and posters back in the 1980s - NO!! it does not look realistic.
Next generation of movies people - CGI'ing real actors faces to try and make them look younger......just fail.
This would be a good movie to watch at home with the kids - but save your cinema money for something better","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

Aquaman was the best part of Justice League, (which is an underrated comic book movie), and I expected this to be comparable to Wonder Woman in terms of quality. I was way off. The dialogue was SO bad. Momoa the only good lines. The writers just quit trying beyond that. Everyone else was very stale and uninteresting. Amber Heard was terrible. I thought Patrick Wilson was good in other stuff I've seen him in but he was bad in this. I can't believe Dafoe and Kidman took these parts after they read the script. This is the worst they've been in years.It was really incoherent in terms of style. It was Game of Thrones for a while. Then it becomes and Indiana Jones movie for the middle third of it. The end is a take on King Arthur set in Avatar world.

"9","/10","this puts James Wan in the same league as JJ Abrams.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4557318/?ref_=tt_urv","healingtoolbox","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45044305/?ref_=tt_urv","3 January 2019","I think this puts James Wan in the same league as JJ Abrams. Audience I saw it with clapped at the end. I tell you: We have not seen such a creative fantasy script and VFX since the last JJ film.While James and JJ both lack the strong moral compass of Spielberg, excepting this, Aquaman is as creative a fantasy script and VFX as you could hope for. I come from seeing close to every fantasy movie and superhero movie made. I first liked James Wan on the X-Files and have followed his horror films from a distance. James brings a great deal together here. He's working with well-worn tropes but manages again and again to make them seem fresh.Thor: Ragnarok is the appropriate comparison here, another crowd please, another comic book come to life successfully. Aquaman has more weight and depth than Thor:R due to its hero's journey arc.I see critics criticizing Aquaman for clashes of tone. When multiple critics say this and I do not, I always wonder how many were simply looking between the screen and checking their emails on their smart phone. I went to art school and have written 44 books where shadings of tone visually and verbally are crucial. Aquaman is a masterful blending of goofy and serious moods. Even an octopus playing multiple drums fits in.A lesser presence in one or more of the main roles could have sunk this effort. The plot point shuffling of trident fight one ending inconclusively leading to a whole middle section hero's journey to get to the second and final trident fight, is amazing effective to keep the narrative afloat. The drone rooftop chase footage is used to great effect. In a behind the scenes YouTube, James says at a superhero movie the audience should feel like they are learning something from the characters; and, that they inspire us to see our own capacity to do good in our own lives. Aquaman does 9/10 on both of these.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This aquatic adventure is a visual feast, boasting stunning cinematography and mesmerizing CGI that bring the depths of the ocean to life in a way that's nothing short of awe-inspiring.The film's strength lies in its seamless blend of heart-pounding action and a compelling narrative. Jason Momoa reprises his role as Arthur Curry/Aquaman with charismatic flair, delivering a performance that effortlessly balances the character's toughness with a newfound vulnerability.

The chemistry between the characters feels authentic, and their interactions inject humor and emotion into the storyline. The introduction of new characters and the expansion of the underwater kingdoms add layers to the already rich tapestry of the Aquaman universe.One of the film's standout features is its exceptional world-building. The Lost Kingdom introduces audiences to awe-inspiring locales and mythical creatures, expanding the DC cinematic universe in ways that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The intricate design of Atlantis and the various underwater civilizations is a testament to the filmmakers' commitment to creating a visually immersive experience.The action sequences are nothing short of epic, with dynamic underwater battles and intense confrontations that showcase the characters' superhuman abilities. The choreography and special effects work seamlessly together, creating jaw-dropping moments that will undoubtedly leave audiences in awe.While the movie excels in many areas, it does have moments where the pacing feels a bit rushed, and certain plot points could have been explored in more depth.

With its captivating visuals, strong performances, and a narrative that delves into the complexities of its characters, this movie is a must-watch for fans of superhero films and underwater epics alike.

DC Comic movies are dark and gloomy, the only exception being Wonder Woman.
Then I saw the trailers and knew DC had made the right choice in choosing the man who also directed Fast 7.
Aquaman is easily DC's best movie. In my opinion it bests Marvel's best (apart from Infinity War).
Jason Momoa totally nails it. He is not your everyday comic book hero. He is a beer drinking, fist slugging, rugged, foul mouthed protagonist who develops into something more.
The story is not that special but the way it was executed was what impressed me. The flashback scenes came in at the right times. The action scenes are just so cool and wonderful, hard hitting too!
The visuals just left me gaping. Just imagine Star Wars combined with Avatar and you get an idea of what I'm talking about.
The score was just out of this world! All the actors did a great job. The outstanding ones are Jason Momoa and Willem Dafoe.
The Russo Brothers had better think of a way to top this (Avengers Endgame) cos this movie is the pinnacle of superhero movies!
Thank you, James Wan and Jason Momoa! I am so proud of this movie! Undoubtedly one of the best superhero movies ever made!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

He's certainly not the same caliber of character he was in Justice League, and that alone should say a lot.Lowering the bar simply because it is a ""comic book movie"" doesn't sit well with me, so if this is more indicitive of what Zack Snyder wants to produce, then the DCEU is in more trouble than we ever realized.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

"4","/10","AQUAMAN is greatly confused whether to make us laugh or to makes us feel!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4514206/?ref_=tt_urv","vidhyasagarm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur72821535/?ref_=tt_urv","16 December 2018","""Call me the ocean master!"" King Orm (Patrick Wilson), the villain in James Wan's Aquaman, portentously shouts at the outset of the film's climactic scene. Warner Bros.'s latest attempt to shift its DC brand away from the dour machoism that marked (and marred) such films as Man of Steel embraces high fantasy, but for Wan and screenwriters David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall, this turns out to mostly mean having characters proclaim their silly comic book names as assertively as possible. ""I'm Black Manta!"" growls Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), the film's other supervillain. Instead of a deep, detailed world, what Wan's undersea fantasy constructs is a series of scenes, often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault, that seem to dare the viewer to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero.This defensive posture was evident in the calculated decision to cast the at once beautiful and threatening Jason Momoa as the man who talks to fish. Aquaman, whose unassuming alter ego is Arthur Curry, is introduced in the film with a fight on board a Russian submarine, a sequence in which Momoa, in close-up, practically snarls directly into the camera as he hurls pirates into bulkheads. That'll teach the audience to make fun of Aquaman.
But there's plenty more in Aquaman that will provoke unintentional laughter. It's less that the world presented here-with its fish-human hybrids, legendary kings, and coveted tridents-is inherently funny, and more that the film rushes through its story at such a breakneck pace that viewers never have a chance to settle into it, to see it as a lived-in universe. After a while, it all begins to feel arbitrary. We have little time to process the functioning of water-based laser rifles before we're introduced to fish people in brightly colored togas, or to a stone-faced Willem Defoe wearing a onesie and a top-knot.The film's origin story resembles that of mythological superheroes like Thor and Wonder Woman, in which a superpowered being awkwardly adjusts to an unfamiliar environment. (One is tempted to call Aquaman a fish-out-of-water story.) Arthur is the child of Queen Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), part of the ruling family of the fabled underwater city Atlantis, and a human man (Temuera Morrison). After his mother is forced to return to Atlantis, Arthur grows up with his father in Maine, isolated from the undersea kingdom that is his birthright, until Mera (Amber Heard) arrives on shore to convince him to return and prevent the war Orm and her father, Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), are planning against the humans on the surface. Although, and in standard hero's-journey fashion, Arthur initially refuses Mera's call for help, he's soon compelled to take up her cause after a tidal wave nearly kills his father.
A bounty of CG-heavy action scenes follow, from hand-to-hand combat in an underwater colosseum, to a chase through a Sicilian village, to a full-fledged confrontation of armies on the ocean floor. At its best, the film's underwater action, with its traveling shots that zoom through crowds of fantastical marine species and past moss-encrusted classical ruins, are vibrant, aesthetically engrossing spectacle. A few shots in particular stand out for their compositional flair, such as Mera and Arthur's climactic kiss against the chaotic backdrop of a raging undersea battle, and one which frames the couple swimming toward the bottom of the frame as a horde of Lovecraftian fish-monsters coalesce behind them and give pursuit.At its weakest moments, however, the film offers a parade of ocean-floor vistas that evoke the substanceless world-building of George Lucas's second Star Wars trilogy, a supersaturated digital landscape of smooth surfaces and expensive-looking designs. Aquaman exacerbates-almost by design-some of the worst tendencies of today's superhero movies. The weightlessness of fights rendered with CG is compounded by that of fights between people suspended in water, and the sexlessness of superhero movies is only emphasized by the perfunctory romance between two leads who seem to have been cast largely because they look good dripping wet.
The best point of comparison for Aquaman is Black Panther, another superhero movie about a king of a forgotten realm reclaiming his throne. But whereas Ryan Coogler's surprisingly affecting superhero film restored weight to both the choreography and the drama of the genre, Aquaman remains adrift, so much fantasy flotsam and jetsam floating before our eyes.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Honestly , the movie reminded me why Marvel is where it is, and why DC is the KMart version of superheroes. With every Yes-Man at DC studios that gives the thumbs up on movies like this just to rake in box office dollars is the reason why DC is slowly losing its legendary comic respect. The SFX is okay, the movie is colourful.

Add in the fact that the movie is about Aquaman, who is to many quite unpopular, and that most of the movie time is spent underwater, something that is very difficult to depict. Yet they have somehow not only pulled all of this off, they have managed to make it into arguably the best DCEU movie.The story is about Arthur (Aquaman) gaining 'King' status in the underwater Kingdom of Atlantis, and his endeavours to stop the nation wage war against land dwellers. It is packed with amazing fights, adventure and a wonderful underwater world and its creatures. There is quite a dynamic in the characters, and it is good to see that some minor characters also get their chance to shine (Without going into spoilers, there's even a scene where nobody-soldiers have a say in the outcome of a major plot decision)The area where the movie lacks is dialogue. It is sometimes quite cheesy, and it is clear that DC is trying to add a little humour to the movie. Sadly, it doesn't seem to work in this situation. In any case, it is not tooo bad.Up until now I had considered Man of Steel to be the best movie of the DCEU. But this to me is much better. That means, to me, it is a lot better than most of MCU movies as well. A very high rewatch value and recommended for everyone","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm not even 20 yet. This film is extremely cheesy and it has some horrendous acting from the teenage version of Arthur Curry and the villain(s) were a bit strange, but oh my god this movie was so damn fun. When was the last time you saw a superhero movie and saw the main character say a one liner looking directly into the camera? Or saw a villain being called (I kid you not) ""Ocean-Master"" wearing this really strange helmet? Or saw an octupus playing the drums, while a trident fight in an underwater coliseum happened? Or saw Willem Dafoe? Because I can't remember the last time I saw a superhero film come out since 2010 that was this strange and cheesy and had Willem Dafoe. It's got the DNA of the og spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire, and I'm so happy it does. While the world seems to be falling apart by the seams, I'm glad a movie like this exists: one that exists for the purpose of fun and doesn't take its crazy premise seriously. Have some fun with it people. Also did I forget to mention that Willem Dafoe is in this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Looking forward to seeing what DC has up their sleeve for aqua man, as well as other DC characters, in future films. Overall, you won't be disappointed with this film; it's worth it! Would like to also see James Wan direct more DC films and help put DCCU back on the map for entertaining super hero films.

Fist of all I am both a MARVEL and a DC fan and I support their movies as they deserve without exceptions. In my opinion, ""Aquaman"" is an awesome movie and the best of DCEU.Advantages: -Amazing CGI -Good Directing, Cinematic -Epic fight-duels and large-scale battle -Good actor's performance and preety actress -Based on Greek Mythology, representing a fantastical world right underneath usDisadvantages: -Some bad dialogues -Perhaps a bit more explanations -More character development -More realistic in some scenesI hope there is an epic sequel, which keeps all of the advantages and turns the disadvantages into more advantages and I am sure, that DC will do so. Be sure to watch this amazing movie in the cinemas. To sum up it is a worth watching movie with epic cinematography. Every frame feels like a painting worth sitting in. Must see movie. However, be as always cautious, do not have very high expectations, in order not to ruin a good-movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's not anything astounding that'll leave you amazed, but it'll keep you occupied and interested. The visuals are amazing for the most part, but when they try to combine CGI with real-life scenes the difference can be pretty jarring. The acting is great, though I don't think the movie spends much time actually looking at or developing its characters--it focuses on the story, and kind of throws simple character archetypes into it, but the story itself is great enough to cover that. The soundtrack is often amazing but there's this one tune that they kept playing whenever something Significant happened and I started getting sick of it. There was a total of 4 times that characters were chilling when they were suddenly surprised by a fiery explosion. All in all it won't be the greatest movie you've ever seen but I'd definitely recommend it if you have time.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Wonder Women was an above average action movie with casting choices working phenomenally but beyond that it fell short of the competition and personal expectations . Aquaman however, really brings many things I love about movies together well. While in my opinion Wonder Women would be a better action hero like movie than Aquaman, Aquaman does a good job job with this still but also bringing elements the other films, including Wonder Women, simply lacked. It has great and cheesy humor, brings the science fiction to the screen more than just a comic book Esq way but with an expanded hint of mythology and tech, and it takes itself less seriously while still bringing the notion that everything is on the line in a more marvel fashion. Huge fan of Jason Momoa too and thought he did a fantastic job portraying the underrated superhero and Amber Heard took my skepticism that she would just be a tacked on side kick and threw that notion pleasantly out the window too. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys superhero films and I personally was happy to pay to see it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The special effects were astonishing in this movie, the way they made you believe they were really under water and breathing! The scope of the movie was amazing and the story held your interest. I would have rated it a 10, but here comes the, BUT! The vilian and men in the submarine their acting and parts to me were flawed. For me this is where it became cheesy and none of it just didn't seem to fit. In fact I think just leaving the villian being the brother would have worked fine for the movie. The whole submarine bit in the beginnning and the making of the vilian because Aquaman left his Dad to die just didn't work or seem to fit for me. This is something that they could have done better with if they wanted it to work, it just seemed to be a side bar that doesn't fit in the scheme of things. If they had done it up better or just left this out, then for me it would have been an easy 10! Otherwise a great addition to the DC family and one I would recommend to go see if you haven't!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yet....There was nothing to imply Manta was adapt at reverse engineering advanced technology, yet he does it in 2 minutes? Because he needed to! It would have been far better to have an Atlantian weapons tech create it for him He's one of those annoying cardboard characters that they leave open his specific skills sets so they can just create an expertise for him whenever needed. Like how 100's of people in TV and Movies are fantastic world class hackers in their spare time. In this case Manta is Tony Stark when he needs to be.To me if somebody is THIS SMART, why are they a pirate? Why are they covertly working for Atlantis? How did they meet? Too many ""just because"" things. Another annoying thing...the bad guys of Atlantis clearly know EXACTLY where Arthur lives, which opens a large kettle of fish.At one point a villain will reveal he's known who was loyal to him and who wasn't the entire time. Which again brings up more questions than answers.Jason Mamoa plays Aquaman as a surfer/biker. It helps cement him as about as non royal as King Ralph. He's a fish out of water. One thing that should be amended is he's able to talk to all sorts of Marine life, not just fish.Ok so there's flaws. Then there's these 1/10 reviews. Also ridiculous. The movie is light hearted without mimicking Thor Ragnarok which got a little too silly. The acting is not going to win any awards. But I don't see Anthony Hopkins getting considerations for his Marvel work either.The visuals are stunning. The fight scenes are great! The chase scene rivals any Bond movie. Aquaman is very strong and invulnerable. But he's not Superman and this is shown very well that he's a notch below, but not too far below.This was a great effort. Not as good as WonderWoman, but not too far off.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This thing is ridiculously cheesy, over the top, with an extremely basic plot, forced romance and cliches. But I'll take that over something boring any day of the week. Just leave your brain at the door and laugh at the stupidity of it. A perfect example of this is the fact that at least 4 times in the movie someone is taking, only for it to be cut off by an explosion. It's actually hilarious how they do this again and again and again! Gotta say I did like Black Mantas character and some scenes were nice. The fight scenes were ridiculously over the top, especially the last one, but thats fine. The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and rightfully so, cause its extremely stupid. And if you wanna enjoy this movie, I suggest you don't take it seriously either. This movie is like a 3/10 but William Dafoe is in it so I'll give it a 4, plus it unintentionally made me laugh more than I'd like to admit. However the fact that this movie made more than 1 billion in the box office is exremely alarming!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Great cast, excellent directing in the way of James Wan (Brilliant work Sir). Thank you DC and all involve. Again..... Loved It.And oh the sensitive world we now live in had to spoil it with some negative reviews. I suppose we are all entitled to our own opinions, but people please let's get real. If you want to see real events and real emotions just watch the news. I am really surprised to see all the bad reviews movies like these are getting nowadays. Come on people we have enough tragedy and horror in real life. Going to the movies (or watching it at home on the big screen LCD) should be to get away from all your troubles and enjoying yourself and what better kind of movie than Aquaman. I watch movies for the thrill, excitement, big screen action, and of course a few tears here and there never hurt. So what I am saying is we need movies to be entertaining. AQUAMAN does exactly that.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

One that shocked me the most was Jason Momoa. I honestly thought I wasn't going to like him as Aquaman but I did. He had some funny lines that made me laugh and he also came across as a guy who honestly didn't want to be king. This film has a lot of underwater scenes which means that they're going to need great visual effects and they did. Every time you see Atlantis it makes you feel like you're there with those characters. It kind of reminded me of Avatar with how the visuals looked. The musical score, which was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams, helped intensify every scene. The music matched each scene perfectly. My only complaint about the music was the song ""Ocean to Ocean"" which is a hilariously bad version of ""Africa"" by Toto. I'm just thankful it only played for a few seconds in the movie. All of the action in this film is well choreographed and well shot. Every scene where people are fighting you can clearly see everything that's happening in that scene. There was not a lot of camera angle changes and when there were they were to keep somebody in focus and to show what they were doing. James Wan directs this film and he's mainly known for horror movies, and there are elements of that in here, but he makes it clear he can direct anything and make it great. The main villain Orm is a great villain and is well portrayed by Patrick Wilson but I wish they gave him more of a reason for hating the surface world. I wish they did his training scenes before they showed him as an adult. This way you would know how he got to be this comfortable with his powers. There is an end credit scene that gives a hint to a possible storyline for the possible sequel. In the end, Aquaman was a surprisingly good movie. Hopefully, DC continues with stuff like this because then maybe they will be able to challenge Marvel.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So much more than a just a superhero movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4536816/?ref_=tt_urv","Eclectic-Boogaloo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6863085/?ref_=tt_urv","26 December 2018","Aquaman is unlike anything I've ever seen on the big screen. The look and feel of Atlantis, the costume design, creature effects, are rivaled only by Avatar and the Middle Earth movies amongst recent tent poles. More than just a really good superhero movie, Aquaman is a great sci-fi/fantasy epic. It can't be stressed enough, the underwater world of Atlantis is so rich and absorbing as to merit the price of the ticket on its own (not that the dry land stuff isn't good too. It is, but it's not game changing like the underwater stuff is).And don't be worried about the underwater sequences as it pertains to the movement and talking either. It was outstanding. The action, especially the third act stuff was phenomenal (among superhero movies released in the last 3-4 years only Infinity War's was better).The only weaknesses the movie had were the handling of Arthur/Aquaman and the movie's ambition: Jason Momoa spent most of the movie playing Aquaman as Arthur, the dudebro, which got a little tiring (many of his comedic moments were spoiled in the trailers, and others fell flat). But once the third act came around and the dudebro stuff gave way to more kingly matters, Jason really came through. All the other actors were note perfect: Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, William Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Temurea Morrison, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Julie Andrews. They were all terrific.And on the ambition: just how much story there was to tell was probably the only real negative. The many side plots and changes of scenery, and the degree to which they necessitated a change of tone did make the movie feel a tad bit uneven and clunky at times, but ultimately, every single plot thread was entertaining and interwoven. The ending was fantastic, and there was really no fat to the movie. It was just a really big, decadent, swashbuckling superhero sci-fi-fantasy epic with a little Shakespearean tragedy, comedy, and a smidge of horror. So much to digest. So good.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Disney has Frozen, and it was all over the place. What could have DC done to prove that it's them who must be the most shiny and sparkling princesses of this realm? The answer is: to make The Most Epic Film Ever!Imagine putting together Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar, Black Panther, The Lord of the Rings, TRON, Blade Runner, Hunger Games, Mission Impossible, Fifth Element, G.I. Joe, King Arthur, Jurassic Park, and even Shrek to spruce things up a bit. Then crumb a ton of lesser blockbusters and blockbuster wannabes on top. Sounds terrific, ""but will it blend?"" Of course it will! With the new WarnerBro 3000, we could mill this into a uniform, fine-grained mess, with giant seahorses, roaring sharks and blaster-wielding steampunk dudes bestriding them.Some superhero films at least have the decency to pretend to have some sense about them before plunging into the abyss of brain-convulsing insanity, but not Aquaman! Aquaman wants to be a Superman x Deadpool, both unparalleledly badass and unbelievably corny. Aquaman is a champion of heavy submarine-lifting and a wizard of cheesy oneliners. Aquaman flies, Aquaman jumps, he does all but sing Italian opera under the sea - and for that omission alone I'm indeed grateful.Being a total self-belittling goofus was maybe the only point of indulgence for the Aquaman himself, so at least we don't have to try to watch this farce with serious faces (like we had to with the latest Batman and Superman movies). Maybe if I was a woman, I'd find some another redeeming point about this movie, but seriously, if you just want to watch Jason Momoa look all buff, watch that Conan film instead, you would feel much smarter while you do. Watch this, however, if you've been sitting in a dark cellar for the last fifty years, and you want to recall what colors and moving objects look like. You might even be surprised by the (not so) delicately delivered ecological message - and start reducing, reusing and recycling right away.And if you do, please go ahead and recycle this trash first. It would make a better confetti filler than it had made a screen one.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

As much as I loved Wonder Woman, the Dark Knight Trilogy, and Man of Steel, it became crystal clear that DC was more interested in making darker films for adults, while alienating the kids that make up most of the target audience for a superhero film. There were actually children asleep at Justice League! Whereas my 11-year old was on the edge of his seat through Aquaman! It's fun, upbeat, emotional, visually stunning, and worth the price of, not just your ticket, but the whole family.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It sucessfully combines action, adventure, fantasy, romance, and even horror in spectacular fashion!Director James Wan (The Conjuring; Furious 7) handles the gargantuan scale with gusto, unafraid to embrace the absolute absurdity that comes with a superhero that can talk to fish. Atlantis is a glistening metropolis of aquatic creatures, skyscrapers made of lava and coral, and technology that would feel at home in a Star Wars movie. Aquaman battles sea monsters that look like the offspring of the Xenomorph while underwater gladiators ride atop giant seahorses, laser equipped sharks, or even draconic leviathans.The movie looks HUGE and the action scenes are outstanding. They put most of the recent DC movies to shame, with perhaps only being rivaled by the unfairly maligned Man of Steel. Instead of having to rescue a city of human civilians, Aquaman has to fend for the lives of his fellow Atlanteans plus crab people, and even mermaids!If the movie was po faced and self serious, it would fall apart and result in a disaster. But James Wan luckily remembers how much fun and joy can be had in a superhero story. The visuals are bright and wondrously imaginative while the tone is pleasantly cheerful.Jason Momoa is a swaggering roguish hero that smiles at danger and cracks one-liners aplomb instead of frowning in scorn, That is Patrick Wilson's job as the villainous Ocean Master (yes you read correctly). And with a name like that, he hams it right up. Momoa has the chops to be a strong likable action lead. As Princess Mera, Amber Heard acquits herself to the action surprisingly well but unfortunately, some of her lines are wooden.Indeed, their romance is one of the weaker links of the movie. But due to the movie's earnest sincerity and the buoyant spirit, it remains digestible. Also there is a key character who is built up as a major villain (even remaining true stylistically to the comics). But then is promptly dispatched as soon as they appear. Patrick Wilson is appropriately smarmy and haughty as Aquaman's half brother King Orm (aka Ocean Master). But it feels odd he doesn't have this other antagonist at his side as a henchman in the big climax.It may sound hokey but there is a heart to the proceedings that falls back on the warm family ties between Aquaman and his parents (Morrison; Kidman). Their family dynamic clearly serving as a metaphor of biracial families. And isn't it nice to see a superhero movie where both parents are still alive?Aquaman is yet another step in the right direction for Warner Brothers' DC film franchise. It's a blast from start to finish with outrageous action and an enormous sense of fun.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So I went in with high hopes. Unfortunately I was right. Momoa doesn't look the part and doesn't have the acting ability to sell himself despite this. He is stiff and awkward.
But it is not just Momoa. Nicole Kidman, who has previously turned in decent performances, makes no effort, even stumbling over her words at times.
Tamuera Morrison does okay, but the horrible makeup and CG on him makes his parts difficult to watch.
But the director has to be the worst offender... what the hell is with the CSI styles stings? and the cringeworthy hair flip as Momoa walks through steam?
The one star is because I couldn't motivate myself to finish watching the movie.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

*******I got home and turned on my laptop specifically to write this. In one word, this movie is beautiful.Hands down, it is the best thing that happened to the DC universe since Nolan's Batman trilogy. The story is very well robust, the actors are perfectly chosen (thanks Zneyder), and the graphics magnificent.Let me start by saying I am a big geek of ancient history and mythology. Atlantis and its legends instill in me a feeling of mystery and an intrigue that always make me contemplate the fantasies of its existence. This movie simply stirs up those feelings and takes you to the lost throne, explaining its majesty, its rise, its demise and now, its renaissance.The story has a beautiful path. Every sequence is well justified and so well connected that Aquaman's universe is well established.
The chemistry between the characters also flows so naturally that nothing seems forced or unexplained.Without adding any spoilers, despite my reservation of its ""completely"" happy ending, I will end by saying that indeed, Aquaman appears to be the hero who has lifted the DCEU from its years in the abyss, the movie that holds the DC universe to its rightful place among the legends.Also, ""Everything I Need"" by Skylar Grey is truly a masterpiece. A beautiful ending to a great movie.Bravo James Wan!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

First I will point out what kept me from giving this a full-blown 10: the depth of the characters of the main characters could have dived in deeper. Next, though the action was well done and didn't hinder the flow of story, I wouldn't have mind them skipping a couple of the scenes and allow the story to be carried forward with more dialog/depth.
That said, I knew what I was getting into was going to be a full-blown action, and where that is concerned, it did not disappoint. There were no laggy, over-drawn out sequences, it was interesting visuals and effects. I am ever so grateful I did not have to watch some form of a car chase.
NOW, the good stuff, the creativity of Atlantis, was stupendously beautiful and supreme eye candy. I was ever so delighted, and my eyes feasted on the dazzling colors, coupled with architectural imagery. Bravo!
Nicole Kidman, ability to bring emotional depth, thus was perfectly paired with the fun-loving nature of Jason Momoa, and resulted with injecting a lot of heart into the film.
I really enjoyed this movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well, Aquaman delivers ten times more joy, awe-inspiring views and badass characters, with almost no political agendas. This movie is aware of what it is and it doesn't pretend to be anything else, because it really doesn't need to, which makes it DCEU's most honest film so far. Back to CGI and VFX, it's the most ambitious film since Avatar and even Gravity, as it makes possible what was believed to be impossible (and even unthinkable): an underwater epic, of which we only really had gotten a glimpse with James Cameron's The Abyss.

Literally everything that happens and is of any significance to the plot can be seen from a mile away, but it doesn't really matter. DC has had enough failures in recent years to excuse their lack of risk, at least when this avalanche of cliches works to make an enjoyable film. And I thought it's nice that in such a formulaic story they found a place for Dolph Lundgren, because how best to wrap up a cliche-fest than with a washed up action star. Moreover, if the film was a bit older, Jason Momoa would have gotten a haircut during the first 5 minutes, which would be disastrous.I haven't really said anything about the film itself - disappointed hero/heir to throne gets called to save homeland, has to face evil brother, needs magic swo..trident, has help of wise old guy and pretty girl. I feel like Willem Dafoe should be rejecting this kind of roles, not that I can blame him.I wish superhero films weren't so hell-bent on advanced civilisations / aliens having so much blind faith in hereditary absolute monarchy, but as we established, this is not the place for such moon-talk. What you might complain about in terms of messages is that the whole ""humans / land-people are destroying the oceans"" thing isn't given the gravity it deserves.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I remember being the few people who actually liked the trailer and what it was actually going for. I was with the film from the beginning. After watching it today, it felt like an adventure filled ride.Plot: Arthur Curry, the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, must step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.Story and direction: I have adored James Wan as a director for quite a long time. I even liked his film Furious 7 (maybe I will go on to say the best the series had). So, with the film I was quite positive that I would fully understand as to what Wan wants to achieve. And he totally achieves it in this film. His vision is huge and he does complete justice to it. The film is a big celebration of CGI and style. The action scenes are wonderfully choreographed and filmed on wide angles, which hugely impressed me. The creature designs and production design are impressive. Also, the comedy is just spot on. I laughed at even the smallest joke that was cracked. The emotional aspect of the film, although very small, was just great. The characterization for most of the characters were spot on. They were not perfect which is what I liked. The musical score was fabulous. The VFX was great and in 3D it just was awesome. Some things that bogged me down was the runtime. At times, it does feel that the film was dragging. Also, the first act did feel a bit rushed and I did feel that they could have built on certain aspects of that act. Orm as a villain was a bit cliched. He didn't have any such motivation for his actions.Performances: Jason Mamoa lived through the role of Arthur Curry. From the first scene onwards, he just makes you believe that he is strong. Amber Heard complements Jason's character nicely. Patrick Wilson was good with what he was given to do. William Dafoe was good as Nuis Vulko. Yahta Abdul Mateen II was bad-ass. It was god to see Dolph Ludgren. Finally, Nicole Kidman and Temeura Morrison were great as Aquaman's parents.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene with Arthur and Mera on the Sahara. That scene was very funny. The jokes were spot on. Adding to that, the scenery was just awesome.Verdict: If you enjoy big adventure and CGI filled action films, then this film is perfect for you. If not, then I would advise to stay away from the film. Yes, the film is not perfect and has some flaws, but I did have a fun time with the film. If the makers are planning a sequel they surely have excited me. The DC Extended Universe has definitely redeemed itself and I am looking forward to its future films.I am going with an 8/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has some fun action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and two likable main characters. That's about it. Aside from those positives this movie is still very flawed. It has a weak villian that feels to much like Loki from the first Thor film(you know, the movie before he became an interesting character) the romance is incredibly cliched, the plot is all over the place, some of the acting(mostly during the flashbacks) is laughably bad, and most of the creature effects really aren't anything to go crazy over. I would say that the effects are much better than all the other recent DC films, but the compitition between those two is non-existent because the effects in those movies have been awful.
Now don't get me wrong, this movie is a blast, and that's what I want from a superhero movie, but the superhero movies I love give me more than just fun, they give me great characters, great effects, and even some solid stories. Personally, I didn't feel the movie gave me any of that. But hey, that's just my opinion. I would still recommend seeing this in theaters. I definitely have problems with it, but that doesn't mean I dislike it. I had a fun time seeing it and was never bored.

Without characters and situations that engage an audience, without screenwriters who can craft meaningful dialogue, all the CGI in the universe can't save a movie. Actors that can make us believe they are the characters they portray, and directors and film editors that shape a film into a meaningful whole can make a good story into a memorable experience. Aquaman has none of those things. It has the CGI, but unless you have the critical capacity of a 10-year old, that isn't nearly enough. This isn't a movie, it's just a bunch of poorly written, badly acted set pieces that look good, but leave an audience wanting so much more.
For awhile, I thought maybe this was going for the Pacific Rim effect-laughably over the top, but no, it's just a mess of a movie, a waste of money and time. The dialogue is laughable, the story is cliched, silly and dull-witted, and the acting is about at the level of a Power Rangers episode. Save the trouble of finding out for yourself, and don't be fooled by any of these 10/10 reviews. Both of our sons (17 & 20) nearly fell asleep watching this, and my wife did. DC has a long way to go before they can equal Marvel.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The cinematography is fresh and never feels out of place and the movie is visually stunning. I also really liked the action scenes. While this is all good, the dialogue which is good in some places, is way too corny at other times. The pacing was okay, but always just a bit too long or too short. Another thing I didn't love was king Orm, he was too over the top villainy. And a mcguffin move that is used late in act 3 is only shown very briefly but we never get to know what it is or does, and that really bothers me for some reason.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Arthur learns that he is next in line, to rule the oceanic kingdom of Atlantis. Arthur must become king & be a saviour to the world.Aquaman is a fantastic movie. Director James Wan has given us an immersive world, that is an absolute treat for the eyes. What works in this film's favour is that, it is aware of its outlandish concept & embraces it wholeheartedly. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. The humour adds to the entertainment quotient of the film. The visual effects are mind-blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. Jason Momoa is spectacular as Arthur. Momoa brings that much needed swag to his role. Amber Heard is outstanding as Mera. Willem Dafoe is great as Vulko. Patrick Wilson is brilliant as King Orm. Nicole Kidman is amazing as Atlanna. Dolph Lundgren is good as King Nereus. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is superb as Manta. Temuera Morrison is awesome as Tom Curry. The supporting cast is impressive. Aquaman is a must watch not just for DCEU fans but, for superhero movie fans. Arguably, it is my favourite DCEU film.

Every time Jason Momoa delivered a line I had to resist the urge to swallow my own tongue. His portrayal of Aquaman was irreverent and immature, which I suppose was meant to provide levity, but only made his character a laughable choice for ""king.""2. The film was too artificial. While I understand a movie set in an underwater kingdom requires the use of CGI, there was still too much of it where it wasn't needed. And where CGI was needed, it was egregious and off-putting. All the scenes set in Atlantis felt like Tron under water.3. The plot was convoluted and contrived. This movie offered nothing interesting about the super hero trope, and there were far too many moving cogs that only added clutter, rather than depth.TLDR: not worth paying for. Wait until you can watch it on a long flight. It'll put you right out.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Some misplaced or unnecessary scenes (which Wan could've done better) were added just to (imho) increase the the duration of the film rather than strengthen the story, Arthur's behavior sometimes doesn't befit his counterpart in the original source (he's to much fun as a king of the planet's most powerful kingdom, he's should've been more like T'Challa instead of Thor), and the resolution is quiet (or at least a little bit) cringe worthy for a conflict between two (or more) great (underwater) nations (or kingdoms, or races).At least, what Wan has delivered us is better than anything Snyder offered (thanks to learning from past mistakes, and a godly touch from DC's lord and savior, Geoff Johns), though he and his wife still take the credit as producers. It's great to know that DC is going the right way, which makes me unable to wait for their next year's project: Shazam!","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Visually it was top notch and Jason Momoa was surprisingly decent. That said the story is atrocious! The story is so bad that when I found the Aquaman comic the film was based on I bought it to see how it compares. Let me say this if you had hope for this movie but we're let down go read the comic because it's brilliant. They tried to take the whole run on Aquaman that Geoff Johns wrote and shove it into one movie. I feel like there's to many writers on this movie. 2 people writing the screenplay and 3 writing the story seems like too many hands in the kitchen.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman and Aquaman alone could carry DC I think, but with Batman and Superman cast correctly and permanently, and Cyborg and Flash getting established well enough.... this is a team to have no rivals... with an army of potential and unveiled characters and material to boot, there can and will be NO stopping this powerhouse billing.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The visual effects were amazing. I kept thinking, oh my gosh, how much did that one shot cost? But for being a mostly CGI movie, it worked, and it made me think a live action version of The Little Mermaid may be possible after all. And the action sequences actually held my interest! What I think a lot of people will not like about this movie is that it had more of a comic book-y feeling than the others, but that's probably why I liked it! With that being said, it meant that the costumes were laughably over-the-top. I would say the weakest aspect of the movie is the acting, which is pretty sub par, especially from the 2 leads and Aquaman's teenage self (that acting was cringe-worthy!) Overall, between this film and Wonder Woman, I think DC may have a chance of catching up to Marvel!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Every diehard fan of DC or Marvel jumps on IMDB and rates it a 10, making the cumulative IMDB rating much higher than it should be, which yeilds optomism followed by incredible disappointment. I like some superhero movies, but not just because I like the universe or company that makes them. I think most of them are vastly overrated, and diehard superhero fans, Marvel and DC alike, become completely blinded by their love for a franchise. In my opinion, Aquaman was one of the worst of the recent superhero movies. The humor seemed incredibly forced and really not funny, there was no character arch, no plot development, and frankly very poor acting. There were so many cheesy lines that were supposed to be dramatic and awe inspiring that were cringeworthy, and I found myself feeling almost embarrassed for the actors involved. Yes the visuals were good, and the fight scenes were entertaining and well done, but it takes way more than just that and a DC or Marvell stamp to make a good movie. After seeing Aquaman, my patience for superhero movies is slowly fading, as it becomes obvious to me that if DC or Marvel makes a movie, no matter how bad it is, their respective fans will immediately rate it a 10. This is slowly delegitimizing good superhero movies. If you are a diehard DC fan you will probrably love Aquaman whether you see it or not; if you're a non-biased movie fan who just wants to see a good film, then you'll probrably think it's trash, and be very disappointed by the positive reviews.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

My mantra for this movie (like for many others) is: do not listen to others. Go and watch it for yourself. Only after you experienced the movie, only then you can have an informed decision about it. If I wanted to be treated to a philosophical debate about a meaning of life or culture, I would not go to a movie theater. I would read books. A movie is an 'escape' from reality, an entertainment so to speak in order to decompress. Aquaman does just that. It's pure entertainment topped with stunning visual effects. To see the underwater city is worth alone to give it a try.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie was directed by James Wan, the story was written by James Wan, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Will Beall, Geoff Johns and distributed by Warner Bros.
As the name suggests, this film tells the story of a man that has to live underwater (even though he doesn't like to) in order to fight for what he loves. Because the fight is underwater the weapon that the main character uses is a trident, this object links the movie to the Greek Mythology, as well as to the mythological creature called Kraken.
The main character (Jason Momoa) wasn't strong at the beginning, but he makes some new friends and becomes strong in no time.
Furthermore, there are astonishing effects and the costumes are very realistic.
In conclusion, Aquaman is a well worth watching movie not because there are amazing effects, nor for the characters, it is the plot that really makes it a good movie. I truly recommend this movie and if you are a fan of science fiction you should watch it.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The significance of this is that Aquaman's story gives the hero's character tremendous boost after how he was portrayed in The Justice League movie.2) The story bestows you with different characters, villains and groups of villains with just enough development time for each as required.3) When into the movie, for the most of the it, the story is nothing that you haven't seen before. But it still feels new every time, even though your anticipation might be met for many scenes in terms of the storyline.4) The final act of the movie does an unbelievable job in single-handedly lifting the already-going-great movie to new heights, in terms of cinematography, direction, visuals and much more.5) The movie doesn't hold back in showing you the amazing war visuals towards the climax, which is only comparable with that of The LOTR or Avatar. You may feel that Aquaman even surpasses those movies in this aspect.6) It is a whole new world underwater which has been meticulously created with immense diligence. Yes, this is truly something which you might not have seen before.7) Most importantly, the movie ends on a solid note followed by a lingering song from Skylar Grey, that captures the essence of the entire movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I think that this movie uprose the DC franchise. It is easely one of my favorite movies. The visuals are breathtaking. Story is such classic, and the acting is on point. Wasn't cringing at all. Personal life of Amber on a side. You can't judge a movie based on that. Like it or not, Mera is important element to the story. Watched the movie like 5 times already since it came out (and usually I don't watch movies that I watched), and regret that I didn't see it in cinema. The only DC movie I rated with 10. Can't believe there are people that are trashing it just because of Amber. Aquaman is the DC classic. Wonder Woman would be too, if they didn't trashed it with CGI and storyline. Still I think DC is at it's best here. Don't think they are gonna outdone themselves. Maybe with Aquaman 2, if they don't ruin it. Fingers crossed.

If you are an adult and enjoyed this then you may well need therapy because you obviously didn't make it past puberty.I watched with an open heart because as a little boy in the 60s one of the very first comic books I read was Aquaman. That and Hawkman who DC have given no space to at all. Then all these years later this travesty emerges. Utter drivel that is reaching for something that was not there in the comic books. He looks different, he acts different, there is this whole Atlantis thing going on. This is not Aquaman. It is just yet another derivative piece of garbage where they can roll out a 'current thing' star to flex his muscles in the avalanche of CGI laced piles of dog poo. This rubbish was so bad I didn't even keep it for posterity and for the sake of completion. You would have to do a Clockwork Orange deal on me with me tied down and my eyes artificially kept open. Yes just as in that movie I too would be convulsively vomiting. It appears that Hollywoke have finally perfected the art of insulting the intelligence of every adult in America nay the world. Is this really how you think we think Mr Producer, director, candlestick maker??This is garbage of the first order. It isn't even escapist, it is pure rubbish.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Amber Heard , Nicole kidman and Jason Mamoa were great the rest of the characters frankly boring and had no meat to eat on the barebones plot . Manta ..... c'mon there has to be a better villain accessible than him so I rue the sequel. I really disliked the overuse of cgi cartoon backgrounds enormously if the film was meNt to be a cartoon make it so not this hybrid .

I mean, at least DCEU tried to tell stories of superheros we've never heard of in their distinct way whether or not they are liked by the public, but now it seems like they just want to play safely, and cater to most of the audience ,no unexpected plot twist, no deeper messages to deliver under the appearance. Exclusive of the superhero-like characters and the mythological background, it may just look like a Fast and Furious sequel,that is, a classic popcorn movie.

I was pleasantly surprised at both the ""Earthy, human love"" elements and quick spots of humor that subtly permeated the movie - how Arthur came into being, incidents at various points of his childhood, and how he was trained as a warrior. You don't see that in many Superhero movies. Oh yeah, there was that Wonder Woman movie. I loved Arthur's reluctant hero attitude, smart mouth, and negative view toward his Mother's people. How would you feel about them if you knew what he knew?The story line was straightforward and clear, the bad guys weren't really without cause but still needed to be put down, and the movie did not drag along. Actually, the action was virtually non-stop throughout the movie. The casting was awesome. Momoa, Kidman, Heard, Dafoe, and Wilson seemed to be made for their roles - most of all Jason Momoa. Who but he could have done as well as Arthur?And the CGI/graphic portions of the movie were amazing. James Wan was able to let it all hang out here - I think partially because a lot of the movie takes place under water, we get a chance to see CGI in all it's three-dimensional glory. I remember thinking while watching that I had not seen such visually stunning scenes in a movie since Avatar - and, no, I'm not saying this movie in any way matches up with Avarar; just some of the amazing visual aspects.This is an outstanding movie.

But the story is really fast paced, it pretty feels like what will happened if we combine all Hobbits movies into one.
It follows a compacted linear storyline with multiple character origins. I felt pushed through the movie rather than lead through the plot. Dialogue seems rushed just to get to another panorama or fight scenes. Basically ""travel- talk- boom!- fight- travel- talk- boom!- fight"". There are no space between scenes or conversations to take in what happened.
Plus the treasure hunting in the movie is a bit forced, They get to a place, spend minimal time searching, and instantly found the next clue, and repeat.
In comparison to other DCEU movies, fight sequences and visuals are on par or even better, but the writing is just not that good.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Nothing.So much unnecessary development and explanation where not needed, while missing some that is needed. Dialogue is stale. The ""jokes"" were dry. Romance is forced, lacks chemistry, emotion and is cliche. If you can believe it, Amber Heard put on a better performance in the TV dramedy set in Virginia.What, if anything, is good here? CGI is above average for today's big studio standards. Objection!... Sustained. Ok, it's average.My one star is for Jason Momoa. JD's career got off lightly relative to Jason Momoa.They should have cut this movie in to two storylines. 1) finding himself and his place in the Atlantis and 2) becoming ruler of sea and uniting the kingdoms. Everything was forced in there and it showed. It was a DC film that looked like it was trying to be Marvel.If you like superhero movies I recommend watching this so you get it done and over with.

What a waste of time and money, undoubtedly the worst movie of the year.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Justice League left a bland taste in my mouth but I'm very happy to say Aqua Man is excellent!Essential it's the DC equivalent of Thor Ragnarok; the visuals are amazing with an explosion of colours on screen which were actually goosebump inducing at times and the action is the best seen in the DCEU yet! The choreography and wide camera shots mean you can track every fight scene and really see the impact of the fight. The battles are just epic in scale and destructionThe story has definitely cemented Arthur Curry's place in the DCEU, much like what was done with Diana in Wonder Woman. At times it is silly, a bit cheesy but honestly, it works in favour of the character. I couldn't see a gritty Aqua Man film working because look at the character material!8.5 / 9","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

The movie is full of Visual spectacles, you need to see this one in decent quality, every scene seems like a fight to present it as better, no matter the cost. The film has a large runtime than a usual Starter Superhero flick, and that's because of the time they take to set out Atlantis, believe me you'll enjoy it. It's beautiful and fascinating at times, and the characters are well portrayed, I've been a DC fan longer, but I enjoy Marvel just as well, so this is unbiased. A critic will try to find issues in every movie, but you'll be entertained no doubt. And just as the movie reaches about an hour and a half to 2 hours spot, where other movies would be finishing off, This one kicks it up a notch. There's a Whole Lord of the Ring-eque feel to the remaining quarter, saving the best for last I suppose. I went to watch it with high hopes, being hyped at every trailer and TV spot, and the good news is, I'm not one bit disappointed, but rather wanting for more.
Definitely worth a watch.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

However, when his half-brother Orm(Wilson, really committing to the role) threatens war on the surface world, which could kill millions of people, he has to embrace his nature. The only way for him to succeed is to work with Mera(Heard, her cynicism a cover for a sweetness and willingness to sacrifice herself), despite not getting along with each other, and neither of them having faith in him.This is entirely unashamed of itself. It is proudly and decisively going all out. I'm not going to claim that everyone who criticised it either ""don't get it"" or don't at all have a point that its tone vacillates awkwardly between different ones, such as Lord of the Rings epic and cartoony comic book. Your mileage may vary. For me, it grabbed me from frame one and I was with it all the way through. It's so infectiously in love with its world, which really is unlike anything seen recently in movies from Marvel or DC. I'm not sure of when there last was a picture like this that didn't get a lot wrong. There is a lot of mythology at play here. Thought this was about a single nation of the Sea? Wrong. There are seven. Those clips of a massive battle in the trailers? It's freaking amazing. And I would have to strongly disagree with those who say it goes on for too long. This has the best action scenes I've seen since Infinity War(no, course it doesn't top that, how could it possibly?). They are easy to follow, the camera moves to take in the scope and keep the energy up, they are varied and distinct from each other, and they take advantage of the cool concepts at play here: dozens, maybe a hundred, underwater creatures utilised for transport and attack, as well as plasma guns and other futuristic tech. Although this film doesn't top Wonder Woman in every way, it's definitely in the top two. Warner Brothers: put as much of this franchise in the hands of Patty Jenkins and James Wan, and the DCEU will thrive.There is a lot of sci-fi violence, some disturbing content, and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes superheroes. 8/10","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

Fortunately i was not suckered into see it in the cinema but now regret the money i spent on itunes, more over the 2+ hours i was wasted watching it across 3 sittings.The scripting and story is awful and probably where the wagon fell off the wheels. Unfortunately the wheels kept rolling and the movie was made. The general structure of the story is terrible and definitely not befitting an origin movie. The universe that Aquaman is set in was not explained just thrust upon the audience. The special effects and design were cliche to say the least, which is why one generally wants to see this type of movie. It descends to the depths of Power Rangers (the TV Series not the movie) with its design and special effects; Without the forgiving nature of the Power Rangers ""its so bad its good"". or at least funny.Randall Park is the best thing in the movie and I feel sorry for Jason Momoa who had to suffer through watching himself in this.I was and am super surprised of the rating this movie received - perhaps every watched it in the cinema and succumbed to the big screen and loud special effects sounds.

At the time of writing, this is probably my favourite solo superhero movie! It was so entertaining, the visuals were like nothing else you've ever seen, the story was coherent (well done DC) the action never stops yet doesn't get exhausting, the pacing is perfect, even the 'back in time' scenes slot in well and never become dull, and they are usually an annoyance of mine! Mera is a strong and awesome female character, without them having to shove feminism down your throat, Kidman, Defoe and Lungdren are superb, as os Wilson, Moama naturally and rightly steals the show ... There's not much else to add really, to pull off an underwater movie like Waan has done here is a true feat, I just hope people go and see it and haven't been put off by previous offerings from DC (even though I have personally liked them all) if you come out of this movie not having truely enjoyed it, you are either biased to a scary level or are dead inside!If you want to be picky, the 'selfie' scene joke falls flat and it gets a bit busy in the end underwater battle scene, but if any of that bothers you, you've gone in to it with a negative attitude and looking for issues!","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

It won't be wrong to say except for the Thanos saga this movie even takes the fight to MCU.
It has a scenic IMAX 3D experience. Treat to your eyes, good VFX and the icing on cake is the plot.
It has a plot, a sub plot and a sub plot.
The director has done well to bundle it together and give us a proper ending and don't keep loose ends.

It's certainly better than many of DC's dark and dreary superhero movies, a visually impressive treat for the eyes (and I'm not just talking about Amber Heard in her green skintight costume!) and, ignoring a few contrived plot details, a hugely entertaining romp.Director James Wan has created a DC movie that, for once, looks and feels like a comic-book come to life, with jaw-dropping production design and dazzling neon coloured imagery that is breathtakingly beautiful. The story is clich√©d baddies versus goodies nonsense, but I think that's the point: this is intended to be brainless fun without all the emotional intensity and gloominess that made Nolan's Batman films such a bore. It's got Willem Dafoe riding a shark, for Christ's sake - it's not meant to be taken seriously.Jason Momoa plays Arthur, son of a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman). When he grows up, Arthur is convinced by stunning redhead Atlantean Mera (Heard) to claim his rightful place as king of Atlantis in order to prevent a battle between the sea folk and the land dwellers. Unfortunately, his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is intent on war...At almost two and a half hours long, this could have easily run out of steam, but Wan keeps things moving at a lick, introducing more and more bonkers action, building to a climactic war between an army of talking crustaceans and the shark-riding Atlanteans, with Momoa joining in the fun atop a massive monster from the depths. Oh, and Nicole Kidman spends twenty years in Jurassic Park at the centre of the Earth! It's all so gloriously daft, and so stunningly rendered that I couldn't help but enjoy myself.The film does overstep the mark occasionally, with some the humour falling flat, and I struggle to believe that a) Aquaman and Mera would bring a seemingly insignificant bottle with them to Sicily, and b) the statue designed to hold the bottle is conveniently still standing intact in the same place after thousands of years, but these are minor niggles in a movie that hits more than it misses.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for scorching redhead Heard.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Wild, unpredictable, off-beat, all over the board, crazy, funny, entertaining, and you'll never really know if it's bad or good.If anything, Aquaman is a gift. If this wasn't a year with a great line-up of superhero movies, this would be the best superhero movie of the year, and not by default.It seems that every Worlds of DC movie not involving Batman or Superman (tragically) has something great about them. Not perfect, but great.Aquaman feels like everyone was just given free reign to do what they want, so they just made it the most insane concept ever. At the base of it it's the usual hero's journey, but it's one that on the surface has you jetsetting under and over the sea, Aquaman punctuated by guitar riffs, one cartoonish pirate villain who customises a suit given to him by a secret underwater race in order to stop the true king of Atlantis from taking the throne from his half brother therefore putting a stop to a war against sea and land, a sea creature voiced by Julie Andrews, and a cover of ""Africa"" by Toto.It's something saying that the soundtrack is more diverse and more fun than the work of Hans Zimmer, or Junkie XL, but it is. Whether it's a cool Aquaman theming, or the left-field choice in covers, or the neon-fuelled Atlantean City music, all the choices are out there and work, which is the lifeblood of all of this movie.Given the reigns to James Wan was the best idea. Wan, probably always more well known for this horror work at the time of writing this, also gave the world Furious 7, the first time the seventh film of a franchise is seen as second best/the best. Like that movie, Wan takes everything up multiple notches, crafting an utterly cartoonish and more accurately, utterly comic book feeling movie.The colours of this movie leap out of you just like the colours would leap off the page. We're not working with darkness and shadow, we're not dark and gritty, and the more we strive away from that in superhero cinema the better.Aquaman is fun. Plain and simple. It is utterly crazy (it seems to be the season for crazy given my last two reviews) and it embraces it so strongly. It knows just how ridiculous it is.The entire cast bring this movie alive, but goddamn does Jason Mamoa lean perfectly into his characterisation here. It's the surfer dude Aquaman you've seen before, but here it works perfectly for the tone.Clearly everyone has realised that if Aquaman was gonna have a film, he'd have the potential ridicule aimed right at him if it was attempted to be made seriously. Pop culture has filled the world with Aquaman jokes, but by the time you even get to Aquaman getting a version of his iconic costume, the laughs aren't in ridicule, it's in the ridiculous of the world and being baffled of actually liking and enjoying the movie.This film is going to be divisive. Not in a critical way, not in an offensive way, but in the admission to whether you actually had as much fun as I did with this movie.It's got its flaws. I wish there was more Black Manta, I wish the film was shorter, despite my fun and enjoyment, I wish there was more bonkers sea war stuff, I wish the 80s adventure peppered with romance sequence carried through a bit longer, I wish for all of DC to embrace this tone. It's not Marvel Imitation Syndrome, it's going in the ridiculous comic direction that's just fun and over the top and true to the larger than life superhumans of the DC Universe.It's hard not to keep coming back and saying that Aquaman is such an enjoyable and confounding-ly weird but great time at the movies. It should have failed on every level, and it's potentially not going to be a financial or critical hit, but really, this is another slice of how these movies should be. Shazam! looks to be in the same direction, so I'm down. I am legitimately excited to see what else comes in this new world of the DC Universe.And you'd think that of all things, Aquaman would be the least likely place I would have thought that.A controversial, in most eyes barely scrapes if at all,8/10 Stars.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Psssst the negative reviews are paid for by Disney Cough cough........","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Things are still rocky in terms of the DCEU, however Marvel still has competition for solo outings and Aquaman is that strong contender that was needed.James Wan takes the metaphorical throne for this one and this movie has his finger prints all over it. I am such a fan of his work. The movie's story played out so well, and the camera shots from the way the angles are used, to the panning around action scenes, when they choose to spiral around or stay steady. The CGI, I might add, is amazing. There is no mountain of mustache mayhem to be found here. The colors are so vibrant and unique but blend together to create truly magical scenery.This movie makes quick mention of Arthur's involvement in Justice League, but is barely attached to the previous batch of DC Films. We are treated to the origin of Aquaman via short flashback moments that tie in with the present day plot that give you a deep connection to our underwater hero. It's very similar to the first season of CW's Arrow, but only in the sense of two stories intertwining to support the overall story-arch. But Aquaman doesn't keep going back to the past for the entire duration of the film.This movie has action every where you look but also tells a great, impactful tale of a loner more or less needing convincing to go from rags to riches in order to save not only Atlantis, but Earth from Arthur's younger brother, King Orm who plans on uniting the kingdoms of the sea, and taking a battle to us surface dwellers for the murders and poisonings of the oceans creatures.Not a single character felt insignificant or out of place and absolutely everything that was done had tremendous purpose. Each actor brought their characters out of the water and into life where you could truly feel connection to everyone. Jason Momoa really turns the charisma on and keeps the wit and charm Aquaman showed off in Justice League and became a completely lovable leading man, and Amber Heard is right up there with him in a constant back and forth battle for leading standout of the film. Both deliver perhaps their own respective performances of their careers, and Heard fully keeps Mera as a strong willed bad ass and Momoa oozes machismo as the film continues on. I could go on for days and describe the outstanding performances of Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lungren, Willem Dafoe, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II but just trust me, and see for yourselves how great they are.I truly feel that this is a knock out of the ballpark for DC & WB. If you like giant battle scenes, swords (or in this case trident üî±) fight scenes, or just bad ass combat, this ones for you!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

When Man of Steel came out I was okay with how it turned out. Then the movies that followed in suit were a complete disaster. Wonder Woman turned out good and lifted the spirits in all of us. However, we need more than just Wonder Woman to save this franchise. Aquaman is the movie that gives the franchise a fresh new take, and the turning point that these mucky waters surely need.
Aquaman is the best DC movie in my opinion. After watching this masterpiece I can say that without a doubt that Warner Bros. is on the right track. I can only hope that they decide to make more movies like Aquaman. This is the turning point that DC needs. The tides are changing, and from the looks of it they are changing for the better.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Just too many fight scenes and a bit too animated. Clever special effects but they spoil the overall viewing enjoyment as there are too many. The actors must have put a lot of time in working with Green screens. The various army suits and creatures remind me of copycat versions of StarWars, Aliens and other movie characters etc etc. Not particularly believable for supposed underwater characters. Somewhat predictable storyline as well and not really sure what age audience this film is aimed at. Good to wait for the extra scene part way through the credits but it's obviously there to make way for Aquaman 2 ... another sequel ... boring!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Out of the movies I've seen from the series, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, and Justice League, I have not liked a single one of them. In fact, they just might be up there with the worst movies I have ever seen. However, (I can't believe I'm saying this) I really enjoyed Aquaman. Yeah. The movies starring some of the most iconic and beloved DC characters? Hated them. The movie based on arguably the stupidest DC character that is pretty much only popular because he's seen as a joke? I really liked it! It had fun action, a brisk pace that took you all over the place, a light tone that didn't take itself too seriously, enjoyable characters to go on an adventure with, and breathtakingly beautiful colours. Imagine that, a DC movie that's bright and colourful! I'm a sucker for neon and bioluminescence especially (Avatar, Tron Legacy, and Blade Runner are some of my favourite movies for that aspect alone), and this movie has a lot of that! Some of the CGI looked a little phoney at times, almost like a video game cutscene, but that just added to the charm in my opinion. Another thing I really appreciated was the fact that it was a stand-alone film with little to no connection to the other movies. There's a loose connection to Wonder Woman and a reference to Justice League, but that's it. This is the kind of movie they should've been making for the DCEU from the beginning, I'm glad that they seem to be going in this lighter, more fun direction rather than the dark, convoluted Zack Snyder stuff. I highly recommend this movie if you just want to have a good time. It's The Little Mermaid meets Indiana Jones meets Black Panther featuring battle sharks, crab people, and dinosaurs! Doesn't that sound awesome? If it does, you'll like this movie a lot, I think! I'm gonna go watch Wonder Woman and Shazam now. Maybe I do like the DCEU after all!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Aquaman is an absolute blast. Jason Momoa owns the role. Willem Dafoe is solid as always. Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lungren are great additions. There is a lull in the middle of the film, but story wise and visual wise, this movie delivers. Aquaman is my favorite superhero movie this year. I cannot wait to purchase this movie on 4K. Fingers crossed that WB has learned from their mistakes with Suicide Squad and Justice League and we'll be getting more great DC movies like Aquaman!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Finally a big screen film of ""Aquaman"", and much different from my memory of fish man as with Jason Momoa's take this superhero looks more like a heavy metal weight lifting super star! And the film is filled with plenty of action scenes and the ""CGI"" and special effects are plenty. Still aside from all of the big stuff it's a good origin story of how his parents meet and how ""Aquaman"" comes about. And it's a journey of sibling conflict and war under sea as the kingdom and water country of Atlantis is at risk and along the way Mera(Amber Heard) gives support as King Orm is a big threat to underwater peace. Thru it all Aqua's mom Atlanna(Nicole Kidman) is an underwater spirit that's still present for things to stay afloat. Overall pretty good take and work from ""D.C."" as the man of the sea finally gets movie exposure.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Jason Mamoa, wooowww of course he is beyond perfect. Amber Heard is so much improved and proved herself as part of DC heroes. This movie also remarks that James Wan could produce a very good action packed superhero movie. This is a really sexy movie with bold characters beautifully built to make us want to live in the ocean. The plots are combination with gentle romance of love, origin of superhero Aquaman, the appearance of politics under the water kingdoms, and also some real footages about global warming. In this globalization world, perhaps humankind just felt guilty about what happened in our oceans, but here the main idea is how far a population could defend the existence of their kingdom and how much the power to have peace than to do war. Peace and war is finally seen in the actions of Aquaman, as the master of ocean, King of Atlantis, and the peacemaker of Earth and the Sea. Aquaman never denied his hidden identity, but at the same time, he felt guilty as the death of his mother. On the other side, his half-brother doesn't want to approve Aquaman as his family. Family conflict then becomes international issue with the timing of global warming against the existence of the ocean kingdoms, credited by profitable scientists who argue and debate for the myth of Atlantis itself. Atlantis is protected by the Trisula and the appearance of Trisula many times. Trisula is also the symbol of Aquaman. Triangle form of Trisula is somehow a perfection, balance, and solid ground theory to do more and more to be the best and unbeatable foundation of life's aspects. To support the main story, we are being told the Aquaman insight in his ""Trisula"" stages; in child times, growing up, and being mature that all directed us to his identity to be himself, but by scarifying some of his ego in land base to be united with sea base, being defeated, then cameback, and tried to be peace maker. The beautiful editing finalization, professional special effects, cool back sounds, and soft developing characters make us believe that ocean has a more beautiful underwater kingdom, than the bad political condition above (on the Earth). All details are so real. This movie will stay for a very long time in our heart and make us want to live in the ocean.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

All around great movie. The characters, the visual imagery,, all outstanding.Momoa is the Aquaman we deserve!! Never did I imagine a world like we see in this movie. (Atlantis!!!) I read some review that talked about Momoa acting like a tattooed, bullish thug as the character in this movie. Not sure what that viewer was expecting to see,, but the last thing I saw was a thug. Momoa plays the character of Arthur Curry perfectly,, and yes, he's a bit rough around the edges,, but he's a hero of the land and sea!! The rest of the cast was great as well,, including Heard. Wilson, Lundgren, and Kidman (also Pops Curry, and the guy who played Black Manta).So, the main movie starts after the events of Justice League. Arthur Curry is doing what he has been for awhile, protecting the sea. Otb, the redheaded Atlantian Mera shows up and tells Arthur that his half-brother Orn is bringing a war to the surface/land,, and he must challenge Orn for the throne of Atlantis! From there,, action ensues!!The one complaint,, or more of an observation/question, I have is what the heck is up with the music being played in that scene where Black Manta was putting his suit together? The scene was fine,, but where'd that music come from?!? Just didn't fit imo.Anyways,, If you want to to see a fun movie, then this'll fit the bill.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And Atlantis is a fun topic!However, what made Aquaman extra enjoyable to me is that it does not fight the culture war, except for a soft jibe at polluting the oceans. I saw some Marvel movie and it was increadibly politicized and preachy. That so many Hollywood movies are preachy and political have made me stop watching Hollywood movies, by and large.Another aspect where Aquaman really really excells is that it does not divide the world into good vs evil. Instead it divides the world into factions pursuing their own self interest, with varying degrees of wisdom. The main ""baddie"" in Aquaman simply has another opinion of what is best for his faction and does his best to pursue such a course of action. But he is not demonized and he is not portrayed as dishonerable, unlike in ""normal"" hollywood movies that go out of their way to demonize and crush the faction or person that is the designated ""baddie"". This was immensely refreshing to me. I will definitively check out more movies made by the same company/director/producer/writer or whoever made this movie watchable.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I am so happy that James Wan got to direct this film, because if you've seen Furious 7 where the action sequences in that film were extremely well-shot and impressive, you won't be disappointed by the fight scenes here.
Yes, the CGI is impressive, especially towards the end of the film. But I feel that special praise should be given to the in-camera fight scenes i.e. the hand-to-hand combat sequences that involved very minimal to no CGI. This is some of the best action in the DC Universe, on par with Zack Snyder's Batman fight and Patty Jenkins' No Man Land sequence.Jason Momoa is absolutely fantastic and is a lot reserved and sincere in his performance, contrary to his real-life persona where he's always wacky and energetic and a bit crazy. But here he's fantastic. Patrick Wilson is also great as the villain, Ocean Master and he has a very thrilling and menacing presence in a lot of the film's scenes. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard were amazing as well in their performances, as well as Dolph Lundgren, for heaven's sake! He's not in it much, but he gave a surprisingly good performance. And the same can be said for Willem Dafoe who, ever since 'Spiderman' I've been a big fan of him as an actor.This feels like an epic fantasy picture and should definitely not be missed. If anything, it just goes on to show what a talented director James Wan is.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I loved it so far for me best movie after dark knight Trilogy just bit further than wonder woman but I like it more than ww that's why else both are awesome movie. DC surely has mad mistake by releasing justice league before solo movies of those individual characters. Cause so far I loved all solo movies. man of steel, wonder woman, aquaman those movies are awesome.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Casting was great. I was really terrified after hearing that Jason Mamoa & Amber Heard is going to lead $200 million dollars project. They both stole the show. Jason is really played Arthur character nicely. Director & Writers definitely knows what they're doing. They didn't do like comic book Arthur Curry's character. They have created their own version of Aquaman who is going to lead more future DCEU movies. Mera is beautiful queen and badass heroine. My man! Black Manta has definite character development to hate Aquaman. Dolph was a big surprise. Williem Dalfoe was perfectly casted as Vulko. At first time, I thought King Orm character was under utilised. But, Patrick Wilson stole the entire show while I watch this movie for the second time. I can see clearly what James and Writers did to this character. Origin of Ocean Master. Best thing about in this whole movie is love story between Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman.
Oh about music! Some moments took my breath away just like Blade Runner & Avatar. Awesome soundtrack. For the record, DCEU movies has awesome soundtracks till now! Except Suicide Squad which I don't remember.James Wan admires everything equally... Story, cringy comic stuffs, showing earth's 70% of underwater atmosphere as real as fantasy, Atlantis and other kingdoms and importantly global warming issues and embracing the real sea creatures. Only thing bugged me in this movie is that scoreboard showed just before their gladiator fight. Some critics complaining about plot shifting, pitbull song, flashback character's vfx... For me, those things never bugged me...Definitely I've enjoyed this movie more in my second round. We're in the era of Jason Bourne action style, Christopher Nolan's reality style of fantasy, Blockbuster fever for past 6 years of MCU & Star Wars movie which Aquaman did the job in it's own way. People have forgot about 80's adventure movies & 90's action movies. James Wan brought that back as epic action packed fantasy adventure movie.
Switch off your book mind & open your comic book mind.
You will sink inside this movie!
Aquaman is definitely worth watching with the whole family.
Oh I forgot to mention this!
This movie is second best IMAX visual I've seen in Big screen.P.S. my first one is M:I Fall Out","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Hopefully the DCEU bosses can remember how to replicate the feeling of this movie and how it was done in their future stand alone character films.In most movies an actor and their character tends to steal the spotlight whenever on screen and Jason Mamoa skirting the line between hero of the common man, man who would be king, and hero of all; shows his ability to be a mixture of a man who wants to help others without recognition, doesn't want or like to take himself so serious, and finally becoming the man his mom told him about in 'Atlantian fork stories.' Momoa shows the hurt he has when thinking that he was the fault of so many peoples.
Overall the characters, and use of beautiful colors and backgrounds, the interwoven mix of the past and the present to tell the story as well as the origin story of AQUAMAN help the movie to become the second strongest film of the DCEU by a very wide margin.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

People that give it 10 stars are hopeless and hapless neophytes. The first 15 min are especially cringeworthy as every ridiculous clich√©es imaginable are employed to try to get the viewers in the mood but inexorably fail to do so. The music and sound effects are particularly annoying as it made me seriously wonder if all of this was a bad joke. While I don't think Jason Momoa himself makes a bad Aquaman the rest of the cast seems to have been assembled by a random algorithms spitting out washed up stars. I remember seeing better CGI in Jurrassic Park in 1993. So many other kinds of wrong in this movie. DC comics just keeps missing the mark and it's pathetic.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Sure Jason Mamoa was a big reason for that, but this was a pure fantasy excitement ride. A few times I had to remind myself to ""relax"" while watching the almost non-stop action. IMO, forget all previous incarnations of Aquaman, Momoa nails the part. Gritty but not too much, cool but not fake cool...he's just cool period, perfect physically for the role. I mean wouldn't Aquaman be 6' 4"" and very handsome? The action and CGI of this movie are beautiful, you really get to delve into fantasy-land for 2 hours. Every character was portrayed well by each actor. There is no portrayal that I didn't like. And it has a good story line that kept me interested. Frankly, it was so entertaining I've already seen it twice and plan to see it in IMAX at least once more. Definitely a BIG screen movie as there are scenes where there is a lot going on visually.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And is VERY close to the comic book, and animated canon. (apart from Aquaman's hair.) Which like Sam Jackson Nick Fury, and Supes not have red underpants on his costume, is actually much better than the source material.Apart from that pretty much everything is on there, from Mera being able to control water, to-- to-- to-- So many things fans will so.. ""Oh thats awesome!"" ... (I dont want to give stuff away.)
Its ridiculously action packed, with insane CGI effects, funny, tender, and just goes from strength to strength.
IMO its one of THE BEST super hero movies by any studio so far.I'm not even a big fan of Kidman or Heard, and even I have to admit they were both superb in their roles.There are also hardly any expletives, either religious, or cussing. And its not gory, even though it has many... many fight scenes.Superbly directed, with incredible set pieces, costumes score, etc.Utterly brilliant.
Highly recommended to young and old.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

To begin, Aquaman may be the best visually appealing Comic book movie I have ever seen.It is already a big hit and the reasons are:
1. Wan's take on the character/direction.
2. Momoa as Aquaman. Mera(Amber) as well.
3. Visuals better than LOTR and Infinity war. It could win the most coveted oscar award.
4. Set on the premise of Star Wars/LOTR universe; a world/universe in making.The story is also good. There are a few great actors in the movie; Dafoe and Kidman are awesome. A triology is in the line(they all love number 3:)).The world wants to see more of so called B list comic characters. That's why WB is working on all the characters but Batman and Superman.Can't wait to see Aquaman 2 and 3.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had never seen the comics, cartoons or the weird GameCube game. When this movie's trailer dropped I thought it was just a random superhero on whom DC is making a movie, like Plastic Man or Karate Kid (the DC one, not the popular franchise one). And so I walked in completely blind for this movie. And I'd say this may be a beautiful adaptation of the superhero, but definitely far from perfect.Unlike most DCEU movies which always have a lot going on, Aquaman has literally nothing going on. Or so it seems, because in this movie he has to discover his legacy, find his mother, stop his brother from attacking land dwellers, save himself from Black Manta who wants to take his revenge from Aquaman for having let his father die and also manage his relationship with his father, step-father, brother and Mera. And in spite of having so much this movie has a ton of breathing content, because each of these things barely last for 10 minutes.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. The characters travel all across from the stormy lighthouse, the colourful Atlantis to the Sahara Desert and Sicily. The fight scenes are all well choreographed although they always begin with interrupting the dialogues. Depending on which character we look at, they are somewhat similar to their comic book counterparts. The sense of humour is, well, at least it's better than the 2017 Justice League.I was interested in the movie only because of its visual effects. And I got that. So I have no complaints. This movie was satisfactory, but not really great. I wouldn't mind seeing it again, it just won't be as interesting as the first time. It's pretty surprising to me that this is the highest grossing DC movie of all time, even though it literally had nothing substantial to offer. I hope they add a little more depth to the story in the sequel, because if Aquaman is really a legendary character then they have to make him look like one, and that won't come by just adding visual spectacles.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It tried to follow the narrative of Thor and Loki, but just downright failed","11 out of 28 found this helpful.

But IDC tbh.... I loved this movie. It was fun, kid friendly, and full of excellent acting and really good CGI. I had my doubt's that anyone would be able to pull off someone like Aquaman while still maintaining the masculinity you would expect from a male superhero ( yes, I know he doesn't have a tail but thats still the first thing to pop into my mind when I think of the character for obvious reasons to those that don't follow comics ) ... Not many could have pulled it off at all, but even fewer could have done it without coming off like they belonged on Bay Watch and not fighting bad guys. I honestly had my doubt's about this movie all together and admit I didn't bother seeing it when it came out. Here I am finally watching it because I am just now really catching up on cinema for the last few years as I am usually really busy and don't have much if any down time between kids, work and life in general. I would definitely watch this again at some point, as well as watch any sequels (of course there will be sequels with how the superhero genre is pushing out ish left and right) if they maintain the same actors for the characters. As it seems happened to Jared Leto's Joker... He had brought a fresh spin on the character that I really liked, anyway, I digress, back to this movie... Not much else to say, plenty of action, excellent CGI and music score, good story line, excellent acting, completely enjoyable for me. I don't see the need to go into any real detail as most have probably already seen this movie so I will leave this review at that.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was an uphill battle from there and, thanks to James Wan (Saw, Insidious), this latest entry struck the right chords like a tidal wave.Plot: Arthur Curry/Aquaman was born a child of two worlds, his father an ordinary lighthouse keeper and his mother queen of the legendary Atlantis. Now, he must rise up to realize his destiny as the bridge between land and sea. He must journey across the world with the sexy princess Mera in order to prevent his half-brother Orm aka Ocean Master from bringing together the seven undersea kingdoms in order to wage war on the surface.Like ""Wonder Woman"", this film was not bound by excessive sequel-baiting or studio intervention and instead told a complete story into itself and, boy, was the story something to behold, one of love and legacy. This film embodies everything that makes Aquaman such a grand and badass hero (he rules 2/3 of the planet after all) and added enough flair and compelling character writing to make it a phenomenal work of art. The underwater world is a splendor filled with stunning technology, fantastical creatures, wonderful colors, varied environments, and a lore worthy of this world. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams definitely left an impression, providing the right feelings in every scene. All the actors did a terrific job portraying these larger-than-life characters, especially Jason Momoa who made me cheer, laugh, and root for him in every conflict, carrying the right balance of drama and humor. And let's not forget the actions scenes, which got me excited every time fists, water, and laser blasts fly; the Black Manta fight and the climactic undersea war had me pumped. I also gotta give creds to all the little nods to classic nautical tales and ancient mythology.Amazing doesn't even cut it for this one. By the time it was over, the audience gave an applause, something I rarely see in theaters and it's well-deserved. Just like the princess of the Amazons, the king of Atlantis revitalized my faith in the DCEU. I give this aquatic superhero venture a 9 out of 10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

In this current age of overhyped superhero films this movie is a formulaic as they get. Every single occurrence from the ostentatious opening voice-over to the sun rise over dear dad's lighthouse is utterly predictable and poorly produced. I am ready for a superhero film that doesn't try to rest on the tired laurels of ""stunning"" cgi because, guess what, we've seen it all and we are at full capacity for these expensive light shows. Give us, instead, a story, some actors and a well-written screenplay. I more than understand that this movie could not have come off without some cgi but this movie relies on it and would truly be nothing without it; it exists as a 2.5 hour fireworks display with zero substance. It's got a few big names earning, hopefully, very large paychecks in order to fund their next real movie (i.e. Willem Defoe, Nicole Kidman) but overall I was embarrassed for them having to stoop to this level. In fact, I was kind of embarrassed sitting in the theatre proving I'd paid real money to see this. Now, I do have a soft spot for Jason Momoa because he was a great Khal Drogo and seems like a genuinely likable guy. I wanted to like him in this but I couldn't due to an abysmal screenplay that no actor could make sound believable. Too bad. All in all, I'd say this is a perfect movie for 10 year old boys.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Good thing is that they tried to put in comedy in the movie, which is nice but a bit stale in my liking.Overall, DC movies as always give actions that we thirst for and, as always, put a movie in a fast pace that make us put an extra effort to not lost in it.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

His backstory is a little wacky. Though there primary villian; Auqaman's estranged brother and prince of the ocean whom is trying to obtain the title ""Ocean Master"" and wants to wage waron the "" land dwellers"" was an amazing cast choice!

One moment I thought, OMG, not that famous kiss and don't let it be a love story, luckily it isn't there's a bit of liove but destroyed with action.About the story itself I can't say a thing because it's easy to catch and I would spoil a lot.

But this one was big, loud, colourful and not great (to me).Everyone is commenting on how Jason Momoa is having fun. I'd be having fun too if I was paid a couple of million $ to basically do nothing. Plus, when the film is a bad as Aqauman, what else was he going to do?Aquaman probably worked as a comic but on the big screen, no so much. The story is okay, but drowns in the ludicrousness of being, you know, underwater. The film drowns in CGI. There's lasers underwater, armour underwater, flying around underwater - you get the idea. Admittedly, what else could you do with a character as lame as Arthur Curry? At least James Wan had a go at it. He failed, but whatever. It made a billion $, so he wins and the rest of humanity pays the price.I think that it proves that CGI wins the kiddies over every time, regardless of how lame the story is, or even how lame the premise of the film is. Without the CGI, this film would still suck, it just wouldn't look as good.The acting is okay, if the acting equivalent of watching wet fish are your thing. These days in films like this, you don't really need to act. You just stand there. You may have to jump around a bit, but that's all. The 'acting' part is not really required.The story is bleached like today's coral, lifeless and cliched.The CGI is numbing, like your eyeballs getting slapped with a million tiny wet fishes.I'm sick over CGI, over-hyped comic book hero movies. Every Marvel film is the same. DC are at least different: they eschew even the semblance of story for bloated CGI.Hey, I mean, I paid to go and see it too. But the difference is that I regret it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The premise of the story (several HUGE nations of humans and various kinds of humanoids having Star Wars-like technology, hidden away at the bottom of the ocean, co-existing with present-day human civilisation without them ever having noticed) is just incredibly stupid. The whole plot is rubbish, very predictable and not even worth summarising. The aesthetics of the movie is quite similar to that of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, which some evidently like; personally I think it is too much. In addition to the premise of Atlantis being what it is, there are lots of other elements in the movie that made zero sense. For example, Aquaman and his girlfriend jump out of a flying airplane, because why not, and are unhurt when they reach the ground. Sure, they are super heroes, but this doesn't explain how their clothes survive the fall without any damage. Then in a later scene the same Aquaman is terrified of falling 5 meters from the roof of a house. Sure, makes sense. The Atlantean commandos or whatever that chase Aquaman constantly keep crashing through walls and closed doors, probably because they are as dumb as the creators of this movie and can't figure out how to open a damned door and go through it like a normal person. These are just a few examples, the whole movie is like this. You can try to suspend disbelief, but it gets tiring very fast.
To summarise, if you are a very simple person with low standards and at the intellectual level of a ten-year-old, you might want to watch this film. Also if you are a computer / console gamer who can't wait to play the newest games coming out because of the graphics. If this description fits you, you might enjoy Aquaman, it's actually a rather similar experience. For all others, stay away, it is a really, really awful film, and you will be sorry you wasted your time on it. Plus it's got Amber Heard in it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Critics should not bother to try and bring down this film cause fans of the series, or the comics will go anyways and draw their own conclusion. This is the most visibly beautiful and heart warming of the DC films. In spite the leftist, NWO, UN infused propaganda I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Gorgeous cast, and scenes. The only criticism I have, making this a 9/10, is that the lead actor can't act. However, his stature, and appearance make the fight scenes, and his inheritance believable. Definitely had a similar setting as Black Panther - with its hidden world of advanced technology, a brothers' quarrel and a feminist heroine, and with Arthur's demi god status just like Thor, this film still manages to distinguish itself from the others. The battle scenes are accentuated by their magnificent color rather than a murkey, dark blur. The fantastical world under the water and the legends of the seas themselves, make for an escape that was well worth the time.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Great execution to every detail of action scenes and surprise factor. Perfect visuals although the script is a bit cheesy for me. The 2 hour movie never felt so long I was entertained till the end and good flow of movie with the climax very well executed . Some movies don't have climax because everything is in climax and it just is overlydone and felt too much but this movie has a perfect timing .

After the underwhelming Justice League movie, the task of keeping the light on in the darkness of the DCEU falls on the most underestimated member of the roster: Aquaman. In the biggest surprise of the last couple of years, the new DC is movie is not only good, but probably the best of the new universe. All in all, I, for one, left the theatre in good spirits, a feeling that persists even a day later as I'm writing this review.Even the synopsis is more coherent than most of the other DCEU movies. When it comes to the story, Aquaman is inspired by Geoff Johns's New 52 story-arc that relaunched the character in critical and public acclaim. While they are not profound or thought provoking, the story and the script are simple, easy to follow and very engaging. It is inspired by the Arthurian quest, while also being a swashbuckling-adventure movie. The way the story goes always makes you excited for the next step in the hero's journey, because Aquaman finally manages to follow the classical mythic structure. I'm not saying moviemakers shouldn't take risks bending or modifying this structure, but most of the time we get convoluted and confusing stories like Batman V Superman. The third act of the movie and the fact that it embraces every element, be it silly or not, makes it better than Wonder Woman, for me.The cast is pretty solid and the characters receive a pretty balanced screen time. Jason Momoa's performance in JL was decent, but felt out of place. Here, Momoa shines. He unleashes all of his charisma and has fun playing a fun character. Aquaman in light-hearted and a little arrogant, coming to terms with his heritage and history. He isn't very changed after the events of JL, but he does understand the consequences of his actions. He grows on his arthurian journey and becomes a more responsible person. His relationships with those around him are also very important. Mera (Amber Heard) is his guide on the journey and the chemistry between Momoa and Heard plays a big part. I was very impressed with Amber's acting. Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is his mentor, the one that showed him the atlantean way and I was sad that his role was not as big as I hoped, but Dafoe makes the best out of his appearances. Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Arthur's mother, also does a very good job. Temuera Morrison's role as Tom Curry is small but brings an important emotional element.The movie has two villains, King Orm, Arthur half-brother, as the main one and Black Manta, as a secondary one. Patrick Wilson as King Orm does a terrific job! His character is constructed as a roman emperor: stern, noble and arrogant. Orm has a purpose and his motives are always clear, so no mumbo-jumbo villain here. He sees himself as the true leader of the Atlantean Empire and acts like it. His experience working with James Wan on both franchises, but also in horrors gives him an edge in playing a menacing, but powerful character. Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is Aquaman's main antagonist in the comics, but the story nedeed to focus on Arthur's rise and his battle with Orm, so Manta is merely introduced here. His origin story is very well done, as we find out about him and his hatred for the hero and seeing just enough of him to understand his story. He is clearly set up as a bigger villain the future Aquaman stories.Visually, Aquaman is breathtaking. The underwater world looks amazing. Blending elements of Sci-Fi and fantasy, Aquaman shows us an imaginary world that is the stuff of dreams. Yes, the movie is bonkers! You have sharks with laser guns on their backs, armored seahorses, warrior crabs and an octopus playing the drums! But it's the kind of stuff we used to imagine as kids, the kind of creations that made us daydream forever and it is amazing. It might seem silly, but Aquaman doesn't shy away from going full on comicbook style and for that, it deserves a golden starfish! The soundtrack is also very well crafted, composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams. The music fills every scene with that sense of wonder and heroism, making the whole journey an adventure for the viewer as well.Overall, Aquaman is a solid superhero movie! It knows what it wants to make us feel and never strays from the path it chose. When I left the cinema I felt good, I felt entertained and pleasantly surprised, as I was cautious, it being a DC movie. Aquaman made me feel that spirit of adventure, awe and wonder that I haven't felt since I was a kid and stayed up late to watch The Wizard of Oz or The Clash of Titans on TCM and that makes it one of the best comicbook movies. Because, in the end, as much as we want drama and profound lessons, we need superheroes and their stories to make us feel better, to take our minds away from our daily lives and our problems and transport us into a fantastical world brimming with adventures, heroes, monsters and the hope of a better world.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Each section of the film has its own fundamentally incompatible aesthetic. On their own each of the Kingdoms can be quite beautiful but there was no thought of how they fit together. More problematic, the various sections are all, by narrative, descended from a single source but don't actually look they do. (I just don't see the connection between say the Fishmen and the Kingdom of the Brine). This gives the film a very episodic feel and the tone never quite settles into a coherent film. The film is very ugly as a result.It doesn't help that the storyline is overly complicated. A bit like Black Panther the film is rooted in Hamlet and when it sticks to its royal drama structure it is compelling. Yet the film feels the need to inject the MacGruffin questline and an (rushed) origin story for Manta to pad its run time. The characters are too often going from point A to point B with no time to breath. I still am not sure what the extent of Aquaman's, and others', abilities are. No one seemed to suffer from any flaws. The story is a jumble of ideas. And when such concepts as ""ocean master!"" is part of the story it becomes laughable quite quickly.Unlike most DC films this one doesn't suffer from the brooding, humorless tone. Aquaman, the character, is at least engaging and charming. He isn't saddled with just tragic backstory to be oh so dark. Now the film is still quite bad but at least DC seems to be aware of the problems. Hopefully they will one day make a good film.But we are still waiting that day.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

While not as popular (nor, generally, as good) as their Marvel counterparts, they all do have their good points - until now.AQUAMAN is not a very good film and I could really only come up with 1 good point - Jason Momoa as Aquaman. Some are calling him ""the next Rock"" and he certainly has the physique, the screen presence and the charm to pull this off. This movie ALMOST worked because of Momoa's presence on the screen.Almost.Director James Wan (Furious 7, The Conjuring) certainly had the ""chops"" to Direct a film like this, unfortunately, I found his Direction to be choppy. What I mean by that is that this film never really settled into a good flow. It cut back and forth - both in content and in tone - to such an extent that I, the movie-goer, could never settle back into my seat and enjoy the ride. I'm sure Mr. Wan would call this movie a ""roller-coaster ride"", but if it is, it is an old, wooden, rickety roller coaster, jarring the riders as they go.As for the cast, they are ""fine"". From Patrick Wilson to Amber Heard to Willem DaFoe to Dolph Lundgren(!) to good ol' Nicole Kidman. They all do decent, professional jobs with what they are given, but what they are given is weak and disjointed.I would like to point out Yahya Abdul-Mateen as the sub-villain of this piece, Black Manta. This is the most incompetent Super-Villain in any Super Hero movie to date. His Black Manta was there, obviously, to give Aquaman someone to beat. And he beats him...again...and again...and again.All I wanted to do was ""beat feet"" out of the theater.Letter Grade: C+ (for Momoa's efforts)5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The DC cinematic universe has a poor track record, underwater CGI can be extremely difficult to get right, and the concept of Aquaman as a hero is ridiculous even by comic-book standards. Yet somehow director James Wan has dished up one of 2018's most entertaining blockbusters, well and truly matching its Marvel counterparts on the fun-scale. It may be silly, but it's the perfect type of silly. After helping the Justice League defend Earth against Steppenwolf, Arthur Curry (Jason Mamoa) finds himself at the centre of another looming invasion on his home planet - this time from the deep sea Atlantians, led by his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson). With action sequences both on land and under water, Wan doesn't miss his opportunity to thrill with inventive and exhilarating set pieces, starting with a pre-credits fight that sees Nicole Kidman's Atlantian Queen kick some serious butt in one, long unbroken shot. The film engages in a game of one-upmanship with itself, the action getting bigger, wilder and more ambitious. Not every single sequence tops the last, but there's a healthy upwards trend leading to the climactic oceanic battle. Like all big budget flicks the computer effects are abundant and lavish, but particular credit goes to the VFX team for making the underwater sequences look amazing and, to a certain extent, feel realistic. It's not just the impressive visuals and exciting action that makes this movie a blast though, the tongue-in-cheek tone and carefree humour signals loud and clear that this movie is in on the joke, and that DC characters can have fun whilst also being a bit moody. It also helps that Mamoa is just so damn likable too; his reluctant superhero is the kind of guy you would want to share a few beers with. Where Mamoa ends and Arthur Curry begins is a blur, his real-life laidback persona forming a large part of the role. Not everything works (Yahya Abdul-Mateen's pirate sub-villain is a misfire, the second act sags a little), yet the film is firing on so many cylinders that these are mere blips quickly forgiven. Throw in an epic Thor: Ragnarok-esque soundtrack and Aquaman is popcorn cinema done right.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Let's face it though, D/M have definitely developed a formula to making their movies, which isn't good, because movie formulas make movies samey. It is a successful formula, to be sure: D/M have made, what, 20 movies? But this kind of formulaic approach will kill the comic book movie. Perhaps part of the success of 2018's ""Venom"" is how it broke from the mould by being its own weird and wonderful entity. ""Aquaman"" goes further still: Aquaman does not just break this mould, it *shatters* it. Aquaman is an excellent film, one of the best fantasy films I've seen, and highly worth your time. It is not formulaic, it is not a filler movie until the next crossover: it actually helps reinvigorate the term ""comic book movie"" and succeeds on nearly every level.The plot is classic fantasy: there is a rightful heir to the throne, an evil dictator, a princess, and magic, all set through the lens of the sea. Instead of swords and sorcery you have tridents and Atlantean technology. It is familiar but different, thanks to the underwater aesthetic and how the movie treats its lore. It is not constantly patronizing us with stupid jokes or nods that break immersion like Marvel and Deadpool movies, nor does it take itself too seriously like the Dark Knight movies. Perhaps that should be the distinction between DC and Marvel: DC adheres to its lore more closely, and in doing so benefits from greater immersion.The leads, Aquaman and Mera, have chemistry together but neither are fantastic actors. But they are earnest and look their parts, and there is so much wonderful content to this movie that when they fumble a line or a moment it is of little consequence. The movie is also quite long, but that is a nitpick: you can't hurry epic fantasy.It is fitting that the characters call Aquaman ""King Arthur"" at the end of the movie. Aquaman is in the same class of Excalibur, Lord of the Rings, Conan, and Highlander.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The visual effects are good but again it's nothing we haven't seen before. to honest I think Avatar had better visuals and that movie is now fast approaching its tenth birthday.I'll never understand why there was so much hype for this movie, because it will be forgotten about very quickly.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The lore was interesting and the movie did a good job showing Aquaman's backstory with quick flashbacks that didn't distract from the main plot.To start off, all the acting was amazing but I have to give a special shout out to Patrick Wilson (Orm). The villain could have easily came across as comical but Wilson brings a gravitas to the role that made the movie epic. Jason Momoa also did a fantastic job and his screen presence really shows in every scene and that's important for a role like Aquaman.The CGI was fantastic, especially for all the underwater scenes. The creatures looked realistic and the world building was really great. I loved the camera work in the movie. A lot of directors get too comfortable shooting in flat, boring angles but this movie really showed how a visual medium should look to help bring out every scene. From the wide angles to the close ups, everything looked inspired and interesting.I did find some of the music choices questionable at times and the songs distracted from the what was happening but at least they were short moments in an otherwise great score.I really loved the fight scene between Aquaman and Orm. The tension and action was perfect and the small comedic quips landed. I also really liked Aquaman's speech before he got his trident.This version of Aquaman was greatly improved from the Justice League movie. You can really understand his motivations.I really got to hand it to DC this time. I haven't had this much fun watching a DCEU movie since The Dark Knight.10/10 would recommend üëç","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But in the first thirty minutes, I knew this was to be a huge disappointment. As some reviewers explained before, the acting is soo cheesy and cocky that it takes away all the interest. Except from okay performances from Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren (yes sadly...if Dolph is among the good performers of this movie, try to imagine the rest!) and a so-so presence from Jason Momoa the rest of the acting is really, really lame. Lines are delivered with a visibly forced attitude, body language is not congruent and exaggerated poses and looks that last too long made me want to stop watching. Even Nicole Kidman is not up to the task here or is playing way below her conventional high standards which made her such a famous and sought after actress. Amber Heard probably gives one of the worst perfomances I've seen on screen after Kristen Stewart in Twilight and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is for sure not helping either.This being said, the movie is visually amazing even if many computerized graphics are way too obvious . But since when can a movie be qualified as excellent or get such high ratings simply based on this? If the visual cannot be supported with strong and believable acting, it is simply like a beautiful postcard with nothing written on it, so it becomes meaningless. And that is what this movie is for me.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The premise of the film sees Arthur Curry forced to travel to Atlantis in order to attempt to stop his half brother Orm from starting a war with the surface.Main Character
Jason Mamoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman and he is really good in this film, I enjoyed him in Justice League and he is further fleshed out in this film. He has plenty of personality and charisma to him to play a leading superhero but there is an added depth here that makes you care about him and want to see him succeed.Supporting Characters
There has been plenty of controversy about Amber Heard but this film came out before it so I will judge her on her performance and I thought she was a good character. You can see how she is different to Mamoa and that leads them to have good chemistry in the film and makes them a fun pair to watch. Patrick Wilson plays Orm and he is a really interesting character, you can tell he is not evil an that he really wants what he believes is best for Atlantis. His dynamic with Aquaman is great to see and it leads to an above average antagonist who we can kind of see the point of view of. Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren & Willem Dafoe play roles in the film and are all good, they play important parts and fit their roles very well. I have to talk about Black Manta though, the character was heavily marketed and his costume looks amazing but it feels like he was just here to possibly set up a sequel. He has interesting motivations but he is basically a cool looking henchman here and I wanted a bit more if we were going to see him.Story
The story is well done, it's a story that has been seen before with the reluctant hero having to step up but it is done well enough. The dynamic between our hero and villain is well done and rises the story above other comic book films. Though the story has a bit of a pacing issue, it gets a lot less interesting in the middle act, the first and last arcs are great but the middle arc isn't as interesting or at least wasn't for me.Script
The script is great here, the humour is well done and fits Mamoa's naturally funny personality in making Aquaman a fun hero to watch. It was also suprising to see how well done the drama was done as I felt something in the dramatic scenes and cared about Aquaman's personal relationship's in the film.Style
Now after Justice League people were worried about the style of Atlantis but it is so much better here. The underwater scenes look great and the bright colours make this feel like a different style of DC film in recent memories. The action scenes are also very good, the underwater and land scenes feel very different and it makes them feel appropriate to the situation. Though as mentioned there is an issue with pacing here, the film could have cut like 15 mins off to make it an even better 2 hour film.Overall
Overall, this is a great film, it is truly unique with the underwater scenes and is visually a film to be watched. It doesn't do anything really new but what it does it does well and is worth a watch.Rating - 8/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I will just be blunt. BAD. The acting was wooden, the jokes were WEAK, the romance was contrived, and the plot was terrible. There were some things that could have been forgiven, maybe, except that every single plot point was done better by a better movie.All that said, there was one moment - a shining moment - that I became angry for the exact opposite reason. It was better than the movie deserved. Cutting to the chase, there was a shot - a glorious shot - where the composition and foley and everything came together for a fantastic and beautiful moment that was beyond the movie that contained it. That's why I give it a three.All in all, just skip it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Those who try and attack her shame on you thankfully Jason Momoa proved he is a true hero. He has stood by and said any sequel will include Amber Heard. Amber is not a criminal she did nothing wrong just because she left Johnny Deep and some of you prefer him over her why I will never know. Jason is going thru a tough time with his soon to be ex and he does not hold anything against her or vice versa. What happens in someone's personal life is just that personal it has nothing to do with their professional life. I have watched this move three times and at NO point like some of these trolls say did Amber have a problem with her lines. I look forward to a sequel with Jason and Amber together that is what created this franchise and Jason showed he is a loyal friend. I look forward to these sequels and all the other movies these two make either together or apart they are both professionals at their craft. People save your hate for your sites were trolls go this is a site that judges movies. To those using Amber as an excuse to pick on this movie. May I remind you this was a blockbuster hit if that is what happens when you put these two together let me buy some stock in that pairing.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

At this point, I feel as if the world is playing a joke on me with the positive reviews I've been seeing.I wouldn't say that I had high hopes of this movie being spectacular. The moment I read about Mamoa being cast a few years ago, I was ecstatic! He seems to be the perfect fit for Aquaman! However, the concept of an Aquaman movie, seems kind of silly. He talks to animals? In the water? Sure, but a movie? Just saying, no high hopes, just wanted a good time!The acting? Terrible. Character development? None! Visual effects? Seems like a beginner. If 1993 Jurassic Park could create effects like it did, why was this so bad 15 years later? Directing? Awful. So many shots were pointless, and honestly, dumb. The script? Well, let's just say there was a solid 10 minutes where the back and forth dialogue was comprised of 4 word sentences. Villains? Two half assed villains, that don't really seem that awful...which is, you know, not great for a villian! It seemed like there was an attempt made at a soundtrack, and then just quit. There were 3 heavy synth 80s songs, and then Pitbull for a bit. What was that about?I don't even want to start on Willem Dafoe's wig and costume.The plot seemed to grab aspects of other movies, and threw them together, trying to make something stick. 3 points for every moment you recognize: Aladdin, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Power Rangers.I have never cringed as much, or as consistently, as I did during this movie. I could honestly go on and on about every aspect of this movie that I found terrible, but it's doubtful that anyone will read.TLDR; DC has to be deleting negative reviews. The cast should be ashamed of this movie. Don't go see it.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

If you never collected them, if you never watched the Superman-Aquaman ""Hour of Adventure"" cartoon show from the late 60's every Saturday morning with your brother, then you ain't qualified to review it, really. If you have, if you have taken the time do you find reprints and trade paperbacks of the old stories, well then that's good. A person should try to be at least a little bit familiar with the character before watching this. And if you don't have the money to buy a bunch of used comic books, then there is Wikipedia and other online sources that are pretty good that can fill you in with the uniqueness of this character, because once you understand the character, you will see why I highly appreciate this film.Even though I stopped actively collecting in the 70's, I still kept up with the history of the character. Aquaman was originally a Blonde haired Blue eyed Seawater Breathing, Seahorse Riding gent who could talk to fish and swim around in the deep but not much else. He was the King of Atlantis, and so his comic books always dealt with his administration of the underwater Kingdom while his adventures with the Justice League of America sometimes took him to other planets. He's saved Superman more than once, and at one time, he grew his hair out long and lost one of his hands, replacing it with a Hook. He became a much darker, more unkempt and disheveled figure, much like Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight"" version of Batman, which in my opinion Ben Affleck was the greatest depiction of.Aquaman, this Aquaman, is the undersea, super powered version of The Dark Knight. And Jason Momoa, who became famous playing Ronon Dex in Stargate Atlantis (another fable which included Atlantis), has been the first and best version of Aquaman. I don't think anyone can take it from here.I really don't know the state of the DC Cinematic Universe at this time, Zack Snyder started it with his Man of Steel, which lead up to the creation of The Justice League, and it is sad, very sad, that this story is not continuing. Or is it? I think I see plans for Aquaman II and Justice League II. But other New films are planned which are basically reboots of what Zack Snyder created. I don't want that, I want to see a second Justice League movie which includes the characters as they are now.Aquaman is one of the latest films to be told in the DCCU, and it caps off the tale with a threat that grows from the deep, Arthur Curry has a half-brother (Played by Patrick Wilson, Nite Owl from Watchmen, and I admit he is very handsome as an Atlantean) who wants to be crowned ""Ocean Master"" which will empower him to make war upon the surface. Arthur has to prevent this somehow, and his adventures take him to Atlantis, The Sahara, my Homeland Sicily, and finally The Marianas Trench/Challenger Deep - To meet a unique creature that has killed everyone who has ever come face to ""face"" with it. Can Arthur survive this?Now, the one thing about this film is that there appears to be a huge knock down drag out fight every 5 minutes. But, they are well choreographed. I thought The Atlanteans had too many Gizmos. Those are my only complaints.I thought it was cool that Nicole Kidman is his mom while Bobba Fett's Clone-Pop is his Dad. And his GF ""Mera"" (Amber Heard, hm, she was married to Capn Jack Sparrow?), so it's an all in the family affair.Mainly I loved that a character that I loved as a child has finally been given their own film, and a guy I like played him. That's all anyone can ask.Notice - Since this review is pretty much the same as the other review that somehow got posted before this one, I'm removing ""spoilers"", because I did not really put any spoilers in here. This was the update to that review and it just has a few new things in it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Trust horror director James Wan to take a superhero movie to an entirely different level. This was so different to the other superhero movies out there.Firstly, blood hell, the visuals are great. The fighting scenes are brutal and violent. Jason Momao is sensational as Aquaman. It simply wouldn't have been the same without him. He is very natural and does the character justice. I enjoyed the fact that the protagonist was also weak at times and vulnerable, and not a super god.'Aquaman' is visually stunning! Atlantis is portrayed as a bright, colorful, breathtakingly beautiful place. The costumes are incredible, and cleverly incorporates marine elements. The photography is also amazing, and I absolutely loved the score. I enjoyed the inclusion of the Roy Orbison song 'Mystery Girl' in such a modern film.The film is unpredictable and sometimes action abruptly ends tranquil moments. Unlike most Marvel films, the humor was at the right moments, appropriate and actually funny. For some reason I honestly believed I wouldn't enjoy 'Aquaman', believing it to be just another superhero 'been there done that' movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. I absolutely LOVED it. I loved the characters. I loved the story. I loved the entire production. This was awesome!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The underwater portray and design of Atlantis is as breathtaking as you would have hoped for it to be, making sure that there is an enchanting atmosphere during the entirety of the movie.Though Aquaman is a visual masterpiece, the terrible writing and dialogue makes the film terrible, no matter how beautiful the cinematography is. The dialogue is simply cheesy, predictable and makes you cringe because it's really THAT bad. I appreciate the humor that gets thrown in there every now and then but most of the time they just feel misplaced and mess with the serious tone some scenes have. The script and overall writing is very slow paced, though the ending feels quite rushed and unreasonable. With a runtime of almost 2h30min this could have easily been avoided.The acting is alright but nothing more than that. My personal highlights are Jason Momoa as Aquaman, who lives up to his role for sure, and Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko. Both obviously did their best with the script that they were given. Amber Heard's performance is worth a mention as she manages to not overshine the protagonist at all.All in all I would have been fine without having seen the movie and so are you, but if you are willing to overlook the terrible writing and dialogue then Aquaman, at least for it's visuals.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The only worse thing is the things they made Patrick Wilson and Willem Defoe do. They are such great actors, and here they were brought to do their acctual lowest. It's sad. It's even sadder DC and WB excecitives allowed that to happen. Damage control department is off the charts with the positive reviews everywhere. They are all lies.

There's moments that are breathtaking, visually stunning, with great acting and a fantastic soundtrack.

(Naming the films they spoof will one day be a great drinking game). I wanted so badly for this movie to be fantastic - but other than a few glimpses of what it could have been, it's not even close.The only real way to appropriately describe this movie is like a restaurant wanting to make a signature dish and deciding that because people like burgers, steaks, pasta and pizza, oh and who doesn't love milkshakes; so for their signature dish they decide just to mix all these elements together and throw them in a blender.I really wanted this movie to be the step that DC needed to launch their cinematic universe and properly showcase their catalogue of characters, unfortunately it looks like my DC universe ended with the Dark Knight Rises.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sure there were a few scenes that were a little cheesy but that didn't bother me compared to the action of the movie, Jason's acting & visual effects as I mentioned. Amber Heard's character was a good match to Aquaman & thought Patrick Wilson pulled off being the villain! I couldn't think of another actor who could have played Aquaman any better than Jason Momoa! He definitely pulls off the fight scenes & shows the right amount of emotion during his talking parts. Of course he has the perfect body to wear those tight suits! The visual effects created beautiful colors of the sea life & makeup people did great job doing their thing on the actors who weren't human. Overall DC is back & I cant wait to see an Aquaman sequel! So people you need to stay when the credits start to roll as halfway thru them there is a post-credit scene which sets the tone for a sequel.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Actually the only great parts were when Black Manta was on screen.However, this is just another dud for dc. So meh and predictable.Aquaman is no Thor because he lacks the charisma and dominance like Thor has. The ""bad boy"" Aquaman of The justice League movie is absent. In this movie he is a almost a beta but acts a tough guy because he like beer.I could barley hear some of the under water dialogue. The scene with Atlantis on land I didn't get why it was destroyed. Most of the lines and dialogue were just lame and generic.The Costumes were good. CGI and green screen were so obvious.Between Justice League movie and Aquaman movie I believe there were contradictions. But who knows or has time to list them since both movies were boring.The brotherly rivalry sucks. It's no where near Thor and Loki.Only positives are Black Manta and the giant lobster at the end. I wasn't sure why there was a big fight at the end probably because the dialogue throughout the movie was greatly bad.Aquaman tries to be Thor (at the end) and fun yet fails. Ocean Master is more fit to be king despite his actions.DC is 1 and 5 within the dceu. It's best to skip Shazam because it will likely repeat its predecessors formula.2 out of 10.

No. Were the visuals interesting? Heck yes. But unfortunately the dynamic action scenes in this were offset by the wooden dialogue, unconvincing CGI, cringe-worthy melodramatic moments, and virtually no character development- overall, this movie force fed me a choppy storyline that mirrored much of the style of Michael Bay's tranformer's series, that is, overstuffed with bombastic explosions but malnourished in actual substance. I honestly believe that this should have been a show instead of a movie.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Granted great cast, but thats all that this movie has.And to think, such a cast was subjected to this . I just dont get where it went wrong. They all just seemed like it was their 1st gig.

And the acting is uninspired with uninteresting character that gives you nothing worth to remember. And it's stupid.Well to be honest, Momoa had some moments that were alright. And Temuera Morrison is always fantastic, here no exception, but he has like two scenes? Best parts of the movie anyway!
Kidman is good and have been in som great movies, but here, her character could have been played by anyone. Also Dafoe is good actor, but the character here, it doesn't matter could have been anyone. It's hilarious to see Lundgrens face in a movie, just beacuse, but here it didn't matter, not enough to save the movie by a long shot. The rest I don't even remember.

DC has always tried to copy Marvel and this fight will always continue between DC & Marvel fans that who is the best among two. Talking about this movie it is a visual treat to the audiences in 3D (specially recommended) as one starts feeling itself to be a part of sea.For those who has done scuba diving and for those who hasn't its a must watch in 3D .Talking about the story Atlanna( Nicole Kidman) is from Atlantis an empire under the sea gets married to a man on earth & gives birth to Arthur( Jason Momoa) whose becomes Aquaman and is destined to be the Ocean Master. Now army from Atlantis empire comes to arrest Atlanna as she has gone against rules of sea world. Later on the story is about ending the war between sea world & earth by Aquaman by acquiring Trident of Atlan which was owned by the first king of Atlantis and now who will acquire this will be the master of ocean. Movie proceeds with run and chase on earth and sea and then war of sea world empires .The movie gives us a visual treat which we will love to watch on big screen . It is a must watch for evry Super hero lover. But one thing is definitely there that every Marvel fan will compare it with marvel movies as the fight between brothers for kingdom with a lot of audience around may be compared between fight shown in Black Panther. The search for Atlan in various empires and the sea world with gadgets may be compared to Guardians of Galaxy and a lot more. For all this winding up all in one word is Must Watch .Rating :4/5","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The dialogues at times feel a bit off (hence the 9 stars not 10) but apart from that id say it's one of the best superhero movies out there.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has an interesting story set after Justice League where Arthur Curry, who is now known to the people as The Aquaman, goes on a journey to Atlantis to stop a deadly war between the oceans and the surface by his half-brother Orm, while discovering his true destiny. The characters are good as well. Aquaman is basically a fish out of water who is clueless about his true role while Mera is a great heroine who aids him in his search. Orm is a good main antagonist while Black Manta is brought in as a secondary villain, and has a good fight with Aquaman. And while the movie does have so much special effects, they are put to good use, especially for the underwater segments. This is a good movie and is worth watching.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The CGI was overdone, and the acting was very subpar. The worst part, though, was the entirely inconsistent physics. It's normal in any fictional universe to have different physics from real life, but it needs to be consistent, and this movie was like the writers and director didn't even think about it. So, when underwater, apparently some things move slower, but others don't. Some things fall slowly, and other things fall like they're in air. It's apparently just fine to stand on something while being propelled through the water, and the water has the same friction as air.The only way this Aquaman gets anything better than a 4 or 5 is because DC is paying reviewers.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman was overrated and had the worst 3rd act for any Marvel or DC movie.

I don't even like Jason Momoa but because everything else is so strong it made me not care that they casted him as Aquaman. James Wan is also a great visual storyteller who uses great transitions and imagery. The movie was beautiful from the very beginning all the way to the end.

Its worth watching on IMAX for its fantastic underwater visual effects and action sequences alone. A lot of visual imagination is put into the underwater city of Atlantis. The action sequences are beautifully shot and you have a lot of different action set pieces that are a marvel to watch at the big screen.Aquaman is an ambitiously large scale film, that tries to go through a lot of world building and backstories. Even at 2 hours 22 minutes, it feels like the film rushed up some of it by mere exposition to save time. The large scale nature of the film makes it feel a bit messy at times even if its basic story is simple. The age old story of two brothers fighting for the throne one may have seen or read multiple times. This one done in a reverse of the way Black Panther did. Jason Momoa is perfect as the macho hero and has his roguish charm that carries the film. Amber Heard as Mera is jaw dropping smoking hot rocking the red hair sharing a nice chemistry with the hero.The climatic final battle is pretty epic. Comparisons to Avatar are warranted in regards to its CGI and world building. Its kinda sad and ironic that the Aquaman movie in DCEU feels the more grander and epic than Justice League.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I got so tired of looking at that guy flip his dumb hair everywhere. That's not even what the real Aquaman looks like! He's blonde! They stuck with the true looks of all the other characters but not him. Truly a disappointment.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie has two villains, but it juggles between them perfectly. Ocean Master and Black Manta are some of the better villains in the DCEU. Aquaman and Mera were great characters with great chemistry together. The Visuals of the movie were fantastic. The city of Atlantis and this underwater world looks amazing, I'd go as far and say it looks way better than anything Avatar gave us. Aquaman is truly one of the great superhero movies, go see it, especially if you want a good DC movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I ended up enjoying a movie. For a big fan of Momoa, I barely noticed him, caught up in the glory and lights of this movie. The emotion caught me, and got me involved, and as a writer for once, it didn't feel like I knew where it was going. After having watched many superhero movies, with basically the same storyline. This one felt fresh, and attention keeping. I loved how they took time to build all the characters, and didn't just give them minuscule reason for fighting. Also that the main antagonists shared moments of grat emotion, being half brothers. I was heavily entertained, and believe Jason Momoa's take on Aquaman, will forever remain, the one to beat, and the one to reach. He did a fantastic job, and I've never seen such perfect acting. He managed the impossible, drew me away from his visage, into a story.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What else do you expect with a story about a man who is caught between worlds, and has to face his family, in order to unite the worlds? (LOL)Other than that, Aquaman is a brilliant superhero movie, playing in a newly created world, which is a wonderful combination of Lord of the Rings, Abyss and Avatar, and perfectly matching sound effects. Despite the story being predictable, and being loaded with effects, Aquaman never becomes superficial. It offers enough background and soft moments, to make almost every character, even those with little screen time, interesting, believable and likable. On the other hand it offers enough action and speed, not suffering under special effects, to be continuously entertaining.Is it a perfect movie? No. Is it the best superhero movie? No. But it's a movie that never feels rushed, contains all necessary elements including some well timed comedy, and is perfectly balanced. This makes this movie incredibly entertaining, and the first movie that can actually compete with Marvel, and is hopefully a promise of more to come. Having said that, the only real bad parts were Amber Heard who is little more than eye candy and may remind you of Pamela Anderson in Barb Wire. Dolph Lundgren may thank his lucky stars for being in this flick, but should focus on Expendable sequels.Aquaman is an epic and fun visual spectacle. Thanks to James Wan, a director who knows how to handle this and various other genres!!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Aquaman was amazing!!! Great job, James Wan","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4514588/?ref_=tt_urv","jelaniwilliams305","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3347429/?ref_=tt_urv","16 December 2018","James Wan did an excellent job with Aquaman. He he adapted the story from Geoff Johns' Throne of Atlantis and used Aquaman's bad a**ery from the New 52 run and I liken Jason's Aquaman look to Peter David's 1994 run (long hair and beard) and they didn't shy away from the ""silliness"" of the golden age Aquaman (if you can't tell, I've been reading Aquaman comics for years).At it's core, Aquaman is a love story of two people who had no business being together but through their union came a product that would bring unity between 2 worlds. Nicole Kidman absolutely kills it; she needs more action roles. I loved the dynamic of Arthur and Mera; Jason and Amber have great chemistry on screen. I love that Mera is pushing Arthur to become the King even if he doesn't take the task seriously at first. Along it with being a love story, Aquaman is also a globe trotting adventure movie, think Indiana Jones/Romancing the Stone. They go around the world trying to retrieve King Atlan's trident andalong the way, their bond grows stronger and I loved seeing it play out on screen.One thing I'm a sucker for is an empathetic villain...this film has 2. Orm's motivation was understandable. This film actually had an environmentalist's message about how we treat our oceans and Orm was not having it. Patrick Wilson did an amazing job as always but, to me, Black Manta was more compelling. It's ironic that even though he's a villain, I totally understand his motivation for wanting to kill Aquaman; when you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. I'm mad that his role was so small but it was definitely effective; Yahya's Black Manta was a straight savage. Black Manta and Aquaman had some SERIOUS battles over the years in the comics and this film laid some real ground work for that rivalry on the big screen in the first act of the film.The action scenes in this film is incredible; Queen Atlanna fighting off the soldiers, Aquaman lifting a freaking sub out of the water and taking down the pirates, Orm vs Arthur's gladiator match in the ring of fire, the chase through Italy, the final battle, OMG THE FINAL BATTLE!!! James' use of the camera during these scenes is second to none. Also, the scene transitions are great.Visually, this is possible the best I've ever seen in a comic book movie; this movie should really be considered for an Oscar for VFX as well as SFX. Atlantis was BEAUTIFUL, the final battle was Star Wars-esque but underwater, men riding sharks with lasers, sea dragons, giant crustaceans and Arthur's entrance in the final battle is my favorite superhero entrance of the year along with Thor's entrance to Wakanda in Infinity War. James Wan leaned heavily toward his horror roots during the Trench sequence; the creatures were truly terrifying as was the depth from where they came. I love the underwater sound FX as well, they put a really cool effect on their voice when they spoke and the ""wooshing"" sound it made when during the gladiator match.This film has a little bit of everything; it has heart (I had goosebumps at some parts), the humor was handled well (it didn't overshadow the serious moments), great action. James Wan and company did an excellent job with this one. I'm definitely gonna watch it in IMAX on my next viewing.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Furthermore I warn anyone with limited entertainment budget to watching future entries in the DCEU at the cinema until you hear from reviewers you usually agree with.The movie was ""fun"" but I found the developement of the characters lacking. The villian wasn't intriguing in anyway. Some of the visual were jarringly bad also.Aquaman's mother, father, and Altantian mentor saved the movie from being just a campy kids movie. It also did a great job of delivering the back story of the history of the underwater kingdoms.For something you are going to fork other cinema money for it is 4. For home watching I would give a 6. Anything 5 and below you should avoid at the cinema in the opening 2 week or altogether at cinema. But for home viewing I would recommend especially if you have hope that future DCEU movies will be better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Just like anything he stars in Jason Momoa really shines and is a perfect lead, while this is a story that has been seen before I believe the things that separate it from the rest are the villains of Patrick Wilson's 'Ocean Master' & Yahya Abdul-mateen II's 'Black Manta' which have a compelling depth of character. The interesting thing is that I feel like there are scenes that standout with great cinematography & the tone that I expected James Wan to bring with him and then there's other scenes that I believe the studio stepped in a bit more. Either way the film completed its goal in my book, I love to rewatch it, and I am very excited for the second one which I believe can be even better than this one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

My score of the movie on IMDB is deliberately set to 10 with the hopes to increase the overall rating of the movie. Certainly, the film is not perfect having some plot holes, and some other inconsistencies with the characters. This film focuses only on showing Aquaman origin story combined with amazing battles - and it accomplished its task on a high note. Some of the other reviewers on IMDB mentioned negative aspects such as weak dialogs or rushed character development. I believe these aspects are not important for this kind of film, one of the main goals is to be entertained. And we all are highly entertained! Aquaman is definitely not a character-focused drama, it is instead a fantasy adventure based on the characters from a comic book. So taking this into consideration, just try to have fun and enjoy the movie!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story is replaceable, you never really know what they do or why they do it (or maybe I just simply couldn't hold my attention for long enough, distracted by the CGI). Which leads me to....The CGI is ridiculous! Who on earth allowed that? I found it really tough to watch. It reminds me of one of these cheesy dragon fantasy pictures bathed in neon lights. I'd rather go in a cheap hotel bathroom and enjoy the view than watch that movie again. A lot of the movie scenes were more like a video game, with a lot of badly fully animated scenes. Certainly worth an eye cancer warning!The actors dont do a bad job (Im not a Heard fan but she was quite believable) although quite wooden at times (might be down to the CGI..). But again, they gave the impression they didn't really know what to do. Even the amazing Nicole Kidman felt somehow wrong in this movie. Shame, could have been a cool movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I can see it as being considered good compared to something like Justice League or Batman v Superman, but that's a pretty low bar to set for a movie.The cgi and backgrounds when they're on land look horrendous. It's like they ran out of money from the giant water battles that didn't serve a purpose, so they couldn't be bothered to maybe film some of the land scenes, I don't know, on a location next to an ocean. This movie is an hour too long. The giant water battles don't serve a purpose other than giant water battles look spiffy.The scenes with Black Manta should've been cut and saved for another movie. He doesn't add anything and promptly loses to Aquaman in a fight. They could've at least made the Aquaman & Black Manta fight take place underwater instead of land. One of the main purposes of his suit is so he can dive to deep distances that he'd otherwise not be able to do.The acting in this movie is wooden. The woman that played Mera can't really act. Jason Momoa seemed like he was just playing a frat boy. Ocean Master was impossible for me to take seriously. He reminds me of Bibleman.The movie references Justice League and Steppenwolf in the beginning. I was hoping they've not done that and just pretended Justice League never existed. Since they did mention it, what was Atlantis up to during those events?The rest of the movie was just blah and cgi overload. I've always found Aquaman to be a ridiculous character","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story was really nice described, everything was explained step by step and it wasn't rushed like some other dc movies. There was no boring scenes or not needed ones, everything in the movie flew like it should have. I loved Amber and how she brought us her character, I was actually very surprised how good she was and she was actually better than Jason to me.
Another good thing was that battle between brothers didn't last for half an our, it was short and sweet just like it has to be and more time was spent on other imortant stuff.
Only thing that was a bit annoying to me was that the Aquaman was introduced to us like an idiot, he doesn't seem nor smart nor very sharp, more like some cocky bully.
All in all, I loved the movie, even the villian was actually interesting which is not the case in every movie, and ofc there is also the Atlantis world that was so stunning, I just loved it, and all of the underwater world was shown brilliantly I don't remember a movie that had such pictures and imaginative scenes since Avatar.

It looks really cool, sometimes a bit over the top, especially with the costumes, but the long scenes where the camera moves around a lot look very nice.

This is by far the best comic book movie DC/WB has come out with, even better than Wonder Woman. The story doesn't meander too much, and everything stays on point. All the flashbacks are done with great effectiveness, especially when Aquaman speaks to the big bad ass Kraken guarding the trident of all tridents. And how could you miss with a unbelievable supporting cast comprising Dolph Lundgren , Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe. Also, I didn't know the Kraken's voice belonged to, of all people, Mary Poppins herself, Julie Andrews. The visuals were amazing, but did not overload the senses, unlike Batman v Superman or Justice League. I hope the people at DC/WB now realise you can't replace good storytelling (and good acting) with outrageous and overwhelming special effects. It doesn't work that way. It was indeed appropriate that our hero announced his arrival in our superhero consciousness with a commanding tone at the end of the show with ""I am....Aquaman"".p/s With all this momentum going for Aquaman, Wonder Woman 1984 has a lot to live up to. Hope it does make it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was excited, but nit extremely enthused about this film given the track record with the DCEU. However, I can now say I love this movie. This is now my favorite DCEU movie, even over Wonder Woman, and is now my second favorite film of 2018 behind Infinity War. This film hit every mark. It's not an overly deep or complex film, but it isn't trying to be. It set out to be an entertaining and outlandish comic book film, and it goes full throttle with it. It's essentially your average MCU movie, though I enjoyed this more than many of the recent Marvel films.The story is relatively simple. Arthur Curry/Aquaman is a half breed. His mother was a queen of Atlantis and his father is human. Now, his mother has disappeared and his brother, Orm/Ocean Master, the king of Atlantis is threatening to invade the surface. Now, it is up to him to challenge his brother to become the rightful king.The best word to describe Aquaman is spectacle. This film is a great visual and action spectacle. This is easily the best, most colorful looking DCEU movie to date. The action is a thrill and it never sops going. The film is almost two and a half hours, but it doesn't feel it like some of the other movies do. There were a couple pacing issues, but overall I was never bored watching this film.Unlike, Batman, Superman, or even Wonder Woman, I was never that big of a fan of Aquaman growing up. It wasn't until I read Geoff John's brilliant comic run in the DC New 52 that I really appreciated the character. Throne of Atlantis especially is one of my favorite stories in comics. This movie felt very much like an adaptation of that run, which isn't much of a surprise as Geoff Johns was also a writer for this film, and a producer.The cast is spectacular too. You have a cast of Jason Momoa, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren, and Nicole Kidman. Jason Momoa especially did a fantastic job here. He was badass, funny, charming, and even charismatic. I was never sold on his version of Aquaman. His performance in Justice League didn't do much for me, but he killed it in this film. Seeing him the traditional Aquaman costume near the end was great, and it felt earned here, unlike in Man of Steel.Overall, Aquaman is a great superhero film, and just a fun movie all the way through. I can't really think of much wrong with this. Again, it isn't a masterpiece like the Dark Knight, but not every film needs to be like that. It set out to be an entertaining ride, with just enough heart to it, and it works. Even if you don't think Aquaman is cool, give this a watch anyway. You might change your mind.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was surprised to see that this movie is in 21st place in all-time box office takings because I really didn't think that it was that amazing. Jason Momoa is the perfect Aquaman, but the script was awful, and the music throughout the film REALLY got on my nerves. Some of the scenes looked great, especially on the big screen, and the few witty moments were delivered well from Momoa but I found the core of the plot to be predictable and a bit annoying in places. The whole ""step-brother wanting to gain the power to control the seas"" theme was weak, and Aquaman's sidekick, Mera (Amber Heard), seemed to take centre stage during the important parts of the concept, more than Momoa. Dolph Lundgren put in a decent performance as King Nereus, alongside Patrick Wilson (King Orm), but that Fly looking ""Baddie"", Manta (Yahya Adbul-Mateen II) was completely useless, and the acting was terrible. I liked the relationship between Aquaman and his father Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison), but Nicole Kidman seemed a bit out of place, as Atlanna. Visually, it was a great achievement because it must have been hard to make the characters look like they were actually underwater, and some of the action scenes were put together well, but it's really Momoa's fresh acting style, that saved the day. He would have been great in a Marvel movie, but now he's stuck with DC's Aquaman, it really could do with Ragnorak's director, Taiki Waititi, touch. With all that aside, it is a decent watch, and it's much better than some of the movies that have come out of DC's camp, but it wasn't memorable and I'm glad that I didn't pay top dollar to watch it in the cinema. With a sequel due to come out in 2022, it's a shame that the same director is making the movie because I can't see it being dramatically different from this one. Now that Aquaman is king, there are many different avenues that they can take the character, but I don't think that the director is willing to take many risks, in terms of wit and really letting Momoa loose. Judging by the scenes after the credits, it's obvious that Manta is returning to revenge his dad, and the fact that King Orm is in a room with a view, I'm sure that he will be returning to gain the throne but it really needs a charismatic character to make this movie something to remember. Anyway, it's worth a watch, especially if you're a comic book fan, but I preferred Wonderwoman. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by James Wan, who brought you Saw in 2004, Dead Silence, Death Sentence starring Kevin Bacon, Doggie Heaven, Insidious 1 & 2, The Conjuring 1 & 2 and Fast & Furious 7. He has quite a versatile filmography, which was originally based on horror mysteries, so he was a questionable choice to bring this epic movie to the big screen. He also produced all of the Saw movies, Annabelle, Demonic, Lights Out, Jigsaw, Annabelle: Creation, The Nun and the Curse of La Llorona, so he has a passion for the supernatural genre. As this is the highest grossing movie from DC, including all of the Batman movies, it certainly passed all expectations, especially after the disappointing Justice League movie.

Otherwise all the characters looks almost alike with the comic! The storyline is also great, it is a pretty well done job to squeeze massive stories from the comic into a 2 hours film. However, I think it is better to read some Aquaman comic first before watch this film. It will make you have better understanding and felt the film's originality from the comic.I'm so glad that DC has finally on the right track on the film making. I hope they keep their good work for long term. Always prefer dc comic than the marvels.Plus, I found quite interestingly that in this film for some fighting scenes, I felt like I'm watching Drangon Balls character fighting scenes and doing their fatal blow or doing Kong Fu fighting. And, Nicole Kidman is so hot and wicked in the film, her fighting scenes is awesome!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What a beautiful, well written movie. The best part? Zak Snyder is nowhere near this project. The soundtrack, cinematography, and cast worked so well together. I believe it also helped that this origin story hasn't been told that often. I was beyond impressed. I think I only caught one mention of the monstrosity that was Justice League and once this movie was tied to that universe they made the right decision and steered clear. Seeing this movie done so well, it made me wonder what could have been for the DCEU had they been smart about things and you know actually built their universe from the ground up with movies like this. Either way, it looks like things are finally looking up if they can continue to make movies like this. Give it a try! 8/10

Beall and McGoldrick's Writing: NAY!I don't believe it's materially doable for me to scheme into words how carelessly ludicrous Aquaman is. I can't declare if I positively cherished the campiness and nuttiness of this movie, or if I positively despised it. Warner Bros have blown their 200-million-dollar budget on something ferociously miraculous, but also, something terribly disposable.In simple terms, Aquaman was acutely run-of-the-mill for me because, all though, Wan's supervision of the action (yes to those one-take shots!) and furthermore, the numerous of filmmakers' tackling of the graphics flowed lavishly, the writing and dialogue, nonetheless, ignominiously sinks to the bottom-ground. Soooo, I suppose I'll meet in the middle with this encapsulation and proclaim that this lunacy of a production-that is Aquaman-is, all in all, mediocre?Aquaman is testosterone fueled mania suffocated with oceans of shirtless men shrieking their heads off while mounting gigantic fishes. If that's what you like in your movies, I recommend trekking alongside this motion picture, but if you're seeking out a superhero flick with sagacity and dandy quality, turn the other way. I'll grant it this though, it's rigorously an improvement from Justice Leauge and Suicide Squad. And, hey, I'll even tally extra points for the Halo jumpsuits and the hardcore, drumming Octopus.

While many of us know James Wan for horror films he definitely delivered a great movie in Aquaman. It certainly is not a flawless movie by any means but it is one hell of a good time. I still think Wonder Woman is the best DCEU film but this one is without a doubt second. The film is a beauty with great cinematography and visuals. The actions scenes are very well done especially since 90% of them are underwater. The cast is great as well with Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard being the best choices for Aquaman & Mera. Their chemistry is amazing with one another and it definitely makes them more likable. Yahya as Black Manta was also another amazing cast choice. The film is definitely over the top but it's mad so be over the top. The cheesy over the top moments just made this film more entertaining in my opinion.Like I said this movie is by no means flawless and does come with some weak aspects. The writing in the film could of been improved and some of the one liners were weak. One of the weakest aspects for me was the score. The score was very basic and forgettable. If it had a better score such as Wonder Womans it might push it over the top to be the best DCEU film. All in all this film is beyond entertaining and anyone can have a good time seeing it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Characters play their role and are sufficiently developed. Unfortunately I can't speak a lot about the acting, because I saw the translated version. Scenography is very good and stays true to the nature of the film.However, as the title says, camera work is one of the things that is absolute astonishing about this movie. Visuals in this film (specially the one sorrounding Atlantian culture) are breathtaking and a delight to see. Fight scenes flow ridiculously smoothly, but I do have to admit there are moments where they overdo it, but I can count those with one hand's fingers. Weakest points of the visuals are Mera's eyes and the water flow effect that ""zooms"" on certain parts of the screen momentarily, it makes serious moments a bit ridiculous.The ancient Atlantian history and folklore shown in the movie is really entertaining and grants a very entertaining trip through ancient Atlantian landmarks.Overall, it's a pretty well thought-out and executed movie and its flaws, like overly dramatic scenes and terrible use of music, in come across as pretty meaningless in the bigger picture.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I must say the way the managed to portray the underwater world exceeded my expectations as I have not seen anything like it before, but unfortunately it's one of the high points of this flick.The movie begins like your average Disney movie. Two characters fall in love, have a child, and they get separated. This child is aquaman, a boy with seemingly unique powers of being able to communicate with sea creatures.Fast forward to when he's grown up, aquaman is your generic character that is slowly transferred into a hero, one that is the last hope of stopping the war versus the Atlantans and the ""earth people"".Unfortunately I can't really go any further without spoiling the plot (there's not really that much to spoil) but let's just say you can predict everything that happens in the movie, including some of the dialogue.The movie feels one linear. One dimensional. There is no sense of wonder, no atmospheric environment, nothing. The movie has managed to bring the best cgi within the DCEU universe, but at the end of the day, it just feels like a movie.There is honestly nothing going for this movie. It just manages to succeed at not being as bad as some of DC's lowest (suicide squad, justice league). It plays everything safe, sticking to the core roots that the audience seems to enjoy and want out of a movie, regardless or not if they have seen it a thousand times.The writing is poor, the screenplay is poor, the cgi is fantastic, the acting is bland, and the movie lacks any memorable moments except for the eye candy fight near the end of the movie.Overall if you're okay with the same old movie following the same old formula, you can't really go wrong with this movie. But for someone who is sick and tired of the same stuff over and over again, I'm going to have to give this movie a 4/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The dialogue is good enough and this film does a great job of staying in its element. What I mean by this is that it mostly focuses on Aquaman alone and doesn't have too many subplots.

The Jukebox songs work very gwell placed. Black Manta doing Tony Stark's thing with the sounds of Depeche Mode ""It's no good""! Roy Orbison and Toto's ""Africa"" with rap - that's a combination, old pal.
The first song/theme in the movie is some kind of Atlantean lullaby - you can cry a sea of tears, it's very romantic.
Momoa and Lundgren are great. Black pirates are cool. Main antagonist is charismatic and deep. There are some really good jokes in Marvel style.
Now let's talk about weak parts:
Same thing with Black Manta and the city of Atlantis. I would love to see him walking around the underwater streets watching simple alien life etc)) All this glory didn't fit the screen time. Lord of the Rings was too fast and rushed too, but Aquaman is like 10 times faster. Maybe they will add some cut material in DVD versions.

Jason Momoa is also not blond, as Aquaman was portrayed in the comic strips. But those are the only things I could score against it.I think it was actually very well cast, and many of the characters gain credibility from a well thought casting.The visual spectacle exceeded my expectations even for a modern film of the genre.Apart from a couple of details, the plot line was not too predictable, and had many satisfying twists and turns.Expecting something less than a Marvel film, I got something even better.

The script is terrible and the plot is meaningless and the whole thing looks like it's straight out of 1994. The costumes deserve a particular mention because they look exactly like a 1990s TV sci-fi show. Some of the costumes, notably Nicole Kidman's, got a laugh in the cinema I was in. And I don't think that was intentional. The only saving grace for me is Jason Momoa. He seems likeable and made the best of some genuinely bad lines. He looks the part too. And I suppose it is MARGINALLY better than Justice League, though not by much.Personally, if I'd known what it's like I wouldn't have gone to see it. I seriously considered leaving the cinema halfway (which I've never done) out of boredom. There's plenty of other stuff at the cinema right now so save your time for those better films instead.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I like how they put like every genre of movie beautifully. Most ppl who hates it maybe have bad blood with DC movies or is a die hard fans of MCU, well i like MCU too but its not that bad to the point of giving it 1/2 in the rating just to make it looks bad. Jason momoa literally is a prefect aquaman. I really love the actions and the shots in the end of battle really so DC for me. Like everyone always judge, the jokes is not that much, and its not like batman cringey joke in previous dc movies and i don't think they tried to be like MCU maybe they just trying to find their own style to fit this future generation. I actually thought some of it as funny. For haters maybe you guys are just ""oldies try hard to be edgy people"" i still rewatch it at least 3 times since its amazing and have so DC-like shots with that filter. I actually felt a lot of emotions, and heart throbbing time. For a lot it may be overrated but for me i truly like it. From the true fan üëåüèª.

But all the hidden green screen in the world can't stop this energetic AQUAMAN from hitting the right marks since it takes the viewer from one location to another (a bit like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL), and with each step there's a new literal clue to get to the next strategic level...All the while catching sporadic glimpses of, without being tethered to or having to tell half the story with, the Origin involving ""Aquaboy"" being trained by a wise mentor (Willem Defoe) that coincides while moving right alongside the present-time obstacles...And the ocean isn't all we dive into. From beneath the Sahara desert all the way to the middle of the Earth, director James Wan keeps the viewer's gravity in check as the camera establishes where our reality begins and this movie's fantastical regions begin, remaining simple yet involving as Momoa's Aquaman, with his own pretty Scarlet Johanson type in Amber Heard's Mera, go on what's basically a scavenger hunt to find King Neptune's all-powerful Trident-pitchfork that will allow Arthur aka Aquaman to... you know... do what he was born to do.The Spy Who Loved Me underwater Lotus... where they see the sea
The second coolest action scene occurs when our initially reluctant hero learns the importance of the mission's goal by failing without it - while the best fight plays out on an island's edge between Aquaman and Manta, who will be the sequel's lead villain, more or less a henchman here...And in the fun and frolicking Roger Moore James Bond flicks, which is another likely inspiration... especially the underwater vehicle that zips around ""down town"" in this unapologetic, non-stop rollercoaster ride... the worker bees make the best villains, and tend not to... drone on like the primary ones...Not that it's a perfect movie. Momoa and Heard's banter has a predictable ""He Said/She Said"" cadence, usually leading to She outwitting the physically superior He, or He surprising She with having an actual brain along with the brawn, and you might scream out ""Just kiss already"" after a few forced-heated moments...Meanwhile, Atlantis resembles a bright, shiny, neon arcade cartoon (albeit nicely scored with a fitting old-school techno score) and the puffy-buff sharks look right out of SHARK TALE...But there's always a good enough reason for our heroes to be wherever the hell they're at, and, unlike the last decade of Marvel, this is a tight action/adventure yarn for people sick of overlong, overly complicated and painfully melodramatic comic book epics. And yes, there will be a sequel. Sequels, actually. But this AQUAMAN proudly stands, and swims, by itself.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

'Aquaman' is another instalment from the line. This is from DC house and seems to be popular like Marvel Studio's characters. It is a good movie for adventure lovers. Jason Momoa is perfect casting for Aquaman. His towering height (6.4) and muscled body gave a real look to this new under water super hero. Other casting like of Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Amber Heard and Dolph Lundgren is okay. Amber Heard looks slim and a little dull than previous and having dimmer charm. Dolph Lundren is lost in his makeup. I actually did not recognize him for a while. Story is as required by an adventurous plot for comics. However photography is super. Various kingdoms like desert kingdom, Atlantis kingdom and other are amazing. Their sets are fantastic and filling real good. You will definitely enjoy from watching brilliantly portrayed those kingdoms. Though this is comical story for children, it is also watchable for parents also with their kids.I impressed to see a scene where an octopus is drumming with his all hands! How a unique idea! it surely will take you to notice this highlighted part of the move.My recommendation is just go and watch, no read any review further.

Starring Jason Momoa in the title role, it proves that DC films are experiencing a resurgence and will likely prove to be healthy competition with Marvel.One year after the events of Justice League, Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa) learns he is heir to the throne of Atlantis, an underwater kingdom populated by sea life and humanoid lifeforms known as the Atlanteans. However, Arthur's place as king is challenged by his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who intends to invade the surface world and reclaim it back for the ocean. Being half-human and half-Atlantean, Arthur must try to stop Orm from succeeding in his genocidal plan and give Atlantis the ruler it deserves.High spirited and likeable, Aquaman thankfully gives the DC Extended Universe the much needed push it has needed for some time, similar to how Wonder Woman did in 2017. There is a comfortable balance between comic relief and serious drama, but never so much that it feels like it is ripping off or downright plagiarising its style from Marvel. In terms of plot, the film feels like a hybrid of Thor and Black Panther, and its only major issue is that the story occasionally becomes muddled in its exposition scenes which does affect the pacing at times. Jason Momoa is without a doubt the perfect actor to play the titular hero, as he effectively elevates the character beyond being the laughing stock he has been among comic book fans for many decades. His scenes with Mera (Amber Heard) were great fun to watch and were the source of some of the film's more lighthearted moments. Willem Dafoe was also used well and wasn't merely reduced to being a cameo, and in addition to this, it was quite unusual to see him play a good guy in a comic book film. Be sure to stay back for an important mid-credits bonus scene.I rate it 7.5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

A dceu fanboy would think that all six dceu movies are masterpieces. That being said I have loved the other dceu movies and I am not a fan of the mcu. I find most of their movies bland, obnoxious, superficial and soulless. On the other hand, aquaman is none of those things. It has heart, a good arc for the main character, its villains have a little more depth than most mcu villains, its vfx/music and cinematography are easily superior to every mcu movie. The soundtrack is easily one of the best of the year. Amber Heard and Jason Momoa have great chemistry and the supporting cast are all memorable. The best part about this movie is that while it does have humor, it never cuts into the emotional moments. Aquaman like wonder woman before it is sincere and allows its drama and action scenes to play out without every character cracking jokes every five seconds. Another thing aquaman does well is that it gives its villains plenty of screen time. The movie isn't perfect, its pacing is a little messy and its story is predictable, but it commits to its tone and because of that it works. I think that the anti dceu bias is obvious considering that it has far worse reviews than most mcu movies. The vfx alone would make this a better movie than black panther but the likable characters, good acting,production design, music, directing, and tone make this the second best live action superhero movie of 2018 behind deadpool 2. In a fair world aquaman would receive oscar nominations for vfx, score, production design, sound mixing and sound editing. In reality it will receive none of these things while black panther which had horrible vfx and sound design will receive tons of technical nominations and even a best picture nomination. Oh and my review will receive tons of down votes because mcu fanboys can;t handle the idea of dc even trying to compete","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by James Wan
Starring: Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Temuera Morrison
Being an Amazon prime member I was one of the lucky viewers who had the opportunity to see an advanced screening of the film Aquaman from The Conjuring director James Wan. Aquaman is a jam packed high fantasy adventure that has call backs to films like Indiana Jones, Clash of the Titans, 80's/90's action flicks and the Harryhausen films of old except substitute claymation with CGI.
James Wan had a lot of heavy lifting to do with this film due to the fact that the DCEU or whatever they're calling themselves these days is in pretty dire straits after the box office and critical disaster that was Justice League. In my humble opinion James Wan did exactly what he needed to do in giving the audience an entertaining thrillride of a comic book film that looks and feels different than most comic book movies out there. Wan infused a lot of color and humor and action in his film which is something critics have complained was missing in previous installments in this shared cinematic universe.
You can tell Momoa is having a good time on screen and because of it we as the audience have a great time along with him. Mera (Heard) tracks down Arthur aka Aquaman to help her take down his half brother Orm as he wants to launch a full scale war against the surface world for the atrocities they have committed upon the sea dwelling populace via pollution and war and only Arthur can stop him as he by birthright should be the true King of Atlantis. Think of Orm as an environmental extremist if you will who will at any cost exact his revenge upon the world.
Of course it's not as easy as all that and Arthur must go on a quest to find an object that will help him in his bid to become the new King of Atlantis. Momoa is a force of nature who brings charm, wit and vulnerability to his role as Arthur Curry. Amber Heard is enchanting as Mera the daughter of King Nereus (Lundgren) one of the heads of the seven kingdoms of Atlantis who joins Orm in his bid to take on the surface world.
Let me say how happy I am to see a renaissance in Lundgren's career giving stellar performances in two back to back films this year Creed II and now Aquaman. The whole cast was just stellar form Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry Arthur's dad and Nicole Kidman as his mother Queen Atlanna. It's this love story that helps drive the film forward and I like how they bring everything back full circle by film's end I won't spoil it as officially the film doesn't open until next week and many of you have yet to see it.
Yahya was so awesome as Black Manta and from certain events that take place very early on in the film you can at least partially empathize with why he has such a searing hatred for Arthur and he is hot on the heels of Arthur and Mera as they are out and about on the surface world. The action sequences that many of us saw in the trailers where Manta and his men are chasing down Aquaman and Mera throughout Italy was even more amazing to behold on the big screen.
I attended the Hall H panel for Aquaman at San Diego Comic-Con and the excitement and enthusiasm from the cast about the making of this film was contagious. Wan jam packed this film with iconic Aquaman villains, friends and lore and some may even find the film overstuffed and to a degree it is with varying tones and sub plots and stories but I feel Wan successfully merged everything together for the most part. Some of the character arcs could have used some fine tuning but that's what future films in this potential franchise are for.
I loved the action sequences in the film and the epic battle that takes place in the third act was a spectacle to behold. I think this is the film that the DCEU has been desperately needing that will help solidify this universe as a worthy competitor to the Disney/Marvel universe. I am so happy that I had the opportunity to see this film early. I absolutely loved it and I highly recommend it to all of you reading this blog.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That was my complaint about MOST DCEU films, they aren't made to fit the character, they are all just Batman clones.It should have stuck with the adventure feel and been a great film.Instead it went in the same direction that ruined Wonder Women and every other DC film of late, it tried to emulate Batman","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I like most of the actors and actresses of the cast individually, but almost no one besides Momoa matches their role. Despite my admiration of them, Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe just don't feel like they fit in this world, but I suppose that could just be because Wilson feels more like an elf the whole way through (think Thranduil from The Hobbit). I'm not going to say that I expect a superhero movie to have a lot of realism, especially when it's about a famous myth, but the visuals are far too Avatar-like. Atlantis can look however they wish, but the entire ocean looking like a glow rave is undeniably wacky. I know it's difficult to explain every detail when world-building, but very little of even the basic technical stuff makes sense (once again, I know it's fictional, but frankly some of their world is downright silly). The fight scenes tend to have shots that are overly dramatic and choppy. I think the intention was to go for a more comic book style of conflict (with severe zoom-ins, comedic smirks, and etc.) like many of the latest adaptations are doing (ie. Wayne and Deadpool), but does so unfortunately poorly (to the point of wooziness or motion sickness). Many of the backgrounds, look like very cheap and stock-quality CGI. I can't believe that most of the praise for this movie was for the visuals, for me that was the worst part. Most of the laughs are cheap and juvenile, not unlike many other movies though. The characters who get the most screen time are the best developed and most funny, so basically only Heard and Momoa. This fact alone is why Marvel continues to beat DC at the box office. After Wonder Woman, I was just expecting better than this, not the same quality as WW even, but just not as disappointing as this. The costuming looked a lot like actual Halloween costumes (the Atlantian guards look like they took the suits from Power Rangers villains and painted them white, Mera's green suit is very cheap-looking, and Black Manta looks like a squashed version of Ant-Man). Even my own mother, who knows nothing of comics and is generally easily pleased by action movies (especially with main characters played by guys she thinks are hot), had to say the music choices were far from the best (I mean an Africa cover, seriously?) and often disruptive to the scenes rather than building them up. For me the most promising thing in the DC Universe now is Ezra Miller's goofy and relatable Flash.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's visually impressive and Jason Momoa manages to make it believable. However, that is not enough. The storyline feels mindlessly lightweight with it's clich√© violence and predictable romance. In spite of the excellent CGI and the environmental message it tries to convey, it just doesn't resonate enough. It's certainly not as terrible as Tom Cruise's ""Mummy"" (what is?) but it's not that great either. The dialogue is pathetic at times and a lot of the action scenes feel way too long and only made to fill out time and mask a lack of substance.

I really enjoyed this one. My daughter bought us tickets to see Aquaman (she knew I was curious and wanted to see it). From beginning to end, I can say I was completely immersed in the story. Good story, too. Never a dull moment. This movie is really about family. It's about doing the right thing, for the right reasons. Aquaman (Arthur) doesn't really want to get involved with the problems of the world (on land or in the ocean), especially at first. And that's what makes it more interesting. The lead actor does a great job at portraying Aquaman. Mera is fantastic, as is Orm, and also Atlanna. All the cast does a great job in my opinion - they seem to be enjoying themselves, and that shows through the screen. The underwater world is AMAZING. They did a lot of good stuff with the story development there - and I want to know more about it!
Pros: characters, story, acting, fun, visuals, music (was great!), heroism
Cons: not much for me...
See it for yourself and decide! I want to see it again soon!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am happy to report that Aquaman surprised me. Although I am not a hater of DC, I am a hater of bad comic book movies.DC has been really hit or miss with their movies. But to me this was a hit. Let me just start by saying, I went to see this with my girl, a couple and 3 guy friends. All of us with different likes. 1/2 liked the movie, the 1/2 not so much.Why was it good:
The story was a good story, giving Aquaman a outsider feel. A reluctant hero of sorts. But overall a strong presence. Jason Momoa does a great job of giving a new spin on the comic book version of Arthur Curry.
The action was a blast. There was a couple of really cool fight scenes and the ending battle was a blast.
Amber Heard was better than I thought. Now lets say she is not going to win an oscar here, but she is believable and could handle her own.
CG was off the hook. Really Amazing.
Imagination was really cool, all the different species and monsters.Why was it bad:
Well lets say this was a fondue party. Cheese was at an all time high. So many needless poses from Jason and bad one liners. Nothing that we haven't seen in any Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone movie. But still more than usual from a DC movie.
To me, it seem like it copied a couple of things from other movies, again nothing new, but for me to notice, its sometimes makes it not so cool.Overall:
Yes its Corny and Cheesy, but man was a lot of fun. I was impressed by the action and the CG. The main stars did a great job playing their superhero characters and I for one think it will come off very well with fans and non fans alike.
If you are looking for Great acting, great story telling, well you may be disappointed, but if you are looking for a lot of fun, which is why I go in the first place, then this movie will be great for you. Enjoy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is not the Aquaman of the comic books? Well, it's a movie guys, repeat after me: ""It is not your comic book"". As a Marvel fan I cannot count how many character they've butchered through the years. I was also uncertain by the choice of Jason Momoa, honestly after Ben Affleck as Batman I was expecting the worst. However I must admit that he is very good and convincing in the part, except for the contact lenses, those are horrible, but that's a minor thing and definitely not his fault. In general this movie is not perfect but the story makes sense, it has a good rhythm and the underwater world is astonishingly depicted. I don't understand the need of CGI to make actors younger, when they could have just chosen younger actors for that part. Despite this fact the action scenes are amazing, a crescendo of comics-like colours and composition with the apex during the end battle. The best DC movie so far, for sure, and one of the best superheroes movies as well.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Its more than all the Batman movies, its more than all the Superman movies!!!! or any other DC movies that came out already. The best thing that this movie has are the nods to some familiar scenes that we may never realized we've grown in to it. The discovery channel documentary about mermans and how they came to be. The zombie apocalypse with that torch waving among the hordes of Trench!. The G.I. JOE scenes and the James Bond chase scenery in Italy. The Journey to the center of the earth, the jurassic park scenery. The nod to the Little Mermaid, not to obviously see the whole Ariel look of the princess but man look at that scenery in the Atlantis! The Octopus drummer, the turtles, the ring of fire, the throne!!!! Ursulas pet!!!! and who would forget Sebastian being too OP as Aquaman's grand finale!Love how they build the story without messing up with the entire concept.

I would advise checking the date more closely because DCEU are clearly using the reviews before release as a guerilla marketing campaign.Don't get me wrong. There are some saving graces. Some of the scene design in this film is wonderful. Atlantis looks stunning and some of the fight scenes are entertaining to watch. However there is inconsistency in how well underwater scenes are rendered and it does sometimes lend itself to video-game cut scene territory. Also some of the costume design looks straight out of old-school power rangers which I'm not sure is a good thing for multi-million pound production.Where the film suffers most however is in the the god-awful dialogue. If you're a fan of overblown cheesy declarations, this film is for you. If you wanted something more punchy and impactful, this film is not. I heard a couple of audible groans from the audience at a couple of points after the characters make wooden use of already cheesy lines and it really is almost laughable.Jason Mamoa does his best with the material given and he really looks the part! Nonetheless though he struggles to deliver on some of the more 'cheesy' moments where he is required to emote something more than 'cool surfer man'. I'm unsure if this is due to the bad lines given, poor direction or due to limited ability. The baddies are a bit forgettable and could have used better motivations over all. Mantis was given one but was underused and a bit ridiculous really.In summary I wouldn't pay to watch this film and I wish that I hadn't. Read the real user reviews folks, check dates and stick to the MCU I guess because apart from Wonder Woman this DCEU is simply not up to par.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He repeatedly days he loves DC in his review. But any sane person can read through his review he hates on DC. I'm just citing this to tell you people please don't listen to people like him. They just want to degrade every other comic book movie that's not part of MCU. They even did that that Venom (which is a Marvel character, but not in MCU) which wasn't tied to MCU, which by the way was hugely successful despite these miscreants badmouthing the movie. People are getting the fact that even so called critics are useless, they also have a bias, that they can't just take their word for it. If you want to know how good a movie is ask around the people you know who have watched it. My honest opinion on film is I went to Aquaman without a lot of hope, because James Wan's any of previous films weren't CBMs. I wasn't sure well he be able to pull it. I wasn't much excited too. I only went and watched it because it was a DC movie. (yep I love DC more, I'm not gonna lie) . But I was really surprised by what James wan had to offer with Aquaman. It had an amazing pacing to the story. No lag or what so ever. What we saw it trailers is nothing compared to actual movie. Visuals were amazing. It's something that's unique. It's made in a grand scale. If you're gonna watch it , it better be on the biggest screen you can find. If you don't it's your LOSS. You'll know when you watch it on DVD or Blu-ray that ""Damn I should've watched it in theatres"".
My review is applicable only to general audiences who enjoys movies for their quality but their Brand.
Certain fanboys will disagree with it, because they don't like good competition.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I can't speak too much on the DC vs. Marvel thing, I always liked Aquaman and saw him on par with Superman and Batman. I found him interesting BECAUSE he was part of the Sea. For years I heard rumors of a feature length film and was happy to finally see this one. It works!What made the film first was the visuals. It's great to see, and I saw it in 3D. I will eat my hat if this team doesn't garner an Oscar nod, they deserve it. Then, there's Jason Momoa as Aquaman, and he fits the bill so much that you can't stop watching him. Aquaman has the difficult feat of being on land and sea, and Jason's portrayal gives you that struggle. And ""that thing"" about Aquaman that he can talk to the fish. He can. It was nice to see the beginnings of that.Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Amber Herd, Wilem DaFoe and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II rounds it out great as an ensemble cast. And then there's James Wan, the director who made all this work - the actors, the special effects - what a wonderful triumph, once it got going, I could have watched more.Aquaman is entertaining, it's family oriented and visually brings the undersea world to life.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Black Panther movie is rated much higher because or that, i mean compare both movies, which one was much more breathtaking? Yet both movies have same rating!This movie was breathtakingly amazing and joy to watch, I watched all Marvel and DC movies up to date, Marvel was ahead by far but this movie returned my faith in DC since Bale's Batman.

His sidekick, Mera, played by Amber Heard, is a memorable and gracious character to go along with Aquaman, not only does Heard play as the character in such a rich and tasteful manner, making it all look natural, but Mera herself is a well written character in this film.
I can't say much for the villains, they were mostly alright, and did their part in the film, it's also nice to see Dolph Lundgren and Willem Dafoe in a Superhero Flick, being a fan of the original Spider-Man trilogy, it's great to see Willem Dafoe in this film.The cinematography is one of the highlights of Aquaman, shot in beautiful locations including Newfoundland, Canada, Sicily, Morocco and underwater itself, it's usually difficult for films to have underwater sequences and make them entertaining, one of which include James Bond's Thunderball (1965), which dragged the film, but this is Aquaman we're talking about, and he has no problem handling the waters.The script itself is good, and the cast dominates it, but it can get spicy at times, there can be scenes where they're supposed to be serious, but then Aquaman breaks a curse word or an insulting remark, something that while it might go with half-human personality, it sort of underminds many scenes, it's not enough however to become a serious problem.The music is not very memorable, while it does its job, none of it seems catchy, at least to myself, it's usually a long road when it comes to making a hell of a theme for a Superhero film, such as John William's Superman theme or Danny Elfman's Spider-Man, the score fits the film, but it's not much to brag about.The use of CGI blends in well with the film, the only times I noticed obvious CGI was at the beginning with Atlanna, the fight's stunts and such are obvious, but other than that, the CGI ushers in beautiful visuals of underwater action and scenery, which fit in well with the world and plot.All in all: Aquaman succeeds as a Superhero film, it's a great action adventure flick, and an entry you just can't miss, if the DCEU continues to produce such great films, it will be in good terms with its audience after numerous bad entries.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

While the effects and the underwater world were nice, the entire movie was lacking a smart script and storyline that can drow the viewer in, however packed with cliche jokes, pointless characters, too long battle scenes to the point of yawning, and a very childish like design of the enemies.
Aquaman is clearly a great actor who drew attantion with his drooling body, but after 15 minutes the lure is gone, and the very long film could have easily cut 40 minutes.
Amber Heard lacks charisma and her only role being in the film was clearly to creata a romance interest for the lead actor, which is flat out boring.
The best part in the film was Nicole Kidman's story, which was sadly only a fracture of the film. Maybe they should have done a movie about her story instead of Aquaman.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

After all, Jason Momoa's hulking, tattooed fish-whisperer was one of the surprising standouts of DC's flop team-up event, and with the campy orange-and-green costume replaced by a long-hared and shirtless Kiwi Adonis, the character can now be played straight-faced. Wonder Woman proved that DC could produce quality with the right director pulling the strings, and they pulled off a coup with James Wan, a filmmaker whose talents I have long admired despite many of his films missing the mark for me. So it pains me to say that Aquaman is yet another tonally uneven and bloated effort from Warner Bros. that never quite knows if it wants to make you laugh or feel, with a marathon running time which, by the time is gets round to its umpteenth climax, is about as welcome as a fart in a wetsuit.In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) comes across a beautiful woman washed up on the shores of Maine. The woman is Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), a princess from the underwater nation of Atlantis who has escaped an arranged marriage and a gang of Atalantian stormtroopers. Tom takes her in and the two naturally fall in love, resulting in the birth of the half-Atlantian, half-human Arthur. When her enemies come calling, Atlanna must return to the ocean, leaving Tom to bring up young Arthur on his own. The baby grows up to be the beer-swilling gym-devotee we saw in Justice League, but there is trouble a-brewin' down in the depths. Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) wants to unite the kingdoms of Atlantis and wage war on the surface, who have been polluting their home for decades. But Orm knows that he will never be accepted as the true leader while Arthur, who has no desire to take the throne, is still alive. Mera (Amber Heard), the daughter of King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), comes to warn Arthur, but they don't stand a chance against the might of Atlantis without the Trident of Atlan, a magical weapon buried somewhere in the Sahara desert.Aquaman certainly isn't short of ideas; the problem is that Wan doesn't quite know how to cram them all in. We are taken across continents on land and to multiple kingdoms under the water. With a desire to capture the adventurous magic of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones, the film actually trips over its own ambition, squeezing in side characters such as Atlantean Mr. Miyagi Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the fearsome pirate Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), as well as a variety of underwater races we are expected to remember and littering the story with clunky CGI smackdowns. Wan crafts a colourful, vivid world, full of giant sea-horses and advanced technology, but it shares more in common with the weightless. computer-generated locations of The Phantom Menace than the tangible flamboyance of Black Panther's Wakanda. Yet all of this could be considered a mere niggle had the leads been up to the task, but Momoa and Heard have all the chemistry of two strangers making awkward small-talk in a lift. Momoa is an impressive specimen and possesses the charisma to bring this character to life (see Justice League), but here he is denied a moment to have that quiet moment of reflection or to reveal the flaws to his character that would help make him interesting. A wheezing, confused and sickly bore.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

But Aquaman...wow! What a great film! The visuals are amazing, the action scenes are mindblowing and Jason Momoa is superb as Aquaman. Sure, the plot is a little thin/predictable, but that doesn't take away the fact that this movie is a bold and very enjoyable step forward for the DCEU.James Wan did an amazing job in visualizing Atlantis and finally embracing the sillier side of the DC superheroes rather that trying to cover it up with a ton of rain and broodiness.9/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

What a flawless performance my him , grace and command is just oozing from him on all frames. And MCU has to step up their game on female leads.

They missed the mark. Over acting, poorly written/delivered lines, red hair that wasn't necessary and underwater storm trooper wanna be soldiers.Mamoa and company I think did the best with the lines they had. The entire cast is way better than this performance. The best actor in the whole thing was the main villan.Mera's hair was ridiculously bad. Tone it down. Look natural. Look like you have lived in a place the majority of your life that doesn't get sun. The wig was bad and it made her look so out of place.Atlantis...can you make it halfway believealble that we shouldn't have discovered it? It looked bigger than Rhode Island and brighter than Vegas!The soldier's armor was terrible. It didn't fit at all with living under water or the armor that the leaders were wearing. Sea life is stealthy not bright white.All that said, the plot was good. I hope they don't get a big head with this movie's success and apply this formula to other D.C.

However, I was expecting big things from Jason Mamoa's character in Aquaman based on his performance in Justice League and maybe that was the problem with this movie is that my expectations were not met by a long shot. Mamoa's appeal is his raw crudeness as a character but he comes across less than sophomoric and actually quite boring. I think DC was trying to bring a Thor-like character to Aquaman, strong but humorous in nature but they missed the mark greatly. Mamoa's dialogue is weak and wasn't even slightly funny. So basically, Momoa's is more of a supporting actor in my opinion and hasn't yet risen to lead actor. Nicole Kidman's performance was fantastic and so was Amber Heard's. Even Dafoe, Wilson and Lundgren did great jobs in their character, which probably made Mamoa look even weaker. I imagine it is tough to look like a star when playing alongside movie greats like Kidman and Dafoe.
Second issue I had with the film is the writing. The story is weak and predictable. If this had been a ""pre-marvel universe"" movie such that it had come out prior the epic series by Marvel, I would have given the movie much closer to a perfect score because it was cinematically well done. But that is just it, it now competes and measures up against what Marvel is doing and it is no where close. The movie feels self-contained and focuses on delivering a jaw-dropping visual adventure while forgetting the story. The graphic visualization of Atlantis and the underwater battles are fantastic, but that is just it, it overwhelms the audience and leaves the story to just that, a battle of good against evil with nothing else. There is no Superman, or Batman, or Flash or even Wonder Woman that make an appearance to somewhat tie the movies together. So if you like the self-contained movie in a box experience, this isn't bad. But if you wanted to see a DC universe film that extends ""justice league"" concept, I am not sure you will find it here.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Featuring a complex story with many twists, more or less predictable, it manages to keep interest throughout its entire length. It's full of action, drama and even romance to make everyone happy. Its characters, well described and put into play, are credible and enjoyable, thus being easy for the viewers to empathize with them. The actors who play them are also very well picked, fitting perfectly within the required characteristics. My only complaint regarding the story and the main fact which made me lower its rating was that it follows some stereotypes which are quite hard to ignore. Take for example an event which happens in the beginning of the movie (the one at the end of the scene with the sinking submarine) which afterwards brings a new big threat to the protagonist just because of his ""decision"". I'm trying to avoid any spoilers here so I assume you've seen this movie in order to understand my complaint.In terms of visuals, the movie looks astonishing. From the underwater landscapes to the intense action parts, you can clearly see that a lot of work has been put into this department, thus the end result is simply impressive. Its great soundtrack also contributes to the unique atmosphere, being there when needed while providing a big plus with every ""appearance"". I find it very hard to criticize these two aspects regarding the film.It's a movie which I personally like very much. This type of a ""one man army"" simply leaves me breathless only when thinking about it, let alone seeing it in such amazing details. I liked the story, I enjoyed the characters and I definitely liked the actors. I was also impressed by the visuals and the music it had. I small letdown in terms of story made me lower its rating a bit but overall, it's a movie which deserves to be seen and enjoyed by comic fans and non-fans alike.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That script must have been a 1 page :
queen escapes , son is born , other son is angry , queen is abducted , son is asked for justice and wins.And the reference to other scenes in movies is over the top :
1. Arthur has to take the trident vs Arthur in Excalibur
2. The fight between the 2 sons vs the endfight in Man of Steel
3. The trench reminded me of the Orcs in LOTR.There were even a few other movies that came about , but can't remember them.The acting was not really that good , even from someone of the likes of Willem Dafoe who generally is pretty alright .Most certainly that bad acting is to blame on the focus on special effects. Those effects are about the sole positive in this movie and for which it gets 1 star. But movies are more than special effects . If you can't relate to a character in terms of ' i feel for him/her ' , then the movie is worthless.And this one is worthless.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Quite frankly, the character Aquaman didn't do much for me to begin with. Subsequently, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like this movie. Man, I was wrong, very wrong. This movie is one hell of a ride, from start to finish.Let's start with the CGI, because it is present in abundant amounts. It is very well done, but sometimes nears the point of being too much, especially towards the end. For me personally it never did cross that border, though, because of the simple reason that it has its place; it makes sense.The musical score, ranging from orchestral to 80's synth is a weird mix of awesomeness. Is this a case of catching a ride on the bandwagon of what seems to work for other movies/shows? Maybe, but it works, and I'm digging it. It never goes overboard.The movie doesn't take itself too serious, but still manages to stay serious enough for you too care about what happens. There's no unfunny joke every two minutes. There are some, though, which didn't bother me.Usually, this type of movie features a one-dimensional plain evil villain with a simple agenda to rule the world. Well, this movie is actually no different. However, it also features a bunch of ""villains"", which aren't quite that. It's not near as black and white as you may expect.Story-wise, it's simple and predictable, but the story is there. And it works. It's a superhero action movie, folks, not Hamlet. Enjoy the ride.All in all, great stuff. Must see for superhero movie fans. Definitely one of the better, if not the best, DC superhero movie of recent years.9,5/10. Go see it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The action sequences and visuals are really well done, but unfortunately they're bogged down by incredibly weak writing. I've liked Jason Momoa since Game of Thrones, and was actually excited to hear he would be playing Aquaman. He has more than enough charm to play a great superhero lead (see: any Chris from the Marvel Universe), especially compared to the lackluster leads we've seen in the other DC films - not including Gal Gadot. But Momoa, Heard, and Dafoe are sorely underutilized. The acting in Aquaman really isn't great - but that's what you get when the actors are given boring, flat dialogue.The movie never seems to stop unloading exposition at you, and it's crammed into every conversation. You never get a chance to see the characters develop because everyone is too busy trying to explain the next 'world-building' element. I mean I don't need 2 hours of exposition to understand a bunch of guys riding sharks shooting blasters at crab people. Give me the essentials and focus on making me care about the people I'm watching - let the world speak for itself.It really is a shame because (almost) everything else is great. Aquaman's saving grace is its effects and set designs. Everything - except some questionable costumes - is extremely visually appealing and there is some wonderful imagery to be found. But the thing is, all of this beautiful shiny exterior is just serving as a means to distract you from a movie that refuses to even try to give you information in a creative way.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And you need to find your local theater that has the best IMAX system to watch this movie.I watched every single MCU movie within the opening weekend, and I never found such enthusiasm for DC movies, hence why I only watched Aquaman now almost a week later, the last comic book movie that made me feel this good after first time viewing was The Avengers, that was the moment I realized my beloved Marvel characters had finally come to life, Aquaman just gave me the same feelings for DC characters since The Dark Knight.10 years ago I watched Avatar in IMAX 3 times, sure the plotline wasn't anywhere near special, but it was visually groundbreaking, since then I never truly found a movie to be its worthy visual successor, and now, such a movie finally arrived.The third act of Aquaman is beyond anything I have ever seen, the battle scale makes Infinity War looks like playing house (Yes Im kinda salty about it, Endgame better up its game), I don't know what they did to the sound system, at one point I felt like the theater was about to take off, the ground was shaking like a leaf like I was sitting on top of a Dualshock controller, stuff like this reminds me why I love going to the theater so much: it completely immerses me into another world full of imaginations.Im going to watch it again the next Tuesday morning when nobody is in the theater, Ill sneak in some homebrew Latte and enjoy the movie all by myself.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

His directing style and talent are unparalleled in the horror genre.. but even a director as talented as Wan couldn't save this train wreck of a film.I could go on and on about everything wrong with this film, but that would literally take up the complete running time of the movie. So instead to save all readers and potential viewers the trouble I will include the aspects that were .. ok.The trench creatures!! Awesome !! Best scene of the movie visually, acted and directed!! (Don't worry, No spoilers here because this scene is in the trailers) this is the only scene where I felt James Wan's talent and horror flare showed through!! The creature design was incredible!!But aside from that one scene (literally 5 min of the entire movie) there was nothing that could save this disaster.Please, if you value your time or the time of others.. DO NOT go see this film!! Wait for the movie to go to Redbox and rent it for $1.75 so you can skip forward to the trench scene. Honestly $1.75 is a steep price to pay considering the trash you are about to wade through.. but hey, it's your time spent..

That it's generic, formulaic, predictable, but most critics neglect to mention what an entertaining and visually stunning spectacle this is. Granted it's got some cliche dialogue and some of the humor falls flat. Jason Momoa is a cool guy and very charismatic and despite his obvious departure from the comic book look, short blond hair and blue eyes, he's got the physical attributes to sell the part. Amber Heard is also a very interesting addition and she's got some of the coolest underwater superpowers from any of the characters in the movie and along with Michael Shannon's General Zod, we get one of the strongest villains in the new DCEU, Patrick Wilson's King Orm. Strong cast, very good CGI, but what really takes the cake here is the production and costume design. The level of detail and the obvious amount of work that was put into recreating every last detail of the underwater kingdoms, specially Atlantis, is breathtaking. 3D viewing of this movie is mandatory. If ever there was a movie for which this format was created, this is it. In short, a very entertaining and amazing looking film.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Wowwwww Aquaman was amazinggg. For a movie that's 60% underwater and 90% ""about life"" underwater, they did an amazing job creating a coming-to-light story for Aquaman and the depths of the other 70% of Earth. Highly mythical with echoes of Lord of the Rings (Game of Thrones?) and Polynesian culture, DC's Aquaman was an action-packed, breathtaking movie you have to see. You actually forget you're watching a superhero movie for a moment.
I admit I intially had doubts about the actor, but now I think he fits the role well for a modern version of Aquman: a brute persona with an amazing costume that's improved from the original. Plus, it's good to see an ethnic minority as a strong protagonist in 2018. I love you DC","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Pro:-nice visuals -some gags are funny -Momoa is pretty badass
Contra: -the story is terrible you can literally guess all the of it from the begining, that on it's own makes the 2,5 hours feel way longer -the music is terrible it breakes the atmosphere constantly and you find yourself wondering why would they choose that song instead of watching the film -they are still trying to sell a superhero universe mostly made for kids as a dark and realistic space, it gets more and more tryhard with every movie, I mean if you want to look at it with a realistic eye just think for a bit about the last big battle sceene....... -Also we just needed a ""random"" love interest for a guy like this totally made sense as the bigest cliche of a cliche collectiveWhat probably hurts the most is all the wasted potential, they should finally learn to roll with the story instead of trying to make the most realistic epic fairitale of a hero ever.......","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie had great visuals and the beginning introduction to the queen was good. Because of that I will give it a five. I am being kind to give this movie a five. The dialogue was horrible, the acting was really bad and the writing (script) was a mess! I am a DC fan and was very disappointed. They destroyed Aquaman. I grew up watching and reading about Aquaman and the sea creatures that was loyal to him. This movie didn't capture the relationship Aquaman had with the sea creatures. Instead they attempted to copy Star Wars with enemy soldiers and all of the special effects. If you want to see a movie with lots of special effects, ridiculous fight scenes, stupid costumes and poor actors then this movie is for you. By the way, Amber Heard cannot act! She was absolutely horrible.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Kidman and Heard were also fantastic whilst even Lundgren whilst unrecognisable puts in some of his better work. Wilson also performs his role superbly.

But unfortunately, for the dceu movies continually getting bombed at the theatres, question arises about the lack of a bold superhero within the hub of iconic gems. Hence jumping within the ultimate depths of ocean, we get a human-atlantean hybrid, son of the land & King of the seas, who became the saviour of the dc franchise.Coincidentally, I watched this film on a heavy rainy day. Thus, ironically the title bore it's significance. From the point of cinematography, it excelled all the previous dc superhero attempts or perhaps might be the followings also. Profound liveliness, good storyline & witty conversations added flavours to the movie. The film also overcame the stereotypes prevalent in the previous movies. The one star I'm rating less is due to the unfinished sequel they showed on the post credits.Finally, people complaining about the dc movies for being dark, must watch aquaman.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Spoiler free review.So. I'm going to gush over this movie... Pun intended.Where to start. Oh I know James wan is a directing and producing genius and the only man who could pull off the perfect aquaman movie.The cinematography for this movie is something I never expected. But had me in awe all the way through. With movement and camera pans and angles that my mouth open saying wow all the way through.A multi genre storyline that crosses from fantasy. Sci fi. Comedy action and suspenseful horror. Everything I was not expecting and surprised by.The story is a mix match of every Aquaman comics origins managed to make every single one connect and work coherently.The cast is perfect. Not a single actor is out of place and feels perfect for the role. I especially liked Patrick Wilson as Ocean master who gave it his all along side Jason mamoa.Special fx and CGI. So I'm always a stickler for CGI in movies but this time I can't say this. The put down in this movie is due to props . But only in the costume department. Where some of the costumes look like outcasts from late 90s power rangers although very aesthetically correct to the comic books. Some costumes look a little cheap and look slightly cosplayish.Music. Wow that music...... I SAID WOW.... THAT MUSIC. A great mix of genres once again that work within the circumstances of the scene TThey are put in to. With a mix of orchestral synthwave rock rap. This films score works on every level.To sum up this movie had me smiling all the way through. It is DCs best movie. Better than wonderwoman (And I love wonderwoman) Better than batman the dark Knight. Better than watchmen. Yes..Better than one of my favourite adaptations ever.....GO SEE THIS FILM 9/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Aquaman tries to remedy this by padding his performance with other well-known actors, but it's just not enough to fix this movie.The plot of the movie itself isn't terrible, but the script is filled with weak dialogue and most of the characters can't seem to use contractions, so that makes the dialogue seem very wooden and awkward.There are a few nods to the Aquaman from the comics and the old cartoons that fans will enjoy, but there are other parts of the movie (like a drum-playing giant octopus) that will make viewers scratch their heads.And of course DC still looks amateurish and cartoony when it comes to comparing their CGI to Marvel movies, not only in action sequences, but also when it comes to de-aging actors.Bottom line, take the kids to see it, but keep your expectations low.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

I didn't know that James wan could direct something like this. The direction is on another level! The action sequences are way to much awesome, well choreographed and the camera movement is just Incredible.
Even the first little fighting sequence has the kind of cinematography which I have never seen in any other superhero movie ever. James Wan is a wizard!
I'm sure warner brothers hired aliens to do the vfx for this movie because the animation is just so so so beautiful and unbelievable! Being a 3D generalist I know how much hard work is there behind making all these scenes possible and it just made me emotional after watching this movie.
Will watch it again next week.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The art direction in this film was absolutely mind blowing! The costumes, sets, locales, CGI, was unlike anything seen outside of Game of Thrones. This film was not only immensely epic in scope but it works on a dramatic level, which was something I often wondered about before arriving at the theater. It did not disappoint.This is why I read pulp fiction and love Superhero films. This is not Deadpool. It's deeply spiritual and emotional and most importantly, relatable. Lots of social commentary in this film regarding real world issues, having to do with the destruction of the environment and pollution of the planet. And even Arthur, as super as he is, is very relatable in this film, written as a rather reclusive, depressed, underachiever archetype that all people will relate too. The DC motto was regarding their heroes was always that it's not about DNA or blood, but what people do that makes them heroes and nothing more. Aquaman is the poster boy for the alien hybrid, or fallen angel, whose Earth blood balances out his alien blood, making him more suitable for the throne than full blooded Atlanteans, who are can be too ruthless at times.This is supposedly an origin film but I had wished for more flashbacks. Perhaps another ten minutes of young Arthur could have fleshed out his relationship with Vulko, who I absolutely loved. William Dafoe played an excellent, even headed mentor to young Arthur Curry. Fans of Aquaman will be very happy and fans of stories like King Arthur will absolutely adore the neo myth of the Aquaman universe!James Wan, I am officially a fan. I am not sure how this could be the same director as those horror films. If you love long take action scenes, beautiful wide angles, and action choreography then brace yourselves. So many films today feature chaotic action with no sense of wow factor. This film felt like a roller coaster ride that I wanted to jump back into immediately after it ended.I can't end this review without talking about the art direction again...it is Oscar worthy. This film was like one big Romanesque painting. The makeup, costumes, the design of the Atlantean ships and technology, all looked absolutely gorgeous and this film is clearly a product of passionate filmmaking. Of course, all of this is nothing without a good emotional story with characters you care about and it truly was a touching story. Some of the comedic stuff felt out of place but never ruined tension. It got better and better as it went on and the 3rd act was very tense! Aquaman was always my 2nd favorite superhero film and is no longer underrated thanks to James Wan, who did it!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Perhaps the Coolest DC superhero movie ever made!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4525280/?ref_=tt_urv","asifahsankhan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55828906/?ref_=tt_urv","21 December 2018","One of the most compelling aspects of Aquaman is the underwater superhero himself. While his initial casting was rather controversial, Jason Momoa absolutely nailed the role of Arthur Curry. Right off the bat, Momoa sold his performance to audiences as both a badass and charismatic character that everyone could root for. He had the perfect balance of snark that made Iron Man such an entertaining character and fervor that has made Batman such a big-screen spectacle. Even with these qualities, the future King of Atlantis was still a flawed protagonist. He wasn't a perfect character, which really only made him more compelling as the story went on.While the actual plot of the movie may have seemed incredibly familiar, being another one of the brothers fighting for the throne stories like Thor, Black Panther and The Lion King, it still did a decent job at making it stand out from the competition. While there were certainly familiar aspects that were similar to those other movies, like the duelling scenes in Black Panther, Aquaman still kept some originality in the matter in order to keep things unpredictable. Additionally, the movie did a great job of avoiding cop-out deaths in order to trigger emotional reactions from the audience, with all of the emotion in the movie developing from the story itself rather than from these cheap tricks that many superhero movies have ridden on recently.The absolute best feature of Aquaman, however, had to be its visuals. Whether the scenes took place underwater in Atlantis or in a city in Italy, nearly every shot of James Wan's was absolutely breathtaking. While previous DC movies like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice had clever framing, the shots didn't really stand out like the shots in Aquaman. The main difference that made this DC adventure stand far above Batman v. Superman was the color pallete. Previous DC movies attempted to have darker visuals with a desaturated look, whereas Wan and his team pushed the limits of color throughout the movie's entire duration. Its color and visual effects were even better than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which broke records with the amount of visual effects put into it.All things considered, Aquaman is a huge win for DC and Warner Bros. Pictures. Its narrative is compelling, the protagonist is well developed, and it's just a whole lot of fun to watch from beginning to end. This is definitely a movie that you will not want to miss in theaters, as the big screen is truly the best way to experience the visually stunning look that this brings to the table. At the end of the day, Aquaman may just be the best DC movie we have seen in years, possibly even better than last year's Wonder Woman. Hopefully this fantastic storytelling becomes a pattern for DC movies going forward.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

BUT I really disappointed.It's so far than I expected. I expected to watch a wonderful and unforgettable movie that can touch my heart and with great storyline and great action before my eyes. And I DID NOT get them all.No chemistry between characters. No plot twisted. Even the scene when Mera is saved by one of Trench and after that, didn't surprise me (I am sure you will understand what I mean).With the similar storyline, Black Panther did it much better. So If you still have a plan to watch this Aquaman, just watch but do not expect so much, ignore the current rating, or you will be disappointed.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

Watched it on IMAX 3D, and I couldn't ask for more. The movie is fresh and unique, not like most of the superhero movie that has a same formula and tone. Every scene of this movie took my attention.
The characters are well-casted and each have a background story. The plot is solid. The visual is STUNNING. The music is really great (Skylar Grey is so talented yet underrated!)It's been a week and I still can remember the scene and details because it was remarkable.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

After I went out of cinema I was really wondering, if perhaps WB were intentionally trolling themselves with previous productions to make everyone thinking, that DCEU sucks, only to make the biggest comeback ever? Im no longer pesimistic about next movies from this franchise. Im really convinced that there will not be any crappy movie after they achieved so much for a character that is not the biggest Icon in DC Universe.
And they did that in the Best possible moment, cause upcomming Captain Marvel will be sour SJW trash and if Shazzam will keep the level of Aquaman (Im trully convinced that it will) DC will catch up a lot from the distance to MCU. And this is possibly the best news for fans of comic books like myself.
Well done WB&DC! You cought your opponent of guard and served him very mean left swing.
P.S. The line that Jason Mamoa spoke in conversation with sea monster is the Best line I heard in superhero movies ever and I dont recall even one MCU production with a line that good. Those who saw the movie Im sure will agree. Those who didnt, I envy you emotions when you will witness the moment.
The movie isnt perfect, but its actually very close to be considered as such and one of the Best comic book inspired movies ever.

Every cliche in the book is employed, and how the actors kept a straight face while delivering some of these lines is astonishing.

Now to make it even worse, the now infamous Amber Heard is playing Mera which is painful to watch for more than one reason.

If a nerd ate Star Wars, Jurassic park, how to train your dragon, and the little mermaid, then pooped it out you would have aquaman. Actually that would probably make a better movie then this. I don't even know how people say they like the ""special effects""... I expected better than this. Wonder Woman was the last good movie they will ever make. Poor poor Jason, he did the best he could with what he had to work with. They basically explained everything you ever wanted to know in a single conversation, the movie was paced terribly you talk to someone for five seconds then boom something explodes. My favorite part is when this Italian guy who is struggling to get up after he is crushed by a building gets saved by aquaman, then the man just walks away completely unaffected. Or maybe the part where aquaman freaks out while dangling from the edge of a small building, after he literally just jumped out of an airplane. Speaking of Italy I lived there for three years and the scene in Sicily looks absolutely nothing like Italy. But I mean if you've lived in one town in America your whole life, stereotypically think that all Italians have Pinocchio books lying around, and can sit for almost three hours without using your brain which can obviously see that every scene looks painfully over rehearsed, and don't care that the main villain calls himself ""the ocean master"" you might actually like this movie. I'll give them this if it was anymore edited/animated it would make a great Barbie movie.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I will consider this to be the best DC movie beating out Wonder Woman. The character Aquaman seems like a cheesy character to even be adapted onto the big screen. With Jason Momoa performance as the character. He makes the character bada** and even when he achieves his golden outfit.The plot is a great adventure story. It was not rushed nor overstuffed with sub plots. It follows Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) the queen of Atlantis being rescued by a lighthouse keeper Thomas (Temuera Morrison). They both fall in love with each other and have a son named Arthur (Jason Momoa) who will soon become Aquaman. As decades fly by, Aquaman is found by Mera (Amber Heard) who informs him that his step brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is trying to wage war against the surface people. And he is trying to unite the seven kingdoms underwater to create havoc to the surface people. With Mera and Nuidis (Willem Dafoe) help and needing to find the true trident of Atlantis in order for Aquaman to claim his rightful place in the throne. He will fight against Orm's army and hired pirates led by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II).The plot delivered an epic scale adventure. Aquaman travelling to Atlantis that looked like a beautiful colorful city underwater. Was more astonishing than the Avatar film. The action sequences are big and well directed. There is a lot of action throughout. Aquaman fighting against pirates in a submarine. From the epic lifting the sub out of the water. The fight scene with Atlanna fighting against Atlantis soldiers in the opening scene with one long camera take was well choreographed. James Wan direction of having the camera rotate around the action sequences worked so well. He is known for his small budget horror movies like Saw and Insidious. His action style from Furious Seven and this film was just awesome. He delivered a great underwater chase scene that almost felt like Tron Legacy with the beautiful lighting vehicles and Atlantis lighting. And the chase scene in Italy when Aquaman and Mera are facing against Black Manta and his soldiers was thrilling. The climax battle sequence is breathtaking. With Aquaman and Orm/ Ocean Master fighting each other was the best choreographed fight scene with the cinematography work.The visual effects are breathtaking when the action is underwater or on land. It was great on an epic scale. The cinematography work was well done that captured the action and choreography. The music score Rupert Gregon-Williams was great. And had a good score that made the movie feel like an adventure. Also, the soundtrack with a few songs in it was great and fun. Jason Momoa was great. Amber Heard is beautiful and great as Mera. Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Nicole Kidman were all great with their characters. James Wan's direction was brilliant with making an adventure story and epic action.Overall, Aquaman is a great film. I say it is the best DC movie out there. I definitely recommend seeing this in the big screen in theatres. If you are looking for an adventure story and exciting epic action sequences with beautiful stunning visual effects. This is the film worth seeing.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Based on the other films so far you try to keep an open mind because this time it might be different.
Ultimately, the movie gets bogged down in far too much distracting CGI, including Hollywood's penchant for making its stars look younger in flashback segments. Particular CGI and effects that bothered me were the shimmer to make it look like they were underwater and a filter on their voices to make it sound like talking with a mouth full of water.
At times this film felt like a cross between National Treasure and the Sword in the Stone while Jason Momoa's Aquaman stumbles around with a brah attitude.
I thought this film had the potential to break away from the earlier DC movies, be a bit different and set its own bar but it has ended up another longwinded disappointing chapter in the DC franchise.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Let me explain why....
The CGI looks good and someone thought it would be a good ideea to have a 360¬∞ view of every CGI place, so expect to be show a view of every location for now real reason... its just there so they can show off....no other reason. Secondly every woman in this movie is extraordinary clean and all the shoots focus on there hair....is like a Palmolive comercial.....I don't think they shoot on location at all.2.Now on with the plot:
The trailer shows every thing....
The story is very poor and predictible and the dialog is extremly bad.
The actors had nothing to work with.
You will see any plot twist comming from a mile away.
They try some jokes, but they don't land. Most people sitting in the cinema were watching at the time....because it was too boring.3.The music is bland end epic....every scene is treated with the same importance so the music is Epic all the time....Awsome right? Wrong....Just dont see it. I will be skiping DC movies from now on...","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Never thought I'd enjoy an Aquaman film adaptation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4602964/?ref_=tt_urv","Aaron1375","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1111192/?ref_=tt_urv","24 January 2019","I am in the minority when it comes to the DC films in that I have enjoyed them all. I thought Man of Steel was an awesome Superman film, Batman versus Superman wasn't great, but the last portion of the film was good, Suicide Squad was pretty cool and Wonder Woman, well people liked that one. I even thought Justice League was good and was baffled that it had a disappointing box office take as it was so much better than Batman versus Superman. This one I was not sure of, because I just thought it would be difficult to make an interesting movie using only Aquaman. I was wrong and was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.The story has Aquaman coming out into the forefront as he takes out some pirates after we are introduced to Arthur's mother and his dad and how they met. He leaves a pirate father/son duo to die as they had been killing indiscriminately; however, this would later turn out to be a mistake as son wants revenge on Aquaman. Aquaman, meanwhile, must go back to his kingdom of Atlantis as his brother tries to start a war with those of us who reside on land. Arthur/Aquaman must try and reclaim his throne and prevent this war his brother so desperately wants and also deal with a new enemy, the Black Manta!One of the reasons I enjoyed this one was the cast who did a very good job. It was nice seeing Dolph Lundgren in a big movie for a change rather than the direct to DVD stuff he usually does these days. Jason Momoa is really good as Aquaman and is one of the main reasons I think this one worked as he is very charismatic as the hero in this one. My favorite though was the Black Manta as they had the costume down pat! He looked completely awesome and the fight between him and Aquaman was the highlight of this movie for me!So, overall, a very fun action movie and surprisingly so for me. I think the DC films are rather good, though I still favor the Marvel film universe more. I have always enjoyed Marvel more in the comics too as I find their heroes more relatable and less overpowered than those of DC, but I like the DC characters too. I am looking forward to Shazaam as well as that one looks fun too. Sorry, but comic book films should be fun and not all dark and serious...unless we are talking Spawn of course.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first opening scene was promising and well directed but the rest of the movie fell flat with cringe moments, noticeably bad CGI, terrible jokes, silly jump scares and pacing issues. James wann the director is very good don't get me wrong but he was either not 100% sure on what he was doing here or the studio was pulling strings most of the time. The movie has all the typical cliches which usually I let pass but these ones you could see coming from a mile away and just make you sigh.The actors aren't bad but the script they are given here is awful, some of the lines are so bad they look improvised at the last second. The scene in the desert is a great example of this, every line sounds like it was written by a 10 year old with a bad sense of humour.The good points here are that the villains have motivations which are clear but mostly cliche, the actions scenes are quite badass especially the submarine scene but that's where it ends.Overall I think this movie should have been short and sweet making us want more, instead I never want to see another solo aquaman movie. The post credit scene is pointless and sparks no emotion or excitement for any future instalments.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I have to admit it that Wan is very talented. He know how to use elements to attract audiences. Nicole's 45s long camera fighting scene, thriller elements, hero moment, fantastic camera, and highly restored comic character settings which can attract comic fans, but a good movie need to use these elements to tell the story right, to decorate the movie in stead of steal the story's thunder. The film originally had a very clear main line, but it was influenced by the cumbersome elements of the story. Especially, those hero moment. The film is about the growth of Aquaman, so there should be only one real hero moment, that is, when he gets the king's trident. However, this Aquaman seems to be posing from beginning to end, but the real hero time is inferior, because by then the audience has been tired of watching him pose.","7 out of 22 found this helpful.

STUNNING, BRILLIANT, STAGGERING, FLAWLESS, MARVELLOUS, THRILLING, SUPER, SUPERB, GENIUS, MAGNIFICENT, FANTASTIC, INVENTIVE, EXCITING, UNMISSABLE, WONDERFUL, JOYOUS. As you can obviously tell I kinda liked this Fantasy Superhero Sci Fi movie a bit.
Yes it's great going to my weekly CINEMA FIX and coming out feeling happy and fulfilled, many times of which are rare these days, especially with the well over 50 Flicks I see YEARLY in CINEWORLD. From the very beginning till the end I was glued to those OUT OF THIS WORLD FX. I said to my pal Tam "" How the hell do they do it "", well actually I kinda know the effects are created using back engineering from the crashed UFO in ROSSWELL in 1947. ONLY KIDDIN, a great hand to all envolved in creating those mind blowing FX.
At many times throughout the film ,I was reminded of many moments from and including great films I grew up watching, namely that romantic boxing from IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT 1934 with Claudette Colbert & Clark Gable, Sean Connery's wittly comedic one liners from the 60's BOND movies and all those exciting moments from Indiana Jones.
I like to think of myself as a wannnabee casting agent and after seeing the brilliant inventive SAW 2004 I knew there and then we had a maestro of a movie maker by the name of JAMES WAN on our hands. More from this Terrific Director please. I loved everything about this movie, the wonderful narrative, powerhouse acting, FX, and so on. It was also nice seeing the New Zealand actor Temura Morrison who you may or not remember gave a powerhouse performance in ONCE WERE WARRIORS 1994. Patrick Wilson who was in the unsettling Superb movie LITTLE CHILDREN 2006 and HARD CANDY 2005, more than most plays the charismatic good guy, so it's interesting seeing playing the Not So Bad Guy. I wasn't that keen on WODERWOMAN which I thought was kinda boring and a little dissapointing , AQUAMAN on the other hand didn't disappoint it was a PURE BLAST!","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

It give a very beautiful view of the ocean and their creatures.Second, this movie is full of ACTION SCENES and their cinematography is also good. But i think they focuses so much on the action scenes instead of story.Third, as i said, the CAMERA WORK/CINEMATOGRAPHY works nicely.Fourth, the COMEDY part of the movie is average. They try hard to make people laugh, and it works sometimes.Fifth, unlike other DCEU movie, it is not twisty and confusing. The movie gives clear EXPLANATION of everything.Negatives :-First, the STORY is so simple. It is like all other superhero movies, and doesn't give any unique thing.Second, they showed the Aquaman so powerful. This is the problem of other DC superheroes as well. The movie makes them OVERPOWEREDThird, they EXAGGERATED the technology of atlantians without giving a suitable explanation. Like they develop a weapon which can destroy so many things, runs on water and don't spread pollution at all.Fourth, the FICTION part of the movie is done so bad. For example, they show that the earth core have a hidden mystical place where dinosaurs still exists.Fifth, the CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is missing, even it is origin movie for a new character. I mean, i supposed that they plot the Aquaman in DCEU with some back story with the help of this movie, but the character development is not so satisfying.Sixth, while watching the movie, i got a little CHILDISH FEELING, i mean i felt like that this movie is for children. The dark tone of the DCEU, which it is famous for, is missing from this movie.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

understatement. No matter what realm or studio these heroes come from, people are lining up to see every movie starring a supernatural hero, DC Universe (DCU) has been riding this wave for some time and while they may have fallen off a little bit here with their newest movie Aquaman, there are still a lot of things to hang in there for.
The film starts off by introducing two characters through Arthur/Aquaman's (Jason Moana) narration, his father, Tom Curry (Temeura Morrison) and his mother, Queen Atlanta (Nicole Kidman) and how their meeting and falling in love and ultimately more important the child they had were never supposed to be. Then after a few years have passed Queen Atlanta's old life catches up to her as she was part of an arranged marriage in Atlantis so in order to protect her family she must return to fulfill her part in the marriage. After this, the movie zips ahead 20 years and viewers can see that Arthur has grown up to be a mammoth of a man who possess special powers thanks to his mother's genetics and we quickly and violently learn that he is using these powers to help those in need.
The dialogue was lacking and in spots, the humor was rather dry and short-lived, the poor script causes there to be moments where something seems to be lost from the scene because of how it seems the words are just thrown in. It seems the scriptwriters tried to be funny in situations that called for something serious or smooth and this leads to a choppy sounding dialogue that leaves viewers wondering if the scriptwriters didn't read things over before they submitted it. An example of this is when Arthur dramatically breaks his way into a submarine then gives a sheepish grin and says, ""Permission to come aboard?"" The screenwriters couldn't have come up with a less original quote, causing everyone to shake their heads as there is nothing more predictable that could have been said and yet they kept it. Also, there is a major lacking of back story for Black Manta, he plays a major role in the film and yet we know next to nothing about his past. This leaves Manta to be a shallow husk of a potentially wonderful character and gives the viewers almost no reason to even like him let alone cheer for him.
With over five different studios working on the CGI for this film, it's not surprising the filmmakers were able to pull off the realistic water effects and seemingly-accurate battle scenes. The way that they made the fight scenes not only look very real but also had to work with transitioning from land to water shots quickly and there was no scene disruption which allowed the viewers to stay focused on the movie. The CGI in this movie is comparable if not better then almost any other action movie out today, some examples could be Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Justice League, and with all of these, advanced CGI is utilized to create an almost undeniable reality.
Something that really stood out to me even as I cringed through the dialogue was how the movie used its audio. I really enjoyed how they used not only songs during action pieces or peaceful pans over beautiful scenery but just the simple non-diegetic music that helps to deepen the moment. Looking back now I can count more than a few times where I got goosebumps leading up to or in a scene because of the audio.
After diving into the underwater world of Aquaman viewers can see that though there were some rough patches, overall this movie was rather smooth sailing. When you look at the animation combined with the audio you get one great movie and though the dialogue can be rough I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun and beautiful looking action movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

DC apparently likes to take one step forward and two back with their films. Aquaman is unfunny when it attempts at humour, its dull when it tries to be exciting and rather confusing in general.I would particularly like to understand more about Atlantis. How does that work? Is it just a massive underwater authoritarian state with a mad, misguided king? Why exactly is he so obsessed with waging war? Why do some people can breathe air? Are they two species? Why exactly is his fianc√© looking for Aquaman? Actually, why was Aquaman's mum on the surface in the first place?There are no answers here, just a bunch of crazy ideas tossed at the viewer with the promise we will understand everything eventually, and it never delivers those answers. Characters are shallow, unmotivated and just.. kind of.. there.Come to think of it, Aquaman is an absurd character anyway. Perhaps that's why no one made a film with him before. If he is not surrounded by water and all the creatures living in it, his only assets are being really strong and really resistant, which are his only super powers. In which case.. probably Wonder Woman and Superman would be best suited to do whatever has to be done. At least Wonder Woman can make people speak the truth and bounce bullets back. What can Aquaman do besides hit people with his trident and wrestle bad guys? Well, the film doesn't tell.Oh, the CGI is good. And there are some nice jokes and action sequences, so I rate it 3 out of 10. I wouldn't bother paying to see it, but it is worth a glimpse on the telly or some streaming service when it's available, if you like DC heroes, that is.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

In this sea of the comic book heroes it's getting tough to do something different. So I guess that crazy idea got abandoned. The lead, Mamoa, delivers his lines fluidly. He perfectly personifies the smarmy, slightly vulnerable, affable, wise cracking, confident, charismatic ... and somehow critically, not arrogant, character. That's hard to do.
Willem, the foe, of immorality spits out evil faster than a Goblin shark. Dolphen Lundgren plays the wise, yet stable voice of reason to the goofy bad Prince (Patrick Wilson) I think Nicole Kidman thought she was in Benjamin Button (wth?)
In terms of plot and story line... it was Marvelous. There was a misunderstood, much more fit, kind, outcast of a prince with great morals who was trying to return to a kingdom left behind by a missing or deceased parent. And it's not like the body building demi-god like, much more charismatic brother character was looking for an almighty hammer. He was looking for a trident. Not even close. They're different shapes. And it's not like the bad power mongering cruel, impossible to like and moreover, easy to hate, sibling of a brother, turned around emotionally and became a good guy. The writers however did great with the thin plot given. They cleverly used hydrology to create some cool water related concepts, such as unique weaponry. There were some interesting original concepts in here that I won't spoil . The CGI was awesome. The only blurring was on the lines of reality. As they would say in Akronym Ohio... IMHO3DIMAX is the only way to see this movie. (ya I know;) It shows up great in this format and really accentuates the production effort","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Part of it is about Arthur's birth and childhood and then about him finding out he is the prince of Atlantis and then becoming Aquaman. The haters say he is a mindless thug, ignoring the fact that he can speak Japanese and has an in-depth knowledge of the history of the Roman Empire. He did not grow up in Atlantis so when he arrives there is a lot he doesn't know, because it's like him traveling to a country he has never been before. His female companion is as much as a historian as she is a guide, because again he didn't grow up in Atlantis he doesn't know the legends and laws. Despite what the haters say the movie is less of a social commentary about polluting the oceans as it is about racism. Which is evident by the comments about him coming from many.It really is a story about forging your own destiny while staying true to your heritage and ignoring what the negative people, it shows being a hero is about more than superhuman powers.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

With a very enjoyable Man of Steel setting a tone that would be completely overdone by the time Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice hit theatres, it was only a matter of time before they decided to change it up. Suicide Squad was financially successful, but admittedly a step in the wrong direction. Justice League was a mess of a movie, but the saving grace of the franchise will always be known as Wonder Woman. Loved by critics and fans across the globe, DC and Warner Brothers decided to steer the ship in a new direction, taking a step into the past and creating origin stories for the characters we've only briefly seen. It worked with Wonder Woman, and I'm happy to say that I believe it's also working with Aquaman.Being very, very loosely tied to the previous films (almost not at all), Aquaman sees Arthur Curry go from an infant to a full-grown man. Being a half-breed from both land in our world and the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, he comes to the realization that he's the rightful heir to the throne. Challenged by his only brother who despises his existence, this creates tension amongst the people. With some very likable side characters and others who will more than likely have repercussions in future installments, there's a lot to like about this film in terms of character and story, which is what I was expecting to find lacking.Jason Momoa once again demands the audience's attention as he completely invests himself in this wacky character. His charisma is easily one of the highlights of this film and his many journeys with Amber Heard's Mera are a blast to watch. This is a film filled with tons of adventure and I was on the edge of my seat throughout a lot of it. It's visually stunning (for the most part) and I found that made it the biggest looking film of the franchise in terms of scope. Although it does borrow from pretty much every movie you've ever seen, it mixes in enough new content to differentiate itself from others.As it seems from my review, I had a blast watching Aquaman, but it's by no means a perfect movie, even by the standards set by this franchise. Patrick Wilson plays King Orm, Arthur's younger brother and although his motivations are clear, his portrayal is quite over-the-top. I personally took issue with this, as he's in quite a bit of the film. The disposable villains of this film actually have quite a bit of depth and backstory but are highly under-utilized. I felt like they were part of a set-up for something bigger in the future. Without ruining it, the scenes where these characters are used are very well-done, so it's a very minor flaw in my opinion. There are many small issues I have with the movie as a whole, but in retrospect, they're all nitpicks.In the end, Aquaman embraces the fact that the premise of an underwater city is ridiculous and runs with that from beginning to end. From giant sea battles to genuine heart-to-heart moments between characters that stood out to me, this is a film that has every I like about good blockbusters. While it's not one of the best superhero films I've ever seen, it's a joy to watch and easily in the discussion for as one of the best movies of this franchise. If you're a fan of comic-based films, I'd definitely suggest giving this one a shot.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are some pacing issues and some scenes just don't fit in the grand scheme of the move but it is very entertaining still! The visuals are stunning and colorful and great cinematography as well, really adds to the atmosphere of darkness and vastness of the oceans. Don't get me wrong the movie has its weak points and Aquaman is a difficult character to portray on the big screen but I believe James Wan has made a solid entry to the Dc Universe. With that being said this movie is not for everyone and some people just wont get it.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is no shortage of stunning visuals or graphics here. ""Aquaman"" is as epic as they come - the quest for a king becomes the story of a hero. This one delivers the goods.Every hero has to come from somewhere ... Aquaman's story begins with his parents. A lighthouse keeper and a Queen from the ocean. A love that should've never happened, but was destined to be. When soldiers are sent from Atlantis to bring home the Queen, she goes back to save and protect her husband and son. Years pass by, and Aquaman is doing his part to watch over the waters and the crimes committed within - but when a beautiful stranger appears to him one night asking him to come back and claim the throne that is rightfully his, he balks at the idea. Him? A half-breed? And his mother dead? However, when a display of power comes from the depths of the ocean, he knows what he must do.At first, I was skeptical heading into this one. It was nothing like what I expected. Then I realized, that I really didn't know what to expect. So, I guess it would be more accurate to say that it was better than what I expected. Usually when you have such striking visuals and CG work, it detracts from the overall story. Not so here. It actually adds to it. Jason Momoa really handles himself well in this role. He is completely believable and does a fine job of acting - not just a brute force, but showed appropriate emotion as well.I highly recommend this film for action and superhero enthusiasts. Be prepared to be blown away by an explosive film that is high on eye candy - with a good story to match. One of my favorites of the year.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's an overlong slog that has a terrible narrative, unbelievable CGI, average performances, and an awful exposition-filled screenplay. The film just gets worse as it progresses, and I had completely lost interest by around the half-way point. There is one good action sequence near the middle of the movie that is actually rather entertaining, and that is probably due to the fact that it uses real stunt-people and fight choreography as opposed to the awkward CGI body doubles that are used in 75% of the action set-pieces. The problem with these is that, since we don't care for any of the characters at all, it is easy to notice that CG has taken over. If we were invested in the narrative and were bothered by the film's stakes, then the CG replacement would probably be less of a problem. Talking about character, some of our hero's decisions are completely unbelievable and make him a totally unlikeable character. The film does use some good scene transitions sometimes, but that's hardly enough to save the picture. The worst thing about it, however, is that it's simply not fun. It could have at least been entertaining, and I could have even excused the bad narrative and dialogue if I was having some kind of fun. Yet, I was bored throughout most of it and was never invested within the story. It's the worst superhero film of the year, and one of the year's worst films full stop. 4/10","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Or just go with an open mind not looking to critic it.This is a really good movie...I watched it on IMAX 3D ,it got a standing ovation,I decided to try 2D to see.I even enjoyed it more.
It tells a story of global warming .
A regular guy standing up to Greatness.
It tells a story of love .I loved that the jokes weren't too much and at times ,you could feel Arthur's pain of being alone.
James Wan did an amazing Job and I loved the Peter Jackson's adventure film style usedTo me ,this is up there with Batman Begins , I also prefer it to Wonder Woman by a land mile.Overall I'd give it a very good 8+Remembering that 10 means perfect and 9 cos I wanted to see more tragedy and death.
and yes..!
Jason Momoa is Aquaman/Arthur Curry!
Amber Heard is Mera and a lovely side kick.That last kiss was one to watch for again","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So, now you know this is a must watch.The storyline is pretty much a copy/paste from the animated world. So much is predictable. The CGI is pretty good (the designer might have got lazy here and there). I was blown away at how they managed to do a few things (won't say, it's a spoiler) and fit it so well in the storyline.Jason Momoa This huge beast is the best thing there is in the movie. The underwater CGI version of him is 8/10. Amber Heard'' did a pretty good come back.DC has pretty good characters but screenplay-writers, not all are great. It is clearly visible that the pressure from Marvel has made them rush. This did not end well for rank 3 and 5. WonderWoman and Aquaman are the key reason why DC is still afloat. Maybe, this says, DC should have done what Marvel did, story out each character and then fit them like Avengers. Justice League is this case.Peace Out!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Epic, mythological CGI mega-spectacle blending ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" with ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" one for the ages","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4736930/?ref_=tt_urv","FelipeCarrillo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61617922/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2019","""Aquaman"" is a stunning miracle; the most visually oddball and mesmerizing big-budget superhero film the world has ever seen. Do not misunderstand me, the Arthur Curry solo film is far from perfect, it presents an origin, born-to-be-king story, rhythmically goes from dynamite to languor and storytelling-wise is whimsical and silly dealing with Greek mythology, but that bravery and audacity, coming from a huge budget and an amazing source material, are what makes it an experience as dangerously unconventional as imperfectly extraordinary.It's no secret that the DC Extended Universe went from bad to worse within American comic book film landscape; diabolically histrionic, unnecessarily drawn-out, fiercely dark, overly serious; whatever the dilemma may be, Walter Hamada, the new president of DC-based film production after legends Geoff Johns and Jon Berg stepped down in early 2018, had to move quickly and wisely his cards after ""Justice League""'s inglorious financial outcome and poorly critics' response.An angel from heaven, ""Wonder Woman"" opened at the very right time - #MeToo and #Time's Up, - displayed a powerful war tale of exquisite female empowerment aided by Patty Jenkins' unflinching direction, introduced the only superheroine portrayed on the big screen so far through Gal Gadot' astonishing performance and let free a fictional universe as feminist and uplifting as promising with a few drops of fish-out-of-water humor that put the subsidiary of Warner in competition again. Clearing their minds and knowing what to do and what not to do as for the kind of movie audiences want to see, they left a bunch of projects behind, rewrote some scripts and gave the go-ahead to ideas discussed for a very long time. Among the category of polished and slightly modified scripts, with special emphasis on comedy, was its latest, most risky and pleasant Hollywood chaos.If ""Wonder Woman"" was somewhat like a Spider-Man for DC, Arthur Curry would oddly be a colorful hybrid with DNA from Tony Stark, Thor and Star-Lord. The King of the Seven Seas has chances to become the most outstanding, fascinating and exotic superhero of the whole combo out there. Momoa gives his role a dominant macho vibe and look, as well as silliness and sarcastic humor that provide much of the funny and not-so-funny jokes spread throughout the feature film. His acting range and rancidity in each of his scenes are the reason why he's so special, so unique, so emotionally relatable and flat-out politically correct.Bigger-sized muscles, two antagonists, responsibility, legacy, kingship, splendid chases, and hand-to-hand combats, we've seen this before, haven't we? - cough, ""Black Panther,"" cough. - But as Ryan Coogler diligently proposed to make a stand against racism, politics, Hollywood's diversity and some other highly important social matters, Wan loosens up and never takes the material too seriously; it's simple: a silly, funny, over-the-top fantasy actioner with two specific purposes on its mind: a message of solving your problems peacefully and an act of redemption for DC; its fuzzy proceedings are what makes it so enjoyable, so strangely magnetic and carefreely brilliant.
""Aquaman"" is a bona fide rara avis, and one of the big ones. Auteurs entrusted with a nine-digit budget to make an original screenplay a reality- Mr. Christopher Nolan - can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Fewer filmmakers get such whopping sums of money to pull off a bizarre comic book adaptation, which is under the eye of a whole company; judgments, visions and worldwide expectations included. After a hurtful slate of bad decisions and critical misfires, DC changed its mind and left its unexpectedly successful billion-dollar baby to one of the most qualified, professional and creative artists working today in the industry.James Wan is a filmmaker for the ages. Visionary, maestro of horror and action, creator and owner of the most profitable, breathtaking and poignant entry in ""Fast & Furious"" franchise yet and king of mainstream contemporary horror at the expense of his 2013 vintage masterpiece/hit, a billion-dollar IP from which spin-offs, prequels, and sequels emanate. These endless victories are the reason why the Malay is now Warner's spoiled child, which was more than enough to entrust him one of the riskiest, most crucial projects for the future of DC.His kinetic and idiosyncratic style for action is high and low from stem to stern. Fight sequences are provocative, diligent, straight out of the wildest video game. The filmmaker also finds time to experiment and toy with settings, nearly masterful camera movements and angles, with explosive 90/180-degree rotations he previously tested in the Hobbs vs Shaw hand-to-hand combat in ""Furious 7"" and then F. Gary Gray in the prison escape in ""The Fate of the Furious."" The camera savagely runs at the audience, endowing dynamism and thrill in large part by the uber-excellent technical, artful features of a couple of incredibly and masterfully executed sequences that might be easily part of the annals of this postmodern genre.Despite CG-overstuffed, even in scenes perfectly filmable in real locations, the film does not limit its creative faculties. We all agree that CGI is everywhere and at all times, which might constantly divert attention from the flick's narrative purpose. Its aesthetics and visual fearlessness, however, make pictures an alluring spectacle propelled by truly great VFX. So far, far away from the gigantic old-fashioned set-pieces of modern Hollywood masterpieces as ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout,"" and yet the film's an artificial delight. By taking place mostly underwater, it was to be expected that even with the enthusiasm and commitment of the crew, it needed to be conceived or at least rendered digitally. Wan and his team created an entirely unique aquatic world for us, certainly embellished by Don Burgess, which is over-the-top, dazzling and exciting, absorbent and carefully designed, is pure visual ecstasy crowded with creatures, altered animals, Atlantic beasts and, why not, an octopus playing the drums. There is time for natural, majestic landscapes as well, such as a beautiful Italian village, the stunning Sahara desert or the claustrophobic Trench. Portraying the fantasy-tinged Greek mythology from the comics sounds heavy, but it pulls it off fabulously with inventiveness and audacity unusual in big-budget cinema. In the end, it's appreciated that this extremely gorgeous world, harmonized by the high-sounding techno-compositions of an unbeatable Rupert Gregson-Williams, is not only a reflection of the cinema of our time, but a reminder of the magnificence sound and image can achieve.Kidman nails it as Atlanna, a kind of character not entirely foreign to her if you take a look at the prolific career of the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" actress. After the ten-minute prologue and a surprise appearance amid the story, she does have no time on screen. Still and all, her interpretative balance between fish-out-of-water humor and family drama puts her in a strange yet brilliant position; a golden gift for the genre. Played by Amber Heard, Mera's design is literally and figuratively sparkling; she's the one who leads a couple of commendable sequences that breathe #MeToo. Willem Dafoe as Vulko embraces ambiguity, having fun in a simple, smaller role that doesn't seem to agree with his previous efforts, especially keeping in mind that after the eccentric characters he delivered to the genre, the actor has focused on more serious, raw roles in outstanding dramas by Sean Baker and Julian Schnabel. Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, King Orm and Manta respectively, wrongly take turns for being the bad guy. It's hard to tell who and where is the real villain here, whether in the ambition of the former or the anger-driven vengeance of the latter. They both try their best, but the material does not help them at all.""Aquaman"" by horror mastermind James Wan is a cinematic oddity; it has an irregular pace, speaks louder than it should, ergo runs longer than it should, but even so, Arthur Curry's first solo adventure is the most playful, hilarious, rewarding and profitable comic book adaptation you will find in the troubled DC Cinematic Universe to date. Even if my voice is shaking, I dare say it is the most eye-catching, wildly stunning sci-fi show I have seen into a big-impact Hollywood production since James Cameron's ""Avatar,"" visually speaking. To make your life easier, ""Aquaman"" could be synthesized like this: ""Black Panther"" and ""Star Wars"" meet ""Avatar"" and ""Jupiter Ascending,"" and these, in turn, bump into ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" energized by a kinetic video game vibe and an unhealthy dose of toxic masculinity and sheer spectacle.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I've heard several times in the last few years that the character of Aquaman from the past was lame. I realize maybe I'm not the average audience member because I liked him a lot in the animated Justice League of my 70's childhood. And my youngest who strongly preferred ""bearded aquaman"" and I both agreed that this was an excellent updated Aquaman and both thought this would work for very nearly any type of audience.The movie making ensemble that made this fab show did far better than many superhero movies do in not frustrating or confusing people who actually like comic books or previous screen interpretations. It showed just what's so great in comic books which we refer to in our house as the Moments. This had good writing, acting, directing, editing, etc. There were grand visuals. And the whole thing just swung along from one great moment to another with good (and sometimes awe inspiring) transitions.And here's my own odd bit: I have a weird quirk where even though I like certain types of action movies in recent years I tend to accidentally tune out fight scenes. It's truly not intentional but its sometimes so thorough that I miss something just after a fight that mattered. I guess they often bore me and often seem to me to have pretty ridiculously poor choices in how they are filmed. But I actually didn't have that problem in this movie. My family would say that was a Very positive commentary on the movie.It's not that there are no criticisms that could be made by those who seriously enjoy critiquing but from my point of view, just wanting movies to entertain me and this movie reaching a very high level of entertainment value, it just isn't worthwhile to do anything other than to focus on the positive.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie has very good scenes, lot's of surprisingly good underwater battle scenes. Great action, great choreography, wonderful sets, terrific battles all of the best!!!! We see how a character emerged and how he was a hero, so i think story of this movie is perfect and amazing. There are action, adventure, comedy, incredible visuals, great soundtrack, emotion in this movie. Character's explainations is done in a perfect way. DC did a amazing job with this movie and showed that there is more great movies to come. You can feel the emotion of all the characters and the villains in this movie are so passionate that you really are rooting for them just as much as the hero himself. It's an outstanding movie loved it must watch!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is certainly one of the better DCEU movies in recent years, as it isn't as ridiculous as BVS and it isn't a broken dumpster fire like Suicide Squad, but at the same time, if the best DC has managed to do in recent years is this and Wonder Woman, which was only decent, then I don't think this cinematic universe thing is gonna take off. I get that quite a few people like this movie and in the end that's fine, but this movie made me incredibly bored by the half way point.

I love visuals and CGI, and I'd even compare them to that of Avatar's. Jason Momoa rocks as Aquaman. The storyline itself is something new and exciting, and while it does feel a little slow for almost 2 and a half hours, I think it's perfectly paced. The action is incredible, and every fight is amazing. It's just plenty of eye candy during the runtime. It also includes plenty of good humor. As someone who is constantly off and on with the DC universe, I found myself pretty drawn in with this one, and future installments have me hyped for even more. There's nothing quite like the beauty of the ocean depths in Atlantis and wherever else they might journey to, with Aquaman's adventures making the ride even better.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't feel a connection to Aquaman. The opening scene was great, but after that... he was quickly thrown into the position of trying to save the world, before we got to know and find out more about him as a person. e.g. what does he do on a daily basis? Some context would have built more connection, understanding and likeability of the character. The bar scene with his dad was great, and personally I think more of that would have been beneficial.2. Normally in a movie you have a clear idea of beginning, middle and end (even if they're following the comic book). Initially I had a clear understanding of what Aquaman's mission was, but too many things came in the way, and it was not re-established what Aquaman was doing. I think this is a key principle for really great movies.3. Some of it was cringy and clich√© e.g. a perfect example is the kissing scene. We all knew they would get together in the end, and when they finally did, it was just an awkward scene and there was no chemistry (I'm not sure if this was due to the acting / script / directing).4. Lack of diversity - I'm not one to pipe up about diversity, but there were only 2 black characters who happened to be evil, and one of them had a questionable name. I get that it relates to the comic book, but because of the way it looks on camera, I would have suggested more diversity in other aspects of the movie to mitigate this.","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

I want to say that one of the best parts of the film besides Jason who is just the best Aquaman there has ever been, in fact he's even better than the rest of the Justice League members! You guys may have to recast the rest of the team and just start over, begin with a real well don Green Lantern and the whole green lantern corps and color ring wars which is just a mind blowing storyline and the parallax story line as part of the trilogy must not be left out, and we want the real Hal Jordan as green lantern, this time none of that riding in a rollercoaster as in the last movie, which I liked, but there are better and more visually striking ways to use his powers like powerful green cyber armors, giant robot suits, powerful blast and feats of superhuman strength with the green energy etc. Ultimately Green Lantern must join the group and have his movie, just put it in the right director's hands and it will go well. Back to Aquaman I love the whole ocean philosophy and raising awareness about very real issues this is very important and should remain a theme for the next two films. I love the oceanography and many of the CGI were great especially some of the encounters he has, they are really great, except for the octopus scene, you know the one come on stop that. Aquaman's suit , the chainmail should be smaller, it looks plastic as it is and plastic. Also the scene at the end of the film the CGI looks fake, I hope the CGI will look much better in the other films. Merma was great and must remain throughout the film, Nicole Kidman was also great and likewise must remain, in fact all the cast members did a wonderful job. I would love to see the costumes look better, more convincing and the strange races are fantastic and should be looked into more in the coming films, as should the monsters and all the strange history, artifacts and the action scenes all add to the intrigue keep it coming you had everyone eating out of your hands that's why this film grossed so much and is on the top 25 of all time grossing films . Final word when they face Darkseid it should all lead up to it after we get to know everyone and seen their movies and there should be cameos from group members to show cohesion and the CGI has to be top notch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Aquaman clearly demonstrates what Marvel has over DC in the cinematic universe. Aquaman suffers from weak storytelling, a poor script and terrible dialogue, incompetent directing, and some very poor casting choices. I have not seen Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones. Maybe he is excellent in that, but he is unwatchable in Aquaman, delivering his lines in a contrived, shallow manner. Maybe this is not entirely his fault. Given how bad the dialogue is, even Nicole Kidman could not deliver hers with any enthusiasm or sincerity. Momoa speaks almost every line of dialogue with two dimensional, cocky bravado, and his character is basically developed as a rather dim surfer dude, all of which I gather is supposed to be humorous. Whereas Marvel, despite occasional flaws, manages excellent storytelling in which the viewer feels invested, develops characters with genuine personalities, and conveys both genuine humor and pathos through those characters and that storytelling, Aquaman Falls flat on every level.I understand the overall fun people have with superhero movies, but that generalized enthusiasm should not extend to giving a movie this poorly made an average of 7.1 on IMDb. I don't know where people are getting this. The one thing this movie has going for it is beautiful animation. The fact that it looks like a video game, and more literally resembles a cartoon, is another factor which detracts from the overall effect, but it sure is pretty to look at.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Arthur also learns about his mother who was a Queen of an underwater kingdom known as ""Atlantis"".Arthur aka Aquaman is now fully grown and has been called to return to his kingdom to claim his throne and accept his destiny. Arthur will now also be hunted by a new ruler known as ""King Orm"" (Patrick Wilson), who desires to destroy Aquaman and rule the earth.For those who have seen the film Justice League, you will know that the actor Jason Momoa is fantastic as the character of Aquaman. Once again, Jason Momoa is easily the best element of this new superhero instalment. I also enjoyed how this film provided further character development in Aquaman's past and upbringing. I also enjoyed seeing his new enemies. Aquaman is a hero who has awesome skills but also isn't perfect. He is a hero who has faults which I feel many audience members will enjoy connecting with. I enjoyed seeing how Aquaman is a rather humourus character and as an actor, it's obvious that Jason Momoa is simply enjoying playing the character. I personally feel he was somewhat born to play Aquaman.As far as visuals go, this would easily be DC's best looking film. Sure, my mind tell me this is mostly digital effects and green screen, but I cannot deny how good this film looks and sounds. Visually this is a stunning film. The film's audio track is also fun, snappy and somewhat beautiful. The film's soundtrack reminded me of what we saw in Thor: Ragnorok, but still differs in its own way.As a plot I don't feel this is something that differs too much to what we have already seen in films. But! you know what, I still found this film fun and rather enjoyable. Previously, the highest rated film from DC from me was Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman delivered a great story and a dramatic film, but its jokes somewhat suffered. Here we now have what I feel is a simple plot with colourful fun, action and jokes. Some viewers may feel the duration is a slight stretch, but given this also includes Aquaman's origin story, I felt this was to be expected.Overall, once again DC has delivered a sucessful superhero. This movie is brainless, fun, colourful and not to mention... humourous. Jason Momoa is fantastic as Aquaman and brings a great addition to the DC world of superheros. While the plot might be something we have seen before, I still had a blast watching this film and look forward to what's to come next from DC.8.0/10

An ambitious project by director James Wan, Aquaman attempted to turn this ""losing streak"" around, and did it work? YES. Aquaman delivers on almost every aspect. The characters in this film are very well developed, the cinematography is exceptional, the story has high stakes and a surprisingly good antagonist. Any worries had about Aquaman from 2017's ""Justice League"" are completely thrown out the window.Jason Momoa is at the top of his game in this movie, showing off both his dramatic and comedic chops. Amber Heard also puts in a respectable performance as Mera.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to just about anyone. Here's hoping this is the start of a new direction for DC and their films!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, such a character would be a joke compared to the dark brooding universe DC typically is associated with. It would be too silly to have such a character and try to somehow make him as cool as Batman, instead the filmmakers tried to make this a cheesy as possible and it works! It's has similarities to corny children's cartoons and doesn't take itself seriously. It's refreshing to see a light-hearted film like this and I really recommend it - just don't expect something as dark and deep as Batman.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Mamoa is great in this role, but the character was so much better written in Justice League. Both Kidman and Dafoe were just wasted.I suppose that it is completely subjective, but so many of the directorial choices took me out of the movie.What the DC people don't seem to realize is that simply because a movie is based upon a comic doesn't mean that it has to be written to appeal solely to 10 year old boys. Characters are allowed to speak as though they are real people, with real emotions, and who have actually passed high school English. Hard as it may be to imagine, the story doesn't have to be stupid just because it's based upon a comic book.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The story is simple, and perhaps predictable, but you'll not regret sitting through till the end.What I liked most about this film was its experimentation with colours, unlike most other DCEU films.

And Jason Momoa was perfect for the role of Aquaman.Along the exciting action scenes, the suspense and the entertainment that this movie provides, we're subtly reminded that ""the surface"" really needs to be kinder to the ocean, for we cannot leave without it, I'd recommend the film Seaspiracy to everyone, it's on Netflix.I used to read comics as a teenager but was more into marvel, so I don't share the disappointment that some of the fans have expressed, as I'm not that familiar with the origin story, but even marvel deviates many times from the comics. In my humble opinion, as a stand-alone film, this is an epic superhero movie and I can't wait to watch the sequel in the cinema.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I am happy to say report that this movie was of the latter category.The avalanche of superhero movies being thrown at audiences in recent years has left me somewhat numb and hard to impress - a CGI spectacle alone no longer impresses the way it used to. But applied as it was here - to show us an entire new world in explicit detail - was a feat to take note of. Just wow!Yes, the movie has all the clich√©s, but it also has humor and charm in spades - and it cares about its story and characters - without taking itself too seriously.Gotta hand it to Jason Momoa - I think he nailed it about as well as Robert Downey/Ironman. Most enjoyable character in a long time. Congratulations!As for the director - I certainly hope James Wan will be back for the sequel (which should be a certainty now that the movie has done appropriately well at the box office). Outstanding job, sir!The only thing that I can point my finger at, would be that the chemistry between Momoa and Heard didn't exactly throw sparks - but was merely adequate.For me this was a GREAT movie - if you are looking for entertainment, look no further...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Im not a kid any more and even when I was a kid, i really didnt like how bad the writing was but I put with it due to lack of options.So what is the problem with Aquaman? Forced emotional nonsense that did not convince. Silly story revolving around pollution politics against a group that is supposed to be extremely advanced, yet they cant figure out how to contain, organize, and recycle trash.... No sign of intelligence in any character, they are all emotionally fueled doorknobs. The quests in the movie include laughable stuff you find in C-grade video games like ""retrieve the magic weapon"" and ""decode daddies message."" Then to add to the pain, a rap version of Toto's Africa... nauseating stuff.On top of the writing and story, there are a lot of plot holes. The plot itself is silly beyond belief. These ""bad guys"" want to take revenge on the surface of earth in a universe that includes the likes of Superman and Wonder Women... Seriously? They cant even figure out trash recycling.Its a kids movie. Might be ok for high schoolers and below but thats about it. For everyone else, its a chore to watch.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even the supporting cast (villains and extras) were all great additions to the movie. the Pacing does take time as it is a 2 hour movie, but keeps the fun in it. It contains nice cinematography as it shows a world for us to embrace. The action is a definite plus to the film as it had great one shot pieces or long set pieces that are effective and appealing.

I mean Aquaman the protagonist here is even annoying the guy that plays him looks like a wrestler and acts just as badly as one too. The bad guys are so lame some look like they would fit in a GI Joe film and some look like they would fit in a star wars or space scifi world. Just when I thought it couldn't get any lamer than the Thor actor and character they make a full length Aquaman movie with an actor who is possibly the worst protagonist of all time. The lines are lame the humor attempts are cliche and not funny in the least I also felt a bit childish like some executive let their son help with the writing cause its that shallow and the only thing that is funny about it is the costumes and . I also don't know what people are raving over with the visual I think it's horrible it looks so unrealistic you cant even imagine the characters are there and there are many movies that get it right including some of the other super hero films its not that they didn't also use CGI but they certainly didn't abuse it either. Next thing is the actors Dolph Lungren his movie career was over years ago I think maybe even in the same year he started as hes pretty much always been a B action actor and even then he's pure cheese and his movies unbearably lame I cant believe hes still in movies.William Defoe lets get serious here I would buy him as an alcoholic retired cop or dirty senior cop he just look so out of character and place in this movie.Amber heard is terrible as usual I mean every role she gets she either goes too far or the polar opposite she doesn't want to be there or its a simple script reading. I found in this film she even gives off body language like shes nervous and sometimes like I said she doesn't seem to be into it at all. Patrick Wilson looks so out of place in this and to me hes always been nothing but a second rate fill in actor not fit to be one of the main in a movie hes ruined a lot of films for me.I love Nicole Kidman but not even she could keep this film above water. I wouldnt recommend this film to the worst of my enemies as watching this is a cruel punishment. The way people here dont seem to care about content and don't seem to understand the rating system.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Though the film does not follow the successful Marvel recipe of laughs and explosions, it still manages to entertain by combining different genres: the Atlantis scenes remind a Space Opera. The plot (a quest for the King's trident) is a successful combinations of Lord of the Rings and (on occasion) Indiana Jones movies. How can these different genres be combined? All one needs is an inventive and intelligent director.Overall, this is a very entertaining movie and compared to all other DC titles, it clearly stands out as their finest yet, up there with Wonder Woman, and in my opinion, this one is even better. Mr Wan proves he is a top tier director, as he successfully combines different cinematic elements with seamless grace.In his extremely apt hands, Aquaman is a long and fun journey, that has nothing to do with the terrible and gloomy DC Universe, as captured in the Snyder movies.I had given up in DC; I thought Wonder Woman was the fortunate mistake. Aquaman changes the expectations. It seems there may be some hope for DC's cinematic future, after all.On a final note, the cast is generally good. Momoa carries the movie successfully, which to me was a surprise after his abysmal performance in Conan. The only big mistake of the movie is that it lacks a convincing villain. Wilson was clearly miscast, I imagine under the misapprehension that the actor playing the part should slightly remind us of his mother. A bulkier and meaner looking actor would make the rivalry between him and Momoa more interesting.But at the end of the day, does it really matter that much? Nobody expects Aquaman to lose. Still, next time please try not to have Momoa trade punches with Remi Malek.In conclusion: Even if you are not thrilled, you will be entertained. DC's Aquaman is a nicely structured action/sci-fi/fantasy/adventure (!) with impressive visuals, excellent direction, and a sense of originality.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Drops a few cheesy lines.
Schools DC and MCU on how to be grim but enchanting (BB & TDKR excused).
Must have had a whale of a time shooting wave after wave of action sequence.
Heard's performance bouyant with bravado and absolutely gorgeous looks.
Momoa captures the spirit of the half-breed King hook, line, and sinker.
This movie versus the somewhat disappointing The Justice League are oceans apart.
James Wan's horror movie pedigree occasionally floats to the surface to profound effect.
Should help change the tide for DC cinematic universe.
Supporting cast - Morrison, Kidman, Lundgren, Wilson, Dafoe - are sharks at their game.
The intelligent design, beautifully rendered (for the very most part) special effects, shakespearean tragi-familial plot points, and the mesmerising underwater-filmed performances provide the depth to the movie. The frequently shallow dialogue remains submerged under this sea of blockbuster brilliance.
Saw it on Vmax with Atmos, however, the argument that this needs to be seen on a mega-screen doesn't hold water. The sense of scale in this film is presented more with heartfelt, artistic creativity than size alone so if someone tells you that it must be seen on a huge screen, don't take the bait.
Whilst my insistence on piscatorial puns might smell a bit fishy I can assure you that my recommendation to see this in the cinema is above board.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In my ""Justice League"" review last year, I praised the way they handled Aquaman, and made him cool instead of the butt of the joke that he's been for the past 75 years. He's just as cool here. From the opening battle to the final battle, his awesomeness has no end. The story is pretty good, though I did feel like I'd seen a lot of it before, but it's such a fun journey, that I didn't care. The action sequences, at least when they're grand scale battles with wide shots or pan-shots, look gorgeous. The hand-to-hand combat stuff, not so much. The way those are shot made me feel like I was watching someone play the ""Injustice"" games. Some of the dialogue is pretty corny, but that's the case with most DC films lately. They're trying to be live-action Saturday morning cartoons. I have no problem with that in the action aspect, but some of the dialogue really needed some re-writes. I usually complain about CGI in Warner Bros. movies saying how it always looks like a trailer for a PS2 game from 2004, but that's not the case here. Ok, there were some parts underwater that were very obviously green screen, but those were few and far between, at least not to the degree of ""Wonder Woman"" where I could tell when things were CGI. Most of the cast is pretty good, but I do need to complain just a little bit about Amber Heard. During the fight scenes, she was great, but anytime she had dialogue, her lips came up into a sort of sneer, like she was smelling rotten eggs. It didn't matter what the line was. It always looked like that, and it was distracting, and a bit funny. A lot of times it also sounded like she was trying to imitate Scarlett Johansson with the line delivery. In fact, if I closed my eyes, I could almost mistake her for Scarlett Johansson. The movie also had a lot of unnecessary figurative hand-holding for the audience. Every time there was a new location it felt the need to tell you where you were, despite the fact that most people could figure it out from visual context clues. It's obvious we're in Atlantis, it's obvious this is the Sahara. You don't need to have the text on the screen tell us. We're not dumb. We can figure it out in the first 5 seconds of seeing the location. By far the best part of this movie is the directing and cinematography. The wide shots are just gorgeous and the non hand to hand battles are well directed too. For a movie called 'Aquaman' where the main character's power is talking to fish, this was a lot better than it had any right to be. This is definitely, surprisingly, one of DC's best.

Let's be honest, you don't walk into Aquaman expecting award-winning acting or screenplay. However, the CGI animation in some parts was just so bad it was really off-putting for me. I didn't even know they were capable of such horrible CGI these days. I'm talking about the parts where young Aquaman was learning how to swim, and also when Aquaman was taken prisoner for the first time in that long white room. Also towards the beginning when Nicole Kidman was fighting those people in the living room. I mean, those parts looked like they were taken from a Playstation game from 20 years ago.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Nimrods, it's a movie, pay your money and enjoy the ride. The Special Effects were superb, the acting believable, only I would have chosen and different person to play Aquaman, but, hey you go with what you got.In 2015 Warner Brothers released an animated movie called Justice League: Throne of Atlantis. This movie is like the live action version of the 2015 movie, there are a few subtle changes, but the basic concept is the same. Guess it's art imitating art.For those who want to tear this movie apart, you are missing the joy of watching an entertaining movie. I say your ticket, take your seat, eat your popcorn and don't spill the drink on the floor, and enjoy the ride.Unlike Marvel, there are no Super Heroes, fighting Super Heroes for two hours, this is an action movie of the good kind. Who cares if they use wrong words to identify things, if you watch most period piece movies people are using words and terminology that wasn't invented in their time. It's called a movie for a reason, they are made for the entertainment value and not for its historical content. It's called taking creative licensing.

It is not moody, nor mopey and had lots of fun. The sea creatures were great, and the underwater world was breathtaking. Jason Momoa proved he could carry a movie. Despite his hulking presence, and badass look, Momoa's Aquaman is a quite a character. He is charming, witty, and persevering. But he is not broody like Batman or Superman, nor is he a doe-eyed idealist as Wonder Woman during WWI. He is a relatable character who just happens to have superpowers. Besides Momoa, Patrick Wilson was excellent as a villain. Unlike previous DC villains, he is interesting, and proves a worthy nemesis to Momoa's Aquaman. Though his performance is not as compelling as Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, we can still see understand his character's motive. As for other supporting casts, Dolph Lundgren stole the show. He chews every scenery he is in. That is not to say Amber Heard, and Willem Defoe were terrible, but I just enjoyed Lundgren more. In the end, Aquaman is a superhero movie done right, and does not aim to be Oscar material. A great piece of fun entertainment!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Then, their Justice League movie sucked, too, which just made me go back to hating anything in the DC Universe again. While my wife and her friends were shopping, a friend and I decided to catch a movie last minute. We decided on Aquaman because it fitted with our schedule. I sat in my chair expecting another failed attempt at a good superhero movie, wishing that this was any Marvel movie other than Ant Man. Was I ever wrong. This movie had it all; great storytelling and the CGI was breathtaking. Acting was very good all around. The movie had so much depth and didn't rely on awkward teenage humor to carry it through heavily emotional scenes.James Wan did an amazing job at directing this movie and I really hope that he gets his hands in more DC flicks.If DCEU can keep up this momentum, I really think that they can find their own in the new era of superhero movies.I have no idea how anyone who enjoys superhero movies could give this less than a 7. Also, as per usual, ignore Rotten Tomatoes and their biast reviews.Do yourself a favor and see this in theatres. The effects are made for the big screen and will leave you absolutely submerged in the underwater Universe. Well done, DCEU!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Many people (including the critics) have praised this movie for being only ""fun"" or putting the accent on ""good old fun"". But in my opinion this movie has much more to it than that. The only reason I didn't gave this movie a ten is because overall is a bit cliched at times and overall the stakes aren't that high really, to make you surprised or mind blown by what turns this movie took along its 142 minutes run time.The story: Many people have compared this movie with ""Black Panther"" or ""Lion King"" but the story although being about someone who steps up to be the king of his people, is quite different. The main difference is that Arthur doesn't want to be king and his character along the journey this movie takes it, becomes more selfless and more dedicated to his people or to the saving of his people rather than on some claim he has. I'll say this: first like 20 minutes of this movie are awesome with a backstory that was touching, powerful and memorable. The movie loses its tempo only in the middle but you never lose the plot if you pay attention. I will also point out the development of Arthur's character and how a certain scene speaks so powerfully about what makes a good leader. Someone who doesn't think about himself but rather gives everything in him for his people. Very nicely executed scene, and one more reason why this movie was more than just good fun for me.The villain: Although some people said Manta wasn't actually needed in this movie, if you really pay attention to the movie you'll see he has somewhat of a role in it. But the other villain is what makes this movie good. Orm is very strong of a character and his motivations are very understandable. There's a scene between him and Arthur in Atlantis that displays all his motivation and how humans are responsible for that. For me that scene just spoke and raised the problem that we as humans continue to perpetuate upon the environment, and how we do everything that we like with it without worrying about it's degradation. Very nice and deep thematically.The supporting cast was good. Standard I would say: Vulko is the mentor, Mera is the ""partner along the journey"" for Arthur, but the rest which I won't spoil for you, two characters are very good even though they don't have that much screen time. Their story is superb and touching. The soundtrack again was very nice done by Rupert Gregson Williams, but a little to loud at times.The visuals: This movie is wihtout a doubt the most visual and the most beautifully looking movie I've seen in a long long time. It is beyond me how this movie wasn't nominated by the academy (btw one of the worst nolinations this year at the academy) for visual effects and production design, which are incredible well done. The amount of work that went in it must have been crazy. I couldn't but appreciate all the visuals and the digital altered faces (which are quite a few) throughout this movie.Overall, great movie with so much fun and excitement but also with a good and flashed out villain, good character development and good enough themes throughout the movie. Well worth watching. Stay until the mid credits for the post credits scene that sets up a sequel, which hopefully will be made.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not only is a mythological sword released in Aquaman but a variety of ""Crackins,"" aka Liam Neesom style. The movie could have buckled under the weight of trying to be all things to all fictions, but instead, was all the better for it. Add to that, a decent storyline, solid acting, incredible special effects, and a few important messages from the ecology.See Aquaman but see it on the big screen.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The creativity is unreal, and I have to admire James Wan and the entire cast for doing such a great job and giving Aquaman such a distinctive and fresh thematic and audiovisual style that I found immensely enjoyable, and for being unafraid to actually try and tell a story.Without spoilers, these minor plot points are eventually explained, but suffice it to say that it's better to give your audience all of the necessary information BEFORE your action sequence starts rather than after it, or you risk the audience asking 'why is this happening' rather than engaging in the action.Still, it didn't really detract from the movie too much, and all cases where this happen are eventually explained properly, if you can be patient and just roll with it for a bit.However, from a logical standpoint, the movie kind of fails in the third act. Too many parts were a bit of a stretch for me or just flat out CGI nonsense (lighting flares underwater?), and is pretty much the only reason I'm not rating this 10/10.Yes it's a superhero movie, I understand that, but it doesn't mean we need to throw normal physics out of the window entirely.Overall, a very fun and engaging movie with an actual plot and surprising emotional depth (pun intended), but just roll with it when it gets too silly towards the end.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In my opinion, they have always made better solo movies compared to marvel at this stage. Mos and BvS may be a critical failure but they were true classics which only an ardent DC lover can understand. Not to disrespect others opinions, but the criticism received by these movies was just unfair and whats more appalling is the common complaint of movie being too dark. These movies are made and meant to be dark which most of the critics berated and lost the whole plot.Aquaman made over a billion dollar and is the DC's highest grossing movie which shattered many other records during its leggy run. The fact that movie was such a huge box office success after JL is a huge relief to the fans and the production house. This success is imperative to DCEU and it's future installments.Coming to the movie, Aquaman has right amalgamation of story, visuals and action sequences. Out of these departments, VFX has been top notch that one would feel wet after coming out of the 3D Imax screens. It is synonymous to Avatar in terms of the graphics and one of the mainstay for the film's success. Furthermore, the trench sequence under the sea is a visual spectacle and major highlight of the movie.Story wise movie is well balanced and predictable at times but overall it is decent story line that sets up perfectly for the sequel which is expected to start soon. The actors played their part well, especially Jason Mamoa charisma is a huge benefactor for the film's wide reach across the globe that later turned into box office numbers.Finally, Aquaman is legitimate movie which can't be juxtaposed to any other superhero movie as there no such similar made till now. Although, the movie won't blow your mind but gives a refreshing feeling with astonishing visuals which can't be missed in theatres.Comic Book Wise - 10/10
Normal Movie - 8/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He has come a long way from those days.After the DC disappointment that was Batman vs Superman this was refreshing! Momoa has made Aquaman his own. I enjoyed all the chemistry between the actors. Momoa especially used his signature humor to add that extra charm to Arthur Curry. I was blown away by performance of Patrick Wilson as Orm Marius. Patrick I've always found to have a great range as a performer.The movie from beginning to end had great flow. I walked in with no expectations I found the movie to have excellent direction from James Wan right down to the music by Rupert Gregson- Williams. Your in for a real treat with this movie.As far as flaws go it had some slow points that are to be expected. However the character building was quite excellent. I even really enjoyed a lot of the supporting characters as well. The film had a nuance a lot of super hero movies seem to lack.If DC keeps to this kind of quality I look forward to many more great films. Hopefully they can translate this into a new Batman and Superman as far as I'm concerned those movies were garbage. As fans we deserve better films, like Aquaman!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well, I would lean towards saying no, but it's far from the disaster some may have expected. James Wan not only brings a new flavor to the universe, but makes a separate entry into a series that desperately needed it.There are two mindsets at play here, one being that Wan ""clearly"" meant to make a overly dramatic and bombastic adventure with cheesy dialogue, the other that the film is a tonal mess that at times takes itself far too serious, and at other times, almost having too much fun. I fall somewhere in the middle. I can acknowledge that a film that has a massive octopus playing the drums under water has a certain sense of self awareness, but there's no doubt in my mind that the mixture of tones just doesn't work in some moments.Jason Momoa is the perfect Aquaman/Arthur Curry and I'm mad that I had any doubt over his casting all those years ago. Despite not having the best chemistry romantically, his love interest Mera (Amber Heard) plays well off of him. When they aren't making out in the midst of an all out under water war, they share some of the best action scenes of the film, including a rooftop chase that displays the true genius behind Wan's framing/camera work.I could have completely done without Black Manta as it felt very much like the unnecessary presence of Baron Mordo in Doctor Strange. Also, his costume is absolutely absurd, and I don't care how close it is to the comic book iteration of Manta. The other villain, Patrick Wilson's 'Oceanmaster', is an overcooked & cliched power hungry super villain that did next to nothing for me. There's a good antagonist in there somewhere for Aquaman, but it sure wasn't in this origin story.I'd be remiss not to mention Nicole Kidman, considering how great of a year she is having, and her turn as Atlanna is no different. Owning her action sequences and elevating all of her dialogue, Kidman is likely the most memorable thing from the film, and I hope to see more of her character at some point or another.Extravagant, colorful, bombastic, a tonal mess, and cheesy, Aquaman is right around where I expected it would be. And hopefully the beginning of a new era of DC movies. Here's hoping.7.5/10","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Overall the script and the storyline were so cliched that it was cringeworthy at times. Every plot twist was predictable and obvious from the outset which made the film boring.The lack of character development meant I wasn't invested and didn't care how things turned out - I was just waiting for it to end for the last 45 minutes of the movie. The main villains - Black Manta and Orm were one-dimensional cliches and lacked any depth or personality.The CGI was overused and at times the fight scenes got a bit silly - a few fish swimming through and destroying metal craft . . . erm, sure, that's totally believable. Ditto a man gets trapped under rubble (which would have crushed his legs) but when it's moved he gets up and walks away.Jason Momoa was the best thing about this film - he played his role well, but didn't have much to work with, script/plot wise.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was looking for something light and easy, that I wouldn't mind missing the end of if it lasted longer than the rest of the flight did. I can assure you that I did not mind missing the end of it.The two stars, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard, are pretty good eye candy, as were a couple of the second-stringers, gorgeous Patrick Wilson and still-stunning Nicole Kidman. Some, but definitely not all of the special effects are well done. Otherwise, what a waste of celluloid, or electrons, or whatever movies are made out of these days.Both Momoa and Heard are atrociously one-dimensional actors who can't even pull off the clich√©d, tough-guy lines they've been given in any kind of believable cowboys-and-Indians way. They'd be the runts of the litter in any 6th-grade drama class, except for their good looks.The script is so bad that its predictability and the simple-mindedness of the dialogue are actually one of the most fun parts of watching the movie. The plot is full of lazy, dumb shortcuts that break the movie's few asinine rules about Atlantis and sea-people vs. land-people as soon as they've been laid out. E.g., our hero and heroine, ferocious Atlantan royalty who can swim better than anything in the ocean, have to steal a boat to get from the coast of Italy? Greece? (someplace on the Mediterranean) to get to an off-shore island so close that it can easily be seen with the naked eye.If you shaved down all the overly long, gratuitous fight scenes, you could probably cut the running time of this potboiler by about 50%. Which would be a blessing. Thank heavens for the fast forward button.I'd been willing to suspend disbelief, as one always must with sci-fi/fantasy films, but this thing is dumber than the crappiest 1950s horror film you could ever imagine. So, of course, it made over $160 million, and a sequel is planned. Yay, Tinseltown. It's hard to tell how much to blame the director and producers for (justifiably) holding their audience in contempt, as opposed to not being able to produce a decent product even in a lowbrow genre like comic book movies.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Even the fight scenes were rushed, almost as if the producers felt the show was getting slow so we better spruce it up with a cgi fight scene.

Good world-building. Most of the acting was decent enough (better from the more seasoned actors). Comedic moments sit a little awkwardly and were pretty flat for me, but are probably not too bad. The story was pretty simple, but that's fine, especially when executed by decent acting.The rest though.. everything out of the water.. it's like someone completely different was in charge. And it's not good.There's a long scene that looks like it came out of the old Power Rangers TV show, with the same cheap look, and a clunky villain who had suddenly become a technological genius... just pathetic.The soundtrack was mostly unnoticeable which I find is usually good, except for horrible double use of the 'signature' refrain during the first appearance, but much worse, two crude scene transitions into overbearing songs, one of which starts a laughable scene that looks like the start of a Disney fairytale musical number.The CGI is bad, including a scene on a boat that looks like they borrowed a backdrop from a film from the 1950s, along with a camera stuck on maximum zoom for some reason.There are other bits too; when Mera makes a 'speech', all moving about for no reason but to clash with the tone of the moment, or the wildly variable displays of Aquaman's strength, or one underwater bit that was so silly, ill-fitting and cheesy that our audience laughed out loud *at* it.Overall the good bits are pretty decent, but good grief, I just don't get it, you're watching then the next scene and you're wondering if they swapped the reels to another film.This is not good film-making.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Loved the costuming and special effects too. One important note, if you are one of those who stops watching the moment the credits roll, don't do it.

It's about training to be the best you can be. Then, when you are ready, your task is to beat anything that's in your way, with a humble heart because good always wins. Another reason why I like it is because of the action between Arthur and King Orm. These two teach that, no matter what the situation is, violence is never the answer. I also really like the background music because the suspense really moved me and made me want to jump out of my seat with excitement and joy.This amazing action/adventure film is about the city of Atlantis, which is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry king Orm. With his army by his side, King Orm plans to take over the remaining oceanic people to become the King of all oceans better known as the Oceanic Master, then to rule the surface world. Standing in Orm's way is his half-Human, half-Atlantean brother, Aquaman, known as half-breed. With help from Vulko, who is the royal counselor of the throne, Aquaman must retrieve the powerful trident of Atlan to proclaim the title as the protector of the deep blue sea.The cast includes Arthur/Aquaman (Jason Momoa, Game Of Thrones), Atlanna (Nicole Kidman, Dead Calm), King Atlan (Graham McTavish, Outlander), Mera (Amber Heard, Never Back Down), King Orm (Patrick Wilson, Insidious), Vulko (Willem Dafoe, Spider-Man), Manta (Yahya Abdul-Manteen II, The Greatest Showman).My favorite part of this film is when Arthur finds out that he has the power to talk to the creatures in the water, in other words echolocation. Following that, Arthur doesn't know how to control the power that he has, which is why King Atlan puts Arthur in the hands of the royal counselor, Vulko, to learn to control his powers. From the training that Artur does with Vulko, Arthur shall use it in the future.Aside from that, King Orm plans to take things into his own hands and decides to conquer the seven seas to become King Of The Deep Blue Sea, also known as the Oceanic Master. After that, King Orm plans to take apart the surface world to become his treasure for good.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, as well as adults. Truly the whole family will love this film as it has so many funny and good reaction moments. This film also requires very good anthropomorphic qualities in various scenes. Don't miss this amazing action/adventure film directed by James Wan, which is playing in theaters now, to find out what happens at the end.Reviewed by Siaki S., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

I'm totally blown away by this movie. Everything was done just right. The pacing was overall fast but did leave enough room for some quality character development every now and then. Aquaman's two arch nemeses (Ocean Master and Black Manta) were properly introduced so that new audiences got the opportunity to get a good idea of why they antagonize Aquaman.
Overall, the movie explored three main themes; revenge, redemption, and forgiveness (in that particular order). I think it was done rather well.
Aquaman used to be the butt of many jokes in the past. He was widely regarded as the ""lamest"" super hero but with this movie they managed to totally re-brand Aquaman's bad image. This can mostly be attributed to the strong cast and good script. I, for one, was very happy to see that Willem Dafoe was cast for movie. I'm still secretly hoping that he'll play the Joker in an upcoming Batman movie but that's another topic for another time.
Towards the end the movie reached Star Wars levels of epicness. And I'm not talking about the new Star Wars movies.The film score was rather modern and had plenty of synthwave elements. I'm a huge fan of these types of orchestral-fusion scores.
Aesthetics-wise the movie had a very futuristic vibe; Atlantean guards who kind of looked like Storm Troopers, and the bright neon lights that illuminated Atlantis. It was very reminiscent of the first Blade Runner movie in that regard.As a long-time DC fan I'm really happy with the movie. I have collected comics for over a decade from both, Marvel and DC. But truth be told; aside from the Batman movies DC had really produced mostly unwatchable movies lately while Marvel was pushing out one good movie after another. Now that I've seen Aquaman I remain hopeful that DC might turn it around and get their act together.p.s.
I don't know why the ""professional"" critics hated this movie. But I can tell you this much; don't trust the metascore. It's bogus. This is one of the most epic super hero movies. Totally recommended.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Casting is perfect and locations and scenery that is not CGI is incredible.

Who would've thought? People always demean Aquaman so he deservedly got a Huge film! Massive production. A whole new world had to be created underwater, amazing effort. Special effects galore and the script is good enough.Apparently they made the most out of the superhero, they made the most out of Jason Momoa, treated him good and he shined at moments. However, hardcore fans might complain of his portrayal as a bar thug tattooed kinda trashy guy (that's what some reviews say?) as opposed to the comic version sophisticated and smarter.
I love Amber Heard, she is such a gorgeous woman, to me she is very charismatic. Nicole Kidman, nice special character and great presence. Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe delivered accordingly. Black Manta's motivation left me a little incomplete.Definitely a movie that doesn't emphasize on the acting but in the end, I liked the conclusion so much, it appealed to my taste. I was satisfied, it's a crowd pleaser, nicely written. I'm not gonna knock it down because it's not at the masterpiece level of The Dark Knight, but shall support DC because they really need to compete (after many let-downs) and they did it with Aquaman, pleasantly surprised.
They found the right direction for the superhero, so I think the second part could easily be better, it has to, I have expectations now. Could it be more successful?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

More like splat.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4533045/?ref_=tt_urv","reefmavericks","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96819157/?ref_=tt_urv","25 December 2018","If you care about great acting, dialogue, and character development, maybe this is not the movie for you. James Wan should stick with the jump scare horror movies, because this movie was an embarrassment, compared to his Insidious series.
Jason Momoa, scenery, and the kraken: maybe the only positives of this movie. It also has a good message: Be humble, a true king fights for everyone, not only his people.
But why the bad rating?
1. Awful Dialogue! This movie is stuffed with cheesy one liners, and horribly basic dialogue throughout. This made it hard to really enjoy the movie. I understand this movie is rated PG-13 and mainly meant for children to see, but it really could have been better.
2. Bad acting. The dialogue did make it hard for the actors to really shine with what they were given. However, the man who played Black Manta was not very good. As a revenge character, he just looked like a mad child and was unconvincing. Patrick Wilson also disappointed in this movie. Nicole Kidman did do a good job with the small role she was given though.
3. Overuse of CGI. The underwater scenery was good, very glowy and spectacular like in Avatar. However, the metal suit CGI was pretty bad. Much too shiny and unconvincing. (Iron Man did it better)
4. Bad costumes! Queen Atlanta, Mera, and Aquaman's fish scale suits looked like they had been bought at a Halloween store. The sleeve ends showed too much and the scales looked like they had been drawn on. Some CGI could have been used here, to add dimension to them.
5. Romance? Where? The romance between Mera and Aquaman seemed like an after thought. Just one scene showing real connection would have helped. Very flat and business like relationship. She helps him, he helps her, and then they end up together somehow.
Despite all this, the movie was an okay way to waste time and the children enjoyed it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The whole ""treasure hunt"" was really nice little subplot that made everyone more relatable.Costumes are just amazing, they are almost exact duplicates from comics and they do not look silly at all! How they did it!? Maybe it's the environment that makes them blend in and seem ""realistic"".Some single shots are little cringe worthy, like those that emphasizes how badass Jason Momoa is. Little less of that would have worked better.Generally speaking this is a great movie.

Much of it feels like a conventional and old-fashioned feeling 'superhero' story that, even at its best (which is an enjoyable Sicily-based action-scene), floats along providing nothing more than a shallow level of engagement. That's its main issue, really; it isn't all that compelling. Yet, it's generally just about entertaining enough to see you through to its conclusion. It isn't gripping, but it isn't boring either. Despite its issues (including a very wonky tone), it's actually not bad. It's not especially good, but it isn't bad. It's somehow better the second time around. I appreciate what it's trying to do, even if it isn't always successful; for instance, the fact that it brings to screen such blatantly silly things as Oceanmaster's comic-accurate costume or a drum-playing octopus proves that it's at least somewhat self-aware. When it's at its most bombastic, it's at its most successful. The underwater visuals are absolutely splendid, full of colour and life. It really is like stepping into another world. So, ultimately, the movie emerges as a decent escapist experience, despite its problems. It isn't particularly good, but it isn't bad either. 5/10.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

In my prior review I asked what had just happened ""Start with the good - I appreciated the casting and there were some beautiful things to look at. Next quick vent : why can't aquaman be organic ? There are some fierce and creatures in the ocean, and a nod to ocean preservation? I mean c'mom. Okay the dialogue was not enough . The cgi weird st times and well it's a 5 but I appreciate DC trying"" I take back the dialogue and the organic nature is aquaman in the iis movie and the cgi is not as bad as I thought it serves a purpose and I anyway I think this movie has staying power and Jason M is an excellent aquaman - I noticed recently that he truly makes movies better with his presence and I am coming to appreciate him and his acting so much !","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The single worst casting in the history of cinema. She cannot act and is a lying, manipulative POS.If they edit her out of this and the sequel, it'll be worth another watch.I would recommend not watching, just for the fact that Amber Heard is in it.Other than that, the rest act very well, and don't deserve to have such a terrible cast member as Amber Heard
The CGI is a little lacklustre, but that's ok. The story is well written, but the direction is a little off, and sometimes, it doesn't follow the same themes throughout.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

First I saw the movie in 2D and as I watched it thought that it really would be great in 3D. So two days later I saw it in 3D. I was so looking forward to seeing it in 3D because I saw all the opportunities for 3D to really shine again as it did in Avatar. I'm one of those people that really want 3D to succeed and come back though I may be in the minority. It wasn't very long into the second time through, watching it in 3D, that it struck me. The whole movie is just too dark.I don't mean that in the sense that it's evil. I mean it's just too dark. There we're so many scenes that would have been so much better had we as the audience be able to see them and more light. I know the whole thing is supposed to be under water but surely they could have explained their way around that! It is my belief that are younger movie Makers just don't have the background and basic fundamentals....
How bright does a picture need to be or how long to display text so people have time to read it are just two things that popped out for me. I believe DC missed a huge opportunity here. Can anyone describe the monster at the end of the movie? I think not. Believe ratings could have been between .5-1.0 higher with more brightness and less artistic gray.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It had a lot of action scenes that were put together really well and the water was someof the best effects in years. The two main leads are wonderful, though I do think they could have given Aquaman himself more brains than brawn.

Yet as the reviews came in, and as Jason Momoa killed it on the PR trail, I finally decided to give it a go and really enjoyed it.Some standouts:
Jason Momoa is a star. He carried this script with all of it's tongue-in-cheek groan-worthy lines... I read somewhere that he uses Metal songs to get into character and that Tool was one of his inspirations. Personally I think Tool is a Very Serious Band and so is their front-man Maynard, but he has a pretty weird sense of humor.For some reason I kept paying attention to the physics - there are a lot of people flying through walls and getting hit really hard, you really feel the kinetic force of the action.The plot is predictable but epic, the final battle is outstanding, and the world design is colorful, interesting, and fun.DCEU really steps up the game with this entry into its universe, but I don't really see Wonder Woman, Super Man, or Batman as having the ability to carry a movie with this level of humor and color. They're going to need to introduce a new team in an alternate setting that can be comical, colorful, and have a ton of action - I think the Lantern Corps are going to be the best way even though it was attempted previously.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Superman is my favorite character of all time and I want these DC films to be good. The writing was just terrible. When A+ actors/actresses look like they just started making movies (Nicole Kidman/William Defoe) it points right back to the directing/writing. It had some visually stunning moments but that is it. Its like the director said to himself "" how many scenes can we put Momoa in slow motion and an awkward pose after an action sequence. I felt no connection between any of the characters beside one scene. When Momoa is talking to the guardian of the Trident and you never even saw the face of the monster talking. That was the only believable scene in the whole movie. How this movie is getting such high praise is BS. I thought to myself several times is this movie is it over yet and how much longer until the credits.

Too pretty for its own good. Just another dimwit comic book movie a little different with a lot of it beneath the sea. Momoa is just about right for the title role, I guess, but Heard is a bore. It's anyone's guess what Kidman is doing in this and I've long wondered why the talented Patrick Wilson is in so many bad movies. I've also often wondered how many times the actors have trouble keeping a straight face when performing in such nonsense. A lot of cracking up I bet...all the way to the bank. It made a fortune. I hear there will be more. Of course.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

However, if not for James Wans' direction, this movie would have a been a 2/10. It is a good looking movie, and it is fun, but it's just bad. The script probably being the main problem. Too many characters to introduce, too many storylines going on at once, and frankly just not very exciting. Super hero movies seem to feel the need to throw a joke into every scene but it is just distracting and not at all funny most of the time. How people are giving this a 10/10, which in my opinion should be reserved for only the best movies ever made, I really do not know. The acting is ok at best, but i still cringed at the line delivery in some of the scenes. I'm not trying to hate on this movie, just trying to make sure you don't go into this movie with high expectations like I did, becasue you will be let down. One more thing, the tones throughout the movie are very jumpy which leads to feeling like you're watching two different movies and it can be very irritating.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Corny and Terribly Written.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4571364/?ref_=tt_urv","NarniaIsAwesome","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89518905/?ref_=tt_urv","9 January 2019","Not being a superhero fan, I was surprised when I was impressed with 2017's 'Justice League.' Aquaman was actually my least favorite character, but the trailers for his own movie showed sea monsters, and that sold it. So I saw it.For starters, the script (written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall) is absolutely awful. Not only can you predict the outcome of the story from the moment the title comes up, but the dialogue is bone chillingly bad. It is even full of cliches like the ""du du DU!"" music that plays when the villain says something ""scary."" It also contains things that I never wanted to see or know, like an octopus playing drums, and the fact that apparently Aquaman doesn't wear deodorant.And then we come to the cast: a fair enough group tainted by terrible lines. Jason Momoa (Aquaman) quotes his ill-timed one liners with all the dignity of smoked ham. So... yeah. Amber Heard (Ariel-Meara) graces the screen as your standard ""tough superhero girlfriend"" with all the dignity of, again, a smoked ham. Patrick Wilson (the evil Orm) is generally a talented actor, but is ruined by cliche ""bad guy"" yelling. Willem Dafoe is impossible to take seriously after his role in 'Mr. Bean's Holiday.' Dolph Lundgren rides a giant seahorse - and that's about it. And finally we come to Nichole Kidman, who looks lovely and doesn't botch her lines or performance. She should be apologized to for working with these people.The visuals are amazing, if a bit overwhelming at times. The most impressive advancement of Atlantis is their waterproof make-up. It's almost 2 hours into the movie before we see the creatures promised to us in the trailer. They are truly the highlight of the film and mostly the reason for my 3 star rating.This is a long, lingering, rather dull movie and only watchable if there's nothing else to rent at the video store: Carson Clay's 'Playback Time.' I mean, uh, 'Aquaman!'","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Jason Mimosa's snarky take and one liners were not born for this character, Amber Heard still can't act & throwing Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson & Willem Defoe into this heap of garbage is frankly disrespectful to their skill set. I'm honestly at a complete loss of how to save DC? I will note I am huge Wonder Woman / DC fan & had great hopes this universe could be salvaged somehow, but honestly, I don't think it's possible anymore. I'll hold out that WW1984 & Joaquin's Joker will be of interest, but 1 Billion dollars does make a turd shine, no matter how much elbow grease you put into it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Then came another boring film dawn of justice and pathetic suicide squad. After that came the first female superhero film wonder woman which worked wonders for dceu. But those wonders didn't last after the release of justice league, a blatant copy of avengers.
And now, dceu comes with aquaman who we saw in justice league (but I was wondering where he was as only focus was on wonder woman flash and Superman).
Aquaman narrates the origin of Arthur curry half human half atlantean. In the first few minutes it captures your attention, with excellent action scene of Nicole Kidman. After then the film takes you to a visual treat. Jason momoa mass intro, underwater scenes, Atlanta kingdom, fight between Arthur and his half brother, escaping from Atlanta to get the golden trident, the superb action scene in Italy, Arthur getting the Trident and the final battle all these does not let you take off your eyes at the screen. Only drawback is story is not that great and slightly similar to Thor 1. Aquaman was my best 3d experience. On the whole, aquaman is an absolute visual treat which not even a marvel film provided me. DC must concentrate for the time being only on solo superhero films. Hats off to director James wan.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Pretty mediocre movie from start to finish. Everyone is just here to pick up a paycheck. The lead, Jason Momoa, is too busy trying to channel nineties metal rockstars instead of trying to play Aquaman. It's disturbing at times to see alcoholism being glorified onscreen. What's up with that? Everyone onscreen is going through the motions because they're being asked to play a part in a movie that's already been done a few dozen times before or more that's been done to death. I'm honestly surprised no one has done a parody of superhero movies yet. So many of them follow the same formula.The end was the worst part of the movie. Nothing was convincing about it. Amber Heard just looked embarrassed. She can't act. It's tragic. She totally knew she was on a set, doing a movie role for a quick buck. She put no effort into convincing the audience of who she was playing onscreen.Watch in IMAX if you can, some of the cinematography is just gorgeous. Yahya Abdul-Mateen deserves some recognition for his part. I felt this movie may have been a lot better with him as Aquaman. Jason Momoa can't act, I mean, if this was the best you could do, at least just cast Yahya as the lead. He deserves much better and was the one good thing about this film.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

As cast members we have: Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman, Amber Heard as Y' Mera Xebella ""Meraa"", Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Patrick Wilson as the Ocean Master, and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna. This is an action movie and is basically directed to ages of sixteen and on because it has strong language and scenes, but some fans are very young age and the best option is going with their parents. Some part of the audience thinks this movie was not as how it supposed to be like in the comics and some other part of the audience thinks that this movie was one of the best made about this character. This movie showed a lot of good special effects and action considered that it is a super hero movie and some type of fight scene should happen, it was well do it under water where is all about. This is a movie that at first you will think twice to watch if you are not a fan of superhero movies but when the movie begins this attached feeling to the movie will come immediately and the movie will be well enjoyed. In general, the movie was really good with good special effects, good fighting scenes, great music, and very good acting especially form the main character Aquaman who in my perspective it was the best from all the cast. The main actor, Jason Momoa made a really good job giving live to this character and I think the audience who really loves this comic will be pleased with his work. Overall the movie was really good personally I am not a big fan of super heroes movies but this one deserves a try, in my opinion I would give this movie a 8.5/10, if you have not seen it then you should watch it and enjoy the 2 hours of movie time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie has some issues with these two, some characters aren't fully developed, the story doesn't really have 1 main villain too, and the love between Mera and Aquaman feels forced.
And this movie is amazing visually, the production design is top-notch, but to be honest some of the de-aging CGI is so obvious, that it's annoying, some models aren't fully rendered here and there. The story is really full of cliches and that sometimes ruins moments, but overall the movie looks and feels amazing due to the charisma of the actors, the musical score and the overall comic-booky atmosphere of the movie. Has some issues, but overall worth the wait and worth watchingAn extra message for the hardcore DC fans giving this movie 10/10 and saying that this is better than everything the MCU could offerAquaman is a good movie. I think it's really well done, and DC is improving on their movies. Shazam I believe will be really good. But this movie is still not better than most of the MCU. I am more of a DC guy actually but Marvel movies are much more consistent with tone and quality, with the CGI, and with all characters, and they are I think overall better movies. Saying that this movie is better than most MCU movies is just too much and DC doesn't deserve it. They should work their asses off to finally give us 1 movie that everyone can say that it's great, until than, I will say that most of their movies are mediocre, because they deserve it. Good luck DC, I hope you do what we, the fans deserve. Aquaman is a good step in the right direction","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even though I defended Justice League last year looking back it was not as good as this masterpiece.Heck, this is possibly even better then anything (except for Infinity wars of course) that came out of the MCU the past year or so. I admit I was not a massive fan of Black Panther nor I enjoyed Ant-Man and the wasp that much.After the success of wonder woman 2017 and somewhat Man of Steel I am glad they are looking back at their products on how to make their movies better. Even if a small number of comic book nerds or marvel/mcu troll would not agree.On to the actual movie it self. It did a good job focusing the story more on Aquaman despite small changes but it still did a good job portraying it even if you are not familiar with aquaman.The script and the dialogues were pretty good. Acting wise it was good without having any over acting or getting too pretend as their roles. The casing of Jason Mamoa, Patrick Wilson, William Defoe, Temura Morrison and Nicole Kiddman was a very well done aswell.The CGI was really good for each scene both in and out of the water as well as the special effects.Overall this was an amazing movie and possibly my favourite I have seen this year.P.S.If Amber heard is in the sequel don't support it.

Making a movie under water is very challenging and kudos to Wan and his team for creating a brilliant world underwater with CGI technology.Storyline was decent and despite what many critics said the movie is too long, I could not feel the time pass since the movie is packed with action.The only thing I would change is perhaps adding less elements to the movie.

Story by Geoff Johns, James Wan and will Beall... The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime--one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be a king.This review will be spoiler-free, because I don't want to ruin this movie to you, guys...
I really don't know where to start, guys... Let's start with the direction.. James Wan's first superhero movie as its director is Aquaman, so I was concerned to see him failing, because we're used to see him mostly in horror movie like The Conjuring Universe, Saw and Insidious.. so yeah I didn't expect him to make a great job with the direction, in fact I was blown away of his amazing job with this movie, especially with the action scenes, he made every single scene epic, and breathtaking, thanks also goes to the crew of the CGI which I'm gonna talk about later on. James Wan did some mistakes with the direction as I predicted when I first heard that he will direct this movie, he actually tried to make some jump-scares in this movie, for no reason I don't get why.. let me tell you how... Most of the NORMAL scenes, when people are talking or doing anything but fighting, especially when they are in a house or somewhere closed, they always ended with someone exploding the wall or anything unexpectedly just like horror movies, and that's what I was afraid of! That's my only issue with the direction.Let's move to the flawless CGI!!!! Every scene of the underwater world was was well made, by the CGI and the direction as I said above, it's amazing.. I can't find any proper word to say about it.. it was fascinating, i was super-entertained by how well done the CGI of this movie is!! They weren't afraid of making that much of Atlantis, like Godzilla did, I don't want to compare movies, but Godzilla was too afraid to make that much of scenes of him, but Aquaman took that risk and they nailed it!Also the performances were very talented by everyone, Jason Momoa is amazing as Aquaman as he was in Justice League, and maybe more! Amber Heard is badass as Mera... Patrick Wilson is an amazing villain and I loved him as King Orm and I can't wait to see him again in other DC movies!Let's move to my biggest flaw of this movie, and it's a random choice.. I don't know but this might have some spoiler for you... There's a scene when Aquaman and Mera were fighting CREATURES in a boat, and in this scene Arthur AKA Aquaman said a very random line, that these creatures are from the bottom of the sea so they fear the light, so he opens a random box to find a LIGHT SOURCE and he scares the creatures with it... This scene was so random, the line of Aquaman can be forgiven, but the random choice can't be!
I tried to make it spoiler-free as I could and I highlighted some keywords, which who watched the movie will understand what I'm talking about.So for those who want to know if Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is better than Aquaman or not, my opinion is yeah, it's better than Aquaman, but it also depends on what you want to see, if you wanna see an epic, old fashioned way superhero movie, so Aquaman is your movie, but if you wanna see a surprising and with a very powerful story, so Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is your movie. Anyways I really loved Aquaman and I'm gonna give it an A!Alright, guys, and thanks for reading my review, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews. Look forward for my up coming reviews...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film is atrociously bad. I mean, they are spending millions upon millions, for cgi and actors' salaries, but have missed the basics : a decent storyline, with credible dialogue.

This film really does take us on an adventure around this beautiful underwater world. James Wan directs this beautifully, and brings this world alive..! The casting was perfect, in my opinion everyone involved brought this world alive and truly delivered. This film came after the backlash of the Justice Leagues failure to deliver to a lot of the fans and filmgoers alike which was never going to be an easy task but they did it and did it with style.I was doubting this film walking into the cinema although I personally loved the Man of Steel and Batman Vs Superman but when I watched Aquaman it made me think, this is what the Justice League could've been. The cinematography was stunning and it really does pull you into the world, the CGI used was brilliant and captivating and really does give a feel that this world could be real. Amber Heards best performance to date and the chemistry between her and Jason Mamoa seems natural and not forced but I also loved the connection between Mamoa and Defoe...!If the DCEU follow suit Then i can't see why they can't get back on track with the world that they've been trying to create. In no way was this film rushed, it's pacing was perfect, I really can't pick fault with this film it's exactly what, (as a lifetime comic fan) I wanted. I feel Jason Mamoa really felt this character and embraced the role in every way..., can't wait to see more of this in the futureLoved it...!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had only seen the first trailer, but went into the theatre since I really enjoy DC/Marvel/Superheroe movies. Unfortunately this movie just wasn't it for me.
The main driving factor is the screenplay, or mainly the way the plot was taken care of. The beginning of the movie really threw me off since there was almost no exposition of the characters. I'm aware Aquaman and Mera were technically introduced in Justice League, but that doesn't change the fact that I think a couple of minutes to further present the character interactions would've helped.
Then there's the fact that I felt that some of the action sequences just threw too much into the situation. The film is a great achievement of CGI and Visual Effects, but sometimes less is best. And I'm not talking about the Atlantian effects, because those were perfect and stunning, I mostly refer to the last action sequence where the writers mostly knew the studio would give them millions of dollars, so they decided to go all in.
I applaud James Wan for presenting the underwater scenes in such an amazing way but the ""real-world"" scenes needed to showcase the same amount of quality as the underwater ones, which left the movie feeling really unbalanced.
Something that had never happened to me is being irritated by the score/soundtrack. I think the score did not know exactly what it wanted to do with the movie, and there was no real consistency with the way it wanted to musicalize the film. What was truly absurd was how in the middle of the movie after an intense and big action sequence they decided to throw in an upbeat Pitbull song. I started laughing out loud because I couldn't believe they decided to include that.This movie just didn't work to me as a whole and I got tired in the middle of the movie because of how much was happening. If you're a fan of superheroe movies and love those big budget all in action sequences, then you probably will leave the theatre really satisfied.","5 out of 20 found this helpful.

Add to this the fact that the aforementioned opening sequence is filled with cringe-inducing moments, including those which concern the romantic aspect, which is, in my opinion, the only silly thing that didn't work in the movie.That said, the movie is packed with thrilling, kinetic, and meticulously designed and choreographed action set-pieces, in which you really can follow the action and the liberated fight sequences buoyed by raucous deluge of dazzling array of visual effects. Replicating underwater movement, and offering exotic creatures and characters' outfits that contrast the deep blue sea with splashes of bright colors, James Wan did a tremendous job creating an underwater world that's a visual feast that's consistently boasting a visual feast for the eyes. I enjoyed the out-of-water action sequences more, they are better and more masterfully designed than those that take place underwater; but nothing can compete with the stunning free-flowing underwater action scenes from the visual standpoint.Aside from Furious 7, Wan's filmography is strictly horror related, having launched franchises in his own right with Saw and The Conjuring. Here we can see that he still uses his background in horror to deliver some moments that have shocking and surprising value, and they are quite effective.It's not hard to tell that the entire cast and crew went all out. Their dedication does not go unnoticed. All the cast did their best to give a strong comeback, considering that most of them once had a quite promising and auspicious career. As for Jason Momoa, he really shines as the titular superhero. His physical appearance suits the badass character that the DCEU wanted to make from the get-go. He looks and fights as if he is a WWE superstar! Amber Heard is great, and the chemistry between her Indiana Jonesian character, Mera and Momoa's Aquaman is electric and gripping. They make an awesome dynamic duo, and their sugary cheerful relationship made up for the nauseating, saccharine romance of Tom Curry and Queen Atlanna.The two villains have quite compelling background and convincing motives. And each one's sub-plot never overshadows the other's. Also, Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II are pretty good.Aquaman is An Extremely Cool and Bad-ass Epic Fantasy Adventure of Cheesiness! It's decidedly a step in the right direction for DC. I still think Wonder Woman is the best movie in their extended universe, so far; but Aquaman is now my personal favorite.(8/10)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So I say that the result is more positive than negative, the films of heroes have to be like that, embrace the exaggeration and that the wan did with mastery, do not try to put some kind of sense of reality in something that does not have, stories in comics are very exaggerated and I want to see it on the cinema screen and also have to respect the original material and try to be as faithful as possible to these characters in their respective media, now all that remains is to wait for the 2nd to come.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie has one of the best cinematography of all time, probably falling just shortly behind Avatar. The visuals are stunning. Cinematography aside, this movie is quite dull in terms of plot. It has an extremely thin plot and story buildup. You will be left scratching your head at the sequence. One moment a character appears another moment another character appears. And the worst part is that it is highly predictable. Also character buildup is weak. The villain is a villain for the sake of being a villain. There isn't an extra motivation for why he chose the path of the aggressive. But Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were amazing, and their chemistry was magnificent. The latter will especially be benefited for that. Jason Momoa with his charm steals the show. But we can't say the same for the villain and the plot.

The script is really made overall dramatic and unoriginal. I will say that the music who are matched with the script is not making it any better. And why is there wails dragging ""carriages"" when they have nano technology?! To sum up, I hope the second one has had a whole new crew of employees.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Definte watch, at least once. FYI there is ONE end credit scene before the long end creditsAquaman is the latest movie from DC comics that strays away from being a setup for another movie in the future. It stands together as a solid movie, with heart, stunning visuals and actions sences that are extremely cinematic but it's not without its cheesy moments.Pros: Aquaman, himself, had a good arc and although a little underdeveloped, Mera makes an awesome debut. Same can be said for Black Manta, who is the standout character of the movie, with a good motivation for doing what he does and what he will continue to do.Cons: Ocean Master aka King Orm, the main Villian has some great scenes, and some motivation that does not really blossom into something meaningful.
The movie can get a little cheesy, especially with those close ups.All in all, as I've said it's a solid movie that stands on its own, something that cannot be said for DC's previous endeavours. Along with Wonder Women and Aquaman, DC seems to be heading in the right direction.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Great value for money","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4745818/?ref_=tt_urv","agferguson-43117","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100650000/?ref_=tt_urv","26 March 2019","I've been big fan of Aquaman ever since I started reading about his adventures in DC Comics (hah, Adventure Comics) when I was a very young kid. I grew up on an island where the ocean was the centre of my universe, its all I knew, so reading stories about heroes fighting crime in these large concrete jungles in parts of the world I'd never visited was completely alien to me. You're basically telling me tales of people living on the moon, and I couldn't relate to that. But, heroes that fought crime in the ocean? That was literally my backyard and something that my young mind could wrap its head around.The other part of the story that resonated with me was Arthur's bi-racial and bi-cultural background. He had a foot in both worlds, but was treated like an outsider by each one. That was also a feature of my childhood, growing up as a minority on an island without much of a tie to the culture of the majority.So, Aquaman was my guy.The thing that impressed me the most about the film was the ambitiousness of the filmmakers. They didn't hold back at all when making this movie. Given the underperformance and tepid reception of the DCU films to date (with the exception of Wonder Woman), it's reasonable to expect that the studio would have scaled back the production budget and made a smaller film to reduce their risk and ensure that it turned a profit. But, they didn't. They fully committed to the project and it shows; this is a very expensive looking movie.The other thing that impressed me was how closely the film sticks to the source material. Based upon the rebooted DC Comics New 52 series from the creative team of Geoff Johns, Ivan Reis and Paul Pelletier, they changed very little from the book. Inculcating Jason's Hawaiian heritage into the role of Arthur Curry and changing the sequence of events around Atlanna's time spent on the surface world with Tom Curry (which is cleaner and works better than the comic book) are the only deviations, the rest is exactly like the source material.In this day and age where they're trying to generate broad appeal amongst an audience that has a casual relationship with the character and his world, that's no small feat.The filmmakers also give us the viewing audience an extensive look at Aquaman's universe, taking us from his birthplace in Amnesty Bay to Atlantis and then on to all (or most) of the remaining undersea kingdoms all while introducing us to the main characters from those places. This could have easily caused the film to feel overstuffed, but it doesn't. It really felt like world building, which is something that Marvel has done very well with the MCU, and that allows them to tell stories beyond the typical origin stories going forward. I think this is really important for the ongoing viability of the character because not a lot of people are familiar with him and his universe.All that said, it is a bit of a silly movie, but in a good way. At no point during the film did I find it hard to suspend my disbelief. It wasn't trying to be anything other than what it is; a big, bombastic summer blockbuster tentpole movie. You're not going to find Shakespeare here, but you will find a superhero fantasy film with a little Greek mythology, Lord of The Rings, Indiana Jones, Star Wars and a smattering of horror elements. It blends together seamlessly and creates something unique amongst the superhero genre, not to mention unique amongst the typical origin story we've seen many times.The bottom line is that this movie is fun and engaging, visually stunning with great action sequences supported by a compelling enough story without leaning too heavily on comic book tropes, all while staying very faithful to the source material.This is for me the best DCU movie to date and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next installment with James Wan at the helm.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Quiet moments are rare, and in any case poignant. The water graphics are amazing, and often tasteful. I really don't understand critics who deride this work as too over the top.

The special effects, which are extremely numerous, helped add depth to a story that takes place mostly underwater.Aquaman is frequently teased throughout his life in the comic books. Even Amazon's The Boys does so with sassing the character, The Deep, by saying his only purpose is talking to fish. The film pushes Arthur Curry's character to great physical heights (Jason Momoa shirtless is such a sight to behold). Also, the relationship between a life on land, and a destiny in the ocean, is explored with great depth and emotional toll.A vast history of a people in the ocean is explored through exposition, but it never felt clunky. The film also made mention to Arthur's work with the Justice League by mentioning Steppenwolf as proof that he could be a part of something bigger than himself.The film also has a wonderful supporting cast that never felt cheesy, or forced, to push the plot along. There is such an abundance of action, coupled with historical mythos, that one would feel swept up in the politics of a culture not normally explored.Does this film have a deep message? I couldn't really figure one out, other than sometimes one's life can be more than one thought. Not everyone has royal blood that cannot be ignored forever, nor does their very existence stop a war, but this is merely metaphor. Or this is just an action film and I'm thinking too hard. I went with my second thought, and 2 and a half hours went by in the blink of an eye. I recommend this film, and I'm glad I was wrong when expecting a badly made movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I just like watching movies and really couldn't care less about comics or brands of comics or anything like that. After reading some reviews, I really did expect a mediocre movie and kind of delayed watching it. I don't go to the theater a lot, so I opted for Bumblebee instead of this just because of the negative reviews for Aquaman.I'm not going to go into detail about the movie, but just want to put my opinion out there that this movie is exceptional. It's hard to do an underwater world that doesn't look cheesy, so I think the filmmakers have done the best I've seen so far with the underwater scenes. The storyline is somewhat linear, as all the movies based on comic books are that I have seen. I was entertained the entire movie, thought the battle scenes were very well done, and found the characters interesting.The development of the love story between Mera and Aquaman is simple and predictable, but it's based on a comic book, what do you expect?

"9","/10","Wild Well Direction Crazy Fun Superhero Action Ride","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4739483/?ref_=tt_urv","TheJohnnyPHreak","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur83640126/?ref_=tt_urv","23 March 2019","Interviewer: Our next film I would like to ask you about is Aquaman...JohnnyPHreak: Dude! Holy wow. I mean no disrespect when I say this but Aquaman is the most fun movie to come out of DC/WB.Interviewer: Can you elaborate on that?JohnnyPHreak: Wonder Woman is fantastic. I love that film. Gal Gadot is Diana/Wonder Woman to a T. The film has a decent story, great emotional beats, and some fun action sequences. There are comedic elements and it so cool to watch. It does so much for actress, female-led superhero movies and I don't want to compare them at all. Aquaman is a bananas fun fantasy ride, that us DC Comics fans have been waiting for.Interviewer: So you take DC over Marvel?JohnnyPHreak: If you were to put me on the spot I would easily take DC over Marvel only because DC has my favorite comic book character of all time, Superman. Let me explain Aquaman. I'm not a huge of the character. He's not one of my favorites. But when we finally got to see him serious in the comics and animated films, it did the character justice. (No pun intended) Jason Momoa's take is a bit different but equally as cool and confident. He's not just a man who can talk to fish. He's a bridge between worlds. He's this powerful being who's also a total badass. He's having so much fun being this character is drips off-screen. I can't wait to see more of him. And I hope we get to see more of him interacting with other DC superheroes. One day I'll explain my love of the Justice League movie.Interviewer: Can you give us some of the plot details for those who haven't been following the story?JohnnyPHreak: It's actually pretty simple. Arthur Curry, Aquaman, is half human half Atlantian. His mother fell in love with a human and they had him. His half brother Orm, hates him and the land dwellers, they declare war on the land from the sea. In order to save his world and all of the world, Aquaman has to team up soon to be queen Mira (Amber Heard) to prove to Atlantis that he is the one true king. One the way he makes enemies of a train pirate who goes by Black Manta. The film jumps all over the world in a fun fantasy adventure with elements of Indiana Jones, The Fifth Element and even some old school monster movies.Interviewer: Much as been said about the cast, how are they in this film?JohnnyPHreak: As I said earlier, Momoa is excellent as the Aquaman and easily carries the film whenever he's on screen. Amber Heard is very good as Mira. She's not the helpless damsel in distress. She's a soon to be a queen that cares about her people, her land and is just as capable of kick-ass as Aquaman. The filmmakers did her well. Patrick Wilson as Orm is okay, you get his ideology. He likes to chew scenery and is very over the top in his portrayal but it fits the film he's in. Willem Dafoe is the excellent mentor role, bring his talents to the character. The scene stealer of the film is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Manta. He effectively in what screen time he has to give DC film fans the best villain they've had in all of the DC live action films. His character has weight, style and a personal attachment/grudge with Aquaman. It gives him more depth than most superhero villains get to have. I can't wait to see more of him.Interviewer: This is a big action film, how are the action sequences and direction?JohnnyPHreak: I'm not saying this as hyperbole, James Wan is the best action director working today. He has a few other directors on his heels but I would place him at the time. The action scenes in this film are wild. They are so well shot, so much fun and pretty crazy. He doesn't put himself in a box. He goes for broke and they all shine when happening. There's an opening sequence with Nicole Kidman's Atlanna (who she is great in this) that looks to be filmed in one take. It's jaw-dropping. The film uses neon colors and sets to express this is a fantasy world and it pops. This is a trippy watch but so enjoyable. Wan even gets to go back to his roots with one sequence that is very horror inspired. It's probably my favorite scene in the movie. It's violent, kind of terrifying and feeds into my need for Wan to make a monster movie.
Interviewer: Any final thoughts about Aquaman?JohnnyPHreak: James Wan has created a wonderfully rich and deep universe here with his first superhero entry Aquaman. The whole cast is great with Momoa, Heard, and Abdul-Mateen II being the standouts. The film looks beautiful, including a bunch of sequences shot in IMAX. The action is wild, easy to watch and just fun. The story is not that deep but it spans all over the world. It has the best elements of Indiana Jones with none of the Crystal Skull. All fans of DC should have seen this on the big screen because it's worth the price of admission. But if they couldn't see it in 4K because the transfer is gorgeous. Aquaman was one of my favorite films of 2018 and is now tied for my second favorite DC Comic live action film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So the story is written for teens but the largely-underwater VFX are pretty striking, that's where the attention and money went. And to fully enjoy it, you'll need a 3D TV if you hung onto yours from 2012. That extra dimension is essential, especially when it's filmed for it.

A lot of actors in this movie, most of which I don't think much of. The only good/great actor in this movie is Willem Defoe, Nicole Kidman's only good acting job was 'To Die For'. The plot seemed convoluted and ridiculous, even for a comic, and worst of all, I couldn't care less which character died! After reading this quick review you might wonder why I gave it 5 stars not 2, the reason is because it's impossible not to compare it to the Marvel movies. As a movie it is watchable, just. But why do the DC movies in general seem so childish compared to the Marvel movies. One of the best movie trilogies of the last 30 years was Nolan's Batman, what's gone so very wrong. I think the main problem is the lack of darkness. These are superhero movies, you can show evil and still attain a PG certificate. Watch The Empire Strikes back for proof.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As at the time it was released people talked a lot about the film and even the critics praised it I expected a little more (not so much morr), but it's so bad that it forced me to create an account and make a review.It really feels like satire, for a moment I even thought it might be. Even for a teen movie there are so many logical flaws in the script, the narrative sequence just doesn't make sense, the action scenes and new characters are placed in an absurdly forced way, the stories are without the slightest depth and shouldn't hold the attention or a child. But worst of all are the special effects: it'so bad.

The effects an CGI that is used is amazing, just as any other new marvel movie at this point. But the bad acting and plot actually made me look away from the movie because of pure embarrassment. What a shame of such good visual effects! I enjoyed every single fight although, but then the mood is killed again when Pitbulls awful version of the timeless classic ¬´Africa¬ª by Toto. I was again embarrassed. Not much to spoil in this movie either because it simply contains every superhero cliche ever, and not in a funny way such as in the ¬´Deadpool¬ª movies. Of course the movie works and excites, but not enough for me to get scared of the beloved ¬´aquaman¬ª and his ¬´death¬ª.The movie also tries too make the audience laugh in some of the scenes, which for me I felt falled through. It felt so fake and scripted that i wondered who thought it was a good idea. The only actor who made me laugh at one point of the movie was the aquaman himself Jason Momoa. He handled the cheesy lines of the script okay, and he made the movie easier too watch. I felt ripped of after I left the cinema, and it was not at all worth the money!

The negatives outweigh ten fold in this mediocre, but consistent with DC bombs, film. The cringe worthy characters and over the top clich√© sequences between father and son (Villains) or the cheesy betrayals and shortsighted plot are the bulk of this mess. This could have been a real stand alone flick given the star power but only Willem Dafoe stood out but only because he's a straight up lunatic and everyone loves him. This is literally a really expensive Power Rangers episode with the same bad dialogue, acting and ""super villain"" complete with bad costume and all.

Also the themes in this movie were old fashioned in some really disturbing ways.. without spoilers, one of the characters - a female character- actually defends her own arranged marriage!!! Puke! Why is this relevant to an American audience?
My suggestion: if youre gonna watch it, watch it on mute. you'll roll your eyes less,","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Bad for a superhero movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4765351/?ref_=tt_urv","JakeBrinkman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39634854/?ref_=tt_urv","6 April 2019","I love superhero movies and shows, and this is the lowest I've ever rated one since the Iron Fist series. Don't get me wrong, 5 stars still means it was worth the watch, but I probably won't be rewatching this movie. There were two positives about the film. The first is the action, which is unquestionably amazing. It's very well-coordinated that I couldn't help but feel awed by some of the scenes, even while I wasn't emotionally invested in the scene.The second good aspect was Momoa. His devil-may-care attitude and raw prowess translate well to the big screen. This new take on Aquaman is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre... except that it was already fresh in Justice League and he isn't ever given anything better than we've already seen, even in his own movie. Momoa does well in spite of it, but the character was not written as well as he should have been. In fact, even the emotional scenes where Momoa could have flexed his acting talents were given to a different actor by only occurring in flashbacks with a younger actor. It's difficult to get emotionally invested in a movie when it seems like the main character doesn't feel strongly about anything.As for the other characters, Wilson and Mateen both perform decently. Not outstanding since their one-dimensional characters had no depth, but also having enough potential to keep the viewer engaged if not satisfied. The story occasionally tries to touch on the villain's emotions, but the limited screen time never allows them to dive in. I truly believe the movie should have toned down the epic war scenes and focused on establishing Aquaman as a character along with introducing an intimidating low-threat villain with a little depth, like was done in Spider-Man: Homecoming. They could have easily done this by keeping Black Manta as the sole villain. Then they could saving the jaw-dropping spectacles for Aquaman 2, where Oceanmaster would be the main villain and they could have more screen time to explore Oceanmaster's ruthlessness and dynamic with Aquaman. Combining them into one film made for a movie so rushed that neither villain's story had any emotional weight.As for other actors, this is where we start getting from bad to worse. Not that any performances were outright bad, but they were certainly given horrible dialogue. Nearly all of the dialogue for Mera and occasional lines for everyone else were so cliched and/or cringe-worthy that it honestly makes you think the movie would have been better if the character didn't say anything at all at that moment. The worst moment was the Pinocchio joke; the joke itself was great, but the minute-long explanation of the joke actually had me squirming out of my seat with embarrassment for the entire superhero genre. Some of the other jokes were fine, but all of the subversive humor was awful. Subversive humor has already been overused in the Marvel series, so even though it was new for the DC series, it still felt contrived and unoriginal. In a movie with an entire franchise riding on it, screenwriting is not where you should start making budget cuts.On the subject of budget cuts, the budget could have been significantly smaller if a less-known actor was cast in the place of Defoe. Defoe is a great actor whose talents were absolutely wasted in this one-dimensional emotionless character (though he would have been good spread out with more screen time in my 2 movie idea). Again, no fault of the actor, but definitely a fault of the screenwriter.If it seems like my review is overly harsh, its because the superhero genre has given us a high standard to expect. This movie fell short in every single aspect, and it is definitely the fault of the poor screenwriting. Warner Brothers shouldn't have hired two relatively inexperienced low-budget writers for such a high-budget film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Traditionally, this mighty king was known as an Aryan-looking Atlantean who wore orange and green spandex. In addition to his striking fashion he wielded an intimidating golden trident, representing power, in defence of his kingdom. However, in the most recent movie, this stalwart image is replaced with a powerful Hawaiian who is covered in tribal tattoos and shaggy hair. This change brought shock to DC fans across the world. They were expecting tradition, similarity to the comic books that they so dearly loved. This is one of the many reasons why Aquaman is receiving questionable reviews. If evaluated solely on entertainment, a story about a forbidden child who returns to claim the throne from a tyrant and saves billions of lives in the process, the movie sounds extremely interesting. However, the plot was weak, the acting was far from perfect and aside from the occasional surprise, the 2 ¬Ω hour movie was fairly predictable.
Just years ago, the mere mention of creating an ""Aquaman"" movie was quite literally laughed upon in HBO's ""Entourage"" series as he was considered relatively useless to the DC family. However, in a year when no fewer than 10 superhero movies were created, ranging from Incredibles 2 to Black Panther, it suddenly seemed logical to give life to such a well known hero. When I initially saw the previews for this movie, I was ecstatic! I loved reading books about Aquaman as a child and I considered him an inspiring hero. However, as the movie began, I better understood why the Entourage series considered him a joke. First and foremost, there were key details and storylines that did not follow the comic books in any way, shape, or form. For example, the true Aquaman from the comics was a broken man when he was first introduced to Atlantis, yet he overcame an internal struggle and became the man we know him as. Jason Momoa on the other hand, is a boistrus lad who enjoys drinking and fighting with little to no care in the world. When we think of the DC heroes, who comes to mind? A man of matchless strength named Superman? A human vigilante known as Batman? Or how about one of the very first female superheros who is generally known as Wonder Woman? The common ground that these three have is their ability to fight for truth and right in a magnificent way due to their extraordinary gifts and talents. Aquaman is considered by many to be the ""butt of pop culture jokes"", as stated by IGN, because he simply is a man who can swim really fast, talk to fish and breathe underwater. Although this is extremely useful while underwater in his kingdom, many of his talents and gifts do not extend beyond the realm of Atlantis. His strength and instincts are quite impressive regardless of where he is, however, in the earthly realm he is not much of a ""superhero."" Because of this, many consider him quite useless, especially if the DC heroes were suddenly needed, for example, to defend the world from an alien invasion as we commonly see in modern films.
As the movie went on, I found myself bored a times and able to predict scenes fairly consistently. The events were great in theory, but there was simply too much plot and it all moved too fast to really get attached to anyone or anything. By the time you begin to appreciate something, another equally important scene happens and you quickly forget what had just taken place. Marvel, in comparison, does a phenomenal job of weaving together scenes full of action, with simple and informative scenes. Through this, we are able to understand and come to love certain characters, rather than just watching them constantly fight throughout the course of the movie.
Finally, a storyline with as much anticipation as Aquaman brings immediate interest and enthusiasm. However, throughout the movie, certain pieces do not fall into place and we begin reminiscing on the comics and the heros that we idolized all those years ago. I would recommend this movie if you are interested in the DC Universe and want to watch a movie that doesn't require much emotional investment. However, not only was the plot extremely weak, the acting was par at best. If you are interested in a memorable movie that will touch your heart or inspire you, this is far from what you would enjoy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But, dare I say it? It is pretty fun! Not fun as in this is a good movie, because this is trash, but fun as in it tries so hard and it fails, and it has so many moments I burst into laughter over how inapt and dumb it is. The main ""bad"" guy is so hilarious I can almost recommend this movie for him alone.There are soooooo many stupid moments, and that B-movie feel never washes away (pun intended), and we see some weird attempts to make political statements - and those facts together ruin the movie.
The basic plot is very generic and those comparing this movie to Black Panther would not be wrong, it is very similar, almost copy paste similar.I am being generous and give this movie a 2/10.Would I recommend this? Ouhm... not really. I mean if you get a bottle of Whiskey that you can empty and throw in the Ocean, like Aquaman like to do, and you watch this movie at the same time it might not be so bad.
This is the second best movie of the DCEU so far, after Wonder Woman. Imagine that, 2/10 and it is the second best movie of an entire franchise... how is that for a record? Yea, yea, plenty of weirdo people went out to see this movie mostly because they spend enormous amount of money on marketing in China, but also other strange folk. Why? What the... *beep*... made you think that this would be a good idea? Together with the Transformers movies Aqaman is the dumbest movie of all time that has made so much money.Super generic, B-movie, badly acted, bad CGi, horrible villains (but also funny!), flat story and script.

When you meet a villain, evil music plays. When you meet a hero, good music plays, and their hair blows in the wind - nothing is left to the viewer to figure out. Whoever did the music for this movie...should find a new career path. There is a scene where they go to Africa, and a version of the song ""Africa"" is played...pure cringe. The characters are undeveloped, and Jason Momoa, while visually a perfect action hero, cannot deliver authentic emotion through Aquaman's dialogue (I prefer him speaking Dothraki). The fighting scenes were shot beautifully, but there was so much screen time devoted to fight scenes that they became boring...I mean, we already know who's going to win. The other annoying thing was the cheap strategy of having an extremely quiet moment followed by an incredibly loud noise to startle you - it would've been fine to employ this strategy once, but it happened about four times in the movie, as if the writers couldn't think of any other way to create excitement.

Directed by James Wan. Written by Geoff Johns, James Wan, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will BeallAquaman is a character that many people have long since thought to be an incredibly silly idea. He talks to fish and lives underwater. He will sometimes fight crimes taking place on the high seas. Justice League introduced him to the world as a beer chugging bad ass saving the world from aliens. No one and I mean nobody thought this movie would have been good or even a success for that matter. It was a huge success. Was the movie any good though? Eh somewhat.This is a very busy film. Something is always happening at a fast pace. They are having a scene on the beach where Willem Dafoe's character Vulko is training Jason Momoa's Aquaman to fight for the throne in the future, the camera is spinning around and around and around. This is just one example. The underwater scenes are filled with so much detail. It is incredible to watch what all these animators are able to accomplish. What those hundreds of thousands of animators working overtime for exposure were able to accomplish is impressive. I am of the mind that when a movie is this full of CGI, it might as well be an animated movie. There is almost nothing in it that's real. It's beautiful and impressive but not real.The thing about this movie is it's not a superhero film. At least not in the traditional sense. It's a prophecy film, a fantasy film. Kingdoms warring over the throne. It's without a doubt a fantasy film. It works in those perimeters. It delivers this world and all the characters work in simplistic terms. The movie is incredibly flashy and won't stop. It tells you what you're supposed at every turn. While all the visuals are filled with details, the script and characters are delivered in the most basic way. They have only character trait and they play it well. I didn't believe a word of it with the exception of Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master.Man he plays it up. He is acting his ass off. Most of the time he is solemn and barely shows emotion. Not as Ocean Master, he is selling the evil and his bigotry against the surface dwellers and his brother. He was the best part for me. I don't know why but man I laughed at him calling himself Ocean Master but he was going to be the best Ocean Master he could be. He was true to Atlantis and its way of life. He's tired of the pollution and he wants to control all the kingdoms to wage war against the surface for their constant crap.I didn't feel any suspense because Aquaman is basically invincible unless he's fighting King Orm. This is a trend in recent superhero movies, I know this is not a superhero film generally, where the hero is so powerful that nothing seems to phase them. I hate it. My favorite heroes have flaws and have to work to win or survive. Aquaman is way too powerful to feel like anything won't go his way.In the end, it's entirely too long. It is entirely too flashy. It could have benefited from slowing down just a bit but the visuals are terrific, Patrick Wilson is stealing the show and it is fun for most of the runtime. I give this movie a C.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Nothing could change my mind; even if the movie's lack of continuity was an artistic decision to comment on movies with a lack of continuity, the movie's attempt is way too unintentional to ever pass as one.

I wouldn't advice watching it. Whoever wrote the script put almost no effort. The only creative thing there was the costumes and the soundtrack at the end.

I love DC. Their comics are far better than Marvel's but let's be honest... Marvel is killing it with it's movies. I have hoped for the same thing with DC. I have actually been a fan of most DC movies. I absolutely loved Justice League! Wonder woman was great but I could do without Professor Lupin being the villain with his jacked God body and little nerdy head. Still great though. Suicide squad was good except for the weird intros for each character and the dumb witch villain. People are going to hate me but Batman vs Superman THE EXTENDED EDITION was honestly really good. Aquaman.....lands dead last. I rarely write reviews and I only do it if I feel strongly about a film and feel other reviewers got it wrong. Everything I read was ""DC's best film,"" ""Better than Wonder Woman"" ""DCs headed in the right direction now"". They were all lies. Like I said I liked all the other DC movies. Why they got criticized so harshly and this is praised I am baffled. From beginning to the very end it was awful. I would not even recommend renting this. It was a waste of a night for me. I will say if you like Transformers then you'll probably like this. Dumb jokes, a lot of special effects, zero character development, and a poor story. Fits the Transformer mold to me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It looks gorgeous. Bright colors, fantastic design of Atlantis, Subnautica-esque bioluminescence. But it feels shallow. There are a lot of underwater scenes, but they never feel like underwater, they feel like everything is floating in zero-G. Nothing in the water, no cavitation, no resistance, everything flies around in top speed like in a space opera. Nothing has weight or feels physical. The fight scenes are well done but become repetitive quite fast.The actors do very well, but are battling with a boring clich√© script. The dialogue is wooden. The story is riddled with clumsy exposition and pointless McGuffins. The characters never come alive. You never feel for them. They never make any meaningful choice that is not obvious. The characters are sad fillers for an idiots adaptation of the monomyth used as an excuse to show of CGI. The villains are beyond one-dimensional.This makes the whole thing a waste of very good production quality for a forgettable boring move that feels like fast-forwarding through a B-tier video game.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Aquaman is proof that studios want to be safe, have fun, and pump out something for the masses.
The amount of green screen kept throwing me out of the experience, not because it was used but because it was consistently noticeable. The overall theme was to be aware of human pollution and how it affects parts of the world we can not see.
The cliche witty dialogue was also expected but it was the amount of dramatic pauses and slow motions that were unbearable.
Breaking bread, I will say that the choice to track the action versus cutting between shot was refreshing and there were certain visual shots that were great - a favorite being the trench dive.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I gave it three stars because it is shiny (not unique shininess though). But the film felt forced and rambling. I took my dog out to pee and didn't miss anything important. It is long and boring. I did think the swirly red scene was interesting visually, but that 30 seconds just seemed to fly bu.

For me, it's completely normal, and ridiculous. the plot twist was so easy to guess that why when aquaman's mom still alive, me absolutely no suprises at all. The script is pretty weird. It made aquaman to become a coward because when he lost the battle, but he was saved by his brother's fianc√©e (??) i mean, its so damn weird!! The circuit kept jumping. And the man who lost his father, i thought he would play a big role in making Aquaman trouble in saving the Alantis. And he was defeated easily in spite of having a super armor... And King Orm (is that right) was much stronger than Aquaman. Just because aquaman had a trident, and he is the lead male so he won. That made me unable to submit this result and the power of Aquaman. Its suck!
My english is not so good to make a long comment so...","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

However, if you happen to desire a movie with a script, a storyline and actual acting, then you will pass Aquaman by. This is one of the worst movies that I have seen in years. I cannot tell you the number of bad movies which I have watched hoping that they will improve before the movie ended. However, I knew that that would never happen with Aquaman, so I actually left with about 30 minutes to go so that my entire evening would not be a total waste of time!!! It is, therefore, my recommendation that you save 143 minutes of your life that you will never get back and go to the movies to see something else other than Aquaman.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

Up until a few years ago , I was a fan of DC, but I'm beginning to lose hope as I've been constantly disappointed by every DC movie since Dark Knight.
Lack of a reasonable and logical screenplay destroyed the big budget and wasted the ambitions of this movie.
At the end , I can confess that there were two positives that nailed me to my seat, sound editing and cinematography, which were both Oscar worthy.

It wasn't for someone interested in superheroes for the characters, the great complicated story lines, the always in the background morality of great power and what you do with it.This movie had none of that. Aquaman is like a teenager who's being forced to clean his room. Nothing he does is because he feels he wants to, or because he should do, or because he cares about something. That may be a little unfair, I think his motivation is wanting to look cool.The script is terrible. The acting is sub par. The plot doesn't make sense.

The rest of the film with the contrast of Momoa's super strength and action one minute to his fear of fast getaways the next was just frustrating. The other actors performances I felt were devoid of any real feeling or believability in the roles.And I'll only mention once the fact the Atlantean realm which is suppose to be continuing from its ancient origins of little contact with surface dwellers, that virtually all the ""human"" looking denizens were all north European looking folks. Exactly opposite from even most European scientists explanations of what any ancient peoples would look like, which would be darker skinned because of atmosphere/conditions.Like most, I've seen many, many films through the years, but there are few hyped so much that I disliked as intensely as this one.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I do think that he fits the character and can bring a lot to it. The the problem is the lack of directions he received while playing this role.Everything in this movie looks like Disney threw up on it. It is so colorful and bubbly. Maybe too much.Everything is just CGI so people get disconnected from what they are watching. I was paying more attention to the CGI flowing hair and not the dialogue. The music is not very good and does not suit the movie at all. Character development is minimum done through a lot of exposition at the beginning of the movie. The villain is just laughable and funny looking.I do have to give then credit when it comes to the costume design on Aquaman. I was really curious how would they translate the costume from the cartoon in real life and they did a pretty good job.It's the king a movie made more for kids rather than all age groups.

That's a big mistake by the folks at DC and Marvel: remaking and remaking each character so they don't look at all like what we knew as kids. Taking this into account, the rest of the story is known: a queen appears lying near a lighthouse, is picked up by a caretaker who looks like a Latino, they have a son who looks like a Samoan, who later meets his brother who He is Caucasian and then falls in love with a dyed redhead. I forgot; one of the villains is black. Here Aquaman is a drunkard, partier, with a childish attitude and with small details of humor. With that in mind we started. The story then through a very long sequence of events that are only explained thanks to the large budget for visual effects. In the middle of the movie your eyes hurt. The ending is like Lord of the Rings without the epic or the depth of that masterful trilogy. The film is entertaining but has nothing to make it unforgettable.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The CGI is amazing, visually speaking, is stunning, I liked the representation of Atlantis and its creatures, it seems a scifi city, but underwater, being a fan of futuristic stuff. I simply loved it and I think that is one of the best SFX that I've watched recently. The problem is that, exactly like in ""Man of Steel"", the movie is overloaded of computer generated images. In fact you there are more CGI, than filmed scenes. You really wonder why they didn't just made an animation movie in motion capture. I can understand that the underwater location is actually very difficult to create stunt scenes, but with a budget of 160 million dollars (source: IMDb movie page), they could have come up with something.Costumes are simply horrible. I don't even know who approved them. Soldier costumes are a mix between a space suit and a diver suit. Without any doubt, the lowest point is Black Manta. It seems a bug, that you can easily crush. I laughed when I saw it. The actor that played him was really bad, not credible as a villain. They should definitely make better casting decision in Warner Bros. Speaking of which, I was really disappointed by Patrick Wilson, I think that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood and I watched many movies starring him, such as the entire saga of ""The Conjuring"", ""Insidious"" and I loved his interpretation in ""Watchmen"", so he even has already experience with superhero movies. In ""Aquaman"" was underwhelming and not credible at all as a villain, even less than Black Manta. He didn't even tried to create a credible character: no personality and no charisma. Jason Momoa is the usual supermacho guy that will always be stuck in this kind of roles, exactly like Vin Diesel, but at least this was a good choice, and actually I liked him playing Arthur.The DC Extended Universe has a lot of potentialities, but they are simply wasting it. Stop doing movies drugged of CGI like this one or ""Justice League"", give us some real actions, more stunts scenes like in ""Wonder Woman"", or ""Shazam!"" Stop creating this mindless movies with always the same story, try at least something different, as in ""Batman V. Superman"". DC is capable to create good movies if it wants to, and I have reported three valid examples. Let's only hope that the second Wonder Woman and ""Birds of Prey"" movies, will be good.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But if it's just you, save it for later.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The biggest thing was the cringey dialogue, really put me off the character development cause I couldn't accept a real human being would talk like they did in this movie. It's jarring to say the least. But Jason as Aquaman was a really great choice and I'm glad he was in it. I'm numb to everyone else.

They figured out Marvel movies are much better accepted by the audience, they tried to make one Marvel style film and they failed miserably. Honestly this story needs at least 1 more hour to be told without rushing. Half of the scenes that are performed by Jason, Amber, Nicole and almost every other actor are extremly cringey. And I don't even want to talk about graphics that look like video game, it's beautiful but it's unreal, and I know it's not supposed to be quite realistic but at several moments I was very disturbed by graphics. The whole story is just bad and cheap and honestly if it wasn't DC movie and if it was done with less money everyone would see that it isn't that good. Is it the worst superhero movie, nope. Is it the best superhero movie, definitely 100% no. Is it good, that's debatable. In my opinion, no, but hey people seem to love it.

Overall I left the theater feeling like I had been cheated out of two and a half hours of my life and 20 bucks.

I'm one of those weird people that really likes Zack Snyder's take on the Superman and Batman stories. There's real cinematic ambition at work there, and while its reach may exceed its grasp, it tries to be mythic in scope. James Wan's Aquaman is a very different animal. It's certainly big and obviously very expensive, but the film feels smaller, and its not the stakes at play. Also, it seems obvious that Wan's time making mediocre popcorn horror films have not taught him the ins and outs of how to build a story.Looking through some positive reviews of the film I see some common themes. There's a lot of praise for the visuals, the special effects, the action, and the humor. Well, the movie certainly very often looks quite expensive and it sometimes does look pretty good (especially the Trench attack late in the film), but this is mostly praise for a film's ability to hire hundreds of visual effects artists more than anything else. A lot of this is to do with the movie's poor world building.The story first, though. Arthur Curry is the son of the queen of Atlantis and some guy who lives in a house by the sea in New England. Being the son of the queen of Atlantis, he has special water powers like breathing underwater and swimming really fast and, apparently, being just this side of invincible. After his mother gets torn from him at a very young age, Nuidis, the vizier from Atlantis, comes and trains him for years in short little scenes that don't even amount to a training montage. After the events of Justice League, Arthur is somewhat responsible for the death of a pirate, leaving the pirate's son itching for murder. In the middle of the ocean, Orm, Arthur's half-brother from their mother and another Atlantian, is consolidating power to become the Ocean Master and wage war on the surface. This doesn't sit well with Nuidis or Mera, Orm's betrothed and daughter to another of the sea kings. They go off to recruit Arthur to challenge Orm and become King of Atlantis.So, when this movie isn't giving us really expensive special effects shots of submarines, giant seahorses, and vibrantly colored underwater cities, it's giving us really boring scenes where people with names we cannot remember explain things to other people with names we cannot remember. In most movies, these would be done in bland environments, but in Aquaman, they're done in, well, bland environments with some thin layers of water effects around them. Seriously, most of the world building in this film is Orm flatly explaining to people his plan to consolidate power without giving us a clear view of who in Earth he's talking about.Then, for really inexplicable reasons, the movie decides to become an Indiana Jones knockoff for about forty minutes where Arthur and Mera have to take a thing to a place where they get another thing which they have to take to another place which directs them to another place and finally directs them to the Trench, one of the seven kingdoms under the sea. This is where the funny is supposed to come in, but like pretty much every scene in the film, nothing here feels fleshed out enough to carry any amount of character beyond some quick quips (which, of course, means that Arthur and Mera are going to totally fall in love by the end). I would say it's an excuse to get them out of the way of Orm so that Orm can consolidate more power while they're away, but they end up trapped in the Trench with no escape at one point. Instead of having a forty minute and unsatisfying Indiana Jones knockoff, they could have given us twenty minutes of the pair trying to find a way out, getting to know each other, and then finding the surprise guest near the end.For a movie that's a hundred and sixty minutes long, it does feel shockingly short in some ways, and that's because it doesn't spend any time with any single scene beyond those that demand lots of special effects, like fights. It's paced very quickly, and that ends up being a bad thing because it makes the film very thin where character interactions feel perfunctory rather than meaningful.And, the special effects. Again, this movie very often looks expensive, but it only occasionally looks good. The approach to the Trench, when Arthur and Mera have to jump from their rinky dink boat and into the water (why two creatures that can swim much faster than a small boat can putter along actually take the boat, I do not know) actually looks really striking as Arthur holds out a series of flares that lights them and the swarm of creatures trying to get to them that surrounds them. However, the flight through Atlantis offers a good counterpoint. It's full of colors and it looks like a team of digital artists spent hundreds of hours each on every little detail to bring it out, but it ends up feeling flat because we don't get any sense of what anything we're seeing is. This is where some actual world building would have benefited the film, allowing us time to explore Atlantis a bit with Arthur as our eye and ears into this new world, learning about what's going on in this fantastic city. Instead, they quickly move to a sunken ship where they hide away from the special effects and then have a fight.I really did not like this movie. It's thin with little focus and an almost complete inability to tell a story. I imagine it's not going to age particularly well for those who were blown away by it on their first viewing.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie is populated by stock characters that are neither likeable nor interesting. However, the movie's biggest failure is its cheesiness. Unfortunately, it isn't the good, funny kind of cheesiness, but the utterly annoying one. Not a scene went by that didn't make me cringe, either because of bad acting, bad writing, or bad directing.

The acting is awful (except Amber Heard, Mara, who is good 1/2 of the time). The first 15 minutes are a competition between Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Nicole Kidman (the Queen) and Amber Heard for who is the most arrogant, stereotyped character. Kidman (usually a great actress) comes in a close second to Momoma for the most obnoxious character.Then there's the story. What an incoherent mess. This seems to be something Wan struggles with as he had the same problems in Star Trek 3 (which was also an incoherent mess). The story has no continuity and only the flimsiest of arcs. The characters are the most cliched I've seen in many years. I thought it was a spoof at times.I will give Wan credit though. He's seriously politically correct. If there's a box to be ticked, irrespective of talent, Wan will do it. However, this movie had a black villain and a female who didn't win every fight. Then, the male and female lead weren't antagonistic to each other - there was actually some romance (naughty, naughty Mr Wan). Finally, Kidman and Heard become doe-eyed and say ""Aquaman saved me, what a hero"". I nearly died! That was the sort of rubbish that only made it Into the worst of movies 50-60 years ago. Far too much of the time I felt like I was watching a b-grade direct to TV.This movie will not stand the test of time. There are very few super-hero movies that will. However, this one was definitely below par. Down there with Wonder Woman, Black Panther and some of the Avengers films.Score: I only gave it 3/10 because it made me laugh at the stream of cliches and it had nice visual effects of Atlantis. I'd almost give it 4 for those two aspects alone, however, delivering bad performances from Defoe and Kidman?!? That's hard to do for a capable director. So, 3/10 stays.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This genre has become the cashcow everyone wants to slap, and this movie fits perfect into it.
It's no risk and no fun.The main characters aswell as the storyline are really plain, it's working, but it's really far from unique and demanding. It feels like they put their hand in a box filled with every fantasy and super hero clichee and hold tight to anything they could grab at once. The result is a highly generic story with a utter lack of depth.The dialoges work just the same way. Not as bad as for example in Thor 2 but the only upside is the ultra manly voice of Aquaman. Besides that it's just another movie where the writers have let the characters articulate the plot.Visually I find most of the ""upper world"" scenes well set, and much of the CGI looks pretty good. But there are not just a few flaws where physics look extremely off, the usage of green/bluesreens gets visible or animations don't fit(like the scepter spinning from Dafoe).
The overall lighting is definitely on the pro side.The design of the atlantean world and especially it's soldiers is probably a matter of taste, it doesn't hook me. Another key aspect of creating a fantastic world in a unusual atmosphere is the proper sound design which, in this case, is not striking at all. It's always a littler too saturated, too heavy to feel authentic and constantly flees into a conglomerate of basic dramatic fantasy sound settings and epic battle music.The fights ain't spectacular but appropriate.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The DC has step up their game - this is another level. Never had I expected this movie will this be good, after the Justice League and Batman V Superman because those movies are trash - and let's forget about those. This is the most ambitious comic-book movie I've ever seen so far. Finally a movie that DC fanboy deserves, this film is just beautiful within the cinematography, visuals, also the action scenes. The action scenes kinda remind me of Romanticism painting, it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I'm not a fan of James Wan movies but he did a marvelous job for Aquaman. The cast are outstanding, badass performances. I don't think any actors can take the role of Aquaman better than Jason Momoa. The atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has high-quality than any DCEU film. Finally we can see the light after those dark days. It has clear motivations for both heroes and villains, pretty solid.But, DCEU really need to fix their poor lines. The writing isn't the best - some dialogues are still cheesy & awkward. Nothing new for the plot, but it is simply enough - almost the same with any superhero film - save the world, family issues, etc. But it has a great message about polluting the water. Also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss. And I don't see how and why Black Manta is the best villains, his story kinda flat and lacking for me. Black Manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villain.Afterall, this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans. Also you have to watch it in an IMAX 3D.

I love these characters and and constantly let down. Jason Momoa is great and I would see a sequel, but the writing was Sky High level corny. Constantly through the film Ryan Reynolds saying ""well that's lazy writing"" popped into my head. The editing was good visually it was great but whenever people spoke or even some of the dramatic pauses I couldn't help but cringe. I felt like the Power Rangers reboot was less cringy and campy. Once again Jason us perfect for this role I think they tried making it more light-hearted but instead they made it more cartoonish. I'm pretty sure they used a ""womp womp"" sound at one point for comedic affect. Anyways that's just my venting about this.

The Verdict. Jason Momoa Was Cool And Bad Ass As ""Aquaman"", I'm Not a Fan Of Amber Heard Films But i Have To Say i Thought She Did Great Job Of Playing This Hero Character Named ""Mera"", Especially Her And Aquaman Are Helping Each Other Out Also By Having Them Saving The Day And The Two Of Them Also Share a Kissing Scene, Patrick Wilson From Zach Snyder's Dark Superhero Film ""Watchmen"" Where He Plays The ""Nite Owl"" Character, Also He Has Started in Two Of ""Insidious Films, And Two Of ""The Conjuring Films"", in Aquaman He Plays Aquaman's Evil Half Brother Named ""King Orm"" Who Wants To Rule The Entire Underwater Atlantis And Of Becoming The Ultimate King Of Atlantis Which Was a Pretty Good Bad Guy Character To Play, Tamuera Morrison From ""Star Wars Episode 2 "" The Attack Of The Clones"" Where He Played The Bounty Hunter Character Named ""Jango Fitt"" in Aquaman He Plays Arthur Curry's Father Which Was Cool To See Him Again in a Movie, Then We Three Big Superstars Like Nicole Kidman Who Plays Aquaman's Mother Named ""Atlanna"" Who Has a Bad Ass Action Moment Sequence Scene it Was To See Her Play a Defferent Kind Of Character Role, The Always Great William Dafoe From ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", The First ""John Wick Film"" And My Favorite Film in Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" Where in Aquaman He Plays ""Vulko"" Who is Aquaman's Mentor And Teaching Him Of How To Learn Of Fighting And Showing Him Of Using Powers To Speak To Underwater Sea Creatures And Finally There's Action icon Star Dolph Lundgren Who Plays ""King Nereus"" Who's Also Mera's Father, Now For Me i Thought He Was Awesome To See in An Superhero Action Film For The First Time Well Not Since He First Played The ""Frank Castle"" a.k.a ""The Punisher"" Character in 1989s ""The Punisher"".

""I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.""Oh, DC. I thought you'd learned! Wonder Woman was proof, wasn't it? All of the elements of great movie storytelling were present. It was wonderfully cast, carefully scripted. The film evolved at a crisp, but comfortably artistic pace, a tribute to careful editing. And when the magnificent amazon finally revealed her power at exactly the right moment as she stepped majestically onto the battlefield? Goosebumps.So, how do you explain the obvious regression of Aquaman?The casting is...meh. Jason Momoa is a fine, physical specimen of the fish man, but his hero is startlingly flat. The rest of the cast might work fine if this was a made for television movie, but it isn't. It's a major theatrical vehicle and DC has failed to bring in a suitable stable of supporting actors to carry the weight. And even though it's unfair to continually compare the DC universe to Marvel's, the parallel is unescapable. Ant Man, who ranks in the Marvel pantheon probably even lower than where Aquaman stands in the DC hero collection, carries two stand-alone movies effortlessly. Aquaman struggles from the beginning of the film, through its tedious center, to its final cheesy conclusion to justify the film's reason to live. Storytelling is the key, and where Wonder Woman earned a well-deserved A, Aquaman receives an equally merited D. Perhaps if the writers had chosen to meditate for two hours on the character's back story and built methodically toward a big reveal, I might be submitting a very different review. But instead the writing bumps along like an old roller coaster, jerking us through rickety rails of track, always in a hurry to get us to the steep climb and the furious fall to the end. None of it is satisfying. Instead of feeling like a big budget superhero film, the movie increasingly feels like a sad mishmash of Godzilla and Finding Nemo, although Nemo did a much better job of creating an interesting undersea world.DC continues to give us heroes but can't seem to connect us to them. It's the primary flaw in the DC universe. It's characters are too cold and detached from the audience. It's a problem that will only be fixed through better movie storytelling.I rank movies like I rank potatoes, because I love potatoes. Aquaman receives my Instant Mashed Potatoes ranking which roughly translates this way. They will do if you're in a hurry, but they generally suck. And in this case, Raj was right. These taters suck underwater.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Dark Knight was just a few minutes longer than this movie. Though the effects and fighting choreography were much better...what the movie lacks is an interesting plot. I fell asleep halfway through it and kept checking my watch to see how much longer the movie was. The Dark Knight, though several years older, still has a better story and is still worth investing my time to watch. You feel connected to the characters and even though you know how it's going to end, you still want to see the Dark Knight all the way to its ending. Aquaman feels like a fish of water, you know what's going to happen, everything is boring and repetitive from other superhero movies. We can't compare Aquaman to Marvel, because the way they were written in the comics are very much different. But comparing this to DC movies like the Dark Knight, it clearly falls short of the water a fish out of water needs. Boring, too long, and obviously a terrible super hero movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

After watching it the first time, I found it hard to escape the realisation of how ridiculous the whole thing is. That being said, I also found it entertaining. That was the first time though. The second time I watched it was about a month later. Viewing movies twice is often a valuable experience. Quite often you spot little things you missed the first time around, but which add to the appreciation of the film. Sadly, with Aquaman, what I spotted was the movies flaws: how really banal the dialogue is, how bad the acting is and how preposterous the plot is. I missed those 'nuances' the first time as I was bombarded by the spectacle of it all. On second viewing, even that spectacle seemed cartoonish and obviously CGI-heavy. The writer(s) hardly miss a superhero movie cliche in this story. The movie tries to take a tongue-in-cheek approach at times, but the humour is quite lame. Much of what is enjoyable about this movie can be attributed to the charisma of Jason Mamoa who plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman - the first Polynesian superhero. His Aquaman scarcely resembles the character found on television and in comic books and is, in some respects, almost an anti-hero. He's not Deadpool, but he's going in that direction. Jason Mamoa isn't a great actor. I'm not even sure he's a good actor, but he's certainly charismatic and, I guess, that's what matters most in this type of film. It also helps that this movie doesn't spend the first hour or so explaining the origins of the main character, before he is seen on the screen. Instead, his story is told in flashback form throughout the movie. Maybe that's because his back story isn't really that interesting and can be dealt with quickly, but anyway... The cast surrounding Mamoa is pretty dull and includes all the perfunctory nods to being racially inclusive. It also includes the obligatory 'big stars' playing mentoring roles to the main protagonist although Willem Dafoe's cheesy character will make you laugh or maybe grimace (though not intentionally) and Nicole Kidman will make you yawn (as usual). Julie Andrews even turns up, or at least her voice does, playing what must be one of the more unusual characters of her career.Aquaman's closing credits make it obvious that this movie is set up for a sequel and IMDB reports that one is scheduled for 2022. I look forward to seeing that. It will have to be better than thisMy conclusion? Turn your brain off, don't expect too much, and you will probably enjoy this movie - the first time. Just don't rush to watch it again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The fights had very little cuts due to the amount of cgi while in theory it should be better than over using cuts (see every bad action film). Personally it takes me out of the movie because at points the animation was worse than at others particularly the first fight scene. The costumes felt like a power ranger costume designer came up with them and that further added to tonal inconsistencies.
Another issue for me was the fact aquaman seemed invincible how can i care for a character who's pain tolerance I don't know.Finally while the film is dumb fun it is not worth anything at most above 6.5 this is my objective view (personally I didn't like it) and people giving this 9's are completely out there review it as a film a piece of art NOT a dceu film at the time of writing it has a 7.7 .","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ok, it's action and stuff, but how can such a weak written script, as well as the really plastic acting, I mean, how did this even sold out so well? The story is probably one of the most generic ones I have heard in a while, the character development was rather say pathetic and the backstories were rushed just to go straight into action. The introduction of the ""unbeatable"" Aquaman came too fast and they shouldn't have started right into showing his powers and skills. He seems also very unnecessary for the Dc franchise as a superhero, I can't really see how he can do something really necessary, and besides fighting for the throne of Atlantis, he doesn't do much more. Aquaman's motive as the savior wasn't convincing, mostly because he was pushed to save something he didn't want to save. Jason Momoa adapting his role was probably the funniest part, some jokes he told and this funny face gave the character some fun into his personality, yet I couldn't take him to seriously, because really, he isn't a good actor. The rest of the characters like Mera performed by Amber Heardüòí was basic. I mean Mera's character had cool elements but she wasn't that impressive overall. Aquaman's teacher from the past, Vulko, played by Willem Dafoe, was good enough and by the way Dafoe is a very good actor, so I understand why he plays in so many movies. Lastly the villains. How to make a forgettable villain, just learn from the Aquaman movie. How many underwater kings most live in cinema history? I think a bit too much. I don't have to say more, because there's nothing to talk about. As I mentioned, weak script and dialogues, a few jokes fall into my mind, but not many. James Wan directing this film was unfortunately a disappointment, I think he does a better job too make horror movies, making the monsters, the fear, you know, he is much better at that. But him directing Aquaman felt like he wanted to organize a war in Star Wars style, but add some Avatar and make it underwater. The ending when Aquaman says ""I am Aquaman"" is just how a Spider-Man movie would end, and I don't know if that's to good, it felt to copied. Why did I gave four stars though? For so many negatives, some pros came on the way. As I mentioned, a few fun jokes, but I think two or three action sequences did a good job with entertainment. I liked the usage of camera, as well as a few nice visuals, adding nice slow-motion and epic music. This was probably the best moments, and Aquaman was on his greatest. But well, that's it, besides epic action music, the rest of the score was the most unoriginal and predictable music I have ever heard in a movie. When they added it too the most embarrassing scenes, it only become even more embarrassing. No, this was not for me. I hope the sequel is better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What about he stupid uniform!Fail 2: King Orm, knew that Vulko trained Arthur since childhood, but he left him do it for long years, and wanted to surprice Vulko at the end of the movie! was this indian sense?Fail 3: the guards looks so ugly and not compatible with the ocean creatures, its robots! come on!! a little babygirl can do better imagination for such guards and customs, especially the red ray weapon!Fail 4: Arthur , the story hero, caould lift a submarine easily from the deep ocean to the surface, but it was very difficult for him to fight a metal ugly robot / Manta!Fail 5: When King Orm met the green freaking king to convince him to do war on land people, that king came to me King Orm without guards, weapons, and brings his wife and daughter with him, is this an act of a Kings!!Fail 6: If these creatures caould see underwater with supernatural powers, why they have lights in their jets, camps and everywhere!!!Fail 7: what is the purpose of Sharks riding when they can swim faster than it, its like Monkeys riding horses in planet of the apes, pathetic.Finally, remember we have to maintain the oceans cleanliness so the aqua people dont get mad and dround the lands.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

People have explained to me DC and Marvel, blah blah, but it's just not my thing. I usually just catch a superhero movie on tv when I'm in the mood, which isn't often.I like marine wildlife so a movie about under-the-sea critters has an appeal. The mood struck so seeing Aquaman in the theatre seemed worthy of my time.I found the movie to be of very average acting, minus the antagonist (Aquaman's step-brother). I found the computer graphics to be the best part of the film.Momoa was fine but they made his role a bit hokey with the way he stared at the camera and also some of his lines. A few times he blurted out a curse word in his one-liner. I thought to myself here's a movie made for kids, why are we trying so hard here to fit in the ""S"" word or something similar?? It just didn't fit the movie vibe and was unnecessary.
I also felt like the movie producers were trying awful hard for future cash-grabbing. How many characters can you introduce that look completely different so we can put a bunch of these toys out on shelves. Haha. I sound like a hater but just being honest.It was an okay flick. A decent time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After seeing so many super hero movies (btw I really don't care if it's DC or Marvel, I don't know what the fanboyism is about, I just want a good movie) and actually movies in general, I had some (pretty low though) expectations. But this, this was horrible. The plot was extremely flawed (I won't spoil it but if you watch it you might know what I mean from the very beginning of the movie), and some elements just not making any form of sense with previous events. Also, the acting was at its worse (seriously, I've seen better acting from secondary school students doing a forced movie project by an english teacher). Everything the characters said was so emotionless and directly recited that it was cheesy and outright seemed unprofessional (which stunned me coming from such a large studio with some usually very good actors). The most ""dramatic"" moments were so badly interpreted that they were funny. Even if you do like the story assuming you have read the comics you probably will be shocked by the low quality of the acting and the CGI. Oh boy the CGI. When I watched it, I had the constant feeling that I was watching some cheesy Mr. Clean commercial from the mid-2000's. The movie revolves around CGI (pretty much half the movie happens underwater so obviously) and does a very poor job at it. However, even if pretty much 90% if the movie was terrible, the fight choreographies are decent, and if you like very classic movies or are with a kid, you might end up enjoying it. I was with my father who was a huge fan of the comics when I watched the movie, and even though Aquaman was one of his favorite super heroes, he thought the same as me. To sum it up, I absolutely do not recommend going to the theater to watch it, but I suggest to consider watching it when it's going to be available on streaming platforms if you want to laugh at the movie a bit or to watch some underwater fights.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jason Momoa is fine, but I don't understand why people like him so much. He's just kind of scruffy and blah. Amber heard was just okay, but at least she looked hot as a redhead.

I thought Man of Steel, Dawn of Justice, and The Justice League were all better films than was reflected in the ratings and I enjoyed each of them. So the ""55"" metacritic rating wasn't going to deter me when it came to Aquaman. I was prepared to like it. I wanted to like it... I didn't like it.It seemed not to know if was dark (Batman v. Superman) or light (Justice League) and it was pretty clear after the first 30 minutes that it wasn't going to be aspiring to Wonder Woman-level heights (overrated though that movie was). I've seen every featured actor be solid-to-excellent in other things but the performances were stilted in almost every case. Momoa, in particular, had some painfully awkward dialogue with Amber Heard. It seemed as if they were trying - hard - to force a Hemsworth/Portman-like chemistry that just wasn't there. And above all, it was silly. The theater I was in heard at least a dozen people, myself included, laughing aloud at moments that weren't supposed to be funny.My 11-year old liked it. To that end, it's perfectly fine. But Marvel and DC have happily raised expectations over the last decade and Aquaman just doesn't make the grade.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

+ Nice exploration of Atlantis' background
+ Good chemistry between Arthur and Mera
+ Variety of environments
+ Easy to consume as a family movie
+ Beautiful visual styleCons:
Aquaman's story is suit to be in either a multi-part format or as a series of comic books, instead of a single one film. It felt like a fun ride that never get your emotion high enough and flat at some points, because they tried to cram the movie too many stuff, which result in a movie that is too long for its format and heroes quest that doesn't yield satisfaction at all.Almost everything in the film was told in a very obvious way without a room for any interpretation, as it's aimed at broader audiences.Here come the good partsThe movie isn't without its merit, as Mera and Arthur's interaction are fun to watch. Both banter from time to time (almost constantly).Arthur's character development also felt developed progressively. Especially when compared to a man whom care nothing about the world from JLA (which is justified in his background exploration).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This one and Wonder Woman managed to get many superhero fans pumped, without needing to take too many cues from the Marvel Universe - which is a thing that other DC films have done, no matter how effectively one blinds oneself to that fact.I'm not saying Aquaman is especially good, but at least it's acceptable - sans a few laughable VFX shots and Power Rangers-tier costumes. It is fundamentally competent, thus outranking the likes of Suicide Squad and Justice League. It does everything a movie about He Who Speaks With The Fish needs to do, which really isn't much.Jason Momoa plays a half-human half-Atlantean prince, going by Arthur Curry on the streets and ""Aquaman"" on the underwater streets. Amber Heard is his love interested Mera, the daughter of the king of one of the Atlantis tribes (Dolph Lundgren). There's also Aquaman's evil brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), whose plan is to unite the underwater kingdoms to declare war on humanity. Willem Dafoe plays the typical old mentor (wearing his goofiest suit since Goblin) and Nicole Kidman is the Queen of Atlantis.This, as you can surely tell, is pretty standard and un-extraordinary. And again, this is quite the step up from the bowel movements DC and Warner Bros. normally release. You have accomplished mediocrity and I applaud you. On some level it is complete.Sitting in the director's chair this time around is James Wan, a man more at home in horror although not completely dreadful here, even if it goes without saying that this is more of a product than an art project. I wouldn't say this film exemplifies Wan's voice. He was just doin' his job. That said, the action is fairly well shot.The cityscape of Atlantis is admittedly an interesting setting and probably the main reason to see the film. It's pretty, albeit no more groundbreaking than worlds like Pandora or the city ruled by King Triton. I'm glad DC fans have gotten something more promising, even if my own thumb points downward, but we'll see what this means for the future of the DCEU (recall that key actors have dropped out and people are more hyped for the Joker of another canon). There is some speculation that next year's Avengers finale will double as a finale for the persistent superhero film craze. They say that this might be what finally - FINALLY - kills the comic-book movie. I'm sorry we didn't get to Darkseid.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's like they took bits from our favourite underdog movies - such as the Karate Kid style ending - and pieced them all together. It's patchy and weirdly paced, with parts that have too much pointless detail while other sections rush ahead and ruin the moment or just execute it poorly.

The superhero genre doesn't have to lack nuance and depth to this extent, as several of the Marvel movies have demonstrated, so I assume the film makers were deliberately aiming at the most undemanding under-twelves with this movie. For everyone else, the artists and designers involved have worked hard to compensate for the lack of any emotional weight, and anything even approaching an interesting plot - so there's a wealth of gorgeous visuals to be distracted by; but there are scenes that are so excruciatingly awful that no amount of trickery can save them. The moments of ""triumph"" are so contrived and hokey that the obligatory orchestral score which swells up on cue is downright embarrassing to sit through. I defy anyone not to squirm when Aquaman steps fully-uniformed from a waterfall, or when he stares dramatically at the bad-guys through the prongs of his trident. As feeble and trite as this movie is, it doesn't fail as badly as it ought to because recent DC movies have set the bar so low, but nothing except the visuals will move you, intrigue you, or leave you wanting more.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The character development is done halfheartedly, and they just tried to push WAY too much history into a single film. Perhaps because of this, it's hard to identify with any of the characters:

Part of the underwhelming DC universe its a surprise that this movie was released based on the bad reviews of so many of the DC universe cannon. It was a strange decision to release the Justice League movie which was an ensemble cast before each of the individual characters had their own movies released.
Back to Aquaman. The basic story is that Aquamans mother (Nicole Kidman) is cast out of her underwater kingdom and is taken in by a lighthouse keeper, played by Temuera Morrison. Fast forward and Aquaman is born and his mother is dragged away by some angry Aquaworld police in space uniforms. This sets the tone for the movie as it seems that any time we have any relative quiet, something explodes. This a repeated theme throughout which begins to seem laughable on repetition. Another odd motif is the use of shouting. Not people shouting in arguments using actual words, just AAAAAAAAAARRRGGGGHHH for no real reason. Trust me this happens. Although this is supposed to be an underwater story it really looks like a sci-fi set in space with lazers, space ships and space suits. At one point it actually looks like Tron Legacy and even sounds like the Tron Legacy soundtrack, this cant have been a mistake?
As for the actual storyline its quite hard to keep up as it seems to bounce around quite a bit, there is a subplot about an evil pirate who is out for revenge against Aquaman called Manta, but he should really be called Frog Helmet due to his ridiculous costume. Watching the movie you basically forget he exists until BOOOM, another explosion and there he is. I warned you about the Booms.
Despite a few well known faces the acting is quite poor, Aquamans is case in point, he seems to chew his words and it looks like the only reason he got the role was his looks. His jokes and pretty much all of the jokes in the movie fall flat.
Some of the visuals are impressive but its a 95% CGI movie and despite the sheer amount of onscreen action its neither engaging or exciting. Its a very Zach Snyder type of movie, at times dark visuals with slow mo but a very hollow experience.
You could easily stick this on to watch while you tidy your house but I doubt that it would be enough to draw you in to make you give up the housework.
It can be interesting visually at times but with a messy script, zero emotional content, sub par acting and very little to remember after. Still, you will have managed to complete over two hours worth of housework with some flashing lights and loud noises for company.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I would happily watch Batman V Superman every day for a month before sitting through this film again.Let's get the very few positives out of the way. Jason is good as Arthur Curry. He's humorous and much like what we got from him in Justice League. The action sequences and visuals can both be stunning and enjoyable at times.The script on the other hand, is AWFUL. This dialogue came straight from The Room. People laughed harder in the cinema when the film was trying to be taken seriously than when there was intentional humour.Black Manta? Complete shoehorn. No need for him to be in the film whatsoever. Despite being a far more interesting villain, they spend all of the time, energy and budget on the stroppy and entitled brother.People will tell you that it was meant to be a silly and fun movie. Of course it is. That doesn't mean they delivered on that effectively. They couldn't decide if they wanted it to be Thor Ragnarock or Lord of The Rings.I haven't wanted to leave a movie so much in a long time. I strongly recommend saving your money as it's 2 hours and 20 minutes (yes really) that you won't get back.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I love Jason Manoa as Aquaman! He is kick-butt awesome and my favorite Aquaman so far, much better than that early Aquaman who was clean shaven and wore spandex. I much prefer Manoa's fresh take on the character. I also really like William Defoe in the film as well, I loved him as the Green Goblin in the Sam Rami Spiderman films and I think superhero films really suit him. Now lets get to the part I ABSOLUTELY HATE WITH EVERY MEANING OF THE WORD!! AMBER FREAKING HEARD!!!!! I really really hate her, not only did I hate her in the film but I hate her as a person, just search her name and you'll see why. I love Johnny Depp VERY much. Not so long ago in my life I went through a very rough time, pretty much everything and anything I had interest in someone was taking it away for one reason or another. I was told what I could like and not like, and if my folks found out that I liked something they deemed ""bad"" I would be severely punished. They even told me I could not be my own person, so for a while I didn't know who I was. One day I happened upon POTC and I LOVED it, finally I had something just for me! Soon I found other Johnny Depp films and Tim Burton films and grew quite an affection for them. They made me feel good about my self and taught me that its good to be different and its good to be your own person. Yes my folks found out about it a little bit and yes I was punished severely (but that's a story for another day). After I found Johnny I didn't feel like an outcast anymore, I finally found my place. Of course lots of people make fun of me for loving Johnny and people make fun of him and say mean things about him to me to make me feel bad. It dose hurt me when ever people say or do hurtful things to people I love. So when I heard about what Amber Heard did to Johnny I was LIVID!!! She is probably one of the only people I have ever felt true hatred for! I can't see the character Mera anymore, now I can only see the vile hell spawn who viciously hurt an innocent man who I deeply care for. She is wicked creature who I hope gets what she deserves!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The best so far was Wonder Women. The story could have been better. I think it lacked more care and love for the production. Everything seems sloppy and hastily done, than being an incomplete feature film. CGI has the same problems as in previous DCEU films, in some scenes they are medium, in others they are horrible. The dialogue was clich√© and without any creativity. Sometimes I rolled my eyes, imagining what was going on in the writers' heads ...
Why is it too long? Some scenes were unnecessary. It did not need so much flashback. And the Romance? Too forced. Why two villains in the movie? The performance of Black Manta was really bad. I could get him out of the movie, I was not going to miss it. Both villains are generic. I love Patrick Wilson in other roles, unfortunately in this movie it was a torturing to see his wasted talent. Jason Mamoa made the give to do with the script. The guilt in part is the script poorly written, it does not deliver us character development. That spoils the movie a lot. If had a right storyline, good dialogue and character development, I'd totally ignore the horrible CGI and give it a 7.5. But I must be honest so I give 4 + 1 (because of Nicole Kidman).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The opening is incredibly charming with the lighthouse and the love story. Even the introduction to the villains was strong. Unfortunately, the character arcs are all cut short for the sake of over-the-top action sequences.The film was too bloated to make sense. During the finale I was confused with why each group was fighting each other and I didn't like how invincible Arthur was.While I like the actors individually, they did not mesh well together in this movie. The chemistry between the leads was non-existent. The acting was very robotic, and the dialogue is on-par with ""Batman v Superman"".All gripes aside, Jason Momoa is a likable lead and I enjoyed this more than other DC projects.Best Character: Tom Curry
Best Scene: The Submarine Fight
Best Quote: ""I am Thomas, Keeper of Lighthouse."" - Tom
Best Piece of Score: ""Reunited""Additional Note: When did Amber Heard get a flute?","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Most characters were wooden and poorly executed which was unfortunate as I was really hopeful that Aquaman would go against the grain and be a good DC movie. Some of the comedy was pretty decent but other moments were very ill-timed and came across as trying too hard but there are definitely signs that DC movies as a whole are improving.

I'm not much of a follower of DC and Marvel productions, but this movie was one of the ones I found good. I thought the underwater scenes were impressive. Even though the story is not very effective, the movie is somehow watchable. I can say that there is no memorable, interesting character other than Aquaman. If we look carefully, of course there are shortcomings. There's a bit of a lack of emotion. Although the action is not very high compared to the duration of the movie, it can be said that the flow is good. The plots of most superhero movies are usually boring. It could have been done differently or the characters could have been analyzed better. In short, more meaningful touches can be added to such productions instead of adding a simple action show.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That doesn't happen too often. Usually, I can stick it out, but, there are things I just didn't like about this film. First of all, none of the ocean dwelling 'people' have gills to breathe under water. Secondly, talking under water (???), telepathy would have been way cooler. Thirdly, no fins?? Super muscular fins for legs would have been more understandable, then when they're out of water they develop legs and vice versa. Kind of like the Little Mermaid. Forthly, using ocean dwelling creatures that already exist in nature instead of some far fetched crazy creation would have grounded the story more and made it seem plausible. The laser weapons just have to go. Again, let's keep it traditional to what they actually have available from nature to use.
Bottom line is that this version sucks ocean water and I'd like my money back.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And how everyone thought she was dead but surprise surprise she wasn't dead, and of course both she and her son both recognized each other immediately when the reunited. Now I'll give it up for some of the fight scenes because they were kind of cool, and the crab king was actually cute which I don't really say that often so that's good I guess. if I have to sum it up, DC was intimidated by the awe that is Marvel's success, panicked, and created Aquaman. The build up was really rough; with all the exposition and drama. Aquaman didn't really have too much of a personality up until a 4th of the movie, just illustrating the kind of cocky hero-Type main character the box office thinks we want to see, and then giving him more of a reckless attitude later on. I'll also give it up for DC's attempt to keep both roles equal instead of empowering just the female role, like most movies nowadays. I'll end it with this: let's just be happy it's not Justice League.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The flick tried too hard with the result being a complete mess. It deviated from a tried and tested formula and simply lost its identity. The humour was sporadic at best and only worth a chuckle. The biggest disappointment was the waste of talent available. Dafoe, Lundgren and Heard are capable of much more and the lead bloke from GoT days actually appeared very capable also. But the script and screenplay for this flick stunk to high heaven.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I kind of have that superpower where I can watch a trailer and tell whether or not I will like that movie. That is exactly what happened. We were trying to find something to rent (my parents don't rent that much because we already have Disney + and amazon prime and a whole bunch of other streaming accounts where we don't have to rent. Rarely we rent, and that is if my parents are in a good mood trying to reward us because of our good behavior or good grades) We didn't really know what to watch because our 7 year old sister was with us and we were to trying to find something that would entertain everyone. We had just recently watch Wonder Woman, which is probably the best recent DC movie from the new DC franchise. So we all had high hopes when we watched the trailer (I did not though. I could tell it would be a cringe fest) I tried to tell everyone it would be a mistake, so we all voted on it and it was a 4 to 2 vote. After we finished, everyone was complaining that we should have listened to me because no one liked Aquaman. Here is why
1. Everything is sloppy and rushed
2. You feel no emotion towards the characters
3. The back story or origin story was generic and stupid
4. They tried to make it funny, and none of the jokes were funny at all (except one joke, but that was a very light chuckle and the joke was more idiotic than funny)
5. Aquaman is ugly, you don't even want to look at him(especially when he gets the orange suit, it is just so bad)
6. Soundtrack is just so annoyingly bad
There are only a few good things about this movie that is semi tolerable
1. Amber Heard was kind of hot(my mom thought she was too revealing but my dad just said she was jealous, OH SNAP!)
2. The graphics were fun too look at
That is basically the only good things about it. Trust me, the visuals was the only back bone of the entire movie. Just screen saver after screen saver. Literally only reason not a two or one because of the visuals. But still, the visuals are just not even worth it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Some of the scenes look like they were filmed on the set of a Power Rangers TV show, especially the Black Manta scenes. Just awful and uninspiring.Jason Momoa is a terrible actor who comes off as a surfer dudebro joker in just about every single scene - when we all know the Aquaman from the comics, TV shows, and video games - is portrayed to be more of a serious, charismatic person with leadership qualities - all of which Jason Momoa fails to bring to the table. In addition, if you're a REAL fan of the Aquaman character and have seen the DC animated film 'Justice League: Throne of Atlantis', then you may have noticed how significantly different the story is.Not sure what the writers, producers, and director were thinking, but this is an epic fail in the story-line department because they decided to basically make Aquaman a comedian and change major plot points from other reiterations of Aquaman's backstory.The only good thing about this movie was simply just some of the CGI action sequences (when Aquaman fights the trench monsters, for example).The villains (Orm and Black Manta) are extremely weak. Orm spends most of the movie talking smack but when it comes down to the epic final showdown, he doesn't put up much of a fight.Black Manta is another major disappointment. Again, if you've read the comics or even played the 'Injustice' video games, you know Black Manta is a warrior with some DAMAGING fighting skills and abilities - but again, is under-utilized and comes off as a weak side villain.These villains should have been much more BRUTAL, but unfortunately, they were weak.Skip this movie, especially if you're a fan of Aquaman from the comics, video games, or animated content. You'll be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

His refusal turns into a catch-22 when his scheming half-brother Orm declares war on the surface, and Arthur has no choice but to reclaim his birthright if he wishes to protect those he loves. Latest addition to the DCEU is chock-full of conventional elements like action, globe-trotting adventure, romance, and cheeky humor (much of which you can see coming a mile away) yet somehow still manages to be engaging thanks to some effective casting, a spectacular view of the aquatic world, and a good decision by director Wan to never take things too seriously. Glib, brawny Momoa is perfectly cast, and there are also good supporting roles for Heard as the obligatory love interest, and Dafoe as the traditionalist mentor.

The movie does not have that much illogical stuff, so most of the events make sense.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The introductory scene to The Aquaman character is breathtaking. Jason Momoa fits the character better than any other actor in a super hero comic movie ever, The plot is interesting with good sence of humour. We give it a 10. Loved it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What really made this and other super hero films of late bad for me is balancing the characters abilities or making things believeable.....ie...what is aqua man made of, is he on par with superman, all of his powers and more.. what are they?? I know they are fictional characters but you cant have them jump out of a plane at altitude and land without a parachute to then be punched and knocked out or hurt by a minor accident /injury!! It was the same with the avengers films, everyone knows that hulk is the most powerful super hero, but on par with black widow or Clint barton....come on....he would tear them a new one!! You have to get it right or it ruins it, far better balancing in the old cartoons or films. I think they just going too far with effects and action and not thinking about the rest....great if your a kid with a small mind but I'm a big kid with a big mind!! Get it right!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","A typical DC movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5190717/?ref_=tt_urv","disposalrobot","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81439765/?ref_=tt_urv","15 October 2019","A big part of the movie happens underwater but almost nothing looks or sounds underwater. Most of the CGI looks like a rainbow puked on it and sound design is a lot more sci-fi than underwater. Basically it feels like unicorns flying in space shooting lasers at each other in slow motion. The CGI overall appears very outdated and disconnected from the real-world footage. People's voices don't change in any way to give the feeling that they are underwater - instead all of the lines sound like clean studio recordings. At one point I thought they are still regularly underwater when in fact they were in an air bubble of sorts, and the only thing that gave it away was gravity.What is watery, though, is the watered down action in general. Everything is desperately trying to be epic all the time, but fails miserably and ends up causing no emotion whatsoever. That also goes for everything else besides the action. There is music absolutely all the time, and the music sounds exactly the same as in other DC movies (where there is also music all the time). Almost feels as if they have just bought a pile of generic stock music to fill in for the conversation bits to keep things dramatic enough. The camera also zooms, pans, flies or makes circles almost all the time. When you put all this together the end result is that nothing has any impact on the viewer because of the complete lack of contrast between calm and action-filled or dramatic moments.It's also a pity to see good actors give underwhelming performances under bad direction and trying to work with a story and characters completely devoid of any substance. In essence the story is one that has been written many times before in many forms, and everything you expect to happen, happens. There is no element of surprise, no plot-twist, nothing. Only a big bag of clich√©s strung together using bad jokes and generic lines that are so obvious they become mere background noise.Yet these below-mediocre mass-produced superhero films keep selling so very well - and even get decent reviews. It indicates that people in genreal do not demand anything more from their action. Rarely is an action movie a masterpiece, but it's not at all impossible to make them entertaining or even thought-provoking. Aquaman was none of those, but to be fair I didn't hate it either. It wasn't disappointing since I wasn't expecting much to begin with. It was just... meh.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jason momoa's portrayal of Aquaman has revolutionised his character into something more modern and acceptable in today's pop culture and is doing a great job at.
From start to finish I can honestly say that I really enjoyed whatching it and was thinking throughout that this is probably one of the best DC movies. I would even say I put it up there with Christopher Nolans 'The Dark Knight'.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
