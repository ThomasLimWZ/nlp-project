"7","/10","Good considering what it is","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2525100/?ref_=tt_urv","rawpow192","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29436114/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2011","I have to say I enjoyed watching Transformers 3. If you take it for what it is, a Michael Bay movie with awesome, epic visuals, an over-the- top weak plot, not very deep characters, and classic 'Bay' humor, then it's great. Not as good as the first, but easily better than the 2nd one. First off, the visual effects are amazing. One of the best, if not the best, that I've seen, both in details on the transformers, in action/fighting sequences, and in more general landscape shots - the views of Chicago when it was being attacked by decepticons were great. I watched it in 3D in the theater, and it was arguably the best 3D effects I've seen, and best use of 3D cameras, and that is including Avatar which i also saw in 3D. This is what Michael Bay is really good at, and this movie shows he is arguably the expert in visual effects and composition.visual effects and presentation - 10/10The plot isn't great. When it starts out, it seems like it might develop nicely into a moderately complex story rooted in some historical events that happened very differently than how we thought (kind of like the hoover dam part in the first transformers), but in the end not much is made of that and the plot is relatively direct and over-the-top. However, it does have a few good moments that offer a bit more complexity or emotion, and anyways I didn't watch the movie hoping for a subtle, complex, and nuanced plot.Plot - 6/10The characters and acting aren't Oscar-worthy either, to say the least. Rosie Huntington-Whitely is not a great actress, in fact she isn't really an actress, and it shows, but, to be honest, I have seen worse performances. Shia Labeouf is decent in his role as usual. and again there are some new characters, including some for Michael Bay- esque comic relief (which in my opinion is actually funnier than much of the humor in revenge of the fallen, which felt a little too forced to me).Characters/acting - 6/10Fun - 8/10If you're expecting a layered, nuanced movie with deep characterization and a complex and well-written plot, well, then, don't watch this. If, though, you want a fun blockbuster with truly amazing visual effects, a decent (but forgettable) storyline and characterization, and an easy to follow dynamic, well you'll probably like Transformers 3.","50 out of 75 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A bit of an improvement over ROTF, but not nearly as good as the first","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2912943/?ref_=tt_urv","gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26083589/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2013","In order to coincide with a fourth Transformers coming out in the next few months, I'll be reviewing this third entry of the successful film series. I liked the first Transformers despite it's cheesy dialog in some parts and while there were some awkward moments and very bad dialog, I still liked Revenge of the Fallen. Then, when I saw the whole thing in theaters back at 2011, I thought, this wasn't so bad after all. It later turned out to be a good ride, but while I do think it's a bit of an improvement over the previous film, it's nowhere near as good as the first.First, there are some good things that saved the film for me. The music score from Steve Jablonsky has improved and has an epic tone to it. The story is a lot more decent than the previous film with a much better second and third halves; the action sequences are solid especially the collapsing building scene which took my very breath away. The scenery is great and the special effects are as top-notch as ever. The acting is good, too. While John Turturo, Franches McDormand, and John Malkovich aren't given much to do, they did fine with the material. Patrick Dempsey did OK as the villain, but he's a bit underwhelming. Rosie Hunter Whiteley is a bit bland, but not exactly terrible as the new girlfriend for Sam Witwicky. While Shia LeBeouf isn't as charismatic as he was in the first film, he does have the same charm he brought to the film series so far. The Autobots and Decepticons are great to see again and the voice actors are solid especially Leonard Nimoy as Sentinal Prime, who is a very good villain for the movie much Megatron.Then, there are the bad things that I would point out. First, the script. While the second and third halves are a lot better, the first half is pretty boring. It seems to be lacking in it's action and it wasn't exciting. Second, the ending is way too similar to the first Transformers (what? with the auto-bots and decepticons fight against each other while bringing destruction to the city and such?) The pacing is also very sluggish it would almost put you to sleep. Third and mostly the final problem is the dialog. There are some humorous bits that might get the audience a chuckle, but there are other parts that are just so inane it would give you a headache.Overall, Transformers: DOTM isn't nearly as good as the first, but despite the flaws that I just stated, I think this is a great sequel in an overall solid franchise. I may not be a fan of Michael Bay and such, but while I do not like the Bad Boys films, Pearl Harbor, and others, I think that this and the other films are a lot better and it deserves a recommendation to those who haven't seen it.","16 out of 21 found this helpful.

Everything about this film just feels disappointing.The Autobots: Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen), Sentinel Prime (Voiced by Leonard Nimoy), Ironhide (Jess Harnell), Ratchet (Voiced by Robert Foxworth), Sideswipe (Voiced by James Remar), Mirage ""Dino"" (Franceso Quinn),Bumblebee, Wheeljack ""Que"" (Voiced by George Coe), Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny) Brains (Voiced by Reno Wilson) The Wreckers Roadbuster (Voiced by Ron Bottitta) and Leadfoot (Voiced by John Dimaggio)The Decepticons: Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving), Starscream (Voiced by Charlie Adler), Soundwave,Barricade, Shockwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), Laserbeak (Voiced by Keith Szarabajka) and Greg Berg voices Igor.The voice talent and their performances are what I like best about this movie and it was awesome to have Mr.Nimoy return to Transformers because anything he touches turns to gold. As I set in the theater listening to his voice work I can't help but think of Galvatron the role he first performance in Transformers. It's good to have Peter Cullen and Frank Welker in the film together since they are part of the Transformers for so long and you can't have one without the other.The plot of the movie was good enough as it did have a tense story line Action scenes in the film are the rewarding part as you are given tense and extreme battles. The music is also very well done Also the Special effects are just awesome that is enough to make you go wowThe disappointment I have with this film is that the comedy was really Bad comedy they try to push the comedy and I swear it just so bad that I wanted to cry. The human characters the new ones are pretty much awful and just really insulted my intelligence it just made you wish they added more transformers instead of more stupid human characters who are not even worth the screen timeThis in my opinion is the weakest of the films yes I know ""Revenge Of The Fallen"" got a bad rap but this one deserves it more because it is like a wreck on a wreck while it does have some things to make it watchable.What I like the best of the film is The voice performances of the cast, the music and the action scenes that are just what you hope for in Transformers. What I hated the most is the human cast who are just pretty much the worse punch line in the history of punch linesBut the plot, the action scenes and the voice performances are the redeeming features of this movieI give Transformers: Dark Of The Moon an 7 out of 10","14 out of 18 found this helpful.

In case you don't know, the six 'Cs' are: chases, clashes, crashes, combustions, carnage and cleavage. Spread over a bottom-numbing two-and-a-half hours, ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon"" can also induce mental and metal fatigue, especially with the clanging robots smashing one another - and the whole exercise making little sense.Technologically, however, ""Dark Of The Moon"" is Bay's best work so far - and action fans looking to be awed by scenes of massive mayhem and destruction in 3D should be satisfied. Story-wise, this one is better than ""Revenge Of The Fallen"", but not as fun and emotionally-connecting as the first.The film opens with a flashback to the Sixties Apollo landing mission where history is rewritten (by Ehren Kruger) to incorporate the cover-up of an alien spaceship crashing on the moon. That spaceship, of course, is one of the remains of the epic battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and its 'discovery' sparks off another war that threatens to destroy planet Earth. Or at least the face of Chicago as we know it.On the human level, we find that Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has traded in his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) for a newer model (a Victoria Secret one, to be exact) in the shape of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly). Sam is being offered a job by Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich) but we soon learn that Carly's boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) may be up to no good. Then, when the conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons hots up, Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) of the elite Government squad NEST are summarily called into action.We get lulled into believing that there may somehow be an intelligent plot coming from the conspiracy of the NASA lunar-landing cover-up which also involves the Russian space program and Chernobyl. These turn out to be just an exercise in 'historical name-dropping' to spur our interest before we get to the demolition derby created by the Transformers. Indeed, some of the robots seem to emote better that the live cast. Cybertron leader Sentinel Prime, for example, is even designed to look like Leonard Nimoy (who provides its voice), complete with stuff that looks like beard. Again, the problems of the previous installments recur - like the confusion between the good and bad robots in the clashes.Unlike the first two movies, there are no more gags about the shock of humans interacting with the mechanical 'bots. Bay, however, insists on some comic sequences and he has hired Ken Jeong to do his in-your-face shtick as Jerry Wang. John Turturro reprises his role as former FBI agent Simmons but this time around, Turturro finds it fit to clown around with his role. The most striking inclusion to the cast is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam's love interest. However, with limited acting talent, she provides only eye-candy and beside her, Megan Fox would look like an Oscar-caliber actress.Like the first ""Transformers"", this one is also a live-action cartoon on a grand scale. Scenes of Chicago buildings being toppled and destroyed can be as spectacular and brain-numbing as those of September 11; and the wing-suit flying sequences are breath-taking. Indeed, these are what most of Michael Bay's fans pay for and they will not be disappointed. The only problem for me is that Bay prolongs and repeats the robotic clash sequences to the point of being self-indulgent. Technically brilliant and visually arresting, ""Dark Of The Moon"" lacks heart and soul.

The film was the last film to have Shia LaBeouf in the film as Sam Witwicky and the end of the original trilogy of films.The film is set three years after the events of the 2009 film, with the Autobots, during the collaboration with the NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers) military force, discovering a hidden alien technology in possession of humans, which had been found by Apollo 11 on the years earlier. However, the Decepticons unveil a plan use the technology to enslave humanity in order to restore Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers.The story was a really good story and it took inspiration from a novel called Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday, written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel was a prequel to the 2007 film, TRANSFORMERS. Due to the critically panned REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, the Twins were cut out of ""Dark of the Moon"".The acting is just amazing, but can get dreadful. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky one last time and he does a great job. Megan Fox was originally signed on to play Mikaela Banes in the third film, and Patrick Dempsey's character Dylan Gould was to be the employer of Fox's character, but she was fired, instead Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays Carly Spencer and she does a great job.She is not as good as Fox but considering the shoes that she had to fill, she could have been a hell of a lot worse. Josh Duhamel, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and the rest of the cast are great in their performances, especially Tyrese Gibson, who was also in another 2011 film, Fast Five, which I previously reviewed.The CGI is amazing and the action is so fantastic in this film and the best part is at the end of the film, and it was so long but I enjoyed it and the film is 154 minute long feature film.The music by Steve Jablonsky is fantastic and much more cool and amazing was Linkin Park's song at the end of this movie.Overall, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON is not the best Transformers film, but it could have been worse.8/10.","59 out of 71 found this helpful.

But surprisingly, it was fresh. Ehren Kruger cleverly used the Apollo 11 event to create a Decepticon world invasion storyline with few interesting twists...Although I was amazed with the explosive action and brilliant special effects used in the film, the film itself lacks a lot of things...It started very well with the whole history of THE ARK and it crashed throughout the second half of the film. The humour was still silly like Revenge Of The Fallen. For example, Ken Jeong was appalling and Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) tried to be funny and humorous but failed. Replacing Megan Fox with Rosie Huntington Whiteley wasn't much of a big difference. However, she was certainly better than Fox. There was pointless scenes around the last half of the film that made it a really long, boring film. Also, Michael Bay tried hard making the slow motion action scenes very 3D and realistic which was a bit irritating and ruins the film. The main antagonists haven't performed well enough to create an epic ending to the franchise In another point of view, however, this film was fairly enjoyable and the script was written very well. The soundtrack used was fresh and bends well with the film. There was some scenes that just blew me away and the CGI special effects definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. Shia Labeouf, John Turturro, John Malkovich and Alan Tudyk was enjoyable to watch.Overall, Michael Bay definitely improved this film compared to Revenge Of The Fallen by creating really amazing CGI effects and a really interesting script, but it wasn't enough to deliver a spectacular ending to the franchise...","20 out of 28 found this helpful.

They both make movies mainly for themselves and in truth, there is nothing wrong with that. As an audience member you need to know going in exactly what you are going to get. It is the only way to really enjoy anything that falls from the cameras of these two (and some other notables). With that said, let's dive headlong into the metallic masterpiece of summertime popcorn, Transformers!Transformers: Dark of the Moon continues the story of Sam Witwicky and his Autobot friends. While Sam struggles to gain a purpose in life outside of Decepticon attacks, the Autobots are off helping the government on secret missions. Then everything is torn apart by the discovery of the original Autobot escape ship, known as The Ark, and the captain of that ship, Sentinel Prime. He alone holds the key to technology that could either help reshape the Transformers home world or completely destroy ours. The Decepticons, completely aware of this discovery, make an immediate power play and the war is back, bigger than ever.Kids buying the Transformer toys today only want one thing, huge robots in spectacular 3D slow motion destroying each other and every building in sight. From this narrow viewpoint, Bay delivers in bulk. The highway fight sequence brought back memories of other high-speed terror scenes like in Matrix Reloaded and The Island (maybe a little too reminiscent of that last one according to some eagle eyed movie nerds). Since Bay actually filmed these scenes in the latest and greatest 3D technology, it was admittedly pretty amazing to watch. In other scenes, some of the CGI was so intensely crisp that it actually started popping too far from the live footage, making it stand out, which ruins a little of the illusion.So the special effects is where it was at. Big robots, big explosions, big buildings falling down. Those were the high points.The low points were pretty much everything else.Standing in the center of all the toys-on-roids insanity is Shia LaBeouf, who in my opinion is a really good actor banking inside really bad movies. I can't fault him for taking parts in some of the biggest franchises in movie history (Transformers and Indiana Jones) because the exposure and paycheck are nearly impossible to pass up, but in terms of showing his skills as an actor, those hefty titles have done him nothing but a painful disservice. He made his big splash on the scene in the Disney TV show Even Stevens and then on the big screen in the Rear Window update, Disturbia. Many people also don't remember one of my personal favorite performances in the Project Greenlight-sponsored film, The Battle of Shaker Heights. Shia has the chops, but gets surrounded by weak emotional performances, both from CGI and real people. In this outing, Megan Fox's eye candy character was replaced by Victoria Secret's model (and current Jason Statham girlfriend), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whiteley was an improvement in sense of acting ability, but the part was written levels below what Fox was given. The original love interest had layers, depth and some edge, while Whiteley was given virtually no background, no emotional outlet and nothing to do but stand there and be hot. Sure, the 12-year old in the audience doesn't want or need more, but to them I say, ""Go grab a Victoria Secret's catalog from your parent's bathroom and stay out of my movie.""Beyond the magical pair of leads, Bay brings back the regular tough guys, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, to keep on keeping on. They both do fine jobs and don't try to make this more than it is. Coming in for the first time in the franchise is Frances McDormand, an Academy Award winner to class up the joint. While she was amusing and brought a little more skill to the screen, her part was borderline over-the-top, even in a movie with three story tall robots, because she had to balance out John Tuturro who drifts somewhere off to Hunter S. Thompson land. As if they weren't enough, Bay decides to bring in an unusual amount of big name cameos, including John Malkovich (who does a decent job in his few scenes) and Ken Jeong (who seems to be acting in a completely different movie, possibly thinks he's filming Hangover 3). I saved the best for last though, my personal favorite and the only person I was actually thrilled to see appear on screen, Alan Tudyk (who plays Tuturo's assistant/bodyguard). Tudyk is a cult TV and film legend to his legions of fans spanning from the days of Firefly, Dollhouse and other projects not created by Joss Wheedon. Tudyk was the one person I actually cheered form when he magically appeared on screen.I could go into a section now where I talk about the story, the plot lines, the connective tissue of the writing, but in reality, Bay didn't really care and neither do the younger members of the crowd, so let's just skip it.The End of the Page recommendation: Transformers: Dark of the Moon starts slow, goes out with a bang and delivers surface entertainment for the middle school crowd.","262 out of 424 found this helpful.

But when Optimus Prime learns that humanity had found a vital Autobot ship crashed on the Moon, he rescues Sentinel Prime from the wreck, just when the Decepticons return with a plan to restore their homeworld of Cybertron.Watching Dark of the Moon feels like an endurance test by the time it finishes, this is due to a ridiculously drawn out battle set in Chicago for the climax. While it makes up for Revenge of the Fallen's terribly underwhelming finale, it does become a blur of insignificance after a while because there's simply too much happening! But if there is one thing done right this time is a correct use of characters. A lot of the ludicrous padding and fluff from RotF is completely missing; our human characters are involved but not excessively (ie. Sam's parents hardly feature at all!) and let's say this film provides us with humans who aren't noble and just. There's a lot more of the Transformers too (you would hope so) and it feels like they have a lot more respect shown to them now. Decepticons genuinely appear threatening and the Autobots are shown to have personalities again, continuing from the first film's groundwork (a scene with a silent, brooding Optimus-in-truck-mode is a favourite). The action is off the rails too. More in keeping with the original film we see them transform during battles.There are some deeply unsettling scenes too. The setup involves assassinations against humans who knew about the mission to the Moon, executed by Decepticon Laserbeak (great to see him too), one where he infiltrates a family's house by pretending to be a friendly Autobot playing with their daughter. Woah, woah! RotF was too cheesy, but this is really dark all of a sudden!As a fan of the Transformer characters, this film sees a lot of deaths. Some are most unforgivable. We haven't seen this many prominent robot deaths since the slaughter that was the 1986 Transformers: The Movie! The only other gripe I mostly have about this film asides deaths and a bloated finale is Carly, Sam's new love interest (the forgettable Rosie-Huntington Whitely) who is given things to do thanks to the plot, but is far less notable than Fox's Mikaela (I cannot believe I just wrote that) but I do believe the film would be stronger without a love interest. But it is Michael Bay, we need a girl for those slow-mo shots.It is a vast, vast improvement and a faithful sequel to the 2007 film. It is too long, and it does make some unforgivable decisions regarding Transformer characters, so it feels less perfect in those regards. It is still a fun film though.","19 out of 21 found this helpful.

The photography is fantastic and the 3d technology is used effectively to create stunning, visually amazing scenes. However, that is the only aspect of the film that I believe deserves merit at all. Despite the continuous action, destruction and battles, I found this film to be extremely boring, and the final battle, which claimed the last hour of the film was far too long and drawn out and it greatly prevented me from appreciating the visual spectacle that is the final battle as it's so long it becomes tedious and I couldn't wait for it to end. The extensive use of cgi action scenes was what ruined the film for me, and although I never fully agree with the typical view that modern films have too much cgi and effects and not enough good story, this film certainly presented a convincing case that the above statement is true. As there is so much shooting, exploding and fighting in this film there is relatively little time for dialogue, which was largely, poorly written, and full of clichés. Finally, I didn't rate the casting of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or her performance. She has clearly been chosen for the role for her good looks and her great sex appeal although I think she shines brighter as an underwear model than blockbuster film actress. Also, It seems unbelievable to me that Shia LaBeouf's character, although not a bad looking guy, has been in relationships with 2 characters played by women who have both topped the annual FHM 100 sexiest women in the world poll. Rosie has clearly been cast to attract more male viewers, bring sex appeal that the film didn't really need and throughout struck me as being far out of Shia's league.","396 out of 677 found this helpful.

The last hour or so of the film really blew my mind, so much fun and games for everyone. Not only that, but I find it to be in my top list of the best films of all time; I may have seen most of the greatest films ever made and had different opinions on them, but none of them I have seen can top this film here! An exhilarated masterpiece to the live-action Transformers saga out of the three films I own and the last GOOD one that I know of. Going forward, the films fluctuate in quality: some being good or bad, but none of them can recapture the magic of three.","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

The Yanks found out about this, which is why they were so eager to land there in the late sixties, their real mission being to investigate this alien vessel. Turns out have the dormant former autobot leader Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, the voice of Galvatron in the original animated film) on board, and he has a cargo that could hand the Decepticons final victory in the Cybertronian war and grant them dominion throughout the universe.So the stakes are huge, so is the budget. So are the nods to older characters. Uber badass Shockwave finally makes an appearance, the autobots treating him with suitable fear and trembling. The rebel autobot Wreckers make an appearance, though as particularly vulgar characters. The autobots have the odds stacked against them, beaten and exiled, and yet triumph in the end after much sacrifice.I won't say too much about the plot. Though there aren't many surprises, you're better off seeing them in the film than reading them in this review.THis is easily the best characterisation of Optimus Prime, and also Megatron in the film series. Sentinel is an excellent addition, and I must admit to chuckling at the various Spock references throughout the film.So with the human actors. LeBeouf, who I quite liked in the first and found tolerable in the second, is here just annoying. We swap the brunette Barbie Doll Megan Fox, for an actual Barbie Doll in Rosie Huntington Whitely. Though to compensate not being able to see Megan draped over a motor bike in short shorts, we are shown a close up from behind of Rosie walking up a flight of stairs in her underwear. As a matter of fact, that is her introductory scene which tells you all you need to know about her character. Frances McDormand and John Malkovich are both welcome additions and their characters both appear to have walked in off the same film John Turtorro's had in the first movie. Patrick Dempsey is perfect in his role as an oily business man conductor of mass enmity.Spike's parents were so funny in the first film, and so vulgar in the second, hear they have improved to being merely banal.Some of the set pieces are astonishing, the highlight being some humans trapped in a sky scraper leaning on another sky scraper, trying desperately to make their way across the fallen building into the still intact one as Shockwave tears the building apart, but the whole battle sequence in Chicago is breathtaking. The ending is suitably dramatic and feels final.What can I say? Loved the transformer characterisations in this one. Had a couple of decent human characters added and actually had a story, even if it was pretty thin. Better than the second, not as good as the first. Loved it!","11 out of 15 found this helpful.

Explosions, CGI, 3D and after these comes everything else. These three things are the main reason why one should watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon. We all know who Mr. Bay is and what his movies are famous for: explosions, explosions, explosions and destruction, destruction, destruction. Plot has never been his strongest feature, but hey, and i am being totally honest here, it works well enough, at least for me. All i wanted to see was a typical Michael Bay movie, something like Armageddon or the first Transformers, and what i got was a pleasant surprise.So, before watching the movie its probably not a sin to say that we were certain of one thing: it couldn't have been worse than Revenge of the Fallen, which, lets be honest, was pretty atrocious. This time we've got plot linked to Moon and Apollo 11, which was clever and worked well for the movie, decepticons taking over the world and turning Chicago into something we're used to see in The Terminator movies and autobots with their human allies resisting them. Oh, and what we don't have is Megan Fox. Thank God for that. The new female lead, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has one task: be pretty and well its safe to say that she succeeds at it, no one expects her to deliver an award-winning performance, but she did really good (it's her first film by the way) and she fits in the movie and with Sam very well. Anyway, the film is much bigger and more serious than the previous ones. This time we've got emotion and character, which maybe has something to do with, again having Steve Jablonsky and Linkin Park for soundtrack. Iridescent which is played at some points creates an excellent aura. All this decepticon destruction and ""drawing the bigger picture"" motive provides us with more seriousness and depth.So all in all, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was an awesome watch. It could be for anyone, if only one goes to watch it for the right reasons (needlessly to say explosions, CGI and 3D). We've got fast pace, a lot of visuals, romance, a lot of mayhem and well, a moral (presented heavily with clichés but, hey, no harm). All of which are vital components for a solid summer blockbuster and a clear head to define Transformers as something more than meets the eye. Just sit back and expect a fun and adventurous ride and you won't be disappointed.","30 out of 49 found this helpful.

In my opinion the first film set some solid ground work for what Michael Bay wanted to do. Sadly in the second movie it all fell apart. Some like to blame the writers strike that was going on during that time, I think that is a cop out, and a bad one at that. Thankfully Dark of the Moon brings the franchise back to the roots of the original film. Light humor, average acting, but fantastic action scenes. This is my review of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.This is the third Transformers film directed by Michael Bay, and while I did trash his effort in part two of this series, I must admit they really rebounded amazingly. He took the heavy criticisms of the second film, mainly being that the humor was over the top and the film was light on action, and made this film better because of those criticisms. The action is heavy in this film, even more so than the first film. Sure there are slow spots here and there while they build up the story, but overall this is a nicely paced film. I love a great final battle scene, and while the summer blockbusters have been mainly stale in that area, Dark of the Moon fully delivers in that aspect as the final battle ranges from a good thirty to forty minutes I would say. That is very impressive.Ehren Kruger returns from the ashes of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and is in fact the only writer who returned from that awful film. Also, Kruger is the only writer on this film. Much like the first film in the franchise, if you are expecting an Oscar winning script, you simply will not find it here. Kruger's script holds up nicely, and he really redeems himself after the mess of the prior film. The over the top humor is replaced with much more timely humor that works very well for the most part. The pacing of the action scenes are far better as well. With only a few slow downs in the story, Kruger is really able to hold our attention very nicely over the course of this two and a half hour film. While it is hard to say if this film was overall better written than the first film in this series, Kruger's effort is still top notch for this amazing summer blockbuster.Overall this film was a fantastic way to end the first trilogy for the Transformers series. Personally I must say this film is slightly above the first film, but even still, it is just barely. So fans of these Transformers live action films, this franchise as a whole is pretty good for what it has set out to be. Sure there are some like even myself who would want a Cybertron War movie, but in due time I suppose.7.4/10 While this is the end of the Sam Witwicky story, the Transformers will return in Transformers: Age of Extinction.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie added some serious effects to it with the robots. just like the first two it combines an action/love/comedy attribute. The action scenes in this movie are without a doubt awesome. The effects they used are amazing and to sort of let you catch up with whats happening they use slow motion to let you see things that are going on. I like how they've taken something that has actually happened like the moon landing and have put there own twist on what actually was happening. this was a very good movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing robots you played with as kid come to life.","44 out of 61 found this helpful.

The special effects were great -- assuming you can suspend your belief in physics long enough to enjoy them. The rest of this movie was awful. The product placements for Lenovo, Cisco, Waste Management and Chevy Impala were overwhelming. There was a product placed in almost every scene, and the sheer SIZE of the logo overshadowed most scenes. It was brutal, even for Michael Bay. And the leading woman (I refuse to look her name up for this review) - the giant implants she had in her lips gave her that permanent ""duck- lip"" look. Gross.

From start to finish a great movie, it has great chemistry between the characters and the robots, with an awesome storyline that really makes you think. There are several minor blips and mistakes I noticed, but they do not take away from movie at all. I would say it is slightly better than the first film and a lot better than the second one. Like Michael Bay said the film could go bigger than the second so bringing it back into a small arena was an added bonus. the 3D was also a nice addition to the movie added to the immersing experience. Nonetheless I am a fan of the trilogy and plan on seeing it again. I recommend anyone who is a fan of explosions, non stop action, and comedy to see this film, maybe even twice!!!","31 out of 43 found this helpful.

Unlike most others, I don't mind big and overblown Michael Bay's movies at all. However his Transformers movies always have been ones that I could never really enjoy watching, while they are the biggest and most overblown Michael Bay movies out there.Reason as to why I liked this movie far better than the previous two Transformers movies is because this time around I could actually understand what was going on, on screen and with its story. Not that it's well written or a terribly clever story but I at least could understand all that was going on. I don't even remember all that much about the first two Transformers movies, because they seemed terribly random with its story and got told very messily.But really, this is not the only thing that this movies does better than any of its predecessors. Also for the first time ever I truly got a sense of it that the Autobots and Decepticons were at a full scale war with each other. And what a war it was! Visually and with its special effects, this movie is truly a great and spectacular one! The battles have never looked bigger or better and overall they also have a more type of special-effects vibe to it this time.So both the Autobots and Decepticons work out better in the story, this time around but so do all of its human characters. Thing that really annoyed me about the first two movies was how it seemed to focus way too much on the human characters, while they didn't even seemed to fit into its story all that well. In this movie it all works out way better. The human plot lines are just as 'good' and 'interesting' as that of the Transformers and all of the story lines besides feel more connected to each other and less random. It definitely makes the movie more enjoyable to watch and it makes you forget that it's almost 3 hours long as well.Of course there is still plenty to complain about. The action and interaction between the humans and Transformers still feels a bit awkward at times really and so does its comedy. It's shocking how lame and totally out of place its humor is at times. Another thing that started to annoy me after a while were its slow-motion moments. Really, what was up with that? Sometimes they would go on for ever and ever, without a real good reason for it and it became laughable, instead of awesome, like it was supposed to be. Also it was weird that you kept hearing all of the Transformers voices crisp and clear, no matter how much noise there was. Things like this bugged me, as did its simplistic story of course.And does the presence of Frances McDormand or John Malkovich add a lot to the movie? Not really but they got obviously put in to give the movie a more serious status, as if this time things would be different and more focused on its story and acting, while this of course really wasn't the case at all.But still, do all of these things really matter for a movie of this sort? This is simple entertainment and at entertaining this movie does not fail. Say what you will about Michael Bay but he is a guy that can make a $200,000,000 movie, of which you can see every cent back on the screen. The action is simply amazing and absolutely spectacular at times. They came up with some good set pieces, which also gives the movie a true sense of war and intensity. Really, this movie is already worth seeing for its action and special effects alone.Simply enjoy it for what it is; a big dumb, overblown, action movie, that simply entertains and brings plenty of visually great excitement to the screen to enjoy.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Once again, Transformers is not focused to the Transformers but focused to a human being named Sam Witwicky. This is why I never liked Michael Bay's Transformers. This is why I already predicted ""Revenge of the Fallen"" will fail two years ago because the movie is not interested with Optimus. How can this series be called Transformers if it doesn't have enough Transformers? The Autobots only appear when there are Decepticons attacking and the preachy scenes about them. If there's no action, there's the life of Witwicky. His life is never interesting but the film just wants us to show how important it is. How about less Witwicky and more Optimus? Would it make the film better? I guess so.Transformers movies never gets a good story. But we still watch these movies for the Autobots and the explosion and the loud noises. Fact: The scenes of the Autobots only exist in the action scenes and the important scenes about them. The rest is all Witwicky and his chick and his uninteresting & unimportant life. There are new Transformers in this film but we never get to know them because it doesn't only have new Transformers, it also have excessive cameos. These celebrity cameos has more screen time than the robot newbies.The special effects were the only merits of this trilogy. All the transforming, all the robots, all the explosions, all the stuff jumping off the screen. Another Fact: The 3D is ""DARKER of the Moon"". We sure love the action and the explosion but the climax is focused to Sam Witwicky's survival again, and the soldiers and Witwicky again and his new girlfriend and Witwicky then Patrick Dempsey(not spoilers dude) and Witwicky. It's all Witwicky! Yeah, there's Optimus and Bumblebee but mostly focused to Witwicky and the humans.Saddest thing is, the scenes of Bumblebee were also moderated. He is the only Autobot in the series we know the most and loved but here he is now like Optimus and the rest of the Transformers. Why can't they just call these films ""Sam and the Transformers"" or ""World Invasion: Chicago and Egypt and LA and other places where the Transformies went""? Sounds more credible than ""Transformers"". I'm not really trolling Shia LaBeouf but him as Witwicky is like playing the same roles all over again. I bet he love Michael Bay for giving him these hot chicks. Rosie Huntington-Whitely was only cast for her sexy body and giving Sam a backup. She doesn't improve Megan Fox's Mikaela Beans.Transformers is supposed to be about the Transformers. But it has more humans, and Witwicky, and Cameos and Witwicky. I think Michael Bay is getting lazy. He's not taking this movie so seriously and the movie ends too quickly and he throws a lot of humanity and celebrity cameos in his excessive runtime. By the way this movie is called ""Transformers"" not ""Human Celebrities"". Well, Bay made a grave mistake.","222 out of 403 found this helpful.

Back in 2007 when they said there will be a transformers film I was kind of excited, I loved the idea. When I went to see the movies I was very very very disappointed. The robots look nothing like the cartoon, the story was different, Megatron's voice was different, Shia LaBeouf was awful - It was a bad movie. OK, sometimes things can get better, I went to see the second one. By all means those were 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Transformers 2 was a total disaster. No plot whatsoever, Megan Fox's body was being thrown on us for the film to succeed, about a million goofs and mistakes regarding ""the big war in Egypt"" - (Believe me, I know, I'm an Egyptian).I thought of giving Mr.Bay a last chance. I went to the movie with very low expectations and then....WOW. By far the best movie of the trilogy. It had a nice story, some twists, AMAZING CGI - no more shaky cameras, you can now witness every fight in clear detail. The music was fantastic (although ripped off, a little mix between The Dark Knight and Inception). Shia LaBeouf surprisingly was actually good. The movie is a summer blockbuster, it's a two and a half hour thrilling action ride with a lot of scenes that will make you drop your jaw and bite your fingernails. Why do critics hate it? Have no Idea. Please people don't talk about plot holes and wrong scientific facts, this is a movie about talking robots that have feelings, so I think we're already past the scientific and logical point! I gave this an 8 because I had to drop 2 points for the movie's biggest fault - Miss ""lips"" Rosie - She can't act, I didn't give a damn about her and to be honest, she is NOT hot. Megan was totally HOT. Don't wait to rent the DVD. You will not waste your money, if you like action, thrilling scenes, have an ear to music and most of all - like the Transformers, go see it.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

"7","/10","More of the same from Micheal Bay","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3058893/?ref_=tt_urv","thedudeabides-2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4397277/?ref_=tt_urv","31 July 2014","The Transformers franchise has got to be one of the most infuriating in all of Hollywood. On the one hand, you have some of the most exciting and innovative action set pieces, not to mention some seriously impressive CGI which really sells the idea of robots disguised as various transport vehicles. On the other hand, you have some of the most excruciating dialogue this side of Twilight, corny humour which would make your dad cringe, and a guarantee of a bum numbing running time of at least 2 and a half hours.And so it makes sense that Transformers: Dark Of The Moon follows the exact same template as the previous 2 movies. The action is fun, the CGI is the best it has ever been and the script is completely nonsensical. The story, for what it is, revolves around the 1969 moon landing. In Bay's universe, Neil Armstrong and Co. landed on the moon, but rather than being a simple exploration mission, they were actually researching a possible alien sighting. This of course turns out to be an old Transformer – one which the Decepticons (the bad guys) have been searching for and it's up to the Autobots (the good guys) to stop them. That's about it really, but Micheal Bay manages to pad out the story with a wholly unnecessary subplot involving Sam Witwicky and his low self esteem. It's as exciting as it sounds and only serves to distract from the admittedly impressive action.This is the main problem with this, and the other Transformer movies; it's just too long. There are a number of misguided attempts at humour and Sam's love interest has all the charisma of a cardboard box. And yet, by the time the epic 45 minute finale kicks in, you will forget about all the wasted time and revel in the destruction that he so masterfully weaves as the Decepticons launch a full on invasion of Chicago. It's easily the best extended sequence of the entire franchise and would have benefited even more if we didn't have to wade trough so much unnecessary exposition.A disappointing entry, in that Micheal Bay doesn't appear to have learnt from his previous mistakes. The good news is, he has also not lost his flair for explosive action and, in these moments, Transformers: Dark Of The Moon is every bit as entertaining as its prequels.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

But has he learned his lessons? Yes and no. Gone are the racially insensitive robots, the incredibly messy and clumsy plotting and much of the dizzying, incomprehensible camera-work. What remains is the poor geeky humour and questionable performances from the leads. Shia Labeouf was very enjoyable in the first movie but here has gone into overdrive, and his character Sam Witwicky has become much less relatable and interesting. His home life in particular (of which the first half of the movie focuses) is getting irritating. His girlfriend problems and embarrassing parents boring and we really couldn't care that much about how he feels unappreciated for saving the world twice. Then there's Megan Fox's replacement: Rosie Huntington-Whitely. She can't act. At all. It wasn't expected that the former model would be that great but she really is poor.The first hour of the film is much like Rosie. Nice to look at (especially in 3D) but lacking any substance at all. We are left with Ken Jeong doing his Hangover thing in a 12A film, and not being funny, just very annoying. And John Malkovich doing his thing but really just embarrassing himself. There are reams of exposition, while the plot is better than the last two films it is still handed out poorly. Bay won't let the action tell the story, it has to be action, break, story, break, action. The rest of the first hour is just CGI and Shia going mental while Rosie watches blankly.But all of a sudden the supporting comic actors are dropped and Michael Bay does what he does best: Explosions and fighting. An impressive freeway chase leading into a fight a plot twist (yes a plot twist in a Transformers movie) and a death of a significant character. The whole film gets better from here. The plotting gets tighter, John Tuturro and Frances McDormand are given more screen-time (there were so many Coen favourites in this movie I was expecting John Goodman to be voicing an Autobot) and the action is dished out in spades. Whe the decepticons invade Chicago all hell breaks loose. And we are given fights, battles, explosions and collapsing buildings galore. Robots kick, punch and rip each other apart. And this is where the third dimension comes into play. This is definitely the best 3D experience since Avatar. Watch in awe as Optimus Prime tears chunks of metal out of other giant robots and chucks them at the screen while in the depths of the background, aerial battles ensue. It is breathtaking and a triumph for 3D, proving that it can be done properly and amaze the viewer.If you went an hour late to the movie, and make sure it's a 3D screening, this would be a 5 star experience of pure entertainment. But as it stands it's still a solid closer for the trilogy, an improvement on Revenge of the fallen but not as good as the first.","30 out of 42 found this helpful.

He manages to make three movies that are basically all just carbon copies of each other and make them all at the very least entertaining. That is no small feat. Thus, although the luster of the franchise begins to wear off (especially towards the film's conclusion) in this installment, ""Dark of the Moon"" still is an entertaining romp that won't leave you bored.For a basic plot summary, ""Dark of the Moon"" formulates the notion that the Apollo 11 moon landing was merely a ""smokescreen"" for the retrieval of alien (i.e. Transformer) technology. Many years later, this technology predictably falls into the wrong hands and leaves the fate of the world to Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his military buddies (Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, & John Turturro).The positives of this movie are the usual: the special effects are a spectacle to behold, the action/adventure is pulse-pounding, and it is just a visual treat to watch. More importantly, though, is that the franchise still goes as LaBeouf goes. Though his exuberance for the Sam Witwicky role seems to have diminished just a bit (and perhaps that can be attributed to the character's aging as well), but his scenes are still the best of the experience.Sadly, this movie also has a few notable ""misses"" that render it only slightly above average. First of is the utter exclusion of Megan Fox's character. I realize that Fox had a falling-out with Bay and wanted nothing to do with this movie, but the fact remains is that her stand-in (supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) has nowhere near that great romantic chemistry with LaBeouf. Rose is just as ""bombshell"" as Fox, but acting-wise it isn't even close.Also, in this third go-'round, the general plot begins to get the slightest bit old. It is never boring, per se, but it doesn't have that ""edge"" like the first two did when the characters were still fresh.Overall, ""Dark of the Moon"" is a decent effort that doesn't end up boring in any way. The exclusion (and no explanation) of Fox is the biggest missing piece here, but other than that it is pretty much ""same old story"" (with just slightly less enthusiasm all around).","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Really, is it necessary to have some chick in skimpy clothes romancing around with metal crashing on metal in the background ? Unless off-course you wanted to woo schoolgirls in to watch the movie.

Now, it looks and feels exactly the other two films, in reality very little is changed upon so what we're given is a semi-mixed version of the first two, and that's sadly not a good thing. TRANSFORMERS 3 involves some spectacular CGI effects, and the more time director Bay shares with the robots not involved, the better the film is, which is kind of surprising given his experience. Megan Fox has been replaced by a high-heeled beauty which gives the teenage boys an alternate run for their money, and Shia LeBeouf in the leading part does a moderately good job, and as for the rest of the cast, it's not very much to say except that John Malkovich is funny in his scenes. The plot is as always very confusing and badly told, and the climax is long and noisy, which one can say is positive, though again - I felt tired at the end, being the film is very loud and way too long (a huge Michael Bay issue). It's way better than the second one, though not nearly as good as the first, so what we're stuck with is something in between.","162 out of 310 found this helpful.

I came into the cinema not expecting much, but I left feeling very underwhelmed. Other than the amazing effects, authentic sound, quite excellent action and above average cinematography and editing, this Transformers entry was a waste of time in my opinion.In my opinion Transformers:Dark of the Moon is the dullest and worst of the three. The first half is poorly paced and dull to the point of boredom, and while the second half fares much better due to the action it came too late and wasn't enough to stop the film from becoming a messy bore overall. The dialogue is stupid and formulaic, the film is much too long and the story is choppy and confused complete with a messy ending.Michael Bay's direction is another low point, it is murky and unfocused throughout, while the characters are either underused(the robots) or annoying(John Tuturro's character). The acting is not great at all, the voice work is decent, however John Malkovich is wasted, Shia LaBoeuf's easy going charm doesn't disguise the fact his performance is uncharismatic and dull, Patrick Dempsey(performance and character) is useless, John Tuturro tries hard but ends up over-compensating and the less said about the lovely but bland replacement for Megan Fox Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the better.All in all, a mess and the worst of the three. 3.5/10 Bethany Cox","98 out of 187 found this helpful.

The dialogue and cheesy and unnecessary one-liners (Optimus while flying: I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU! from 1000 meters away) are abundant here, but this is a ""Transformers"" film, but it still seemed to have slight resemblances to RotF, which it was said it would try to stay away from. Its not bad, but it sort of degrades the quality a tad bit, preventing it from being on-par with the first. Rosie Huntington-Whitley's acting in the film was poor as well, but that was expected, especially since she was probably just picked straight out of a Victoria's Secret magazine, especially since she models for them and was chosen just to look pretty and just have a big sign on her forehead saying, ""HEY GUYS, I'M REPLACING MEGAN FOX!"". She was the only really ""bad"" actor I witnessed throughout the film. Comment if you wish to try to educate me about everything else (I do agree that Wheelie and his buddy, while helpful in the movie, are still obnoxious, but less obnoxious than the dreaded Twins).GOOD Well, the humor of the first is back (no fart/ball/weed/kid jokes, mainly the type of humor from the first), and it was actually enjoyable instead of stupid like the second (and Sam's parents are slightly restrained also, participating only in the first half). The score is excellent, reminding me a little of the ""Inception"" score a bit, and Michael Bay did an awesome job directing the action sequences (my favorite part was when the paratroopers jumped out of the planes and flew through the city to find Decepticons to fight), but not very well with the plot scenes (although it was slightly more coherent than TF2).Also, the last hour of the movie, which starts with the climax of the brutal destruction of Chicago and DC (Megatron destroys the Lincoln Memorial and sits upon his throne, which I found somewhat ironic), and ends when the long battle is over, especially in 3D, makes up for the gaping flaws.FINAL VERDICT Compared the the first, its only average, but compared to the second, its like the first. It was a bit cliché at the beginning and the end, but the last hour makes up for some of it. I would give it a 3/5 (a B-), but I'll amp it up to a 3.5 just because it met my expectations.It was some good fun, and the 3D is quite good. See it while the gas prices are down.GRADE: B (3 and a half stars out of 5)","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A good movie although it still remains dark in many ways !!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2553897/?ref_=tt_urv","loopmyworld","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22210094/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2012","After the success of revenge of the fallen in terms of money grossing over the globe, Michael bay n his team returns in Transformers 3 Dark of the moon. The movie is way much better from revenge in many ways. Been unlucky not to get the chance to watch it in 3d cause, the only 3d theatre projector got busted just before the release of the movie. Totally heartbroken as my other friends enjoyed the movie in 3d. well let first give you the overall negative & positive comments of the movie in my opinion.Negative points Where is Megan fox ? if I would have Michael bay, would have done anything to get her back in this third installment & made her role much better that European chick.Was there a need of the Chinese guy in the movie director bay, I don't think so ! Megatron & Starscream were total waist in the movie, their role is not at not convincing as in previous installments.Ratchet share the screen presence for not more than a minute in the entire movie.The movie would have been better without Epps in my opinion. Bay just got him the movie to show the link between previous installments . Movie looses grip in the last 40 minutes due to excess of action & as their weren't much use of dialogues in the end.What's the need of that European chick running around in the battle ? I could see the glimpse of war of the worlds & other alien invasion movies in this film.I personally hate that scene so much the fight between Sam & Starscream, it does'nt make any sense & very unbelievable.Positive points The movie begins breathless, Autobots ark crashing on the moon & Apollo 11 sent to moon to investigate. Brilliant move Bay.Good thing that Bay rid of Rc twins, which was pleasure to my eyes & ears .Some new robots in Autobots, Que , Dino & Rackers. I became an instant fan of Dino, when he first transformers in the Middle East illegal nuclear site & his words. Way to go bay.Bumble bee is been upgraded with its design & now he can even shoot without getting transformed. Way to go bay.Optimus Prime as usual brilliant in the movie & carries the movie on his shoulders specially after getting betrayed by Sentinel Prime. He is being upgraded to with fly tech.The introduction of new Decepticon Shockwavewooooooo my new fav in Decepticons & makes me his fan with its first arrival.Laserbeak & Soundwave looks good on screen too.Sentinel Primes looks perfect as a villain against Optimus prime & much more powerful too & has been given the perfect voice to his role.Shia has improved with his acting skills in this movie, & proves that transformers is no where without him.Agent Simmons at its best again in this movie, brings smile on my face with his introduction in this movie.Mearing role is perfect for this movie, looks more powerful way strict. She share an important screen presence in the movie.The movie has got some of the best action sequences in the entire transformers series, my personal favourite, the highway battle my gosh what a chase I literally felt that I am actually inside the movie. 3 Decepticons chasing Sentinel & bumblebee, sideswipe & Dino in action. Ultimate action chase. Dino steals the show in this particular part. The best part of this chase is the background score, special thanks to my fav music composer Steve. The music touches my soul deeply every time I hear it & it suits the chase perfectly. I actually watch this particular everyday. The best action sequence in the entire transformers seriers. Masterpiece bay.Ironhide the tuff autobots does it again in the Mexican stand off & so does the sideswipe.Linkin park does it again giving another theme song for this movie, way soulful.Steve as usual give the best background score once again.This movie in my opinion could have been much better if bay & Ehren would have work more harder on the script cause I totally believe this movie could have been the best in the entire series but as usual its been ruined in many ways. If this movie would have been directed by Spielberg it could have been much better. If your planning to make a 4th one then bay please please take all your time work on the script & make a good transformers. No doubt about the effects in the movie but still you got to work on the script & screenplay. But still the movie is highly enjoyable in many ways & I loved it. As a huge transformers fan I rate it as 9 on the scale of 10 specially that highway chase which was breathless.The movie has got the best trailer ever i have ever seen. I am definitely going to buy the 3d bluray.","11 out of 14 found this helpful.

I liked the visual effects but that wasn't the whole movie as some reviewers said, there is good dialog and it shows humans for about the same amount of time as transformers. I thought that plot wise, the second movie is better but the visual effects on this one took the cake. I think they should end the transformers series here, if they make another one they are going to drag it out, this movie was stretching it a bit much. Its going to turn redundant soon.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It lacks of a convincing argument, and it ends up being just another almost-boring Sci-Fi movie.I've got the feeling that they could keep making these movies for ever.Recommended if you (like me) are wanting to watch some good visual effects.

She is gorgeous, but she can't play. At least she didn't in this movie. I bet she tried, but what we have is just horrible, and there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Shia Lebeouf's to the point I couldn't actually believe that Witwicky digs her character. It really bothered me throughout the movie. I mean, we have Turturro who overdoes his part but for one I'm fond of him, and two - he does that deliberately and winks to the audience while doing it. I understand that, it's just an action-figure movie. Yet what Rosie delivers is dramatic, and would be in anything more than, let's say, a Brazilian TV soap opera.Sigh. Alright, let's move forward. I'll just point out that the story, while making more sense than in the previous part, is still rather so - so. While everything is fine with the dark side of the moon and the general core of the plot, there are little inconsequences and simply daft scenario cuts that make it, at times, just disturbing to watch (whole issue of government handling the situation, Malkovic and Jeong characters). Not to mention we are lead by the hand throughout whole movie so while there are some major twists - you just can't be surprised when they finally happen.So what's good? As always - humor and visuals. I mean the battle at second part of the movie is truly epic. The mega-mecha-worm cutting through buildings, the air scenes with skydivers, dang, those are some really creative effects that were never tried before in any other action movie, and they are top quality too.So why rate it so high? 7/10.C'mon, it's a movie about giant robots! Let's not expect too much from it.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The special effects held up well after ten years. The directing and some dialogue could be better, but there are great scenes that have beautiful visuals. Rosie Huntington Whitley is stunning, the cars are beautiful and there are scenes with elegant visuals. Some of the jokes will probably be dated in the near future and theres alot of product placement. It can be somewhat exploitive of Rosie Huntington Whitley as she is essentially eye candy and a damsel in distress, but she does SOME stuff. The cast is preety A list however for a threequel. Shia Labeuf plays Sam as quirky as ever in this one but hes trying to prove himself more as a hero. John Malkovitch, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Patrick Dempsey, Frances Mcdormand, and Alan Tudyk all have great character performances. Hugo weaving and Leonord Nimoy do a fantastoc job as well. Sentinel Prime is a well rounded character. Much of the action is mechanical and explosive but theres alot of sci fi action as well such as dogfighting spaceships, carchaces, gunfights with lasers, and disaester scenes. It doesnt have a good ending either and kind of cuts off at the end, but; everyones arcs are preety fullfilled. It also has one of the best alien invasion scenes, I feel. The Autobot designs are preety cool though a bit stereotypical when it comes to race, theres an italian, and two celtic sounding robots which really doesnt make sense if they are aliens from another planet. Rhe Decepticons have cool designs as well. Theres also a few plot holes but nothing that interferes with the story. Its mainly a movie you watch for entertainment and action, theres a few emotional moments like the begining scenes and a few with Sam but the human side of the story isnt as fun to watch. I do like how the antagonists are dark shadows to the protagonists. Its also probably the most rewatchable, american, giant-robot film besides maybe the Iron Giant. Id say if you have time to kill and want a movie to watch on maybe a work night or a lazy day I would recomend this.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A little better than 2009's sequel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2728256/?ref_=tt_urv","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29565770/?ref_=tt_urv","30 December 2012","So many changes, so little progress. As the conclusion to the Transformers trilogy, this second sequel was better than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but not everything was tweaked as tight as it should have been. There were changes and there weren't. As stated before in my last two reviews of this franchise, there are three components that have stayed the same for these three films. These three components are the music, action and special effects.The music, still composed by Steve Jablonsky; good work. The action; still big, loud and bold. The special effects; still cool to watch robots transform and fight. Not much to be said because that kind of stuff has been standardized now. The autobots and decepticons are still voiced by their respective voice-actors. One decepticon I found really cool was Shockwave. A real robot I don't think anyone would want to mess with. Here are the changes and for the most part they are positive things. First, Megan Fox has been replaced with Victoria's Secret model, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who plays Sam Witwicky's new main squeeze, Carly. It's not that I find her bad at acting but she doesn't cut out being a tomboy like character as Megan Fox made out in the first two. Plus, Carly's clothing ceases to get dirty throughout the whole running time of the film. Oh and let's not forget that she runs around in high-heels.The next piece to change was the tone of this sequel. For once, the film crew heard what fans and audiences wanted and they followed up on it. Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) actually has less of a comedic feel. People will actually be killed on screen. It won't be blood and guts but the audience will actually see them die. Also the two loud- mouthed autobots were removed from the story as well. Thank you for listening Ehren Kruger.However, I am still frustrated over the fact that Kruger did give Simmons (John Turturro) a larger than needed role and still gave Shia LaBeouf's role the lines, ""You scream here, here, here and..."". I'm done with the runaround. I don't know how others who tolerate it can sit through it and say that's good acting. It's noise. The explosions are more fun to listen to than that.The second transformers sequel has some improvements over its previous follow up but it still lacks the greatness of the first.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

On top of that we have Shia Lebouf screaming every 5 minutes countless laws of physics and common sense being broken (and not in a god way) and is packed with characters that are unnecessarily over the top or just unneeded, like Ken Jeong and John Malcovich.Overall it is a very slight improvement over the second film but still falls far short of one's expectations.Overall will give this a 3 out of 10 for amazing special effects and relief that this will be Michael Bay's final defecation on the Transformers franchise.","13 out of 22 found this helpful.

Seriously, it was crap. I was a fan of the first TRANFORMERS movie, but the second was almost enough for me to write off the series completely. Now, I understood that there was a lot of behind-the-scenes trouble during the second movie's development/production, so when the time came that the third movie, DARK OF THE MOON, was to be released I could barely muster any interest. I almost passed on it, but I enjoyed the first movie enough and the reviews coming out claiming that the third film was actually decent blockbuster fodder convinced me to give it a shot. I did, and I'm happy to say that it was a lot better than I expected. Not good enough to rank as one of the best movies of 2011, but fun enough that I haven't totally given up hope on the franchise (because let's be honest, this series isn't done yetnot while it keeps making bank at the box office). In this movie, it's explained that America's sudden eagerness to reach the moon during the 60's space race was the result of a mysterious craft's crash landing. The first men to walk on the moon discovered a Cybertronian secret that would remain buried for decades. In present day, Optimus Prime and the Autobots are angered to discover that the humans have been keeping this secret from them and demand access to the craft and it's contents. We discover that the craft is the Ark, a ship sent from Cybertron during the war containing a secret to ensure the continuing survival of the Cybertronian race.For starters, I should mention that the story in this movie is actually coherent. It's amazing how much better things turn out when your writers aren't on strike. The plot is pretty slim (though I love the premise: integrating man's first landing on the moon with the Transformers canon), but that's to be expected in a movie where the big interest is the visuals. If there's one thing that can be counted on in a Transformers movie, it's that the CG will be spectacular. They've had three movies to perfect these effects, so yeah, they're pretty awesome. Quick complaint about the CG: the computer-generated JFK. It sucked and stuck out horribly. The Transformers themselves look great and the action is seamless and intense. The battles in this movie are done a lot better than in the previous movie because you can actually see what is going on. With that said, I've got to saythe fights in this movie are pretty brutal. I was surprised. I mean, the whole series is based on a collection of children's toys and a cartoon. When the Transformers fight in this movie, robots are being dismembered. ""Blood"" is spurting. Death gurgles. Heads ripped off and even a ""spine"" being ripped out. Seriously, you replace the robots with humans in this movie and you've got a hard-R rated action film. I'm not complaining, I'm justwow. A bit out of place but pretty cool nonetheless.There's a lot of action in this movie. The last 45 minutes in the movie is a non-stop action sequence as Sam and the Autobots infiltrate a Decepticon-devastated Chicago. But, unlike the overlong action ending in REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, this one entertains. The majority of the regular cast returns here: Shia LeBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, etc. Even Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) get some screen time, though mercifully less than in the second movie. The only one missing is Megan Fox. Oh well. Her character was nothing more than eye candy in both of the first movies so, plot-wise, she won't be missed. Nope, director Michael Bay merely replaced her with a different piece of eye candy, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. A Victoria's Secret model, Rosie's acting history is limited. But that's OK, because the only thing this character needs to do in Michael Bay's Transformer movies is look good in slow motion and show off the goods when necessary. And that's all she does. Mission accomplished? Speaking of Michael Bay, I guess he's had a good run with the Transformers series but, in my opinion, it's time for him to let go. Let another director have a chance to bring these larger-than-life robots to the big screen. He's done well (ok, except for FALLEN) but his shtick is getting stale. His obsession with the military is becoming overbearing in these movies. I get it, he likes the armed forces and has some friends inside that let him use the cool stuff. But I didn't come to this movie to see Bay's military toys, I came to watch giant robots kick each other's butts. Enough, man. I also think the character of Sam Witwicky has run his course. Let him remain as a supporting character in future films, but pass the torch to a new leading man. New director, new characters, more robots. Time for an overhaul. Well, time will tell where this series will go in the future (and there's already a release date scheduled for a fourth film). On the bright side, DARK OF THE MOON was fun enough that I'm willing to see another in theaters. If you were a fan of the first movie, then DARK OF THE MOON probably won't disappoint you.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"","","Transformers : Dark side of the Moon","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2460991/?ref_=tt_urv","jjf662001","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24249904/?ref_=tt_urv","18 July 2011","So who is with me and giving up on listing to some of these so called critics who bash our comic book movies? I say if you're a fan of the transformers show or any other comic book film franchise stand up for it and let your voice be heard. This sci –fi adventure transformers : dark side of the moon stars Shia Labeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington –Whiteley, and PatrickDempsey.It's directed by Michael Bay and runs 157 minutes.Going into this film i was hoping it would better then revenge of the fallen and it went way beyond that this film was a home run. The Transformers : Dark side of the Moon centers around the autobots learning about a cybertronian spaceship that crashed landed on the moon during the war on cybetron between the Autobots and Decepticons, this space ship holds a secret that could have help the Autobots defeat the decepticons.The secret is held inside an accent autobot leader Sentinel prime who crashed on the moon and prompted the space race of 1969 between the USA and Russia.Sam's life picks up after transformers 2 living in Washington DC trying to find a job after graduating from college living with his new girlfriend Carly(Rosie Huntington –whitely).Megan fox and victories' secrets model Sam is one luck guy.This secret brings SAM (ladies man 261) witwicky back into the fold of the war among the auto bots and decepticons. While working at new job he meets a co worker jerry Wang (ken jeong) who has inside info to the spaceship that crashed on the moon and knew Sam had connections to the auto bots. He gives this information to Sam in an awkward but funny bathroom scene wrestling around in a bathroom stall. When on the way to give this info the CIA, which is headed up by Charlotte mearing (Frances Mcdormand) Sam is attacked by the decepticons at every turn.Sam realizes after some digging what the plan actually is and all hell breaks loose. It's all starts with his girlfriend Carly being kidnapped by her slimy boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who happens to be an allies of the decepticons and helping them get the secret from the crashed spaceship on the moon.You know regardless of what people think of all the special effects being used nowadays this is one film where it is necessary to explaining the story and bring the characters to life. Michael bay did an outstanding job of bringing this final chapter to life from the battles between the auto bots vs.decepticons to the attack on the CIA facility, and the attack on Chicago and everything in between.If you're expecting any Oscar worthy performances here you went to the film and wasted your money. This is a typical sci- fi action adventure lot of explosions gun fire, buildings collapsing, and aliens. He did a good job adding some new faces to the franchise; it didn't interfere with telling the story at all. Ken Jeong (the hangover) John Malkovich (red) added just the right amount of humor as Sam's co worker, and lunatic boss.Frances Mcdormand felt like she was there all along from the beginning and what can you say about Rosie Huntington –whiteley she made me forget about Megan what's here name.If this indeed is the final chapter in this wildly successful franchise you can say it really went out with bang. It didn't disappoint one bit from beginning to end. I give Transformers: Dark side of the Moon 7out of 10 stars for putting a great product on the big screen.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The home i share with my wife is filled with original die-cast metal transformers toys made in the 80's which i display proudly in my home. I have spent large sums of money to get the items i want and countless hours learning about each transformers character and history. In short, i am a transformers purist. This means i want any movie that depicts my childhood heroes to be true to their original characters and soul. This is a bias i must point out so that you the reader understand where i come from in writing this. Michael Bay has come under sharp criticism for how he directed the first two films. It was widely accepted before the third was released, that the original was far superior than the second. Now it is time to explore what Michael Bay did well and not so well in the third. WHAT IT DOES WELL. The films action sequences are superb. One of these scenes in particular is worth the price of admission alone where a number of autobots seek to protect another while driving at high speed on a freeway. More specifically, it is bumblebee's attempt to do battle with passengers on board that is an absolutely magnificent sequence that gave me similar thrills to those i experienced when i saw the car chase sequence in the second Matrix film. To give you an idea, I consider that scene in the Matrix to be one of the best car chase action sequences ever. If you enjoy action films then this movie is a must. Michael Bay does his best to bring some maturity to the plot .There are twists that genuinely add to the drama and draw real surprise and anger (towards the characters) from the viewer - these moments alone allow the film to stand head and shoulders above the second transformers film. The brutality of battle is not censored and the very real sight of human casualties is a welcome realism that was missing in the last two films. The film definitely has its comedic moments. John Malkovich has a welcome and underused role and the banter between Bumblebee and Witwicky is not heard often enough. There was a clear decision to give a less prominent role to Sam Witwicky's parents and i actually believe this was a mistake. Going against the grain i actually found his mother's role and edgy insanity to be funny in the first two films. Regardless, the film managed to have the audience laughing at times more so than the last 2 films. WHERE IT FALLS DOWN The acting is cringeworthy. As i exited the theatre i overheard one woman say to her friend ""would you like some cheese with that?"" and her cynical question nailed it on the head. The film utilises a cliché'd romance between its main star and his sweetheart to motivate many of his actions and it does not work. Their scripted lines are stale and lack any type of edge. More importantly, the Transformers themselves always had enough on their own to sustain a plot. These are machines with souls and the original characters had failings just like humans - these imperfections made them interesting. We do not see it in these Transformers films and the insertion of a romance plus its lack of credible dialogue means we miss out on a big part of the folklore that makes this franchise great. The film does not make a genuine effort to be true to the original transformers. To name but a few let me provide examples: OVERALL Transformers 3 is an action extravaganza worth seeing for the wonderful sequence of battles and use of CGI. The acting, as with the first two is average-to-poor but this film is a genuine improvement on the second and is on-par with the first. For those with little concern for the Transformers history and mythology this is likely to satisfy but one thing is for sure, Michael Bay has failed to satisfy the hardcore fans in his attempt to bring the Transformers to modern day cinema.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Argurably better than the first one, and just about anything is better than the second","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451151/?ref_=tt_urv","FairlyAnonymous","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25126113/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2011","Well after the last transformers movie (revenge of the fallen) a lot of people lost hope in the transformers series. Actually some people lost hope after the first movie, but I personally liked it.Dark of the moon takes place some time after Revenge of the Fallen, and thank goodness Sam has a new girlfriend. Honestly Megan Fox wasn't really attractive in the last movies and just kind of looked like a... ummm... not going to say slut... but you get the drift. Either way this new girl who is played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who honestly know how to act for not being in any movies before this. I found this surprising that she actually did have some acting talent, and seemed like a better match for Sam's character than Megan... but honestly who really cares about the female role. I WATCH TRANSFORMERS FOR VIOLENCE! Shockingly Dark of the Moon has a plot of sorts (I know this may sound like a stretch for Michael Bay) but it does. The plot isn't real deep or extremely engaging, but it still has one that deals with conspiracies and it actually makes sense. The visuals are over the top in this movie, and honestly the visuals are so good you don't really question if this is real life or not (scary, I know). This movie is much darker compared to the others and there are much less juvenile jokes. That was the biggest problem with the last two movies is that the autobots would do something juvenile like fart, pee on someone, or talk trash. There is a little bit of that in this movie, but much less compared to the others. The most annoying characters from the last movie are gone. Sentinel Prime is voice by Leonard Nimoy which I discovered when watching the movie and I literally turned to the guy next to me ""THAT'S LEONARD NIMOY!"".This movie is really good at being what it is: A very violent robot action movie, with human characters that are there for plot reasons. The human scenes are sometimes funny (a particular bathroom scene) but sometimes they are unrealistic. Like where someone gets shoved out of a window, only to fall to their death. Everyone in the building practically laughs at the guys death, and take pictures. One guy says ""Look there is a dead guy out there, he is literally everywhere, so go clean him up."" at this scene bothered me because it is trying to be funny, but it is so dark that it doesn't make sense.I'm slowly getting to this, but the action in this movie is top notch, along with the 3-D. If you are going to see this movie, see it in 3-D. The action is very detailed, has graphic robot violence, and is very epic. All of the battles are very cool and fun to watch. Seeing humans work together to take down a giant robot is also cool, though sometimes it seems like the humans weapons are overpowered. Like when the humans are using machine guns, you will see chunks of robot fall off. Another impressive battle was a road action sequence which you could compare to the road action sequence in the first movie. The only difference is that this one is bigger, and a lot cooler. The decepticons are in large numbers in this movie, but they seem to be a bit weaker, and Optimus Prime now has a crazy amount of weapons and seems like a total bad-a** when he is mowing down tons of decepticons.The movie has some slight pacing issues, like the ending seems a bit too abrupt, especially if this truly is the last movie then I think there should've been a deeper ending. There are a couple moments in the movie where a whole bunch happens in about 30-seconds. Like the entire decepticon attack was viewed in a montage... slightly disappointing we didn't get to see the whole attack instead of only a couple seconds of it.If you want to see a great action movie, with a fairly good plot then Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the movie for you. If you didn't like the first movie than you might not like this one... you notice I didn't even mention the second movie there? Either way see this movie in 3D and you will definitely enjoy it. Did I mention the ending action sequence is over an hour long?","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I've never been a fan of the first and second one, but I like them nonetheless. When I found out my Mom was going to make me watch this, I had low expectations.But after I watched the film, I realized I was wrong. The movie pulls it off. I never thought I would like this one but ended up LOVING it. This is a simple tale of freedom and the will to claim it against all odds. The acting was top-notch, and I have to give Rosie Huntington-Whiteley due credit for making a great performance which is not bad for a first-timer. Shia was as usual excellent and so were the other actors. Their performances complement the simplistic storyline to give it a kick it deserves.And finally, there are the Autobots and Decepticons. They have been the CGI masterpieces that they are ever since the first one, and now it seems they've just secured their spot as the most charming CG robots on Earth and Cybertron. (Yes, I found even Megatron quite great.) In Dark of the Moon, they are not just rendered robots but somehow, the makers were able to breathe personality and even more life into all of them. Kudos to Michael Bay for directing this great third act to the Transformers franchise. I just wish there is no more 4th film as it might ruin the greatness in the series.10/10","15 out of 21 found this helpful.

The others are good fun and all, but they're never what ""they could have been"". And, to be honest, Michael Bay is a great visual director, but a TERRIBLE storyteller. It shows a lot in almost everything he touches (""Pearl Harbor"" being the best example of how the man, simply, can't tell a story).Having said that, I feel that Bay directed this movie with the single intent to show us one of the greatest fire-work movies of all time. Screw the story, the characters and the substance and let's simply blow something up. The ""final fight"" last for about an hour and I just didn't want it to end. Let's face it, nobody walks in a Transformers movie for the story, that's just stupid. If you want to see some of the greatest action scenes ever made, watch this film. If you're looking for a great story and a beautiful romance, go see Titanic or something else. This is a film for the eyes. And it delivers it in an amazing fashion.","16 out of 23 found this helpful.

Transformers 2 only made things worse. Jokes and humour only funny to children with language and sexual references aimed at a much older audience, it was a mess.Now you could say; 'Why then, if you hated the first two films, would you go to the theatre to see the third?' I have a six year old brother who is obsessed with Tranformers. He is going to see the movie either way. So I thought it best if he was going to a 3 hour long abortion by Micheal Bay in the theatre, I might as well be there to support him.It begins like just another sequel and goes on for about an hour with only a few hints of action yet both the presences and performances of Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk and a much less goofy, John Turturro, take the film to a new respectable level. I know, I still can't believe it either.Somewhere within the 2nd hour, a complete shift happens. A series of plot twists with characters and Shia LaBeouf, who I have never been a fan of, for the first-time in the series, we actually relate with! The film then continues to surprise as it gets bigger and darker with excellent effects and stunts with human characters we care for. It's not shot over-the-top Micheal Bay style either, which is a surprise within the film itself. The film looses the over-use of shaky cams and lens flares, instead focuses in on what is going on, so we can get in on the action instead of getting frustrated trying to figure out what is going on.It's almost as if Micheal Bay studied Zack Snyder's direction of The Watchmen, stopped smoking crack and later, watching J.J. Abrams films, said, ""That's what I've been doing wrong!""","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

"7","/10","This epic conclusion will make a Transformers fan out of everyone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450697/?ref_=tt_urv","DonFishies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1622466/?ref_=tt_urv","28 June 2011","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Michael Bay's finest achievement. It is not his best film (that honour will always reside with The Rock), but it is his most mature film to date. After disappointing everyone including himself with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Bay went back to the drawing board with the final film in his robotic orgy of mayhem and destruction, and rehauled just about everything. While the results are not perfect, it shows that he may not be quite the hack we always thought he was. And that he knows exactly how to end things with a bang.Picking up a few years after the travesty involving the Fallen, Dark of the Moon revolves around secret government coverups, the US/Russian space race of the 1960s, high-level assassinations, secret counter- terrorism ops involving the Autobots, and Sam Witwicky's (Shia LaBeouf) search to find his place in the world. It may sound just as busy as the previous two films, but Dark of the Moon manages to let the story flow organically through the first two acts. It feels significantly more grounded immediately after it starts, and all the threads manage to lead somewhere. And rather surprisingly, there are very little action scenes splitting up the story beats. It stalls in some places due to a serious lack of editing, but I am willing to give more than enough credit to Bay and writer Ehren Kruger for composing something that actually held my interest and did not lose me twenty minutes in. The government intrigue and the blending of the Apollo 11 mission and infamous space race into the story was so incredibly well done that you almost forget you are watching a film about robots that can turn into cars. But what is really impressive about the film is how grown up it feels. When I watched Transformers and Revenge of the Fallen, I knew I was watching slickly produced movies primarily sold to teenagers and young males. While watching Dark of the Moon, it felt like it was catering to a more adult audience. The dark nature of the film is simply astounding, and becomes downright brutal in some areas. I was really surprised by Bay's go-for-broke style, but it works for the tone the film strives for. There are more than a few shocking moments sprinkled throughout that really push the PG-13 rating of the film. I predict that some parents may take immediate issue with how violent the film becomes.While the dark nature of the film flows throughout its excessive running time, the story comes to a screeching halt when it hits the third act and the massive battle scene begins. You may have read that it lasts almost an hour, and it comes pretty close. It is an absolutely insane, balls-to-the-wall action piece that simply needs to be seen to be believed. The blend of special effects, practical effects and 3D effects is simply outstanding. The addition of the real 3D effects helps make the battle, and the robot antagonists, feel more real than ever. Bay has staged some awesome fights in the previous two films, but this ridiculous heart-stopping battle is simply incredible and outdoes every single one. It is worth the price of admission alone, Transformers fan or not.Of course, this is a Transformers film, so it is not without its fault. The 3D may be the best since Avatar, but it never really comes alive until the final act of the film. Leading up to that, it is just as underwhelming as every other 3D film you have seen recently. And as you likely have guessed, the film is far too long for its own good. Some scenes drag themselves out unnecessarily, and others are cut up way too quick. But what really drags it out is the obscene level of comedy taking place before the epic battle starts. I mentioned how adult the film is, but it still attempts to bring in the child audience with goofy jokes and ridiculously zany performances from John Malkovich, John Turturro, Alan Tudyk and especially Ken Jeong. The previous two films seemed like they had a few too many jokes, but here they just feel forced and overdone. It makes the film feel desperate in some scenes to evoke the dark tone it is aiming for, and in other scenes feels like a complete betrayal. Acting wise, there are not a lot of standouts. LaBeouf does his usual scared hero routine, and both Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do their usual ass kicking routine. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is absolutely stunning eye-candy as Sam's new squeeze Carly, and she wisely does not even attempt to act. Frances McDormand does well in a thankless turn as a CIA honcho, but Patrick Dempsey is likely the only human character who gets to chew scenery and not overact while doing it. I have yet to be impressed with him as a film actor, but he gives a great performance here easily outshining everyone not playing a robot. Voicewise, Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving are excellent as always, as is the absolutely impeccable Leonard Nimoy playing Sentinel Prime.I wanted to love Transformers: Dark of the Moon for everything that is done right and all the mistakes it makes up for. But it still has its share of problems that seem to be characteristic of the franchise more than anything else. Yet, do not let these issues hold you back from experiencing the sheer absurdity of Bay's robot opera. It is a wild event, and one of the few true worthwhile blockbusters we have seen this summer. After being disappointed by the previous two films, I can say without fault that I was made a fan by this film. I just wish I did not have to wait for three movies to make it happen.7/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Dark of The Moon sustains with overlong explosion-laden redundancy, but not without some improvement over its predecessor","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3733655/?ref_=tt_urv","Screen_Blitz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24623283/?ref_=tt_urv","18 June 2017","Behold the third entry of the Transformers saga. After the mediocre sequel that was 'Revenge of The Fallen' in 2009, Michael Bay has made his return to the director's wheel with a second sequel that manages to breath a just a little more life back in the franchise. It is loud and it is a very special effects heavy with lots of explosions, lots of destruction, lots of innuendo, and lots of screaming -- all of which is packed into a bloated 154-minute runtime. In addition, it slightly improves upon one major aspect that plagued the previous film, and that is boasting a more coherent plot with slightly more ambition. On the other hand, this does not eliminate the problems in Ehren Krueger's script which sporadically hinder the loud and overlong experience. Another change in this entry lies in the casting of Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who steps into the damsel-in- distress role, replacing Megan Fox was fired prior to production. This film tells the story of Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) who leads the Autobots in a race against the Decepticons lead by Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) to retrieve a mysterious Cybertronian artifact discovered by NASA back in the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf) has graduated college and has just landed his first white-collar job to support him and his new girlfriend Carly (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). When he and Carly are unexpectedly dragged into a heated war between autobots and the decepticons, they must enlist the help of the National Intelligence Agency, head by Mearing (played by Frances McDormand), to aid them in yet another battle on Earth. Michael Bay normally falls short of ambition when it comes to storytelling. The premise, which unlike the previous two installments, boast a surprising amount of substance dealing with the Space Race during the JFK administration. The story to is able competently connect landmark political history with the Transformers universe. But when it comes to sustaining the plot, that is where things falter. In return, he tries to make up for this an enormous slew of eye-dazzling action sequences complete with extravagant special effects and enough explosions to put dozens of firework shows at once to shame. Then it comes to the big question: are these massive special effects do enough to distract from the thinly developed plot? For a while, they do, especially for those with longer attention spans to parades of visual effects than the narrative. Bay indulges in his signature blow-em-up style with countless shots of the giant metal monsters punching, shooting, and slashing each other to pieces, a gimmick that gets taken to a bulky advantage in the final act during the climatic battle in downtown Chicago. The destruction of the skyscrapers is spectacular and fun to sit through, but goes on for so long to the point where it gets a little numbing. On the surface side, the performances are about as good as actors can get in the franchise. Shia Labeouf is fine in the role, and working along his side is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the model-turned-actress who turns into a rather one-note performance. Her role is rendered to feel identical to the fashion in which Megan Fox's character is written in the previous films, and that is serving as a sex symbol for teen boy, especially as she is introduced in the first ten minutes in a shot showing her lingerie- clad bottom. Arguably the most surprising new face in the cast is Frances McDormand who, like the actress she is, turns in a competent performance. Needless to say, it is nothing that shouts for wide recognition as is the rest of cast here including Ken Jeong who has a minor (and gravely obnoxious) role during the first half.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an overlong, but somewhat competent special-effects action thrill ride that is likely to please those hungry for some explosive visual heft signature to Michael Bay's trademark directorial style, but disappoint those seeking for something more ambition. As far as many of Bay's films go, this one sustains a level of entertainment that is not too low, but too high either. Don't go in expecting something ambitious.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you hated both movies then stay the hell away because there will be nothing new for you this time around.Quite simply this is the most outstanding action flick you're likely to see this year let alone this summer and it's a successful return to what they managed to deliver with the first movie. Make no mistake about the toilet humour, sometimes screwball acting and silly jokes. That stuff is still very evident but unlike the second movie where it went spiralling out of control and dominated the picture, here it is kept firmly on a leach. In fact it is very much a film of two halves, the first half has an even mix of humour an action but it doesn't go too over the top to the point where we see robots doing embarrassing things like peeing or showing their balls etc, and there is a lot of human death unlike the other films. You see the innocent getting wiped out not just building collapsing and explosions. The second half is very much a tour de force of action scenes that are either nail biting or breath taking, not much letting up once it starts going and the finale is very satisfying! This is no movie with an agenda to deliver some life changing tale, it makes no attempt to equal the Bard with its narrative or plot. This is a movie based on popular toys for boys. Expect that much and you will be entertained because they actually set up this movie with a very clever conspiracy theory based on the NASA missions to the moon and weave that into the roots of the franchise. Shia Lebeouf is without his sidekick for the last two movies in Megan Fox but finds a more than worthy successor in supermodel Rosie Huntington Whiteley who plays a part that's very difficult to see Megan ever pulling off. Sure these girls are meant for mostly eye candy but where Megan's hot lipstick and deep pencilled eyebrowed, glam-pornstar look got more slutty with each picture, Rosie's supermodel grace and fine English accented charm brings more class than candy. Sorry Megan fans but no way would she pull of a semi-rich bitch who's been to finishing school and back! In fact her part is essential in the few well executed plot twists and deceptions this movie presents that were never as potent in its predecessors.All this builds up to last hour of back to back action sequences of spectacle, stealth, barbaric violence and utter heroics that will please the masses and outrage the critics who can never assess these kind of movie based on what they aim to be rather than what they don't! Transformers Dark of the Moon delivers a picture worthy of ending any action series, this is what makes buying a movie box set on home video worth parting with the cash even when one of the films is totally duff. Bay's even managed to show the industry how to use 3D with easily the best 3D presentation since Avatar. Whoever takes over this franchise has a mighty jump to make because Michael Bay has placed the bar pretty damn high!","158 out of 292 found this helpful.

It's all a bit exaggerated, since I see little reason for the critical acclaim piled onto later CGI-action blockbusters of the superhero variety. Bay sticks to his vision, his personality, all of which oozes out of every frame of this film for better or for worse, and with Dark of the Moon he basically synthesizes all the trends that would come to define Hollywood films throughout the decade.DOTM is a different type of film than the previous two Transformers films, which were very much products of the mid-2000s. Gone is the shaky-cam, War-on-Terror military aesthetic, replaced by a slick, detached-from-reality sci-fi tone. Gone are the messy Roland Emmerich-esque subplots, which have been cleaned up into a slightly more linear and focused format. The effects sequences are dialed up to 11, going to places the previous films probably couldn't reach due to budgetary reasons. The final battle is a massive boondoggle of Bayhem, so large scaled it overwhelms the film. The tawdry, 'edgy' humor has been dialed down. It attempts 'dark' themes while staying at an essentially juvenile level.If all this sounds familiar, it's because it all fits with the evolution of Hollywood films from the 2000s to the 2010s; Bay was way ahead of the times, or maybe he defined them. Even current Marvel films (along with old ones like the first Avengers) seem to owe something to DOTM since they all steal from its structure, its tone.That's part of why I'm more forgiving of this film, it certainly has the personal stamp of its creator and already has caught enough flack. Avengers films are TV productions of corporate blandness, yet they seem to get higher Rotten Tomatoes scores than most Oscar nominees. Why is this? They lack the kinetic force of Bay, while being equally brainless and simplistic. Both Bay's films and modern blockbusters indulge in bathetic, cringy 'comic relief'. (Bay's humor is overall worse, but at least he's not trying to 'cleverly' mock the conventions of his own sci-fi world). All of them are somehow able to ensnare some of the most talented actors Hollywood has to offer.Another thing: DOTM is actually better than its over-budgeted descendants in some ways. Steve Jablonsky's soundtrack is glorious, among the best of the decade. For all his faults Bay still sticks mainly to practical effects, so there's a realness to his action that Disney's films haven't really achieved. If you want to enjoy an overpriced, bloated, maximalist blockbuster to rest your brain, (we can't live off foreign films alone) this will probably leave you satisfied.To sum it all up, perhaps it's better to be an over-hated film than an over-praised one.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It proves to be an extremely miserable experience, being an hour too long with a plot too complicated for its own good and characters that, even for the type of movie it looks to be, are too thinly written.The movie sees the return of its main character, Sam Whitwicky, portrayed at his whiniest by Shia Lebeouf, as he once again aids the Autobots in some sort of war against the Decepticons. Honestly, that's the most I'm able to describe the plot because I had no clue what was exactly going on for the film's entirety. Every major detail is presented in such an incoherent manner, with characters rambling endlessly at a pace so rapid that my head was left spinning after just a half-hour into the film. It also didn't help that the film would periodically stop for inane subplots such as Sam's mother - for some reason - trying to promote a self-help book to him.That brings me to the film's next biggest problem. This is a two-and-a-half-hour-long film, but it really should have been anywhere between ninety to one-hundred minutes. For a simple summer blockbuster, everything should have been presented in much simpler terms and without unnecessary subplots. Why do we need to hear all this complicated backstory that's being thrown in our faces when all we really want to see is a simple story about two groups of robots in battle? If the simple route was taken, I could guarantee at least forty-five minutes or so would have been cut from the film. And for the better, I might add. I mean, how long could one possibly drag out the notion of a bunch of robots fighting each other?Speaking of the fight scenes, the film even fails to make these appealing, and it's the action that's supposed to be the center-point of the film. Each action scene is presented as loud as it could possibly be, with non-stop explosions and screaming being the driving forces behind these sequences. The editing causes these scenes to jump all over the place, so there is never even really a clear focus as to where all the loud noises and screaming are distinctly coming from. This proves to be especially mind-numbing in the last act of the film, which is essentially all the previous action sequences in the film presented non-stop for forty-five minutes to an even greater degree. About five minutes into this point of the film, you're already begging for it to end.The film also includes a huge supporting cast of actors who are clearly all too talented to be wasting their time with this sort of nonsense. However, I guess with the way the economy is going at this point, desperate times call for desperate measures, I suppose. The cast includes supporting roles or cameos from the likes of John Turturro, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, Alan Tudyk, and Patrick Dempsey. The majority of these roles are meant as comic relief, although they all fail miserably at providing one single laugh. Instead, they all play obnoxious versions of characters they have previously played, all desperately shouting out one ""comical"" line after another. For example, take John Malkovich's Osbourne Cox character from Burn After Reading. Now, take out all the profanity, make him shout even louder than he already did, and then just make sure every single word he says is not funny. And that's essentially the character Malkovich portrays in this disaster-piece. It shames me to see such talented actors go to waste, but like I said, there are just times when some people need a paycheck, I suppose.Watching Transformers: Dark of the Moon proves to be one of the most miserable experiences I have ever had watching a movie. It does everything it could possibly do wrong to the greatest degree it could possibly do it. There was not one single bright spot I could think of as I look back on the film. And by that, I mean, there actually were about three or four moments where I remember briefly smiling, but there were so many explosions, screaming, and obnoxious performances that immediately followed that it caused me to forget what I was smiling about. It actually was so obnoxious that just thinking about it now gives me a headache, so I'm going to stop before I do any serious damage to my brain.0.5/5","24 out of 54 found this helpful.

The storyline follows a hidden artifact on the dark side of the moon that the US government kept secret for decades but has been waiting to come to Earth. The artifact is awaken by the energy from the last Transformers film and another Prime emerges...a Prime with different motives than Optimus.This picture is directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys I & II) and stars Shia LaBeouf (Fury), Frances McDormand (Fargo), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Mad Max: Fury Road), John Turturro (The Big Lebowski), Patrick Dempsey (Can't Buy Me Love), Ken Jeong (The Hangover), John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) and Josh Duhamel (Shotgun Wedding).Once again the opening narration, special effects, sound effects and Transformer character depictions are awesome. The soundtrack is also very good. The storyline was the worst of the first three pictures and I definitely missed Megan Fox. It was good they could bring back so many others from the original cast. The villain were just okay and I felt the long mechanical Dune style worms were a bit corny; however, the last 40 minutes of this movie is non-stop action and I found myself glued to the screen.Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the action genre that's a must see but you may only need to watch once. I would score this a 6.5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought Sam's storyline was boring. The absence of Megan Fox doesn't help either. The only thing that pulled the film along was the action, of course. It was unreal, though. I'd say a lot more explosions compared to the previous installments. In short, the film doesn't let you breathe from a certain point on and when you want it to, it's over. I mean, compared to the previous films, which concluded the plot nicely, the ending here didn't seem to me to be very good, I would even say a little bit cut off, as if there was still something missing. What to add. An action movie with a capital A without a deeper plot. If you're looking for explosions at every corner, you probably won't go wrong. For others, I'd rather not recommend it and give another action spectacle with a better story a chance. For me, an above average film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you come to see the movie expecting to be completely moved by what you've seen, then you've got another thing coming. This is a great movie for what it is, a summer action thriller. The story was good not great, and obviously, the special effects were perfect. Compared to the second installment, this is a BIG improvement. The second was just trying to be too funny, and the action was great, but it was just chaotic. In Dark of the Moon, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg tuned down the comedy level and they put in a better structure for the action sequences. Now, there were still a lot of great laughs, and the special effects were at best they've ever been, if not better. my only problems were that I believe that the characters could have been better developed, but enough was done to get by, and the way it was put together was just a tad bit messy, but nothing too noticeable. DO NOT listen to what a bunch of hot-shot movie critics have to say, you really should never listen to these guys. Overall, this was an awesome, fun summer blockbuster. You will enjoy yourself, a lot.","23 out of 36 found this helpful.

The first hour of the film is laden with so much silly humor that I sat there asking myself ""why, just why?"" so many times. Too much time is wasted on Sam trying to get a job. There's no place for crap like that in a movie of this stature. This, together with the silliness, added to the unnecessary long running time and ruined the excitement during the first hour.Once the film reached the hour-mark, it literally is a non-stop full throttle fast-packed action-paced thrill ride. The visuals and effects are out of this world! It just proves again how well the film industry evolved. I know its all CGI but it looks incredible on film! Blending CGI with real life actors is still a challenge, but Michael Bay seems to have perfected that with his Transformer series. He has such a vast imagination!John Malkovich is a brilliant actor but he honestly was dispensable in this film and there really wasn't room for his wittiness and cocky attitude. The visuals certainly steals the show. I will remember this film for the toppling building scene. Wow, that was awesome!! If you're in the mood for action and explosions and destruction in abundance, then this is probably the perfect choice.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I visited the IMAX 3D version today and the visuals were absolutely stunning. For anyone who is enthusiastic about graphics, this is a must see.At least, for the first 30 or 60 minutes. I did not see this movie expecting any depth in the story or brilliant acting - but Transformers 3 seems to be a compilation of every bad cliché to attempt getting the viewer to connect to the characters. The reason this fails, at least for me, is that you will see everything coming from miles away. The movie will not skip a chance to throw a US flag in your face.This movie will work fine for you if you're into hot chicks, hot cars, explosive action, American heroism and not very attentive of details. As soon as you start trying to ""read"" the scenery, the sequence of action and especially the plausibility of everything that happens, you will find that the suspension of disbelief is broken every two minutes.I'm rating it a 4 because although I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics, everything else in this movie made me want to get up and leave halfway.

I was wrong and I admit it.When I saw the first Transformers movie, I thought I was seeing something that advanced the cinematic vocabulary. The movie was still otherwise worthless, and the advance was in the service of crass goals. But an effective evolution in how we see things is a big deal. What I saw was expert editing that in the action scenes gave us just a bit less information than we needed to understand what was going on. These edits had compositional energy so that in general we got caught in the swirl of the battle, experiencing the fog of war.This, I thought was a big deal, because there is only so much you can do visually. You are delivering an entire world and interacting within that world at the same time. It should be impossible. I qualified my comment at the time by remarking that this also saves money; since you never have time to fully comprehend a special effect, they can be designed or rendered with less fidelity.The second film continued the tradition, with less freshness. This one abandons it altogether and presents itself no differently than your average Marvel bravado. It has a different editor, so that makes sense. But for the first time, the franchise has decided to enter the premium ticket market with three D and IMAX. Ticketbuyers who pay the extra moola want clear confirmation that the extra detail is worth it. So the whole enterprise has had its one redeeming value ripped out. The world we glimpsed was coming has had its transport beams destroyed.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

This doesn't make Dark of the Moon a bad film, it just doesn't take the franchise in any great leap whatsoever. It provides a fairly fast paced, action packed movie with awesome special effects and incredible set pieces - probably better to wait until it drops in price and pick it up then.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

In it, Megatron marches to the Lincoln Memorial and blasts Abe to pieces. He sits on his new throne while two smaller robots gnaw away at Lincoln's severed head. This image serves as a haunting symbol of the fact that the entire human race will soon be enslaved, their freedom and dignity taken away from them. God, this movie sucked. I could stand Megan Fox, John Turturro in a thong, and the takeover of the Smithsonian Air Museum with a couple of tasers. As bad as ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is, I can stand it. Even enjoy it. It's a decent popcorn flick. That being said, I found it easier to eat popcorn during Precious than this cinematic train wreck.The third installment in Paramount's billion-dollar franchise finds Sam Witwicky in search of a job. He's saved the world twice, been given a medal by the president, graduated from an Ivy League school, and dated really hot girls. Regardless, he still can't get a job outside of the mail room. In the midst of this, he discovers that the malevolent Decepticons are out to take over the world again. The logistics and intricate details of their plan aren't important. Just know that the plan involves an exhaustive barrage of slow motion, explosions, running, and screaming. Michael Bay's never really been known for his storytelling, but he can make movies flow at an even enough pace. This movie jumps around faster than a bunny rabbit on crack, explains nothing at all and assumes we care about characters who are about as interesting as bird droppings on a telephone pole. Appearances by the likes of Ken Jeong, Stephen Merchant, John Malkovich and Frances McDormand aren't as much welcomed as they are unnecessary. The humor present in previous installments, which at times was cringe-inducing, has all been vanished, replaced instead by an extremely morbid, depressing tone. It's not even exciting. To be fair, the movie is a technological wonderland. The CGI is effectively placed in the film, the sound design is excellent, and the 3D is actually worth the price. Shia LaBeouf is always fun to watch, and I was actually able to stand new girlfriend Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley. Despite its achievements on the technological front, the movie is still a mess. The final, incredibly long battle to save the human race will leave you more exhausted than exhilarated. Oh, and the movie's about 157 minutes too long.","20 out of 44 found this helpful.

Kill each other off, but please do it quickly, quietly, and far far away from here. Unfortunately, in Transformers 3 they take forever (over 2.5 hours), it's noisy, it's in a theater near you, and there are still some left standing when it's all over.The original Transformers wasn't all bad; I gave it a 5 (average). The sequel was aggressively, unrelentingly obnoxious and loud loud loud loud; it got a 2 (awful). This one edges up a notch to 3 (bad). Why is that? Because the 1st 9 minutes recreated the greatest moment in human history, when we took only a decade from decision to footfall on a trip to the Moon. There's original footage from the 1960s plus a modern-day cameo appearance by Buzz Aldrin.But why did we go to the Moon? The movie starts off with an intriguing premise: that we were aware that an alien spacecraft had crashed in the Sea of Tranquility, and we wanted to go up and get a good look at it. Aldrin and Neil Armstrong (who were never on the far side of the Moon, regardless of the title or what screenwriter Ehren Krueger has his characters claim) supposedly discovered a huge alien robot there. This turns out to be Sentinel Prime, master strategist of the Autobots, voiced by Leonard Nimoy. Severely damaged, he had fled the Transformer homeworld of Cybertron after his last-ditch effort to win the final robot war ended in defeat. But he's inert in 1969, and it isn't until the present day that the Earthly Autobots head back to reactivate him, bringing along their own version of the Energizer Bunny.That's the high point of the movie. After that, it's all downhill, as director Michael Bay and the various special-effects teams take over. As before, there's lots of whirling hardware, dust, spurting oil, blazing guns, and explosions. Once again it's impossible to keep track of who's who, even if you had a clue in the 1st place, which the movie never bothers to provide. Dweebish protagonist Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) tries to pretend that human beings in general and he in particular have a role to play in the intra-robot conflict, but it's abundantly clear that they're mainly cannon fodder. He's accompanied thru much of the carnage by eye- candy girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), whose job is to dress in saran wrap and adopt whatever emotional attitude the screenplay requires at any given moment.The tone of the human interactions is saucy and insincere, played broadly and cartoonishly. Oddly, the actual cartoon characters, the robots, are the ones with the serious dialog and motivations. This is at least consistent with the movie's general attitude that they're the only ones worth caring about.Other actors who collected a paycheck for walking thru this junkyard-in-progress include Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, Alan Tudyk, and John Malkovich. Their talents range from decent to excellent, but in all cases are superfluous here.The Decepticons convincingly devastate an odd version of Chicago that includes the Milwaukee Art Museum. The survival of our heroes against all odds is not even remotely plausible.I saw the flick in a packed 1st showing, and I was the only one who laffed out loud when Nimoy's character said ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" This tells me that (a) nobody else in the theater was over 35 and (b) efforts to insert even a little bit of ingenuity into the plot were wasted. OTOH, one of the comic-relief minibots elicited a hearty chuckle with the clipped-off expression ""clusterf"", which tells us once again how effectively the MPAA is protecting the tender sensibilities of the too-young-for-R kiddies.There's no doubt that this movie will find its audience. I am not among them. I'd advise you not to be, either.","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

It was new, original, and simple in what it tried to accomplish. The same can not be said for Dark of the Moon. What made this movie terrible was Bay's attempt to appeal to a mass audience. He tried to make an action, horror, comedy, romance movie and unfortunately the end product was extremely cheesy. Also, the movie had poor physics. How many times can a human being jump through panes of glass and not receive any cuts? I freely admit that I half expected this to be a bad movie and what I was looking forward to was the 3D animation. However, even that lacked originality to it as it was simply debris flying everywhere as the 3D showcase. The one saving grace of this movie was LaBeouf's performance, who carried this movie on his back by creating a believable world of metal robots and bad actors and actresses. I will not be watching another Bay movie in my lifetime.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

The Transformers look ultra impressive, and they sound mind blowing. The actors are on fire. Shai Labouf and the new Rosie Huntington-Whiteley go great together and their acting is infectious. To start remember to watch this on the biggest T.V. possible!This is where the 3-part infection starts. On one hand Dark of the Moon is amazing. On the other it has serious flaws which is EXTREMELY SAD because this could have been the Star Wars of it's generation. What Star Wars had was flash + all the other great stuff. Dark of the Moon has flash, but it only has some of the other great stuff.Infection I: Pretentious = why people dislike Michael Bay, you can really feel his arrogance in the movie. There are some unnecessarily stupid and glamouresk scenes that just seem fake.Infection II: Confusing, but honestly it does a great job of not losing you. It's not as confusing as Pirates of The Caribbean 2 and 3.Infection III: The Autobots and Megabots are indistinguishable. Not only do their personalities burn out, but there was one big scene that me and my wife couldn't tell who was good or bad because they all looked the same (colors). The only AutoBot (that's not a leader) that gets good development and some screen time is Bumble Bee, and I'm kinda sick of him.Despite the flaws Dark of The Moon makes up for most of them (except the last one I mentioned) with some of the most amazing action scenes I've ever scene, also with a nice tune up of comedy throughout. I'll be watching this again, and on a bigger T.V.","12 out of 17 found this helpful.

The decision to include Sentinel Prime in this equation was actually a good one, primarily because it raised the stakes and gave the Autobots an incentive to fight and protect.Optimus Prime, as usual, was the pivotal figure in delivering iconic scenes (the climax fight being one of his finest so far in this series). Bumblebee, too, had his moments to shine, which warmed my heart.For the human counterparts, LaBeouf was as effective as he had been since the first day, but I had serious concerns about Rosie Huntington being replaced by Megan Fox; I don't think that was a wise decision on their part. Another minor complaint would be Megatron's brief appearance on the screen; he was kind of pushed aside since he had too little to do, which seemed amiss.Having said that, it's a solid entertainer. The visuals are gorgeous and massive in scale (Shockwave design was phenomenal), the action is full of energy and enthusiasm, and most important of all, the score sounded incredible here, exacerbating the intensity whenever and wherever it could.

There's that rush of adrenaline, the heart beats become faster, the pulse quickens and all your thoughts converge into making the most out of what lies in front of you, be it a naked body or bare knuckle metal. And while the act in itself, however long it may last, may very well be an apotheosis of pleasure, it will definitely be one of those acts which, once it's over, you'd desperately want to sweep under the rug or stash it away in a closet hoping that its skeletons don't tumble out years later the way Bill Clinton's did. And soon after finishing the act, you realize that you have a wife, seven months pregnant with your 2nd child, and a 5-year old kid to whom you are the Batman, Superman, Ironman and all other imaginary super heroes out there rolled into one. The screws of guilt start turning and tightening, leaving you conscience – stricken about the dastardly act that you just committed. That is exactly how you feel when the closing credits starting rolling after completion of a Michael Bay movie. All the excitement, the adrenaline, the eagerness that was there before the movie started snowballs into one gigantic sphere of guilt as the end nears, leaving you flummoxed as to why you went to see the movie in the first place.It has been four years now that Michael Bay has been running a prostitution racket in all its metal glory. We know that racket as Transformers. And just like failure to contain one's carnal desires has led to flourishing of prostitution, Bay's metallic monstrosities, bereft of any emotion or storyline, have drawn audiences from all over the world if only to find out whether a robot's testicles are square or round. Almost every Bay movie has raked in substantial amount of moolah at the Box Office, resulting in rapid proliferation his racket and fueling his desire to find innovative ways to assault people's senses with every imaginable metal monstrosity. As if it wasn't enough, this time he has gone a step further and added an extra dimension thus launching the attack from all the three dimensions leaving us feel like a mosquito that has been squashed over and over again with a sledge hammer. Bay's movies are destined for two things 1) being lambasted by critics 2) striking gold at box office. Dark of the Moon will be no different. I don't know for sure whether androids dream of electric sheep or not. But that Michael Bay is wet dream of every metal part that moves is unadulterated four-dimensional truth. The tagline of Bay's latest instalment is 'Earth's last stand'. How long an ordeal do the earth's population of 6 billion+ will have to undergo before they get the see the tagline 'Bay's last movie'??","20 out of 45 found this helpful.

Also Bumblebee was the best part as always.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Excellent","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3032752/?ref_=tt_urv","user-543-975655","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38196613/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2014","Since Transformers: Age of Extinction is coming out in two weeks, I decided to re-watch all of the old Transformers movies. After watching the first movie and reviewing it, I decided to review all of the movies. I really liked this movie, which was surprising because I didn't remember liking it this much. I really enjoyed the 2 1/2 hour movie. It was very long, but I still enjoyed it. Just like the second movie, I felt like some of the scenes were dragged out way too much, which is why I gave it a 7 instead of an 8 or a 9. Just like the second movie, I was happy with the absence of a shaky camera. It made the battles much more enjoyable, and made the movie way better. Even though I gave this movie the same rating as Revenge of the Fallen, I think Revenge of the Fallen was a tiny bit better. It was more pleasant. This movie was so dark that I had a hard time believing that it was a Transformers movie. Don't get me wrong, it was still really good, but it was also very dark. The acting in this movie was once again outstanding, and Shia Labeouf did a great job adapting to his new character. He was still Sam, but his attitude completely changed, and he did a wonderful job. Rosie Huntington-Whitely did a good job filling in for Megan Fox. I thought the movie would've been a little better if Fox was still Sam's girlfriend. Whitely still did a wonderful job, though. Every single person did another wonderful job in this movie with acting. The Transformers really is a good series for acting. The series is also amazing for special effects. Everything looks so great that the battles and the robots and everything else that isn't real looks real. Transformers 1,2,3 and probably 4 are one of the best displays of visual effects I have ever seen. I like how there is always so much detail in all of the Autobots and Decepticons. Their emotions are so easily displayed that you are sympathetic for them when one of them dies (the Autobots, mainly), which really makes them more human, and all of their moving parts go together without a problem, and their transformations are once again awesome. That is another thing I like about this movie. They aren't just regular, stereotypical robots. They are original, and are very realistic. As with the second movie, the setting changed. Well, the final battle of the first film was in New York, and the final battle in Dark of the Moon was in Chicago, which are different cities, but still cities. But the scale of the battle increased at least 20 times. Maybe even more. This made the battles more grandiose, and way more fun to watch. Also, the story thankfully changed again. The introduction of so many new Decepticons was awesome. I was looking for a lot of new Transformers. Ehren Kruger and Michael Bay did such a good job creating some new Transformers that it was almost as if this was a different series. The dialogue was another great thing in this movie. The actors said their lines perfectly, and displayed their emotions perfectly once again. Steve Jablonsky (composer) did a great job once more with this installment of the series, and used Arrival to Earth again as a main theme, which is good. That's all I have to say about Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Thanks for reading. See ya.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the first film, Optimus Prime and Bumblebee had their moments, but they were still secondary to the human characters in every way, and the second film didn't really give anyone, human or animated, anything to play. This time out, I actually felt like the robots made a strong impression, and if there are more of these films after Bay leaves the series, then he's laid out a pretty strong template here for others to imitate moving forward. Finally, it feels like the war makes sense, and the stakes make sense, and it all matters. Sentinel Prime is a great addition to the series, and Nimoy plays him perfectly. It's a real performance, and as a result, it makes the rest of the Transformers feel more real. Cullen is very good in this one, and the rest of the robot cast manages to impress as well. Even the weird little robots, and there are two of them living with Sam (Shia LaBeouf) grew on me over the course of the film, especially when you see where they wind up. The Decepticons are way nastier in this one, and so when Optimus Prime and the Autobots unleash hell... AND THEY DO... it is so deserved and so worthy of one cheer after another that it almost becomes audience participation.","18 out of 28 found this helpful.

Dark of the Moon is relatively decent with some entertainment and in comparison to the films with Wahlberg, this one is better. Shia LeBeouf portrays his character better in these films than what we have seen from Mark Wahlberg, as his character and the storylines seem to make more sense.As a film, this does start off decent but becomes tiresome at some points and drags on heavy as these films tend to do. The visuals are there but overall, the film film is still quite messy and the plot becomes distant to its special effects.Megan Fox's replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is decent as her role doesn't require much but is quite odd how the film doesn't mention how her and Shia's character came about. Though, it is what is expected. Dark of the Moon even with its flaws is easily better than Revenge of the Fallen as that was far more messy, too much overload of action with a lesser plot. In this film it settles down somewhat as there is more drama, more heart and at least concise. Not the mention the finale of Dark of the Moon is quite entertaining and heartfelt, knowing it was the end of the main characters.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He hammed it up big time with his screaming, spazzing, and terrible witticisms. So why watch part three you ask? I couldn't tell you. Some pathetic hope that things would be better. They weren't.Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) traded in his old girlfriend for a new one, but it doesn't make much of a difference. His new GF, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), is nothing more than eye candy with perfect make-up in every situation much like Megan Fox was, except this one has a British accent. The introduction of a new flame was awkward. For two movies we saw Sam doting over Megan Fox, then all of a sudden (in viewer time), he's just shy of wedding bells with a new girl.Thrusting a new paramour into the mix was just the beginning of all the things wrong with this waste material. It was way too long, it took itself too seriously, and there was far too much screaming.At two-and-a-half hours ""Dark of the Moon"" was trying to bill itself as ""Lord of the Rings,"" especially when you factor in all of the portentous moments director Michael Bay had us sit through. With the rousing speeches, the slo-mo, and the emotionality I thought Bay was really trying to go for Best Picture. Too bad it was all so hollow. There was no need to be that grand. Just give the people what they come to you for Michael Bay: explosions and special effects.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

There are hardly any faults and they look like real.Director Michael Bay helps us enter into the agony of the battlefield with his camera angles and movement. The film's atmosphere is now more dramatic. Many humorous elements of the 2 prequels are not anymore present. The dialogues are mostly desperate while the action is like a hurricane with a progressing climax that keeps the audience's interest and expectations on a constant knife edge. The battles can be described as epic. A minus (according to my opinion)is that the character of Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) is no longer in the script. Overall, a state of the art action film that will keep you in the seat from the first till the last minute.","112 out of 215 found this helpful.

Then the second movie came and I HATED it. It took everything great about the first one and flipped it on its shiny metal ass. I gotta say that this movie is marginally better than 2, but still nowhere near 1.You don't need to know the plot here because it barely exists anyway.There are a lot of annoying characters, both human and robot, that deliver bad performances and really bad jokes. In fact the first hour is full of these bad jokes. The first action scene is really boring and forgettable. How could they screw up Optimus fighting a giant driller worm? The first hour is boring and almost a completely different movie with hardly any robots or action. Instead, we get Shia LaBeouf trying to find a job and please his new impossibly hot girlfriend in a painfully long and unnecessary sequence. You can almost skip that entire part.Thankfully, the move gets much better in the second half, where a HUGE battle takes place in Chicago. The effects and the set pieces look amazing here. This is where you gotta give credit to Michael Bay. The robot fights are also filmed better here than in the other two movies. Two scenes get special mention: the highway chase involving Decepticons and the skyscraper. Those scenes are really intense and fun to watch. Like I said the entire second half is pretty much one big prolonged battle scene. It has some great moments, but some are filmed poorly or just plain long. Also the movie ends very abruptly, with about 30 seconds of aftermath.Put simply, the movie is pretty bad overall. Most characters are annoying, the writing is bad and the jokes are horrible. The robots and other CGI look great, but they cannot cover up the flaws. Only the second half is worth watching.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Watching it on regular DVD, or Blue Ray will make it lose some of its attraction. The story is a typical Transformers story. The acting is watchable. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley did her job.

By the third part it becomes quite ordinary and mundane.The positives: The action sequences are done quite well. With the way technology is advancing it's quite amazing at how quickly sequences can become bigger, better and longer. If the humans portion was cut out of the movie entirely it would be an even better movie to watch.It is a million times better than the abominable ROTF.John Malkovich in his short role is quite funny, as is John Turturro, even if he is still OTT in his diminished and toned down role.The transformers, both good and bad, are quite excellent. Sad to say but they're better actors than the humans.The slightly sub par: The new girl: I have to admit that she wasn't as bad as I thought she would be acting wise but she was still nothing special. In fact her role was completely pointless and there was a point where she's interacting with the transformers as she's been in the previous 2 movies and took herself way too seriously at times. Even a muppet on a stick could have done the same job, for less money, and with the same result. But she is still a lot better than Megan Fox...The negatives: The lack of consistent humour, which was quite funny and welcome in the first movie. Instead there are some sexual gags and jokes which are quite lame.The slow motion of the new girl's body: I like it when a camera focuses on a hot girl but the way Bay did it made me feel sleazy and cheap. It was there in the first movie but done quickly and more tastefully. Here, it's so blatant that it's annoying, as if it had to be part of the script or else the movie would fail.The plot: there is none, or more to the sense there is nothing original to the plot of the movie. It follows the basic principle of just about every trilogy ender: have a giant war/battle that lasts more than an hour. It seems that the plot was written after the action scenes were mapped out because it's a jumbled mess with a lot of stop and go.The cheesy ending: a typical Michael Bay ender. NO spoilers required. Who said this guy could direct movies? Too many human actors: just about everyone from the first two movies are in it and there are new people added. There's no time to draw out anyone's back story and you just don't care for Sam and the rest of the humans this time round.Not enough time spent on the robots: This movie, as well as the others, starts of as Transformers, not Humans. There are new transformers but they are either not identified or done too quickly for us to register before the start of a action sequence so it becomes confusing whether they are autobots or decepticons.All in all, it's a teenager's action movie wetdream and they'll love it. But for the cynical it's a wasted effort on ending the transformers saga on a high note in terms of a good story. If there is another movie in the works I really hope that Michael Bay is not there to ruin it. George Lucas destroyed the first three Star Wars movies with his ""vision."" Let's hope that Michael Bay is not round to repeat the same mistake...","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Apparently so. With a little work on the script and animation, it would have had much broader appeal, but the result is a movie aimed only at teen-aged boys, which is actually offensive to other demographics. The jokes were stupid and crass, and the themes too childish for someone of LeBeouf's age and maturity. Presumably the inclusion of good-quality actors was to make it seem they would present good characters, but I suspect that after they saw the script, it was only good pay that kept them at work on the production.

To call it a movie would be gross injustice, for it is anything but, it is a sad, raucous, empty 150 minute flick that tricks you into yawning insufferably. To call it a bad movie would be no less an injustice, as it would give the bad movies a bad name. So if we agree to call it Thing, I should say that it is one terrible Thing.It is easily the worst Thing of the decade, and keeping in mind that this very decade has seen movies like its prequel, Pirates of the Caribbean IV, Twilight saga, this is saying something. There is no story, none at all. It is a pathetic excuse for a movie. The last hour is peppered with loud cacophonous dumb action, where, for all it matters, every robot is hitting every robot, and it becomes tiresome to figure which ones are the good ones, and frankly speaking, you would hardly care. The acting is pedestrian, a fine actor like John Malkovich is reduced to an absolute mockery, Shia LaBeouf, who was moderately tolerable in the first two installments, spends the first half screaming like hell, and the second half deciding whether to scream or not, and his parents, as usual, are poor comical add-ons and make you cringe. Every alternate minute, people turn up sporting a national top-secret, making you wonder since when has the US Govt started dishing out state secrets to common people. John Turturro appears out of nowhere, and bosses his way in and out of CIA, NASA, whenever he pleases, wherever he wishes, and he seems to have an awful number of people at his command, even though he is supposed to sit home sipping lemonade, as he was stripped of his power in part II. Surprises abound, still. As if the entire US army has gone to Tahiti for snorkeling, only a dozen of people are left in Chicago to defend the city, as the future of the world lies in balance. Thousands and thousands of spaceships materialize from thin air, and instead of attacking the rest of the world, which would have been much easier, given they don't have Autobots to protect them, attack poor old Chicago, and keeps on attacking it only. Actors find time to exchange romantic truisms in the midst of the war, even when a missile is cruising towards them. A clichéd word of wisdom is enough to turn one Decepticon against another, that too when the latter is about to kill an Autobot.The dialogs are so inane and trite, that one might strongly suspect whether there was any script at all. The action is stale and raucous, an unending pain-in-the-ass litany of gunshots and missile blasts, a motley influence of too many Fast and the Furious movies, and it's time that directors understand that having the latest CGI graphics and special effects at their disposal and cramming them in any possible combination does NOT a good action film make. Perhaps they will never understand. Perhaps that is why the Spielbergs and Camerons will always belong to an elusive class.And of course a review of the Thing would be incomplete without a mention of its lead ""actress"" Rosie Huntington Whiteley. Yes, you heard it right, she does make Megan Fox's acting look like Ingrid Bergman's! She happens to be the latest addition to a slew of models who have made a foray into acting, trying to parlay their success as a model into celluloid. She looks reasonably tolerable when she keeps mum, and indeed looks hot in progressively lesser and lesser amount of attire, but the moment she opens her mouth the entire effect is ruined, and an already poor scene is made even worse. Not only does she sound dumb, her trying to buy off the audience with daredevil clothes, as if her 'hotness' can buy her a purchase on acting skills, cannot but appear condescending, and after some time, quite tiring. It's high time that directors (and most importantly the models themselves) understand that acting and modelling are mutually exclusive sets, and excelling in the former doesn't necessarily make her good (or even tolerable) in the latter, so that we, the audience, are spared some horribly wooden acting. Amen.","23 out of 55 found this helpful.

Before I saw this movie, I saw tons of reviews saying that this film was a fun, action packed movie, with great visuals, and a plot that actually wasn't that bad. I see the movie, actually really like it, then when I get home, I get on my computer, and all I can find are reviewers bashing the film. I mean seriously, spill.com gave this a low rental, two some ol' bulls**t, and a f**k you. Richard roper recently said it was the worst movie he had seen all year, despite the fact that he had given the film a D and given at least two other movies a D- and at least one film and F.I won't say the film is perfect, even though I couldn't find any, I'm sure there were at least a few plot holes. Some of the humor didn't work, and it is at least 30 minutes too long.I basically went into this movie expecting great action and effects, and I got that, but there actually were other things I liked in this movie. For example I did laugh quite a bit, some of the humor actually did work for me. And yes, I actually liked the characters. I can't say I really loved any of them, most of them are just forgettable, but Sam Witwicky I did find to be enjoyable. It's weird, I should hate him, but Shia LaBeaof takes a character I should hate and makes him likable, where were you on that one Jeremy Renner.And the plot actually isn't that bad, the last half of the movie is pretty much not stop action. And like I said, I didn't see any plot holes.There are some people who absolutely hate this movie, and to me, they either focus on one negative aspect and exploit it, like Richard Roeper. Or they can't stop living in the 80s, like Spill.com or Brad Jones. I don't really care what Spoony says because I was never really a fan of his. If you do have a strong hatred for this movie, please explain why, what makes this really worse than Season of the Witch, or Battle: LA? Overall, it is a very stupid movie, but it's a fun, very stupid movie.Whether you like them or not, I guess there are two things you can't deny about the the live action Transformers movies, one, they have incredible special effects, and two, they are very stupid.","10 out of 14 found this helpful.

The 1st one is still the best for one single reason - pure action. This one, much like the second, has become watered down by Michael Bay as he attempts to reach a wider audience while hardcore transformer fans (like myself) now have to suffer! The two annoying mini-autobots from the 2nd part make a return appearance and are still very annoying. Also the romance dialogue between Sam and his gf is quite weak and actually takes away rather than adds to the movie. I hope in the 4th installment that Bay sticks to pure action (a la Terminator 2) and stop trying to appease different demographics!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Michael Bay's film probably is so noisy to avoid that the viewer sleeps. It may help, since wakes up the viewer when the noise increases too much, but it is not enough. I have seen this film with two other people and we three have taken naps along the never-ending story of 154 minutes running time. The awful story is ridiculous and the characters are imbecile and inconsistent. The hero Shia LaBeouf has the face of an idiot, is a simple filing clerk in an office and out of the blue, he is the savior of mankind in a total absurd. His girlfriend with Botox in the lips is a decorative character and may be a great model, but her acting is limited to make faces and mouths and nothing else.The excessive use of stereotypes and exacerbated patriotism is also irritating. A film can not be limited to special effects only; otherwise it is unbearable to be watched. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): ""Transformers: O Lado Oculto da Lua"" (""Transformers: The Dark Side of the Moon"")","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

Which one do you think it is?I thought Michael Bay apologized for the second movie, but still he didn't seem to have learned anything. The annoying parents were still there (although I have to give him credit for keeping their screen-time to a minimum) And although he put some well-achieved actors in this movie (John Voigt saved Transformers 1, in my opinion), both John Malcovich and Frances McDormand are both redundant for the plot (if there was anything like a plot) and also had pretty ridiculous roles.And yeah, you have to give the movie some credit for the special effects, but now really think about it!...Were there any amazing scenes apart from those in the trailer? I don't think so. Optimus slashing some Decepticons, Building falling down with protagonists in it, City of Chicago under a large-scale attack of spaceships... all in the trailer...And now some more points that make the movie the terrible piece of cinematic pulp it is:-product placement (yeah, all computers are lenovo, I get it)-soundtrack (some nice pieces from the first one but anything new? anyway,what has become of linkin park?)-non-existing jokes (at some points you feel you were supposed to laugh, but couldn't really find anything funny... just weird)-what the fudge did the Chinese guy from hangover do there?","17 out of 39 found this helpful.

Thus we had 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' which was a terrible in parts, overly complicated and had a dull climax. For these reasons I had pretty neutral expectations going into this film where I expected action by the bucket load but more hoped to gain enjoyment from it this time. The film starts out with our human protagonist Sam played once again by Shia LaBeouf with shoehorned girlfriend Carly played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The reason why I say shoehorned is because there is no introduction, they are just a couple. Of course I realise the absence of Megan Fox but after all Mikaela went through with Sam you'd think something pretty big would end that relationship. Anyway we've got two and a half hours to fill, Sam has to find a job and the Autobots must face off against the Decepticons again. The first act of this film very much feels like filler until the action comes rather than set up and that is where we get most of the 'humour' which falls flat around 60% of the time. I'm not going to get too wound up as if the film got treated completely seriously this time round it would make for a cringe inducing experience. By now though it was more of a slight distraction. Performances wise LaBeouf does a fairly good job with what he's given. Quite a good actor in all honesty and wasn't nearly as annoying as he has the potential to be. Carly, our new female lead is not very good and doesn't provide an improvement on Megan Fox. Maybe its the fault of the script but she was just uninteresting and obviously only really served as eye candy. Other characters like Simmons returned to inject little to no decent comic relief. Gladly John Turturro is a good enough actor to be in the role and not be bogged down by what he's in. Special effects wise it is mostly more of the same, the action set pieces are better set up and are superior to second film. In truth at times it was spectacular to see especially towards the end before becoming very familiar the more it progressed. This had more to do with the film's run time which again well over two hours, you do have to brace yourself for it as certainly I felt it towards the end of the film. The Transformers looked as good as they ever did and if it is one thing the film gets right is that they did look very real. The Decepticons seemed to have more of a presence this time round as there appeared to more effort put into them as antagonists. They were satisfactory but never came across as particularly menacing as they wouldn't the third film in. The film more works out as a middle ground but could never capture why the first was the best. It is superior to Revenge of the Fallen but the final action climax did very much remind me of when I was bored in the cinema two years ago. Overall though this is the mediocre edition to the series, its enjoyable on its own merits but not on a general film level. If you want to see this and enjoyed the series so far you'll probably enjoy this one. It is just simply a half decent Transformers film and an average action film.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, Michael Bay has made a film about on par with his last trainwreck Transformers movie, and this, like this last movie is a thoroughly dumb and unenjoyable sensory overload full of poorly thought out plot points, dumb dialogue in this sort of surreal fantasy world where everyone is as goofy as can be.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is living in a nice apartment with his new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and needs some action in his life. He gets a new job, and is almost killed, and meanwhile Optimus Prime makes a trip to the moon to gain pillars and to bring back his old friend Sentinel Prime. Meanwhile again, Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) is Carly's boss, and Sam is jealous. And then Megatron and the Decepticons take over Chicago. And then there's action. And then it ends (thank God).Transformers 2 must have been too serious for people, because Michael Bay just had the actors go all out slapstick performances. It was like an unfunny reproduction of the Three Stooges or something. Comedic scenes are comedic only because of these cartoon like performances where everyone is a comedian, and nobody seems to care about impending danger, but instead just want to lighten the mood with their nightclub routines. The first hour of the movie is so silly and lightweight, it literally serves no purpose whatsoever. No scenes had any effect on the next scenes. Shia Labeouf is almost killed, and this scene is followed by a 5 minute speech about love with his parents. Chicago is destroyed by Decepticons, and immediately following we see people casually walking through destroyed Chicago like they're going for a stroll before work or something. An entire sub-plot about Sam getting a job is completely dropped, and serves no point in the movie except to introduce these bizarrely eccentric characters and give the audience some very dumb yuk- yuks. A bizarre scene has Russians pulling guns on Sam and John Turturro, and it literally is just there for laughs. It's so over the top, and cloying for cheap laughs, it's almost pathetic, and again, has no impact on anything. In fact, this entire movie could have been scrapped, and the big battle at the end could have basically been the film, because really that's all that mattered in the ""plot"".Character motivations are way off too. Patrick Dempsey wants the Decepticons to win, because he was promised he will be saved, and not killed by them. He knows that their plot is to enslave humans, and he also admits a dislike for Megatron. When the Autobots come, Dempsey goes and tattles to the Decepticons. So...does he want to be a slave? Not tattling would have had no repercussion on him, and actually could cause him not to be a slave. Also making no sense is Patrick Dempsey's henchmen and workers who stay loyal to him in the face of total annihilation. As the robots destroy Chicago and kill people, they stay guarding Carly like this job is of some importance. Humans are being enslaved and they are taking some meaningless job when they should be running for their dear life. Again, it's like no characters think through anything that happens. The Transformers are hard to watch. They walk around with English, New York, Italian and other accents and why? Are they from these places or just made to be exactly like Earth people? Megatron's henchmen robots are like Igor from Frankenstein, and one of them even has this giant rag on their head to make them seem like a lowly servant, but why? Why would a robot wear this? Did they see people doing this in clichéd sci fi movies? And to top that off, the robots know all the cool Earth slang and speak in it, and the little robots seem to have high libidos. The only purpose for them being so anthropomorphic is to get the audience to laugh at their lame one-liners, and they come off as horrible clichés. This is a movie that is pandering to it's audience through bottom of the barrel dumb comedy, big loud action scenes and a nonexistent plot. But it's terribleness goes beyond that. It's a movie where even the most idiotic of individuals in the audience has more brains in their head than any of the characters, and nobody thinks through any situation, and no decisions make any sort of logical sense. It's a series of unnecessary events that leads to an overlong finale that is more headache inducing than fun. This might be a tiny bit better than Transformers 2, but the two movies are close to being on par. If you just think about any aspect of the film, you will realize nothing makes any sense. This was just awful!My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 153 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.","14 out of 31 found this helpful.

The movie had the best action scenes of the Transformers. There are some fabulous action sequences and epic battles that take your breath away. It's technically sublime, but if does go on a bit. After two and a half hours I did feel as If I was suffering from metal fatigue. Incredible visual effects !!! Outstanding. I waited for a long time to see it and after seeing the movie I could only say 2 words ""WOW and AWESOME!!!"" and I saw this 3 times but still interesting. This film tells the story of the future of a thousand years. There all awesome all though the end I think should have been a three way battle instead of Optimus killing them both in 3 seconds but still really good movie Megatron looked awesome. The should make a fourth one with Megatron coming back as Galvatron and Unicron should be in it. Morover,the special effects is where it was at. Big robots, big explosions, big buildings falling down. Those were the highest points.The story of TF4 is similar to the 1st cartoon movie. Megatron is revived by Unicron and becomes Galvatron. Optimus is replaced by Rodomus Prime in the cartoon movie. I like that Transformers 3 is effective and very clear like in a reality life. Not Boring...I wanna to watch it every time.... I hope continue with next episode more adventures, also more tragic.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

And to be frank this movie had none of those. It was just a showcase of high- tech, expensive but pointlessly executed special effects filled with extremely boring clichés, petty thrills and cheap attempts to draw big crowds. Movies like this might be considered by some people as 'entertaining' but where is the class in it?The acting is just awful, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was used as an eye candy but nothing else. Shia Lebeouf did what he did in the first two movies , bored us to death. His character is flat as usual and the acting was disappointing to say the least.Now, coming to the context of the plot , there are no twists, no adrenaline-rushing action scenes, no depth in the storyline. The only thing that might be considered even remotely close to ""good"" in this huge mess is the work done by the special effects team. They managed to make some of the scenes pretty believable and realistic. And finally, how on earth did the writers manage to create plot holes in this rather simple plot? I mean how can machines survive for years in a metal corrosive surface like that of the moon? There were also other plot holes which I spotted but I'd have to spoil the story to point them out. Anyway, with due respect to Michael Bay and all who were involved in the making of this film, I'd like to request them to change their extremely commercial approach to filmmaking and create movies by thinking out of the box like Quentin Tarantino and especially Christopher Nolan.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

But it fails in many off the same ways as the others did as well as in some brand spanking new ways! First off,I'm probably one off the only ones in the world that thought number 2 off this franchise was an improvement on number 1 (These blockbusters being referred too as number 1 and number 2 seems justified too most who saw them i'd imagine) Ye it was over the top, but so was the original. I remember that the first film tried way too hard too be funny, while ""revenge of the fallen"" had me laughing. So succeeded more in entertaining me in my book. I also had trouble following who was who amongst the robots in the first flick, while the second had some off the characters I remember from my childhood featured, making it an over the top mess I could at least grasp a little better.This ones attempt at humour is pretty poor, but restrains itself more too the first half off the film, leaving the second part as nothing but action. The special effects are as good as always, even if the ""3D"" proves as disappointing as always. Off course its all relying on its visuals this, but at least there is a story off sorts, and some more characters that I remember from the cartoons and toys I had as a kid. So I really can't complain about not getting what I was at least expecting from the movie.What I will say against it though is that it really has a whole bunch off other priority's wrong! It brings back unimportant human characters from the first two (except for Megan Fox, who is replaced here by some annoying English model) while getting rid off the robot characters we're finally getting round too seeing way too early. All in all the whole franchise seems intent on barely featuring Megatron. The Main bad guy as far as I know. Demoted too a mere side character in this series. Oh, and the raciest robots from the second film have gone, but there is a stereotypical Irish and Scottish robot on board. I'm Scottish and can't really say I was offended, but I'm just saying because no one else will pull Michael Bay up for that one.Its nice that Bay got John Malcovich, Frances McDormand and Leonard Nimoy too be in the movie but so what? He should be concentrating more on cutting out cliché slow motion and dumb comedy sidekicks from his movies. I wasn't expecting the film too be a masterpiece based on what came before it. But I was expecting too at least see the return off some cool robot characters, and in that respect the film just teases!This feels like an abrupt end off a trilogy too. One that's finished before a proper story has even begun. I hate Hollywoods recent fascination with re-booting everything, but the ""Transformers"" really do feel like they're in need off one. A Transformer getting re-booted sounds just about right too me. Make it happen!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Now I know I'll probably just catch hell for making that statement. But I don't care, it's my thoughts and that's all that matters to me.Like most 20-somethings today, I grew up watching the original ""Transformers"" cartoons throughout my youth growing up in the early '90s. Those were really good times. I even collected a few of the Hasbro toys (which inspired the cartoon and big-budget live-action movies), but my admiration for ""Transformers"" never really peaked because the channel that I used to watch the original series on removed the show from its early-morning line-up during the mid-90s and it didn't return to TV until just recently - like within the last four years when the first live-action movie was released.History lesson over...Like its two predecessors, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is loud, obnoxious, high destructive good fun. The first film is obviously the best by any standard, I'm partial to liking the second film only slightly more than that one, and this third entry probably has the most ridiculously over-the-top city-wide siege battle I've ever seen. (The film's last 40 minutes are basically one long action sequence; 20 years ago something of this magnitude would have been impossible because of the sheer scale of everything but because of CGI and bigger budgets, lengthy action sequences of this type are now commonplace in the movies today.)As you will recall (or in case you've been living under a rock and have no idea what a ""Transformer"" is), the whole ""Transformers"" mythology involves a centuries-old war between the heroic Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin who mistakenly bring their conflict from their home planet Cybertron to Earth where humans are soon brought into the fold along with them.""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" begins in 1961, when an Autobot spaceship carrying a secret from Transformer home planet Cybertron crash-lands on the moon. A little bit of revisionist history thus takes place in which it is revealed that the whole Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union at that time was instigated to see who could reach the lunar crash site first and learn its secrets. (This is all set up in some pretty quick-step tempo that includes archival footage of President Richard Nixon and the 1969 moon landing integrated with scenes newly shot by over-indulgent, over-director Michael Bay.)We learn that this secret could also save mankind, or wipe us out.The Decepticons are back once again, led by their fearsome leader Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving), and they once again resume their war with the heroic Autobots who are led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, the only voice actor from the original ""Transformers"" TV series). Caught in the middle of it, are determined human players Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf, still continuing his likable Everyman thing), his new love interest Carly Spencer (newcomer and model Rosie Huntington-Whitely, now having thoroughly replaced Megan Fox), soldiers Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson), Agent Simmons (John Turturro) and his assistant Dutch (Alan Tudyk), and newcomers federal bureaucrat Agent Mearish (Frances McDormand) and Carly Spencer's hunky boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey).Everything culminates in an epic, highly destructive Earth-bound siege in Chicago between the Autobots and their human allies, and the evil Decepticons.I think Bay out-did himself on this picture with seeing how many things he can blow up and how many bullets can be fired. It's all utterly ridiculous, but the entire time I was more in awe of the amazing technical feats of it all. From the beginning of the ""Transformers"" series of films, I've always been impressed by the level of attention paid to the littlest details of every scene.Every time a Transformer transforms, I've always been amazed by the sights and sounds of metal parts clanking, whirring, and reconfiguring into some robotic alien mass or robot disguised as heavy-duty machinery. I'm also awed by the amazing details of every explosion, every slain robot that gets torn apart limb from limb in battle, and just the overall attention to detail. It's a pure visual spectacle where you're just in awe of everything that's going on. If you hate Michael Bay, at least like his special effects.Whatever your feelings regarding Bay are, don't miss out on this one; you'll only regret seeing one of the most finely detailed action epics of the year.10/10","15 out of 23 found this helpful.

The original may not have been the greatest or most intelligent movie, but it was fun to watch and looked like a hopeful start to a new series of films. In 2009 Revenge of the Fallen was released to the world and has since become the definition of dumb bad movie as it was filled with mindless action all tied loosely together by an extremely weak plot. As much promise as it held it was not able to deliver what audiences were craving. For many film goers it seems that Dark of the Moon has the huge task of not only being entertaining but also redeeming the terrible second movie. Michael Bay himself apologized for the failures of the Revenge of the Fallen and promised a better third movie. With Dark of the Moon it seems that Bay is aiming for a darker film that will finally wrap up the transformers trilogy which does give audiences hope for an emotionally satisfying ending. So the big question on everyone's mind is can Michael Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger pull off a dark, entertaining, and emotionally satisfying end to this usually dumb but still fun film trilogy?Check out the rest: http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

A lot of talks happening in the movie made me and a lot around me sleepy and they like talking about the film that what really is happening or where is it going i mean it was heavily loosing its interest as people today needs to see a movie that keeps them a lot interested and like what's gonna happen next?! That boosts a lot of + points in the movie's ratings i bet! But nothing was seen like that in this. Due to the other characters playing a bogus role and because of wasting time it was like there was no use of making this one and like the movie is just made for the heck of it. I give it a 6/10 because of the cars, good action, good acting by the main stars of the movie and really because of Shockwave (Character) which was awesome, would have been better if they would have shown him from a much further distance angle on camera to see it all clearly for long doing all the thrashing stuff but none the less was good as much of it was shown.

There should have been nothing exciting, therefore, about the prospect of a second 2.5-hour exhibition — this time of hunks of scrap metal perpetually raining over Chicago — filmed entirely in 3D. Yet with the added assurance of the 3-D fusion camera system and someone with as keen an eye for action as Michael Bay, there was something thrilling — at least in theory — about this installment.It also helped, for me, that Bay apologized. He was among many involved to admit the problematic nature and various shortcomings of ""Fallen"" and vowed a better experience this go-around in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Redemption, it seems, would be a good way of categorizing ""Dark of the Moon."" It's hardly the disaster its predecessor was, but it's also hardly what most would classify as ""good."" Fortunately, it has plenty of (thoughtful) satisfying action with enough traction for us to actually give a damn about what happens on screen.In this third chapter, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives in D.C. with his new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). She's a bit more charming, though equally positioned for the purposes of eye candy, than Megan Fox. Sam's trying to get a job, but finds that he only felt confident in himself or important when he was saving the world with the Autobots. When the U.S government makes a discovery proving that Transformers first made contact with our planet in 1963 when a ship crash-landed on the moon, a chain of events occurs and Sam finds himself with the chance to be a hero again. Basically, if the Decepticons were to get ahold of what's on the moon, destruction would befall Earth, unsurprisingly. For one, ""Dark of the Moon"" provides a worthwhile 3-D experience. Bay and 3D seem like a perfect marriage of auteur and medium. Only he and other style-first types could imagine an action sequence worthy of capturing in 3D without intentionally making stuff fly out toward the audience. Some of it's breathtaking, but most of it simply looks good. The ""Transformers"" series has only ever been as good as its paint job, and the look of ""Dark of the Moon"" is crisper and cleaner than ""Fallen.""Yet many of ""Fallen's"" problems transfer to this installment, in particular length, story and an overabundance of characters and robots. Other than a key plot twist halfway through, the story lacks any grounding. At this point as well, the focus shifts away from Sam and onto the Decepticons trying to take over the world. Writer Ehren Kruger takes so much time to set up the historical context of the dark side of the moon and Sam's feeling of insecurity, yet he throws all that setup out the window when the action finally takes off. By then, we're ready for Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots anyway, so who cares.An extended lineup of new mechanical friends probably made the folks at Hasbro happy, but there are too many Transformers to count in this film and so many lose the attention they deserve. Rather than focus on the effective ones like Soundwave and Laserbeak, Shockwave and Sentinel Prime, we get various bots shifting into the spotlight so that no one gets a distinct personality. Only those who've seen the prior films will feel moved by scenes involving Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and Ironhide, for example. The ceiling to care about these bots is high, but the sheer number keeps us from getting there.More problematic, however are the number of people actors. The human characters outside of Sam have always been obnoxious and inconsequential to the story, so to fill so many roles with A-listers such as John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and Patrick Dempsey feels more wasteful than not recycling a dead Transformer. Audiences are paying to see the robots fight in 3D, not the humans talk. Unless you're going to deliver a story where the humans matter, don't bog us down with them.Then there's the humor and political incorrectness that the ""Transformers"" movies can't seem to shake. Although nothing's as insulting as the racist twin motorcycle bots from ""Fallen"" that have been eliminated, the two ""mini transformers"" and some English race cars that McDormand calls assholes take their place. Some of the jokes are surprisingly spot-on, but it ends up excessive and uncalled for more often than not. Michael Bay also continues his lady- ogling with Rosie making her ""Transformers"" debut from the waste down.So maybe Michael Bay is just a stubborn old filmmaker who knows what he likes, but one gets the sense with ""Dark of the Moon"" that he sharpened up a bit to make sure this film didn't outrage the fan base. Some filmmakers whose movies make $900-some million take that as creative license to make edgier projects, but in Bay's case, he makes it more how he likes it: big, loud, slick and sexy. It's unlike most filmmakers to make their films more Hollywood- pleasing as they gain notoriety and respect, but Bay's turned it into an art form. In the case of ""Dark of the Moon,"" he's upped the emotional and visual stakes to create an engaging feat of blockbuster. Although some of his contemporaries would have us believe that explosions and fighting should come with a side of philosophical sermon, Bay reminds us that there's value in wowing an audience and that doing so requires talent, even if that talent normally rates behind great storytelling.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Transformers 3 however failed to even live up to my low expectations and in my opinion it is easily the worst film of the series. In the first two films director Michael Bay was at least aware that a movie based on large robot toys should be fun. This movie tries to get clever by infusing robot lore into actual historical events such as the moon landing in '69 and the Chernobyl meltdown of '86 which had great potential if only they'd bothered to think it all the way through. Stagnating in pits of exposition with plot holes large enough to ram Optimus Prime through sideways, we get bogged down in lengthy scenes where everyone tries to act more crazy and over the top than everyone else, presumably to hide the fact that nothing much else is happening and it's all very boring. To compensate for the absurd over acting displayed by most of the cast Bay throws in a new leading lady who barely acts at all but in her defense she does do a decent job in the role she was really hired for and that is to fill the 'sexy eye candy' void left by the controversial departure of Megan Fox, who should be glad she was left out of this debacle.The first half of the film is filled with little more than scenes of Shia complaining about everything, so much so that I almost switched off around the 30 minute mark but thankfully the second half of the film ramps up a little and we get to have a bit of fun as the story starts to unfold with some twists (albeit mostly lame or obvious ones) and an injection of much needed WOW moments of visual delight. At last we get some of Bay doing what Bay does best - total mayhem, but regrettably by the time the film really kicks into gear I was way past caring or investing into the movie on any level.Watching Transformers 3 I couldn't help but feel Bay was growing bored with fighting robots and the complete lack of extras on the Blu-ray could be a telling sign that I might be right. It was like he was on auto pilot, there was a definite lack of typical overly stylistic signature Bay moments and I wondered if he actually bothered to turn up on set most days. In fact he has become so disinterested that he's now reusing songs from the soundtracks of his previous movies (Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion also featured in Armageddon). It's way past time for Bay to move on, especially if there is to be a fourth film because this franchise is in desperate need of fresh ideas and some enthusiasm. Despite being a pretty terrible film Transformers 3 grossed a truckload of money and there are rumors that parts 4 and 5 will be filmed back to back. The bad news is that Bay is meant to be directing. The good news is that LaBeouf may be replaced by Jason Statham so hopefully there'll be less moaning and groaning from the leading man which might, if nothing else, free up some time for Bay to blow more stuff up earlier in the film.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first Transformers was a weak action film with some redeeming qualities. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was a ridiculous and over the top mess and now we've arrived at Transformers: Dark of the Moon which at this point is just sad. This is a pathetic excuse for an action blockbuster that makes a mockery of everything action films stand for. In the latest bulbous growth to the series follows the Autobots when they find a Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon. The Autobots must save the world again as they keep the Decepticons from utilizing the spacecraft for a worldwide takeover.There isn't really much more to say about the plot because it might as well be nonexistent. In its place we find the most convoluted action scenes full of a painful and redundant amount of explosions and robots throwing crap at each other. There is a scene here and there that I might be able to stomach calling a little cool or kinda neat, but this film mainly succeeds in convincing me that giant fighting robots can actually be really boring. I never thought I could muster up so much hate for so much action. But there is a certain point when all cinematic skill and finesse goes out the window and it is nothing more than an attempt to see how many explosions can be allowed in one two and a half hour film. There is no aesthetic quality to the action. It is as far from stylish or sophisticated as it can possibly be and is nothing more than an idiotic mess. I don't remember the last time I wanted a film to end as badly as I did during the last 45 minutes of endless stupidity that was the final battle of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.This film basically breaks down as follows. 60 percent action. 30 percent stupid jokes that do so incredibly little for the plot and aren't all that funny. 5 percent childish romance between the two obnoxious leads. And finally, 5 percent story. After Michael Bay snorts twelve lines of coke and crams his idiotic mess of a film full of as many explosions possible he says to himself, ""Oh right! I have to put a story in here somewhere! Well I can't have it take up too much time so I'll have to just have the characters explain things as blatantly and flatly as possible so that I have more time to thrown in explosions and stupid jokes that don't really belong here, but who cares! I'm Michael Bay I can do whatever the hell I want! And that includes making my movie two and a half hours long!"" And what a painful two and a half hours it was. If only Bay's heart had stopped after that whole spiel and I would be in a better place right now.This film reminds me why the art of filmmaking is so under-appreciated. It is because some ""filmmakers"" manage to produce steaming piles of crap like this movie. Every moment of this film is a mess. I chuckled maybe once and never did I feel I was witnessing something intense, awesome, or even fun. I wanted this movie to end and when the credits finally began to role a huge wave of relief came over me. This film is exactly how not to make a film. It is boring, stupid, paced horribly, and just put together so horribly and so crudely. In all its glamour and grandiose special effects you would think the film would be more polished than this turd is, but it is just such a piece of garbage that feels like it was thrown together by someone who has never made a film in their life. It is dreadful on a whole new level. However, there is one thing going for this film. I'm going to go see a lot more films this year as we're only half way through. A lot of them will surely be crap but now, when I see a bad film I can at least find some optimism by telling myself, ""At least it wasn't as bad as Transformers: Dark of the Moon.""","18 out of 44 found this helpful.

The characters are alright, they balance out the screentime between humans and the transformers pretty well. The writing and acting were ok.

With his latest offering he takes the ockham's razor to the summer blockbuster, carving out the superfluous- story,characterization, et al, while distilling the necessary and tweaking his distinct Bay-ian aesthetic to a maximum to produce the purest testimony of an evident cinematic apocalypse.Also worthy of interest is Bay's provocative depiction of the British bimb0. Her reduction to an object of the gaze is evident throughout the film. In one glorious shot where she scuttles to the telescope to view the enemy forces Bay cuts from this collagen prone bombshell(sic!) to a fancy golden maned bitch seated on a similar chair passively viewing the ensuing mayhem!Talk about free association! Such honesty and fearless purity of vision effectively transcends the entire camp of critical left field detractors! As a final note : I'm sure future post modernists shall hail this film as the newest reincarnation of B-movie conventions . the 'b' now read as Blockbuster. Move over grind house! The CGI ridden future is here!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was perfect. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie, excited, shocked, amazed, I even had a few tears in my eyes! Transformers 3 has everything a good movie should have. Action, comedy, a few little heart felt moments... Well Maybe just for me but it was perfect. 10 out of 10!! Go see this movie. I'm going to see it again tomorrow, that's how good it was. I just wish it would never end. I need more Transformers. On the other side of thing though, I don't think this counts as a spoiler or anything but a few autobots weren't even in this movie, maybe they were killed between movies, I don't know. Mudflap and Skids were the comical ones and now R.C had to fill that roll. And Jolt is missing, the character that put the wings and guns on Optimus in Revenge of the Fallen. How could he not be in it? But new characters make up for it all. And don't think it's all action, there is a lot of important conversations and what not, not just robots running around.","24 out of 40 found this helpful.

It adds nothing but increased ticket cost and eyestrain. No question, the effects are great (and would have been equally so in 2D), but the plot is very disjointed, with many odd segments that really make no sense, even when well done. The best performances were John Malkovitch and the barely credited Alan Tudyk. They were just great to watch, but so far off the main plot line, I was just not sure why they were there. I did love hearing Leonard Nimoy's voice as an autobot, but again, it was just too much in an already over-stuffed film.Let's face it, an overly long feature movie based on kids' mechanical toys is certain to have its detractors, but it does have a lot of rapid fire eye candy, and is a great summer movie. I did enjoy it, but I can't help but wish it had skipped the 3D, and invested that money in better editing, writing and some attention to continuity. It's always depressing to see a major production that really fails to be great, despite huge effort and expenditure, because it simply forgets the key rule of movie making. Have a great story, and tell it well.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

In 1999, 2002, 2010 he won decisively Razzie Award. I mean doesn't this by itself tell you a kind of movie you can expect from him? Hard core Transformer fans will like it more than the 2nd disaster. However, I am missing Megan Fox, in this type of movie a hot chick is a necessity. Rosie is miles away and definitely not even comparable to Megan in a ""beauty"" department. All that this movie possesses are visual effects and better action in comparison to the 2nd movie. Even the sequel name is lame ""Dark of the moon"" trying to imitate the sequel ""Dark Knight"". In conclusion, better sequel than the 2nd one, but still not up to expectations.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

It's preposterous. but it IS AWESOME. so, in fact, no, i don't want to be wasting my brain too much getting really 'in' to how deep and thoughtful the movie is. yawn-o-rama. Having said that, a story is present here, and it works perfectly well for the source material. It tells of a device that has the power to re-shape the universe.re-shape what i hear you cry? the universe? YES! THE UNIVERSE! that's epic man i don't care what you say. it plays out mostly like an epic fantasy, with it's own mythology and world relatable history. and man, what more do you want? Michael Bay is the king of blowing stuff up. He's the man here who dreamt ""what would it be like it bunches of massive metallic transforming alien robots started having a war on our planet, smashing each other and everything around them to smithereens"" And I'm so glad he did dream that dream. because this movie perfectly portrays exactly what i'd imagine would happen if this was in fact the case.We need this guy. Nobody creates this kind of spectacle like he does. it's so impressive. I can't even imagine beginning to conceive some of the sequences he pulls off in this movie. and he does it with such ease. It's so easy to hate michael bay, sure it is. he makes big dumb action movies, but we know this, and i really really enjoy a big dumb action movie once in a while. it's so much fun.michael bay is the man. yes, THE MAN. he is your man for pure explosive spectacle. No one else would have done a better job of this movie. I genuinely believe that.Beautifully mixing perfectly realised CG effects with epic locations. The camera always at some kind of ridiculous angle that makes everything look GINORMOUS. Huge towering sky scrapers, and vast landscapes setting the backdrop for the showdown. It's a movie that knows exactly what it is, and who it's aimed at (that's right, horny teenage boys) and because of that, this movie DELIVERS. I'm now in my twenties, but when I was a young teenager, all i wanted to see was some awesome action, some crazy effects and some hot women. boom boom boom. this movie nails it.Given most of the reviews from critics and again here on IMDb, people seem to have forgotten what fun it is to go and watch a real event movie. To see something that will blow you away. To have an experience. (3D came about for this reason) You want your ears bleeding, you want your eyeballs popping out, you wanna be guzzling your popcorn at all the visual thrills. well i do at least. i love movies. i love everything about movies. and i loved this movie. for all it's obvious flaws, it's not trying to be anything but what it is. and i love it for that. sorry if i rambled on there. i know it's not the most eloquently written review. i think you get the idea of how i felt about this movie.go see it with your brain tuned the right way and you'll have a blast.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

After watching Transformer's in 2007, I fell in love with the stunning new rendition of the well known franchise. When Transformers Revenge of the Fallen came out I was also very happy with it overall, although their were some aspect's I wasn't entirely happy with, I overall did really like it.When I went into the Cinema for Transformers Dark of the Moon, I think however that I was expecting to much because in my opinion it didn't live up to what I imagined it would.Firstly I will say this. This movie is a great Movie in some aspects. The Special Effect's are simply jaw-dropping, with crisp, immaculate detail that look's like the Transformers are visually there on the set. The Action also is insane, and at certain part's of the film left my saying ''Wow, that was awesome''. So there is no doubt in my mind that the Action and Special Effect's side of the Film is incredible and top notch as usual.... However, the Storyline and some other aspect's of the Movie though were very disappointing and quite confusing. Without sounding too harsh, unfortunately for me this is the worst story line in the entire Transformers Movie. After thinking about it non -stop all night and all morning, even i found it difficult to recall what was happening. After discussing it with some of my fellow friend's, they also found it very confusing. I felt the story - line was rushed, or wasn't consistent, and it felt like they were going for that objective ... but then they were going for that objective. So for me, this is the worst story -line in my opinion.One of the other thing's I did not like was some of the Acting skill's. The acting was at time's fairly good, however at other time's it was week and degrading. The new girl who is playing a different role, is not the best actor either I'm afraid. At first I admired her sweet tone and fairly well presented acting skills, however - and excuse me for sounding a bit prejudice - I found her English accent quite frustrating at times when she was suppose to be conveying a sense of sadness or fear. Unfortunately the acting skill's for me were average, Megan Fox in my opinion did better in the acting field.Another thing that was very frustrating is they did not show us or give us enough information or detail on new Transformers. There is a lot of new Transformer's that we don't know there name, didn't see them Transform and didn't see their vehicle form or hear them speak. I saw one Transformer only in it's vehicle form, I never saw it Transform. And their was countless other Transformer's that I wanted to see more. Also a large minority of character's were killed and in a way I felt like they were only shown for a couple of minutes and then they were dead or gone just like that.Overall, I wouldn't say it is the best Transformers. It is still worthy of seeing. I would rate it 10/10 if it were just for the Special Effect's and Action, however the confusing and jumbled story - line, lack of knowledge on a range of character's and the poor acting skills from some of the actor's leave me to give it a 6.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Worst ever movie i have seen in recent times . Not to be rude or offensive but in close up shots,Rosie Huntington-Whiteley appears to be less feminine and looks like a bloke with thick lips (??). of course she can't deliver her lines - she is not an actor. She is a body with a few lines to speak.

I can't review this movie from a die hard fan p.o.v. because in all honesty, though I loved the original animated series and the classic movie, my history is a bit rusty and my ass would be blended into a tasty boba treat for some spectacle wearing fan boy with a hard on for Optimus Prime. So, in all fairness I will simply review this as someone who loved the previous movies. And yes, I even loved Revenge of the Fallen If you've stopped reading at this point because of lack of credibility I understand, if not then let me continue. There were several things I appreciated about the movie, the first being the visual effects as always were impeccable. The orgy worthy robot on robot fighting was amazing and exciting. Honestly, I almost wish Bay would do a prequel following along the lines of the fall of Cybertron.You know, just ignore the human aspect of it all together since we have a habit of being awfully messy with emotions and intentions gone awry(cough cough every suit wearing pencil pushing government agent Bay puts into his films cough cough). The stunts were nothing to sneeze about either. Something about soldiers leaping out of burning planes with wing suits under wave after wave of assault by the pursuing Decepticons just makes you tingle inside. Or that might be this morning's coffee? Either way, there are moments of jaw dropping stunts mixed with visual effects that make you sit on the edge of your seat. I was also impressed with the plot that starts to take shape early on in the movie but sadly it drifts off lazily in the background halfway through like my Grandpa during our family gatherings for Christmas. It also gets a little far fetched at one significant point where even I, someone with little knowledge on physics and global dynamics, had to shake my head and ask out loud ""What?! We're just gonna pretend that that wouldn't have any repercussions?!"" I can't divulge too much because then I would be spoiling the surprise but once you see it, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. What makes me especially upset about this is that (and yes, here comes my redemption for the earlier comment)with Revenge of the Fallen the plot was filled with so many holes it looked like the Swiss cheese I put on my breakfast bagels. However, at least in the second one they made an attempt to fill in as many of those craters as they could with one of (or both at times) Megan Fox's ass cheeks in daisy dukes or the never tiring air acrobatics of Shia Lebeouf. Yes, throw your Bumble bee collector cups from Burger King at me and boo at the statement I am about to make: I felt the second one at least delivered more closely to the first both in satisfaction and entertainment than Dark of the Moon. I liked it better, so there. I feel this movie could have been great had Michael Bay simply followed the story line and tried to keep his Bayisms at a minimum. Much like the random moments of humping dogs and pants less people in the second there are times during the third that seem rather arbitrary and eye rolling-ly awful. Not to mention even though Fox has a backlash against her that would make Vanilla Ice blush, her character, Mikeala, seemed to fit the mold of female lead better than Rosie Huntington-I don't care I lost interest in the remainder of her last name. Fox's interaction with Shia also felt more realistic; yes, maybe it was because they were actually getting it on behind the scenes but that's not the point, point is both his character, Sam and the new girl, Carly, have a forced physical attraction that doesn't seem as convincing. The same go for other character interactions that don't seem as genuine as they did in previous movies which unfortunately becomes a little emotionally detaching from the story. All in all, if you are still awake, I would say the movie is worth checking out but I don't feel it lived up to the hype or delivered as well as the others.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I am so glad that I took the time to watch it since it was full of continuous action and destruction.The theme of this movie is about good vs. evil, and how good will always prevail at the end. The film revolves around the Decepticons trying to take over planet earth, and part of that plan means getting rid of all of the Autobots. It starts out with videos of the sixties Apollo landing mission and later the viewers learn that it was all a big cover up of an alien spaceship crash on the moon. The Decepticons are able to get started on their plan when they trick Optimus Prime to go to the moon and bring the missing puzzle pieces they needed back to earth. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is of course the main character and his new girl friend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is his side kick. I think the only down fall in the whole movie is Rosie and her character. She is clearly not meant to be an actress and I think that this film lacks a great female actress to match all the amazing male roles. I really don't see why a movie with such brilliant special effects would need ""eye candy"". The other male roles were played by Josh Duhamel as Lennox, John Turturro as Simmons, Tyrese Gibson as Epps, and Patrick Dempsey as Dylan just to name a few. The Transformers in this movie are really amazing, their movement is so real and the angles they are shot from are visually spectacular. They did a great job shooting them from when they are cars to when they turn in to the transformers, and the angles make all the difference with such stunning sequences and the viewers are able to picture how huge these transformers are really meant to be. Bumblebee is my favorite transformer and he had a huge part in the first movie but I felt like he was missing a bit from this movie and it was disappointing not to see him as much. When this movie first hit theaters in June of 2011 it did come in 3D. I was not able to watch it in 3D and I'm usually not a big fan of them either because films seem so dark once you put the glasses on. However, I felt this movie was very bright in lighting and because of that fact I think it would look great in 3D and hopefully I will have the chance to check it out sometime. At the end all of the Autobots and humans have to work together to save the planet. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) puts a group together including Tyrese Gibson (Epps) to go to downtown Chicago and stop the Decepticons from succeeding. The final battle is a little drawn out and long but there isn't a dull moment in it, there are building falling over, glass shattering, explosions and all kinds of fun fire. Of course the Autobots win and Optimus finally kills Megatron.In my opinion it is highly doubtful that this movie will be the last of Transformers and as long as they are able to put this much action into a movie they will continue to gain more new fans.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

With the action getting bigger in every version, 'Dark of the Moon' aka Transformers-3 is a typical Micheal Bay movie, which promises loads of action which, as usual is scantily clad with a semblance of a story.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), the central character in the first two films has now finished schooling and looking for a job. He has also moved cities and also to a new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington- Whitley). Sam and the Autobots dive into the thick of the plot when the truth behind moon explorations is apparently revealed as an investigation into a crashed Cybertronian spacecraft on the dark side of the moon.Sentinel Prime is a key character inclusion as Optimus' mentor and Cybertronian genius who his keen on using advanced technology to revive his planet and also brings a twist in the story. The one-eyed serpentine cannon bot Shockwave is TF3's most formidable antagonist. Old enemy Megatron has lost his edge but not his ambitions and moves around as a rusty old truck with a cowl covering the injury inflicted by Optimus in TF2. The film's selling point is its special effects, largely shot in stereoscopic 3D which deserves unreserved applause for the resultant spectacle. Intricate action sequences are slowed down for detail and camera angles are simply great. The freeway chase that features in most of Bay's movies is seen again though. With more bots and the threat of imminent global danger make the climax worthwhile. Nevertheless, there is a lot missing with the script and acting. The flow is also affected by poor transitions between action and storytelling. Sudden cuts in some action sequences and the lucky bunny romance scene that suddenly pops up from nowhere are just a few examples. Also, some of its humor is downright silly.Sam's character that was central to the story in the earlier movies as he held maps or clues that either group was chasing. Here, the battle has nothing to do with him and all that LaBeouf has to do is to play his usual scared hero. Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie brings in her charm, but none too comparable to Fox. Both something in common though; they're both equally awful at acting.And, nearly everyone else is just a caricature. Be it those reprising their roles such as Josh Duhamel as the army commander or John Torturro as the former Agent turned author who aren't critical to the story or new new faces such as the largely wasted John Malkovich or a nervous Ken Jeong of Hangover fame. A significant exception is, Patrick Dempsey as Carly's moneyed boss with a deeper secret to his role.Clearly, it's a case of special effects donning the role of a back-seat driver. But, full marks for special effects, the lone pillar on which the Transormers edifice stands.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This all changes when an old government secret is uncovered. From there on things start to get nasty and the world once again needs to be saved by the Megatron and his metallic friends.After seeing the second one I wasn't expecting too much of this one. Where the first one had a story and a decent amount of CGI the second one had no story and nothing but CGI. For some reason I was thinking this one couldn't be worse than that second one. But alas, it is.On the one side it offers what is to be expected - explosions and fire, and lots and lots of action sequences. On the other side it offers the return of some of the older characters - and a shipload of new ones. Now that wouldn't be too bad - if only they would fit in the story and would do what they were supposed to do. What I found more than mildly irritating for instance was the fact that the Sam Witwicky character had to start all over when it comes to trust from the government agencies.Add to that that at least one character was hopelessly miscast - Patrick Dempsey does not belong in this film, at least not in the role he plays, it doesn't suit him at all and it shows in the way it comes to the screen.Then it seems they tried to save the film by applying the old trick of opening a can of known actors/actresses in the hopes they can turn lead into gold. The trick never worked and it doesn't work in this one. What's Frances McDormand doing in this film? She can do a lot better. The same for John Malkovich. John Turturro is about the only big name that I can like in this film - but that's because he has a long history of odd little roles and the one he has in this film suits.Last but surely not least, the 3D. This can be described by asking one question: What 3D? There's next to none and where it is visible it doesn't add anything.So, all in all, an utter waste of celluloid.2 out of 10 robots no longer disguised","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

They're not being hoodwinked or manipulated into seeing anything they don't want to see. They, we, I know exactly what I'm paying my tenner for.On the way out of a screening of Emmerich's 2012, someone described the experience as ""like an apocalyptic roller-coaster."" And that's a pretty fair summary, if you ask me. These are sensorial thrill-rides, state-of-the-art theme park attractions as much as they are movies. Audiences want to be blown out of their seats by the audiovisual experience. As long as the plot is coherent, the characters are likable enough for us to care whether they survive or not, there's an occasional laugh throw in to preserve that roller-coaster giddiness, well, there's your formula for this sort of thing. I can imagine select 3D scenes from this third Transformers film playing to sell-out crowds in any Universal Studios or techno theme park.Dark of the Moon has stupendous scenes of destruction, perhaps even surpassing the aforementioned 2012. Director Bay's robot battles are epic. The hour-long showdown in a battered Chicago is worth the admission price alone. Vehicular carnage, military firepower, transformer face-offs galore--this sequence has it all, including skyscrapers being crushed and toppled by giant robot snakes. The 3D, too, is stunning, with a daredevil freefall by Josh Duhamel and his special ops rangers into a maelstrom of robo-carnage being the standout. It's eye-popping stuff, and just when you think Bay has peaked, he ups the ante tenfold until your brain can barely process what he and his filmmaking wizards have wrought with their limitless FX budget.The series' throwaway humour is as hit-and-miss as ever, with John Turturro's oddball Agent Simmons and his even weirder German sidekick (Alan Tudyk) generating the most laughs. Ken Jeong is atrocious in his brief (but not brief enough) role as a paranoid office worker--probably the most grating comedy performance since Chris Tucker's screechy turn in The Fifth Element. Other series newcomers include John Malkovich and Frances McDormand; the former is given nothing to do, while the latter is good fun in her role as the brassy National Security Chief.Duhamel and Tyrese are solid as ever in their stock gung-ho roles. Shia Laboeuf goes hysterical once too often but at least his character, Sam Witwicky, wants to join the action this time around. Brit model Rosie Huntington-Whitely is sweet as his new girlfriend, Carly, and makes a decent replacement for the Fox (whom I did miss, I have to say). In the transformers' cast, Leonard Nimoy makes a great voice contribution as the powerful and crucial Sentinel Prime.I'm going to recommend Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3D to anyone who enjoyed the first movie, those who love action on a grand scale, or anyone who wants to see the potential of 3D technology. The SF prologue, including a nice alternate history reveal during the Apollo 11 EVA, showcases some breathtaking 3D framing and depth design. And the extended finale in Chicago is the must-see action event of the summer.It's pretty much indefensible as anything but a thrill-ride, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one, as did the (astonishingly multi-cultural) audience at my IMAX 3D screening. It runs a bit long at two and a half hours, but once the Chicago sequence starts, you'll be gripped to the end.","29 out of 50 found this helpful.

These kind of movies are killing the movie business, I am certain that there must be a hundred lower budget projects that never get green lighted, because such lumbering primitive monstrosities like the Transformers movies get made. I have no problem with high budget movies per se, Avatar, Pirates of the Caribbean ,Marvel,Star Trek, Batman franchises all cost lots of money, and make lots of money, but they have at their core, intelligence vision and integrity and are far more entertaining than most of Mr. Beys work. Give Mitchael Bey $50million and he might just manage a 10 minute short. In short Transformers DSM while occasionally spectacular lacks pretty much anything else that would make me want to watch it ever again.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

There were some scenes where I was really impressed with the depth, and it added to the 'experience' without a doubt.In addition to the excellent 3D, the FX artists have used far less motion blur, and the action and fights are much clearer for it.I also felt the story was more cohesive than both 1 and 2 - and I was pleased to see we didn't have a repeat of ""you need to get item X to position Y"" and then rather then dropping Sam off at position Y, they leave him a mile away so he has to run through a war-zone just for the spectacle of it.Make no mistake, there's still running, and it's still there to segue between massive set pieces, but at least there was a semblance of logic as to why the characters needed to be there.It wasn't amazing, but it was enjoyable, and from a story perspective (as I'm not going to go so far as to call it a plot) it did seem to have the best pacing of the trilogy.So in summary, if you enjoyed TF1, I'd say it was equally enjoyable if not slightly more so - as long as you don't expect anything more than a popcorn movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Before I review all aspects of the film, I'll talk about the story.The story is being reviewed as convoluted, choppy and all over the place. And I can admit it can seem so for some audiences, but I think the film is directed for a target audience. I'd say Star Trek Trekkers! If you're a hard core Trekker, than this might be the best film ever created. It sounds bold, but I seriously feel that this is the case. I might sound corny for saying so, but I acknowledge that. And this is why I believe it is one of the most important films of all time.In Transformers, and Transformers 2, we saw some simple good vs. evil battles, great action, and funny scenes. In Transformers 3 Dark of The Moon, we get a whole lot more. More in plot, and a much more subliminal tale that blends fiction with historical account. If you believe in The Secret Space Program, E.T. controlled governments, and UFO's, or plain and simple; aliens amongst us, than this film is the nutshell. I believe that Transformers 3 and it's plot is basically centered around conspiracy theories that have been running since the 50's. This is E.T. disclosure in fiction form, You will see simulated stock footage of John F. Kennedy discussing UFO's. Only to see real stock footage right after wards. You will see astronaut Neil Armstrong in a cameo appearance, only to see a scene of him taking an oath not to discuss his knowledge of aliens on the moon and on Earth. Why would Neil Armstrong agree to the role if he didn't agree with all of this?! It's absolutely perplexing to me.The movie was darker than the previous 2. Less comedy, but thought Shia Lebouf was the best in this 3rd installment. He was very good, and as funny as ever. But yes, the movie lacks emotion as most critics say, but It doesn't matter, it's a plot driven film, not a character film. The CGI is the best I've ever seen, simple as that. It surpasses Avatar's CGI by far, I was absolutely mesmerized by the CGI in this film, and the previous 2 Transformers films do not compare to this one. Even the fight scenes were well choreographed, where as in the past 2 films, they seemed blurry and rushed.This is Micheal Bay's best film. It's his masterpiece, without any doubt! I just wish the film was rated R, like I said in my review in the other Transformers film that you can find on here. I think a more serious tone would have made this less campy and just better.In the end, there is an all to powerful message. All the evil in this world is due to a spiritually evil Extraterrestrial intelligence that intervened with our technological progression. And there is also a good kind of E.T.'s keeping us safe. Whether through their messengers, or not.Star Trek fans, be advised, there are many homages here to Spock in this film, some of his most famous lines are used, and after all, he is voicing Sentinel Prime, so why not! 9/10 I'd give it a round 10 if it wasn't for the lack of emotion, and lack of care for the characters. But like I said, it's the plot that is good, not so much a character driven film.","17 out of 27 found this helpful.

And while i have noticed some improvements over the sequel, this one still fell short from becoming a good movie in my eyes.So many wrong things about this movie that i don't know where to start, probably, the most thing that annoyed me, was the silly and lame humor. very silly and unrealistic characters that don't seem to take the events surrounding them seriously, especially Turturro's and Malkovic's characters, such jokes !! i don't get why someone like Malkovic agrees to do a character like that ?! And what about the embarrassing Ken Jeong ?! involved in a disaster scene that was meant to be funny !!!Then comes the typical cliché characters in the American military, all pumped up and Rambo like macho men with big huge guns and gear running around and kicking A** !! lame !!the Robots themselves are ridiculous with their multi English accents, some speak American accents while other speak Irish and British ! what is up with that ?So here, Sam has left his old connections with the Autobots and is starting a new life looking for a job, yet he still has two robot pets, that i have no idea why they are there with him ? and as expected they are clumsy and always goofing around him for no clear reason ?!No more Megan Fox, but now she is replaced with another hot model like actress, who's character is still annoying, was just casted here to be constantly saved by our hero. there was supposed to be a passionate drama like relationship between her and Sam, which was totally unrealistic and lacked in depth. She was hot undeniably, but why ? do we have to ingrain this hot image in our growing generations ? that this is what every guy should have and that this is what every girl should look like ?!?! another cheap Hollywood image that i wished they would have avoided in this film. sad !!Too long, too much unnecessary scenes that could have been easily cut out, the whole Sam struggling with his family issues have been done before and grown old.the Visuals and sound effects, however, were stunning, i really can't deny that, and i only saw this in 2D, people seem to like the 3D and highly praise it. definitely, very enjoyable visuals, and some of the action scenes were very brilliantly executed, but even the action lacked in certain areas and did seem unrealistic.Spoiler >> so when Sam is hanging by one arm to one of the Decepticans, there was so much big and violent movements and he was dragged around like a feather, yet his arm did not get broken or his shoulder dislocated, seriously ?!So to summarize, this was another Hollywood joke, lots of emphasis on visuals, which were brilliant, but no depth and no heart to it. but I'm pretty sure, a lot of people will be taken by the visuals and will think that this was the best movie ever made, the younger audience "" including my 7 years old son who actually liked this "", and it will make big bucks, but with no heart.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

People need to stop hating on Michael Bay, what he doing is working , look at the ticket sales. 2. If after the first movie you still looking for character development, go else where. Go watch HP or LOTR, like they really had it anyway. 3. Transformers falls in a genre that is not for everyone, it is action, scifi and mecha, plus it was a CARTOON Finally, go watch it in IMAX 3D , the whole movie is 3D. If there was one problem i did not get enough of the transformers, which is what the movie is about, even though it had lots . next time do like 1hr 45 mins to include the TRANSFORMERS, and the remaining 45mins of humans All in all great movie","18 out of 29 found this helpful.

It's not the worst movie. Yes, there's a lot of problems with physics, reality, and acting. It is predictable at times and filled with directing clichés. But, if you're looking for action and mindless entertainment, this movie delivers. It's better than Revenge of the Fallen, but maybe not as good as the original. There is little chemistry between Sam and Carly, but the good new is there's less screen time for Carly and for Sam's parents than in Revenge of the Fallen. It is a long movie, but it is full of action and not as much ridiculous, waste-of-time filler. Had a hard time distinguishing which robot was which at times.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Then they ""kinda tolerated"" the second one. Logic dictates that the third one ""sucks"". Logic is right.The curse of the number three movies continues. This movie is indeed worse than its predecessors and with Transformers, that's really saying something. While that may spell big box office, it doesn't spell long-term staying power and of the three films in the Transformers trilogy, the final installment may well go down as the biggest disappointment of them all. It's wild but it's as bad as most feared. The CGI action is indeed over-the-top and may induce some popcorn merit but there simply is not enough of the things that matter. All that video game action starts becoming dull without a film or characters we care about to hold it together. It's easy to see where they went wrong but the formula led to two big paydays, why would they change it now?","19 out of 70 found this helpful.

I love the first two films, and I was pretty excited to see this. I was already annoyed/bummed that they had replaced Megan Fox, but I was hoping it wouldn't be too big of a deal. Because I had fairly high expectations, I ended up being disappointed by the entire first half of the movie. It had a very strange, unpleasant feeling to it. The humor was very forced and didn't fit well with the wittiness from the other movies. There were several new side characters, few of whom were at all funny. John Malkovich's part was unnecessary, Frances McDormand fell flat. Ken Jeong was a nightmare who brought The Hangover to Transformers. Alan Tudyk at least provided some good laughs, but his character was also an unnecessary addition to a bloated cast. Even the established characters didn't have that old spark. Sam was reduced to ranting and whining by turn, without the right kind of sarcasm. His parents became caricatures dressed in matching green track suits, who irritated rather than endeared. Even some of the new Autobots were ridiculous, especially in appearance. Only Optimus and Bumblebee felt true to character.And then, of course, there's the new girl. Carly, a.k.a. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. With regard to any actual acting, she did alright. Nothing impressive or all that expressive, actually, but she was okay. The thing that I'm most bothered about is the blatant and over-the-top over-sexing of her character. You can so obviously see why Megan Fox declined to return to the role under what I'm sure is the absolutely objectifying and misogynistic direction of Michael Bay. Of course he had to resort to casting a lingerie model! And his unprofessional-ism showed itself in the dialog as well, dismissing the character of Mikaela as 'selfish' and praising the new Carly as someone who 'loves Sam for who he is.' It read way too much like Bay getting a final few jabs in at Megan Fox through the script of his new film.But there were some redeeming factors that deserve to be mentioned. First of all, the 3D in this movie was admittedly spectacular. Normally I hate 3D with a passion because the darkness added by the glasses and the inevitable headache that ensues, but I had no such problems in this film. And the action scenes were as fantastic as ever, perhaps even better than in the previous films. I must admit that the second half pulled me in and had me on the edge of my seat. There was a wonderfully epic feel to the entire Chicago storyline, which almost made up for the rest of the movie's shortcomings.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Honestly not as Bad as People Make it Out to be","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3042962/?ref_=tt_urv","clarkn-nc2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51543037/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2014","***ONE VERY MINOR SPOILER THAT DOESN'T GIVE AWAY ANY PLOT POINTS***After seeing this when I was 11 or 12, I, as pretty much anyone of that age would be, was mesmerised by this film. Of course, that was simply because such a film is like a staple diet for kids that age. If that makes any sense at all.Anyway, 4 years later, and I'm still loving this film. And it's not because it's feeding my inner 12-year-old (well, not completely)— it's because I genuinely think that this is a good film.I understand where the hate is coming from: enraged viewers still haven't gotten over the somewhat shabby Revenge of the Fallen, and are continuing their hate over this sequel, too. People complain that it's too long, bloated, the acting is bad and the comedy is ridiculous. These complaints are what's ridiculous. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is exciting, the CGI is incredible, the acting isn't too bad, and the comedy is toned down, but very much needed. Let's elaborate...The CGI. Pretty much the only aspect of this film (or, indeed, the entire franchise) that is not hated upon. It is simply incredible- you don't stop and think- ""was that real?"", or squint to see if there's some sort of not-so-real detail— pretty much nothing is flawed about it, except of course, the infamous scene where Sam is carrying an invisible robot in a brief shot.The acting— not bad at all, I don't understand why people hate on it so much. People seem to hate Rosie Huntington-Whitely's acting, but it is not bad at all. Fair enough, it's not Anthony Hopkins, but at least it's not Alan Bagh (Birdemic). None of the other actors are bad at their job either: each one gives a very realistic performance. Yes, Shia screams a lot, but wouldn't you if you were flying through the air over a truck that just fell over while there are robots shooting at each other? Now, the comedy, which made Revenge of the Fallen one of the most hated films ever. In DOTM, the comedy is toned down to Wheelie and his companion (who's name fails me at the moment). Their comic relief is much needed, as Dark of the Moon is as the title suggests- dark. There is a lot of killing, and some of it is graphic, but brief. The climactic threat is quite intense, and in the midst of it, these two provide a little relief. I will admit that there is a lot more humour in the first 3rd of the film, with the humans, but it does tone down once the action picks up.And that's another thing that people are complaining about. ""Too much"" human involvement. Can I get one thing straight? Each of the Transformers movies are set on EARTH. Earth. That's where HUMANS live. How can you have a credible storyline if robots are fighting each other and there's no human involvement? And if there are humans, you have to develop them and make them interesting. The only reason why Carly (Huntington-Whitely)'s character was underdeveloped was because she was replacing Megan Fox who was abruptly fired. And she doesn't even need a back story- all we need to know is that she and Sam are together, and she's simply replaced Fox's Mikela (spelling?). And then you get all these other complainers saying there's too much action. Goodness me, it's a freakin' film about robots. No one complained about Pacific Rim.Now, the storyline. There's only one major plot hole, which no one is going to care about unless they're a troll. Each of the scenes match up, there's no major clashes in the story, and it's actually pretty good. I'm sure there's some things people will nitpick at (yes, I have seen CinemaSins), but nothing too major. I could go on and on, but I'll sum it up here. All in all, this is a great film, despite the unnecessary hatred for it. The CGI is incredible, the storyline is pretty much solid, the acting is believable, and there isn't the ridiculous comedy that was found in ROTF. A much darker, thrilling film that's based on a toy lineup. Doesn't require intricate thought, but is still very good, nonetheless.On a final note, may I remind everyone that this film is intended for guys. GUYS. What does a guy film need? Explosions, action and hot female leads. This film has all that. This is a fun, dark action film that is definitely geared towards the male audience. Suck it up, quit hating and enjoy this epic masterpiece. Plus, it's doesn't feel 'cheap' like some action films (I'm looking at you, Die Hard 5...). It feels... Epic. Literally.One final, final note to wrap this up— the score for this film is absolutely incredible. Very well done and really epic. Major, major props to Steve Jablonsky. He really captured the scale of this movie. (Yeah, scale. Giant robots, epic score— large runtime. It's about the scale).That's about it. 8/10.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

It just didn't have that same appeal and just never felt like it was properly being ""Transformers"".And I guess that having Shia LaBeuof in the lead was the deal breaker for me. That actor just doesn't bring anything good with him and he is annoying in his acting, just to be blunt. So he wasn't helping sell the movie adaptations to me. However, the amazing voice cast for the Autobots and Decepticons, now that was impressive. And especially since many voices from the 1980's series are back, that was just downright awesome.As with all Michael Bay movies, this was a continuous explosion. If you enjoy lots of action and explosions, then you will be more than happy with this 2011 movie.Story-wise, well, the movie was good enough for what it was, and it was entertaining enough for what it was. Just don't expect a Shakespearian experience.This is solely a special effects movie.

Made it 1h 30m through somehow. My head is spinning. It felt more like an anxiety attack than a movie. Sort of like ""The Other Guys"". Just bizarre moment after bizarre moment. Felt more like 6 or 7 hours of dialogue crammed into a very dizzying, very uncomfortable experience. Where do I start? The comedy failed. The action was pointless. The girl? Who cares. All I remember was something crashing on the moon and there being a government cover-up. Can't put into words how stupefied I was after viewing this crap. I watched the first Transformers and, I didn't have enough great things to say about it. It was amazing! The only vibe I got while watching Dark Of The Moon was that the directors must have been ingesting large amounts of amphetamine while directing this. I felt like it was one big RUSH to squeeze so much dialogue into 2h 20m of run-time. But for what!? 80% of the script was pointless! Maybe cut out all the completely useless scenes and you wouldn't have this horrendously distracting pacing issue. I spent so much time being dizzy and confused, I didn't really even get a chance to digest what was going on. I literally had to leave, and go to the bathroom and splash water on my face and calm down because the movie had overstimulated me to the point of having an anxiety attack..

Transformers: Dark Of The Moon takes more than a step to finally able to become again another watchable Blockbuster extravaganza after the utterly boring and horrible Revenge Of The Fallen, the movie opens with these amazing real 1969 moon landing sequence with the twist of the Cybertronian has a classified part in the mission, that i think despite the fiction part Michael Bay should do a movie about it because he executed very well, and after that we're back on the track with Sam Witwicky played again betterly by Shia LaBeouf and his new chick which i think not only she is pretty and hot, she can also act better than Megan Fox, and this whole new story up from the beginning until before the last 15 minutes build up for the last battle was better than the first Transformers and i really enjoyed it and i really really like it, after that it dragged down a bit until the long final battle sequence which i still think a bit too long but the most important thing is it's not bad or super boring like the previous one, it has it's exciting and impressive moments in it and i still enjoyed it for the most part, the special and visual effects are incredible, Transformers: Dark Of The Moon has an enjoyable good story for the most part, a better performance, but a bit too long last final battle, and story dragged a bit near the end but overall it's still pretty good and i still like it, oh, and there is so much less cheesy moments in this one too which is good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What's new in this film was the lack of chemistry between the lead actors. Michael Bay simply got lucky with the first Transformers. I didn't like any of his previous work until that one.

But this time around it wasn't that bad in my opinion. Now I can see why professional reviewer or critics gave this movie a negative review, I guess they just had to. The story is just so cliché and predictable and there is almost no character development in this. Saying this movie is better than the second installment isn't saying much, since that one was pretty much garbage besides the special effects and action. But this time there is much better set pieces and it has the most action from the three movies in this franchise and the action sequences are more well done and more fun to watch. However the constant explosions gets a bit tiresome after a while, explosions and a lot of actions is what this film is known for with robots beating the crap out of each other. But after a while with things constantly blowing up and stuff flying around everywhere for a long period of time it gets tiresome. But didn't get super irritating because of it and was worth sitting through those sequences. The build up is however crappy and so is the climax, there is one twist I didn't see coming but overall everything was so damn cliché and predictable. With the humans on the brink of destruction there was no tension and there was no parts that was actually gripping. You will not care who dies or lives when it comes to the humans or which robots get destroyed for the most part. Also Shia again taking on the main role as sam again got irritating after a while cause all he does most of the way through in the story is constantly whine about his life and how he can't get a job. One of my co-worker was like this and it was a real pain to work with him and didn't want to see the same crap on the big screen, ironically he is a big fan of this franchise and Linkin Park. Unlike the 2nd installment however things stayed consistent for the most part and didn't go all over the place in negative manner, which is a plus. I didn't really like the new girl taking the place of Megan Fox, not that I was a big fan of Megan Fox but she was better than the girl that took her role in this. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is shot in a very sexual way but didn't leave a impact or made the movie better, the audience for the most part didn't seem to care how her assets were expose a bunch of time on screen. Except the annoying 14 yr old kid that was sitting on the next seat in theater that seemed to go bonkers over it and constantly made stupid remarks or talked on his phone. Micheal Bay must have a big grudge against Megan Fox cause here character gets insulted multiple times in this movie. Anyways overall this was a good summer flick that has some entertaining action sequences, the war between the Autobots and Decepticons at the end was satisfying and felt it was worth the price of admission this time around. Oh and Optimus Prime is a badass robot in this as well.7.4/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie starts off rather interesting with Sam's new love interest, Carly(Rosie Huntington-Whitely) and I must say that she is a big improvement from Megan Fox, she brings sex appeal and class to her character which I love! Back to the movie... The plot revolves around an ark that crashed on the moon and Apollo 11 being used as a cover to investigate it however the deceptagons want to use it to bring Cybertron to earth and make it their home, and the auto bots must stop them. I will commend Spielberg and Bay on their great work on the effects and use of 3D, it was really a good action flick however, to me, that is all the movie ended up being. For 2 and a half hours I sat there knowing what would come next and instead of feeling sympathy for some characters I found myself waiting for this movie to be over. The script was OK, I think it could have used some more dialogue and the fades annoyed me. Good acting, good plot, great effects but not enough depth to hold you into wanting to see how it ends but rather dragging it out and having certain parts predictable.

Who ever wrote the screenplay for this was an idiot. whilst i know it was an action film i at least expect the story and characters to be focused on as an important part of the film but it was all about the action scenes which were a little confusing to watch at best.I gave this a 3 as some effort went into the action scenes even if they could have been better, When i left the cinema i initially thought of this movie as a 1 star!!!!","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Let me first say after i watched the second one I really was not going to waste my time with this one. Though it was in 3d so i decided to check it out.This movie is a lot like the second one. About an hour of story line(if you could call that a story) then about and hour and a half of explosions and CGI.Now if you watch movies and take them in at face value and all your looking for is explosions and CGI then by all means this may be your favorite film. As for any true film lovers like myself though if you enjoy story line, solid acting, good script and direction then this movie is probably not for you.This is dirceted by Michael bay which of course means he is going to pump exsplosions and CGI whenever he can. And hell why not he makes hundreds of millions off these movies.Overall though if you are looking for a good movie you can skip this one. If you are bored and like just watching explosions and and incredible CGI then go ahead. Better then the second one not as good as the first. 5/10","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I consider myself a movie fan, I'm 30, I am not a fan of Transformers franchise, I didn't watch cartoons, read some comics as a kid, had one toy. Now. I saw it yesterday in IMAX, and wanted to sum up my experience in few bulletpoints considering how horrified I was with all the hate here. Not a fan of Bay too (I love The Rock though), but I like his films as I like to go to a theme park or a zoo - simple entartainment. 1. 3d was excellent. It was used for pure fun and joy of the viewer and not just to throw axes and shoot bullets into your eyes. Also I liked the brightness, and as a side note my eyes hurt much less than say on Avatar, and movie is almost 160 mins long. 2. F@ck the cardboard characters, I did not expect much and was there only for pure brainless kaboom action, which I got. The human baddie was weak though, and I still have no idea what Malkovich was doing there. 3. The girl. I see many of you demand Hellen Miren or Meryl Streep acting qualities from a chick in a Bay movie. I expect MY girl to be smart, intelligent and pretty, but in Bay movie she can be brainless idiot and seriously I do not care - so why so much whining? Don't understand. 4. The design. I see people bitch1n on the robots' design. What the f@ck where you expecting? Megatron transforming into giant gun? In my opinion, seeing how lazy production designers happen to be nowadays (see Skyline, or Green Lantern) the overall look of robots' devices, ships was t1ts. 5. Unlikable main protagonist. Wait... what? He was a pure everyman - b1tchy, frustrated and tired of how the world is constructed, looking for a job being pressed by parents and having issues in his relationship with a girl. I do not see any difference between him and guy posting rant SaM WUZ soooo 1RRRR1TAT1ING ZOMG WHAT A F@G GOT. 6. CGI. The composition was far superior to Avatar, I have not noticed any ""low-res"" textures that people complain about. I saw every dollar spent on this movie on the screen. Few scenes were done with so much taste that I was really proud of Bay (re: scene introducing Megatron, and dialog between Sentinel and Optimus about the latter being now the mentor since he's been on Earth long). The squirrel people jumping off the burning plane gave me goosebumps and that was what I expected from this ride (because I do not consider it a serious movie.) Now. Having addressed these few issues I would also like to add I really loved the one sweet moment - in the highway chase scene there was a significant zoom on the rear view mirror of the car with standard OBJECTS IN A REARVEIW MIRROR MAY APPEAR CLOSER THAN THEY ARE text being shown with blurred bots in the background. Well it was a song by Meat Loaf for which Bay made a cool video and I truly loved this little trivia. Closing my wall of text - and I know a lot shall not even bother to read it - I quietly ask you guys: do not overanalyze this. It's fun summer action flick, more of an experience than a film, a mixtape of cool action clishes for a tweleve year old in every one of us. Much better than the second one, and maybe even the first - but hey! stop analyzing! Cheer up and stop hating, life is better without hate isn't it? PS. Buzz Aldrin scene was so touching and directed with great taste. Brilliant.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't know about everyone else, but I LOVED the first two. Watching the third one once again I appreciate it MORE then I did the FIRST time I watched it. But, this is because I understand it a LITTLE bit more watching ti the second time.I find this third installment extremely hard to keep up with. I take my eyes of the screen for 1 minute and suddenly they (the main characters) are no longer where they were and are some how in danger or out of danger. This movie feels like they tried to jam a whole lot of information in one movie, they mention one idea, and that's it. They mention it ONCE, and so you are left behind thinking ""What, explain again?"". I still don't even know what the hell they were all fighting about. Something about something. It feels like it should have been TWO MOVIES, but then you think ""NOPE, I will not watch this thing stall out into bullshit"". There are however some EPIC scenes. These scenes just keep you glued to the screen, even though you have no idea what is going on, and you're still wondering why everyone is fighting for, these scenes MAKE the movie.Another great aspect are once again the creative and new designs of Aliens, weapons and gadgets. As one said in the film (no spoiler, just a quote) ""Why do all the Decepticons get all the good stuff?"" very true. It is extremely fun to see all these new unique Auto-bots, they are characters you just love. As a fan it is hard to get attached to this new girl... I can see they try to enforce their love (I'm not into Romances, but!) BUT they get it right. Although it would have been nice for a change of personality, maybe a girl with a different body type, something different. But, it worked. I did miss seeing Mikaela (Megan Fox) I just loved her in the last two. There isn't much comedy relief, and if there is you simply don't understand it as much because you really understand the plot. But it has its moments.I GAVE THIS FILM A SIX (perhaps 6 and a half if I could). The first two were worthy of a 7-8. But this one lacked almost everyone that was good about the first two. It JUST CONTINUED ON AND ON. You get to the point where you think ""Omg just finish already, get to the point"". It was a drag. BUT it DOES have its MOMENTS. In every 'Transformers' film Sam has a problem. Number 1 was getting a girlfriend. Number 2 was saying 'I love you' and number 3 is getting a job. At least they kept that idea going. Good film. Unfortunately the writers rushed it a bit.Also, how do they procreate? I understand they're Robots... but they could clarify how they get the solid mental to change into them. PERHAPS in the future they will make a WHOLE FILM about the Auto-bots and Decepticons. No humans, just these two rivals battling on unknown planets. That's always fun.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Take any critically acclaimed film and see what the return ratio is and then think ""maybe these guys have got their criteria wrong"" because their industry is still called the ""entertainment industry"" and not the ""social commentary industry"" or the ""change the world industry"" (that's US politics) or even the ""I'm so far up my own backside that I think I can make a film about any old tripe and call it Art and people will buy it industry"".

It was decent. All the talk about how amazing the final hour was, it didn't live up to my expectations. There were flashes of brilliance here and there, but it didn't really elevate the whole action sequence.Story-wise, it is as bad as the previous two movies. Things just happen in the nick of time, coincidences drive the plot, etc. But this time, there are a few twists to make it slightly more interesting.Comedy-wise, some parts were damn right funny as hell. The jokes that involve robots didn't work, but the wackiness of the new human characters adds to the funny bits. Alan Tudyk is easily the funniest of the bunch.The action bits featured in the trailer are actually most of the highlights of the action in the movie. Due to the use of 3D cameras in filming the movie, the fast cuts and camera shake that were prevalent in the first two movies are gone. The action is much more discernible. Overall, it is more of the same. If you give this movie a miss, you're not missing much.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I definitely think that this film has the most dynamic effect feeling, and watching these in 3d glasses would make to get deeply into this film and feel it so bad.

Once the film came out though, I couldn't wait to see it. The cartoon I grew up watching, was now a real live action movie and there I sat in awe. I recall watching the first time Bumblebee transformed and getting chills at the sight and sound. Once Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was released, I was terribly disappointed. Instead of a worthy follow-up to an enjoyable first movie, what was delivered was an insulting piece of garbage, but that's a review for another day. It was inevitable that a 3rd movie was going to be produced, I was simply hopeful for major improvements being implemented to move the franchise forward. I'm happy to say that my hopes for the movie were far exceeded. The script far exceed that of the first two films; the action was again on a grand scale and the acting.well, it was OK. It's difficult for real-life actors and actresses not to be overshadowed by the sheer awesomeness of the Transformers. Michael Bay has made amends with me, whether he wanted to or not.Director Michael Bay has shown that he loves devastation, often times excessively; i.e. Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor. The one thing about Bay's movies though, is that they never lack excitement and entertainment. Transformers: Dark of the Moon meets the required criteria, with non-stop action and massive destruction from start to finish. Shia LeBeouf's Sam Witwicky is once again thrust into the middle of the war between Autobots and Decepticons. I've enjoyed LeBeouf's portrayal of Sam throughout all three movies. In Transformers: Dark of the Moon, he plays the role with humor, such as his interactions with his parents and while interviewing for a much needed job; and he plays the role with a convincing intensity, which is necessary in action movie of this magnitude. Bay added big name talent to the roster this time around: John Malkovich, always a pleasure to watch, in a small but humorous role as Sam's boss; the talented Frances McDormand; Patrick Demsey; and the hilarious Ken Jeong, who continues a strong run of supporting roles. Reprising their roles for a third time are Josh Duhamel, Tyreese Gibson and the highly amusing John Turturro.Without a doubt, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a HUGE improvement over Revenge of the Fallen. There's a lot to love about the effects, and even the storyline.yes, it has a solid storyline, which revolves around the race to land on the moon in the 60s. I think it's a safe bet that the Transformers are here to stay and that more movies will be coming. Hopefully, should Bay decide against returning as rumored, that the studio replaces him with someone capable of continuing to move the series in the direction he just left it....pointed towards the stars and the planet Cybertron.Oscar worthiness: Special effects and Sound Summer movie Grade: B (my son, who is 7.5 gave it an A+) Age appropriate meter: 10+ (some excessive language, A LOT of violence, one sexual situation in the very beginning, some scenes may be deemed too scary for younger children)visit our site at www.twodudereview.com","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Special Effects, The 3D Impact, The Direction, are awe-inspiring. However, as a film, though better than the 2nd part, This action-packed saga still falls short, in comparison to it's first masterstroke! However, the devotees of the franchise, won't be disappointed.'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is the same thing again. Human vs Machines, The Good versus The Bad. It's old wine, that comes intact with, as mentioned before, stunning Special Effects, good 3D & Effective Direction, working on it's advantage.Writer Ehren Kruger, should have worked on the film more. Though not at all boring, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is very long & slightly dragged. The climax, which runs for nearly 40-minutes, is visually captivating, but as a whole of a screenplay, is lazy and takes advantage of the top-notch technology it's blessed to have.Michael Bay Cinema is different. It's Escapist, Ambitious & Explosive. I have liked him as a storyteller, and even though the writing material isn't as sharp as expected, Bay still manages to do his job effectively. Cinematography is good. Editing is average. Art Design is nice.Performance-Wise: Shia LaBeouf continues to impress, in a role, that he plays for the third time. Rosie looks good and does fairly well. John Turturro & Frances McDormand are first-rate. Turturro, is sure bring the house down with his witty dialogue delivery, that is truly funny. Josh Duhamel is decent. Tyrese Gibson gets limited scope. Patrick Dempsey plays the bad guy ably. Kevin Dunn is sweet. John Malkovich is wasted.On the whole, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is meant for Transformers Fanatics, mainly.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

But here we are, it was a fun brainless ride and I really like it, mister Bay finally was able to create actions sequences that wasn't just scraps metals shaking on the screen. By making the Autobots in brighter colours the fight scene now make sense and are quite enjoyable, two or three time i just had to turn toward my girlfriend and exclaim, ''whoa! I just understand what happened!'' But it leave me a bit bitter.It took me time to figure out what was so wrong with dark side of the moon (and the trilogy in general) and here goes, I wont rehash what have been said a thousand time about the bad script and mindless explosion, no, I will just say that Micheal Bay don't understand is source material but more importantly he got a lousy moral compass. We have a movie where heroes (yes, the heroes) MUTILATE, DISMEMBER, EXECUTE and are hellbent on GENOCIDE and the list goes on, the malaise begin when Optimus put a bullet in the head of a random Decepticon in the second movie like it was nothing.And that, beyond anything else show that Bay doesn't care, its okay for the heroic character to dismember opponent for fun, for Optimus to kill brutally is mentor and none of them seem to raise and eyebrow when their home(cybertron, who look like a huge, ugly, planetoid, hive) got seemingly destroyed, because they are NOT characters, they are NOT heroic sentient machine, they are special effect pure and simple. I wouldn't mind if the movie was called Marines VS Machines or something, but hey its the Transformers where talking about here.So it was okay,in a dumb and fun kind of way, buts its time to move on, lets someone with real audacity and imagination take a shot, awesome thing could be done with that property other then selling Bud light and GM truck.Oh and as far as pointless insertion of useless token babe goes, Megan Fox was better, at least she as some real acting skill.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

They'd really have hated the over priced easy to break Transformer toy-line.The story line was over the top. The evil corporation making deals with deceptions with everything the antagonists bring transformerdy, toasters , Televidions etc.Opening with the wise ass Transformer ""This is the one where Spock goes crazy and the Battle of Chicago was way to drawn out...and making it cheesier with lines like ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" really?Disney has that warning..but on an OLED quality 55-72' set the robot fight scenes can be overwhelming on the senses.The films may have been accepted or reviewed better had they been cut down to 130 minutes max plus credits..But if something can rake in over a billion on a 250 million budget before BLU-Ray and merchandising it will be made.Like anything else movies especially in this genre aren't made to win Oscars but to bring in big bucks.In terms of sequel overkill.... I find Starwars to be more embarrassing as mentioned. The prequels were a nightmare, and JJ plagiarized the first three...Ray is the Emperors Grandaughter...Luke is Vader's son. Mark Hamill was young and mopey now old and grouchy. A Death Star and Star base 1 at least they didn't make a second star base just Imperial Cruiser planet killers. Embarrassing.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The acting was spot on. The robots were amazing. The music was top notch. Rosie was hot. g g g As a huge fan of the Transformers animated series, I was disappointed with first Transformers film. I didn't really like the look of the Autobots and thought it was a little annoying. When I saw Transformers 2, which is a HUGE mess of a film, I was really angry. I vowed never to see a Transformers film ever again. But when the trailer of Transformers 3 came out, I actually got a little interested. I mean the special effects were pretty much great as usual. But this time, it seemed they took off the annoying little robots and that annoying mother and replaced them with good old fashioned action.When I went to an advanced screening yesterday, I still came in with relatively low expectations. I have to say, that Transformers 3 is an overall improvement from its predecessor, Transformers 2. The film was pretty much at level with the first film, though. The action scenes were highly extravagant and at times, pretty epic. The movie had a lot less lame scenes, which is always a plus. The acting though, has not improved at all though. Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was not unbearable, but she's certainly not a good actress, but a mediocre one, at the same level with Megan Fox. Although Megan Fox is definitely hotter. As usual though, the story was unremarkable and extremely abysmal at times, but not as horrible as the first film though.Overall I rate Transformers 3, an 8/10. Don't go in expecting a Best Picture winner/nominee. With the right amount of expectations, you will probably be fulfilled. A definite improvement over Revenge of the Fallen, which doesn't say much. But at the end, the great special effects and extremely extravagant action scenes more than make up its flaws. A summer flick that rises above the usual, noisy summer blockbuster films. I definitely recommend this film if you overall liked the franchise.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

Yes the parts involving the robots were visually amazing but I wanted more, I left the cinema bored and unsatisfied. I felt the story line could have been improved and I have to say that I preferred the first two with Megan Fox, did they really have to add another girl purely for looks? I rated this movie 5 as I do love the Transformers films and the effects but I was hoping for something a little bit more I guess. I think if they do a fourth instalment they should restart with a whole new cast as taking out one of the main characters was strange to the dynamics of the film, however involving totally new people and focusing on the Transformers would definitely have improved this movie for me!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But hell, a little wouldn't have been too much to ask. I know I know, it's Michael Bay at his ocular raping best, but something is missing here. Something big. I think Sucker Punch proved, you can't just through a tonne of money and special effects at a turd and hope it will polish itself. And this is no exception. Don't get me wrong, it's a major improvement on Revenge of the Fallen, but not quite up to the standard of the first. What has happened here (in MY opinion folks. Don't get upset. You're all entitled to one, and have one (opinions, not assholes)) is, we seem to have lost the need or want to tell a story. The special effects here have spared no expense. The 3D is OK only surpassed by Avatar or Jackass 3D (no, seriously, if you'd seen Jackass 3D, you would know what I'm talking about). I guess you have to tune right out and not try to think about the film so much to rate it 10 out of 10, but when I'm paying hard earned dollars to see something special, I expect something special. This is not special. To be honest, my favorite thing about the whole film was the Green Lantern 3D trailer at the beginning. I guess I had hyped this film up for myself too much and it failed to live up to my own expectations (also my friends who sat next to me complaining about the stupidity of the weak ass story). But I imagine I'm not alone. I think a lot of people have high expectations of big budget blockbusters and want to see something mind numbingly great. But this just didn't do it for me. Why? Because it was just plain stupid. The story had holes you could drive Optimus Prime through (at one point he does). And come on, since when do Robots have free-kin HAIR???? Robots with lips is one thing, but hair? I draw the line people.So see it (at your peril). But please don't expect to be blown away. Maybe expectations of an epileptic seizure (there is a lot going on at one time, flashing lights, explosions, space shuttle disasters and robots with hair) are more appropriate.I can only hope Green Lantern lives up to the trailers expectations.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

I also heard a lot of bad reviews of this film. But having seen it, I have to say the movie was actually pretty decent and I think it's a definite improvement from the last one. In fact it's probably the best of the three. That's not to say it doesn't have its problems, but I did actually find myself entertained by this film and I do appreciate that the filmmakers tried to make improvements based on everyone's complaints about the last film.IMPROVEMENTS - Annoying characters are mostly dialed back and removed, and stereotypes are dialed back. That's not to say there aren't stereotypes, but the stereotypes this time around didn't totally offend or annoy me to the point where I couldn't enjoy the film. Skids and Mudflap are gone with no explanation (they needed to be removed from existence), the parents aren't in it as much, and John Turturro is far less annoying. The story makes more sense (at least for a popcorn fun blockbuster) and I'm able to understand what's going on without getting totally annoyed. There are no robot balls, and there is no close-up of John Turturro in his underpants (there is a close-up of Ken Jeong in his underpants, but it's played up for a shock humor joke which actually made me laugh for the big payoff so I can't complain. Others might find it offensive, though). Oh, and there is far less dog and robot humping all around.OTHER POSITIVES - Obviously the action and special effects. Definite props to the animators, the cinematographers, the stunt coordinators, and the special effects guys because they did an amazing job. Again. Plus I'm actually able to tell which robots are fighting in this movie, which is good. The jokes are a bit funnier this time around (not all big laughs, and not all tasteful, but definitely more hits than the last movie). There is better (not great) but better character development and I didn't totally loathe anyone. The pacing, the editing, and the music were also all very good. The elements I enjoyed all contributed to the story and added to my enjoyment of the film. The villains are also much more threatening because they have a definite goal and you see more of the damage they can cause (although the foaming at the mouth was over the top).NEGATIVES - There are a lot of unnecessary cameos and characters in the film who pop in and leave. For example, I'm not sure why John Malkovich is in this because he doesn't really do anything. He just comes in, acts weird, and leaves. They introduce him like he's an important character and then he's dismissed about halfway through. Kim Jeong will be annoying and offensive to some people, but he didn't annoy me so I really only mention this for the benefit of others. Bill O'Reilly and Buzz Aldrin make unnecessary and distracting cameos. And I love Leonard Nimoy, I think he had a good voice role in this film, and I love Star Trek and Spock, but the Spock love was totally distracting. They mention Spock a lot, show a scene from ""Amok Time,"" make references to the Enterprise, and even have Leonard quote a famous ""Wrath of Khan"" line. It's really very distracting. There are a ton of distracting ad placements in the movie (which, you should really expect if you go to see any Michael Bay film because they pay for the effects). Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a very sexualized, very stereotypical, very useless damsel in distress who may be offensive to some people (as one of only 2 major female characters in the movie). There are also still very noticeable plot and logic errors, despite the improvements, and some scenes that don't quite fit right.But, in spite of my problems with it, it did entertain me and I did enjoy it. It's about on the same level as ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" or ""Twister"" and any problems I had are made up for by the improvements and positives. 7/10 - Some problems, but overall enjoyable popcorn fun. Recommended for people who just want to watch a robots and stuff blowing up movie without worrying too much about plot or characters.3DI don't like 3D anyway, but I saw this with a friend in 3D, and I do have to admit that the 3D was better than the last film I saw in 3D (""Tron Legacy""). It's not totally dark, and it didn't make me sick looking at it. However, the graphics popping out are still distracting, and I can't focus on some of the animation detail due to the blurring effect of some of the 3D graphics. If you go to see this I recommend 2D just to get the full details of the animations.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, and I'm really shocked to say this, I actually enjoyed Dark of The Moon. Sure it's no masterpiece by any means, but what do you expect from a director whose only talent is making things blow up minus character development, plot, and dialog.Dark Of the Moon really is the best film in the series, surpassing ROTF by many a long shot. It's story is better than the first two films, though that's not saying a lot when Bay for no apparent reason at all, inserts random shots of sexual innuendo that really serves no purpose at all in the film and scenes that are totally unnecessary; particularly the antique car and bathroom scene. But the battle scenes between the robots is really impressive and I'm shocked to admit that I was on the edge of my seat watching it all.But still, some characters are seriously overlooked; especially the villains Megatron, Starscream, and Shockwave. Sentinel Prime, really, was the only one who had the most development out of them all. As better than Revenge of the Fallen may be, Dark of the Moon still suffers from the same problems that 1 and 2 had: No fully fleshed out characters and plot. Dark of The Moon has a plot, but it's really skin deep as far as the twists and turns go and because of the fact alone, the emotional attachment is drained significantly.I will say that Dark of The Moon is better than Revenge of The Fallen, but it's not exactly the game changer of the whole Transformers mythos. And judging by the box-office business it's doing in theaters, it's safe to say that a 4 installment will inevitably be made. Hopefully by then it will have a better director and screenwriter along with better acting and plot.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

You just can't. It has something to do with some Spock-voiced robot crash landing on the moon in the 60s and some teleportation pillars having to do with the end of the world or something, but I digress. It's already giving me a headache. TF3 can be basically seen as an apology from Michael Bay after making the hated TF2. He said it would be 100% better. He lied. Sure, TF3 has a hint of a story this time around, and the film tries really hard to show us this, but it fails miserably. At least TF2 didn't try to have a plot (which is probably due to the fact that the script wasn't even finished when they began shooting the film), and at least it was entertaining.Even removing the two annoying racist twin robots from TF2, TF3 is still worse. Why? Because it's a dull film. It turns out that watching the same thing thrice isn't as interesting as watching it the first two times. It tries to be different, but when you get down to it, it's more of the same, but with one huge difference: Bay decides to save all the action in the last 45 minutes of the film. And seeing how people watch these films for the action, we have to wait about 100 whole minutes to see it. Now this shouldn't be a problem had the film had an interesting story and characters to invest in. Well, it didn't. It's a LOOOONG 100 minutes of unfunny jokes and non-existent, incoherent storytelling. Seriously, Bay could have easily cut 30 minutes off the film, but you know how he is. His films just have to be over two hours, don't they?But anyway, once we finally get to see the action, it's actually quite impressive. With the addition of 3D, it's pretty damn amazing. And because of the Chicago sequence alone, TF3 isn't a total lost cause. We eventually do get what we came for. As for the 3D, I liked the use of it. It was shot in 3D instead of converted into 3D during postproduction, so you really get to see the depth and stuff popping out during the entire film, especially during the Chicago sequence where you see the depth of the city and people flying around (among many other things).The actors in here are efficient. It's not like they actually have to act. They just run and yell. Newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Megan Fox's replacement, is pretty decent too, although it's easy to imagine that Fox could have done the same. Veteran actors John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and Leonard Nimoy give a response of pity rather than a warm welcome as we much prefer them not have their resumes tainted by this film. But anyway, they are in the film for good, and there's not much we can do about it. Ken Jeong is pretty annoying but (thankfully) does not appear in the film any more than 5 minutes. Alan Tudyk--why? Why are you in this? You're better than this!Anyway, I'll get off my soap box now. Of the 157 minutes(!!) TF3 has, about 45 minutes are actually fun to watch. The other minutes....aren't. I mean, it's a Transformers movie. It's the third one in the series. You know what to expect. By this time, you already know if this is for you or not. If it is, watch it in 3D. Or maybe don't, just so they don't make a fourth film. I'd imagine people will get tired of Transformers soon enough (like me) as the case of sequelitis becomes increasingly apparent.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

Another Transformers movie and another round of critics bashing it harder than a decepticon hitting an autobot picnic.First let me preface things by saying, when do all movies being made lately have to be compared to The Dark Knight or be reviewed as if its the next academy award winning film. Whatever happened to just simply going to the movies and enjoying yourself.Transformers Dark of the Moon fits nicely into the ""go and enjoy yourself"" variety. ** Potential Spoilers ** I really enjoyed this installment of the Transformers franchise. The special effects are as always excellent. As opposed to Revenge of the Fallen there's actually a story to this movie. It appears that the space-race was inspired by a crashed Autobot shuttle that was fleeing Cybertron during the war. The US got to it first and learned what they could from it and salvaging some items that become integral to the story later on. Sam this time around is out of college and out of work. There's some mildly amusing and awkward interview moments (we've all been there) and he finally lands a job in a mail-room. This is when the story kicks in. It seems Megatron and the Decepticons have been working with humans behind the scenes for a while and now they are looking to terminate some of those relationships. Sam is confronted with the information about the crashed Autobot shuttle and NASA cover-up. And he goes to the dismissive head of national security. The Autobots hear of the news and hear to the moon to recover Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) and he tells why he was fleeing Cybetron. Then the action begins with some excellent chase scenes on the highway. Great battle sequences and an unexpected betrayal. Thus resulting in the invasion of the US and some mass destruction. Parents be warned the Decepticons actually vaporize innocent by-standers on screen and it may be a bit harsh for little ones. The new Autobots were enjoyable. Loved the Wreckers and they provided some great moments on screen. And the final fight between Megatron and Optimus was very satisfying. This was a great way to end the current story and leaves things open enough for future movies. It seems like most of the negative reviews have focused on the fact that A) They hate Michael Bay. B) Megan Fox isn't in it. and C) The story sucked. Well I for one thought the story was as good as the first movie. I like the action sequences Bay films and although I find Megan Fox pleasing to the eyes I really didn't miss her at all. I don't expect great acting from these types of movies.

He has partly succeeded. Dark of the Moon still features many of the flaws present in Fallen – lame jokes (especially from Sam's parents), preposterous plot holes, inaudible dialogue from the robots and woeful acting by the love interest, this time Victoria Secrets model Rosie Huntington-Whitely as Megan Fox's replacement – but it improves on one, arguably the most significant, element: the action. Where last time out you couldn't see what the hell was going on, this time around the robotic fighting (rendered in mind-bogglingly good CGI – the best of the franchise) is clear as day and possesses some tremendous slow-mo metallic clobbering. By no means a brilliant movie, even by 'dumb-action' standards, but leave your mind and maturity at the door and you'll be in for an entertaining two and a half hours.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

In the case of Transformers 3, the package has always been non-stop robo-action, and humoured digressions. That's what I kept telling myself going into this film: ""it's just a popcorn movie, so enjoy it for what it is."" Well, I went in, and for part of the movie I was kind of enjoying myself, but as soon as the final hour began, whatever enjoyment I felt disappeared and boredom set in.If you're familiar with the humour of the franchise then you're probably expecting more of the same, and that's what you get: more colourful comic relief, more banter between characters, more awkward moments for Sam Witwicky. Your enjoyment of this is likely dependent on how you enjoyed the previous instalments's humour: if you enjoyed it you'll like this, if you didn't then you probably won't. Personally, I thought this film was funnier than the others, but I still thought it was hit or miss.The actual plot itself has a lot going on, but it's largely there to connect the dots and present opportunities for large scale action. Even the moments of humour, which appear to at least attempt to advance the film's plot in some way, come across more as digressions from the plot as certain characters are given license to chew the scenery. But really, does anyone come to Transformers expecting to be engaged in the plot? Most people come to this movie to see robots fight each other, and that's just what they will get. And yet...I found myself wanting more.I thought I had gotten myself ready prior to my viewing, to enjoy the film as best as I could on its terms, and for a moment I believed I was heading in that direction, but I soon became bored in the final sequence & though I have a few reasons for feeling so, the one that sticks out in my head the most is the fact that not only was I not engaged, but I wasn't even feeling the slightest sense of drama.Out of all 3 Transformers films, Dark of the Moon easily has the most at stake, and there are moments of characters in distress, but it all comes across as superficial. Michael Bay fails to go deeper into the characters and throughout the climax I kept asking myself ""why should I care that 'this' is happening?"", and if I don't care about anything that's happening then why am I watching all these special effects other than to just, well, watch the nice looking effects? To a lot of people out there they are able to view only the eye candy and get enjoyment out of that, but to me, without any real feeling behind anything that's happening, the climax became meaningless.Dark of the Moon is indeed a popcorn film, and if you go in looking for a lot of action and humour then you may come out pleased, but for me the lack of any real drama hindered the conflict a great deal and left me feeling cold and bored.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

This one sees the plot revolving around Earth's manned mission to the moon in the 60s (which incorporates some good use of archive footage). The real reason behind the mission is in fact a cover up for an ""incident"" which the world was in the dark over. An Autobot spaceship which crash landed on the surface on the moon, millions of years ago.With the intriguing premise, the film unfortunately starts to flag. As we head back to the drama's of Sam (Shia Labeouf) Witwicky life. Set a couple of years of the 2nd film. Sam is struggling to find a job whilst his Autobot companions are out on secret missions maintain peace and order with their human allies. It isn't too long before the Decepticons make an appearance and are back to their old tricks again. We learn that within the crashed spaceship (the Ark) contains special pillars that could help the Autobots once and for all to conquer the Decepticons and win the war....but in the wrong hands they could also lead to the destruction of the planet Earth.To summarise the plot in such way makes the film so interesting and exciting but it is far from it. The total lack of serious/normal characters in the film jars the brooding menace. Every supporting character is a bit weird (John Malkovich's- Bruce Bezo) or over hyperactive (Ken Jeong's-Jerry Wang). It sometimes feels like there are two films competing here. One a wacky and (un)funny comedy drama whilst the other, an explosive and eye popping special effects laden action film. I am at a loss as to why there was any need for such a need to try to use stock footage of real events for it to only throw us such infantile humour. After the absolute slating that the 2nd film received you would have thought that Bay would have learnt his lesson, but far from it. Racial stereotypes are still ever present and it seems like any ethnic minority is portray in very unpolitical correct way. A Scottish sounding Autobot is heard to say ""I'll bottle ya"" The humour is also not at all funny. If you do laugh, you'd be laughing at the absolute dire dialogue written for the film. I had high hopes for this film and my hopes soon turned to anger and dismay.The other problem with the film is the pacing of the whole thing. It takes an absolute age for anything exciting to happen. When you come to see a film like this you'd expect robots to be smashing other robots, buildings or any other inanimate object. What you get is a limp attempt at humour and character development. Enough about the negatives you say, what about the positives? Well the action scenes are extremely well handled. If you watch in 3D then your eyes will be in for a treat. Bays trademark of slo-mo is in full effect and there is so much happening at one time you could get lost in which Transformer is which. With the carnage and mayhem, you're going to be in safe hands with Bay. The 3D is also implement in such dazzling array and the action packed set pieces are done with aplomb.I just wish he would try to leave school boy humour and offence pokes at other races alone. Apart from that I just about found the film tolerable. A complete mess with a tone which shifts from one extreme to another and just doesn't sit well. I now know why Megan Fox jumped ship and left this awful mess of a film. A sad waste of money, time and effort. I want my money back.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was the fastest two and a half hours I've ever experienced.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451078/?ref_=tt_urv","carlkevad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24341212/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2011","Let me start off by just saying that ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is much more better than its predecessor.I'm not what you'd exactly call a fan of the Michael Bay-directed Transformers film series. I didn't particularly like the first film with it's excess of cheese and CGI. I hated ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" which was even with it's action sequences less interesting than watching paint dry in a dark room. It was muddled, and after 30 minutes of watching the movie, I started to begin to have chronic headaches. Luckily though, Michael Bay has picked up the pieces, and directed the awesome ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon.""I'm not gonna bother writing a detailed plot description, since it doesn't really matter a lot, but the film is practically the following Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has to once again save the world from total destruction. He once again needs to help his Autobot friends. He once again has the hot girlfriend, this time a new one, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, who's replaced Megan Fox. She is what Megan Fox was, hot and not getting too much dialog. She's effective at what she is supposed to do.Thankfully, there's less and more humorous humor here. Coen-favorites John Turturro and Frances McDormand star alongside John Malkovich to provide us with subtle humor. Turturro's character, the retired agent Seymour Simmons, who tried to laugh us in the previous films, actually succeeds here. From it's cast to the amazing special effects put to display here, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a carefully made action picture. It succeeds as one on every level.That said, there are still mistakes in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" The plot is too complicated for the adolescent 12-year-olds it's mainly made for, and it drags quite a lot in act two, but ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was the fastest two and a half hours I've ever experienced. I mean that in the best possible way.There's a huge cast in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Frances McDormand, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Hugo Weaving, Kevin Dunn, Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and even Patrick Dempsey as Whiteley's boss.Bay is known for directing bad movies with great action sequences. He doesn't create a good movie here, but he creates a movie that's action sequences are so good, that we don't really care about anything else. He's obviously done a lot of work here. Remember all you haters, Michael Bay doesn't write the dialogs of his movies. Ehren Kruger does that in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" and I give Bay extra credit of making the action so good that we forget about Kruger's horrible dialog writing.Apart from the action sequences, the 3D is amazing here. It's as good as I've seen in a long while. In fact, I believe that the only movies with good 3D I've ever seen are ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Tron: Legacy."" I didn't see ""Avatar"" in 3D. The second act dragged a bit, but the engrossing act one and the frantic act three with the epic destruction of Chicago in amazing 3D, more than make up for act two's mistakes.He said it himself, Michael Bay wants to ""entertain the summer audience"". He will with ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" which is the best film I've ever seen that he directed. This isn't a great movie, but it's wildly entertaining. It's got the explosions, it's got the frantic action, it's got the Victoria's Secret model, it's got robots beating the **** out of other robots, and it's got the amazing third act of total destruction. What more could you ask from a summer action flick?Rating: ★★★ (7/10)","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

As a fan of the cartoon, I was excited to see it brought to life on the big screen. And seeing it was quite an event. I got the chance to see an early screening of it at Anime Expo in 2007 with about 3000 excited geeks and nerds. So, you can imagine, it was a lot of fun. Sadly, the energy in this series is not the same. Gone is the excitement carried by the discovery of CGI- fueled Transformers. Gone is the thrill of seeing Optimus for the first time or hearing the line Autobots, Roll Out. Without that thrill, one thing becomes glaringly obvious: the series just isn't that exciting any more.Don't get me wrong, this is not necessarily a terrible film. Good, well, that's debatable. The action is still very well done and Michael Bay is still probably the best choice of a director to do a Transformers film. He makes the action look great, and it certainly is great here. But, one could argue that this is the same film as the first, and that was probably done on purpose. We're made aware of some dark secret, reintroduced to Sam Whitwicky in his current life, and then things go wrong. And yes, it all ends in a spectacular battle in which an entire city becomes the battleground. What is highly noticeable is how long the film is. It drags in the middle and by the end, you are starting to notice that the film is really long. And it is, at 2.5 hours. There is certainly some entertainment value to be had. The action is spectacular, to use that word twice. The CGI effects are phenomenal, as they have continued to be for the series and the Transformers are as enjoyable as ever. Sam and Bumblebee's relationship is specifically enjoyable, as it was in the first film. Despite what many will say, Bay does have a certain way of pulling out even the tiniest bit of emotion from his films, and he succeeds here on the smallest scale. Certainly it's not a film to will find a deep connection with, but there's one there. But, as I stated, this is essentially the first film, minus the excitement of discovering the Transformers for the first time. So, if you enjoy these films as a sort of reunion with old friends, then you will like this one. While the second film was certainly a disaster, this is much better, with a simpler plot, decipherable action, and even a decent story. I, however, was fairly bored. There's some sprinkling of humor and decent action, but again, the film dragged quite a bit. Maybe I was just a bit tired when I saw it, but one thing a Transformers film shouldn't be is boring, and sadly, this one was. What I say to you is see it if you want some decent summer action. But if the idea of another Transformers film already has you rolling your eyes and yawning, I say skip it. You probably won't change your mind.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Setting the standard higher than any that has gone before. Such a film has the ability to unite people in a common purpose, no matter what walk of life they come from, enabling young and old, rich and poor, to put aside personal differences and agree together on one a common opinion...disgust! It's not that Transformers 3:Dark of the Moon is just bad - that, this trilogy will be long remembered for. Instead, Micheal Bay has upped the ante once more and has created a ""film"" that not only succeeds in being vapid, obnoxious and offensive, but downright boring. The plot that exists is a hotch-potch of half-ideas, beginning in the 1960s with the suggestion that the American space programme and moon landings (via some shocking inter cutting of real footage) were an effort to reach a crashed Autobot vessel (they are the good robots - you can tell because they don't have evil red eyes). This ship carries 'pillars' which have the ability to open portals which allow teleportation. Cue the Decepticon's (red eyes) fiendish plan to bring their home planet of Cybertron to Earth, enslaving mankind in the process.TF3 is a game of two halves.For the first hour exactly nothing happens. Not only does nothing happen, but when it does happen, it is garbled and confusing, with big jumps in continuity and logic. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf - the human hero of the previous two outings) finds himself searching for work while also struggling to come to terms with the fact the Autobots no longer need him. Fortunately for Sam, he has a new girlfriend, possibly the least developed and most insincere relationship ever committed to celluloid, played by super-model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in inimitable Bay style, with minimal charisma and minimal clothing. In Bay's world men are either soldiers or gay, women are either supermodels or Mrs Trunchbull tyrants (with insinuations of lesbianism), and ethnicities serve only to be stereotyped (only black people say ""wak""). All familiar territory for the Transformers world, but Bay truly outdoes himself with some horrendously thoughtless references to 9/11 and Chernobyl. Classy.(NB. This is a 12A rating but due to sexual content, innuendo and swearing - not to mention the regular Hostel-style disembowelling of robots - it should be avoided for younger audiences. .) Played largely, and largely unsuccessfully, for goofy laughs, the first hour feels like a holding pen until the director can unleash his trademark Bayhem in the second half. Surely this will redeem the film, especially in the glory of 3D?! Well, no actually.Devoted to one long fight scene, this should be visceral, mind-blowing, red-hot action. Granted, the CG is effective, robots really do look like they are hitting each other, and a free fall set-piece is very well done. However, despite so much going on (explosions, mecha-crunching fist-fights, lots of running and shouting) there seems to be very little happening. Sure, there is lots of noise and stuff, but it's all so overblown that it's difficult to get a handle on anything, making what should be exciting, well, boring.It appears that Bay does not have an original idea in his head. Decepticon spaceships and technological hardware are a 'who's who' of other alien incarnations. Humans are dispensed of in War of the Worlds dust-clouds, the mother ships are Skyline carbon-copies, and the snake-like droids have been seen ad nauseum attacking The Matrix's Zion. (There is also a horrendous amount of copy-and-paste dialogue. Guess the films: ""I'll never let you go"", ""There can only be one"", ""With great power..."" yadda yadda yadda...). The random splicing of half-finished scenes, breathtakingly poor soundtrack choices, and rapid cuts is entirely disorientating, causing the viewer to slip into a kind of action-induced coma.Having spent so much on CG effects, Bay clearly had no money left for insignificant details like script, story or acting direction. Forget the Blockbuster cliché ""it's just a bit of fun"" - it isn't. It is boring and senseless, leaves a bitter after-taste, and gives the best reason yet to close down Hollywood forever.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

But the main issues are still very visible. One of the largest problems with this movie are the human characters, you can't relate to them and we don't really get to know them at all, as such we don't really care what happens to them, which makes a lot of the scenes where people get hurt or gets close to death rather bad.The awful and very miss-placed comedy is still here, while it is far from as present as it was in the second movie... It's still here. This is a really major issue since there isn't a consistent theme in the movie. For example, a lot of times when suspension is built up in the movie, it's destroyed by miss-placed toilethumour slapstick jokes which immediately breaks the tension. This was a MAJOR issue in the second one but thankfully it's not AS present in this one. Also, most of the human characters are in the movie only to serve as comedy-relief, which usually is fine but there are WAY too many comedy-relief characters in the movie which just gets annoying and breaks the tension. The story is also quite bad and there are a lot of plot holes in the movie, however what annoyed me the most were the same things as in the second movie.A, Unnecessary scenes) Again, there are so many scenes that contribute nothing to the story or the development of the characters, since I can't spoil anything I can't give any good examples of this, but again it's much less than the second movie (which is pretty much just a clusterf**k of unnecessary scenes) but is still very prominent.B, Historical things...) This is something that I personally dislike a lot, while a lot of people probably don't care at all. The movie both ""explains"" what ""really"" happened at two major of events, one of which was a huge disaster most people probably heard of, namely the Chernobly disaster. This almost felt insulting, not only do they want us to accept such a implausible explanation, they expect us not to react on it... I mean, people died in that disaster show some respect for Christ sake. It also references other disasters via imagery.C, The transformers)This is supposed to be a movie about the transformers, and I still don't understand why our main characters are humans and not autobots. The transformers themselves are never really presented in a good way which means you probably won't know who's who. The only characters I could notice were Optimus Prime and Bumble Bee, luckily the autobots are easier to differentiate from the decipticons this time around. As for the decipticons, I really did not have a clue as to who's who.D, The length) This movie is way... WAY too long. The ending part of the movie is almost 50 minutes long and it's just constant action which I found rather boring. I think if they cut around 35% of the movie I might consider giving it a 5.5-6 in score, but at this length it got to the point where I was looking at my watch every 5 minutes to see if it was about to end soon.Conclusion)If you want to see a solid action movie, then this will probably serve you rather well, however do not expect anything from the story and be prepared for poorly placed toilethumour jokes. If you're looking for a ""good"" movie, then you'll have better luck elsewhere, the movie fails to deliver at everything aside from the action.Final score, 3,5.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

Then again if you aren't aware of Micheal Bay's reputation of an all action and special effects based style of direction than you probably don't go to the movies a whole lot. That being said it is in my opinion that this film is nothing short of brilliant. Micheal Bays days of shooting car advertisements have really paid off in these three films and in particular this last installment of the trilogy (Transformers: Dark of the moon). The film lives up to everything I expected, the special effects are amazing, the action is fantastic the Computer Generated Imagery is perfect and to even add onto that the 3D experience is just incredible. I actually think I appreciated the film a lot more watching it in 3D. Like in particular the scenes where Shockwave's pet mechanical leech rips through the commercial buildings and the deployment of the airborne military troops in particular are quite astounding. Though as much as the action was fantastic and nail biting at times. The story is pretty simple and predictable as you would expect. I don't care though, I don't need story for a bunch of robots, just as long as their motives justify their means to blow $%*# up, I'll be happy to watch it to see what happens. So that being said do me a favor and grab an energy drink and head on down to your local cinema and buy a 3d ticket for transformers.Its one of the only 3D films out that will get you the experience you would be expecting and if your not to keen on an all action based film than its probably time to watch ""The Departed"" again","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie's action scenes are quite attractive and dramatic. The director tried to show everything as best as possible. But maybe because the plot is not good, there are scenes where we feel everything is quite predictable or quite funny. Remember these are giant robots. They cannot have feelings of pity. Or at least the reason for this needs to be mentioned in more detail. Instead of focusing too much on action scenes without enough depth, the film no longer has story continuity or realism, which the previous two parts did better. The music still completes its mission. But even if Sam changes girlfriends, everything in this story needs to be accurate and realistic. Moon? An interesting topic.

It's about having too many explosions, stupid jokes, the hottest girls I've ever seen bending over the nicest cars I've ever seen, and robots killing each other.To think that it's anything other a fun movie is expecting too much and when the movie is 2 1/2 hours long you'll have a bad time if you're not going to overlook the fact that it's not the next Shawshank Redemption. Michael Bay is a director who people go to expecting explosions and action. In Transformers 3, you got it.However, the fact that it's a very long movie does give it some downsides. The real action doesn't start until the second half of the movie following a real exciting twist. One of my friends even started crying at it. The second half though is without a doubt one of the coolest movie scenes I've seen in a couple years. I went with my girlfriend and we were talking about it with her dad and we suggested going into it half way through the movie if he wouldn't have the patience for the slow beginning. I thought they were going to end the movie at the twist at first and make it the sequel as the second half would've been a great movie on it's own.Similarly the story is all over the place, I would suggest not paying too much attention to it as it wasn't very good, only complex and confusing. It's slow and mysterious at first and until the action picks up not a lot happens.Give the movie your attention long enough to get to the second half and you'll see some amazing robot fighting action that's way cooler than anything I could've done with those cool toys. It's fun, it's cool, it's stupid. Don't let the fact that it isn't a perfect movie ruin the action. I would suggest seeing it in theater; it's just a great time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Its structure consists of mindless action scenes with hundreds of explosions, stiff characters, and a neverending amount of screaming. It's easily one of the worst action films to come out of Hollywood in recent memory, and the worst Michael Bay film to come out in about a year.The story is convoluted and just a mess. In simple terms - the Autobots and the Decepticons are at war again, and for some reason, they decide to fight on Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive in Chicago.Shia LeBeouf is back playing Sam, who is still as idiotic and as loud as ever. Only this time, he has a new accomplice named Carly (Whiteley) who takes Megan Fox's place in the film. Together her and Sam face numerous explosions and somehow survive everyone of them. Because, you know, every girl sticks by some charming nerd who has a relationship with giant metal monstrosities. Not to mention remaining optimistic while they watch in awe as the robots turn Chicago into what appears to be the depths of hell.When people say they love the Transformers films I can't help but laugh, then correct them. They don't love the film. They love the explosions, the special effects, and the constant, mind-numbing action on screen. If these action sequences were cut up and put on the internet in little spurts and dubbed something totally different it would be the web series every twelve year old would be talking about. So, before you say you love Transformers: Dark of the Moon, stop and think - do you like the film or the special effects within the film? I bring this up because while Transformers: Dark of the Moon lacks a lot of hefty material that is required to make a good film, it completely shows the carelessness and idiocy of making a modern day action piece. Look at any good action film - Death Race 2000, Dirty Harry, Easy Rider, The Rookie, Speed, etc. What makes them all good besides their iconic leads? Character development, dialog, and worthy special effects that make up well crafted action scenes. Transformers, and I'm saying this to represent the entire franchise, lacks all but one of the categories.No matter how great the pyrotechnics, the explosions, or some of the scenes are, it gets incredibly aggravating to see pretty much the same thing for the course of two and a half hours. Not only is this just an incoherent mess, it's a mess that occupies so much more time than it needs to. It would be different if there was some narrative consistency rather than just explosion after explosion with a pounding, pretentious score playing at all times. If it followed a simple story, and worked from the ground up rather than settling for such a lazy style of film-making, the series might actually be more than just ""dumb fun."" One thing I could never wrap my brain around were the physics. I understand the whole genre is based off of someone's creative idea. In a cartoon, the idea of cars turning into a full-blown mechanical robot destroying everything in their paths is not only unique, but perfectly acceptable. For a cartoon of course. In a live action film, the idea is simply way too plausible to be accepted. The fun thing about cartoons is you know they could never happen. Having a live-action film made about the franchise, let alone three, just flat out ruins the point of Transformers overall - it could simply never happen.Certain scenes baffle me. For one - how can a robot jump, climb, wrestle, destroy, and blow up the same building and not having it collapse? How can another robot run on the side of a building without going straight through it or making it tilt? Also - how can Sam attach a grappling hook to a robot's eye while proceeding to be flung around like a piece of meat, crashing into concrete garages and buildings? With one hand only. Questions like these don't really get any other answer aside from ""just because."" Director Michael Bay has spent most of his directing years to making and producing horrible remarks and lackluster franchise re-imaginings. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the poster child for why he shouldn't be in film, and why action films are quickly spiraling down to an all time low. The problem with Bay is he isn't creative or willing to pursue his own personal idea. The problem with this is the fact it suffers from no straight forward narrative, and relies on drawn out, cliché action scenes that, while well-crafted, go on for way too long of a time span.The final battle in Chicago, literally, is over an hour long. And it ends in the same cliché one would expect. If the battle was an hour long, and we were provided with a twist or something new I could see the reason for making it a certain length. But when you make us walk a long road to get somewhere and we get something we've seen before it just makes the whole trip useless and contrived.The moral of the story with Transformers: Dark of the Moon can be summed up, unlike the film itself, simply and effectively; quality over quantity.Starring: Shia LeBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Patrick Dempsey, and John Malkovich. Directed by: Michael Bay.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The media hype about a dark story, technically pronounced action sequences, toned-down comedy and last but not the least '3D' were driving me crazy to go watch the movie. Well I did, and here are my opinions. The action sequences have defined DOTM to be the benchmark for all future action movies aiming to blast the audience in 3D format. Michael Bay has once again proved that there is no one to parallel him in orchestrating explosive shots deftly. The story elements embedded with amazing special effects work as constructive blocks in the able hands of Bay, building up to an explosive hour long climatic sequence that should end Bay's take on the saga. But...I feel that the story was a bit of a let down. The first movie was a fresh artistic piece that made me look up in awe. The second movie was just a mix of better action with not so good a story, yet a good take for an intermediate episode. But in both those movies, the human characters, especially Sam, were at least 70% instrumental in moving the story forward. Unfortunately in DOTM, I found Sam to be less integral while many characters who were important in the past two movies ended up playing near-insignificant roles except for some comic bits or command- center style dialog. If you think the robots filled the gap, well, I don't exactly think so as it is a simple autobot vs decepticon plot with more numbers on either side bombing each other, and hence more focus on action. So in all... 3D 'wow', story 'so-so', experience 'worth it'. If you want the action, go get it as you don't want to miss it on the big screen. Else if other elements are important to you as the action is, you might be disappointed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, it was pretty sweet, but it's such a long movie that after your eyes adjust to the 3D you kind of forget about it. There are few scenes worth watching in 3D anyway and most of the biggest explosions can hardly be seen in 3D.Now about the movie. It was freaking awesome! I've been reading some of the negative reviews and I just have to laugh at them. Those guys are so right about the movie yet they missed the point. One guy wrote a review and didn't even watch the whole thing! Oh well, all I have to say is that if it weren't for the Autobots I would have walked out as  well. Yet, I knew better. This movie was never meant to win any awards that has to do with screenplay, acting, or directing. I mean it was done in two years. Two years! That's not enough time to write something crafty without some concrete background like a book. I mean I'm sorry, but I don't think the cartoons count. Especially with the special effects and everything. Just not enough time at all.No, Michael Bay doesn't know structure in a movie. He doesn't even do transition within a scene very well either! Yet he knows one thing: how to make a movie exciting. And since this movie was done in only two years I give it a positive rating. Yeah I noticed all the clichés and the dragging storyline about the humans. Bay pays too little time on the Autobots and Decepticons at the beginning that I just felt like it was starting to become Witwicky's story, which is understandable, but something I didn't like all that much. Michael Bay seemed to misunderstand the type of story some fans wanted to see. Yet, despite all that I couldn't help but feel entertained at the end. That's because Michael Bay understands that the majority of fan goers aren't going to watch this movie expecting a grand Oscar worthy type movie. They are going to watch it to escape. To watch a little fantasy that is completely unrealistic but enjoyable. Remember what happened with Pirates 4? Yeah I felt like the story improved, somewhat, but the excitement and the overblown action was gone. That wasn't fun. Yes, this movie was filled with clichés. I rolled my eyes a couple of times, but I didn't care at the end. What is not cliché about this movie is the different take Michael Bay gives us this time. After the excitement, but at times lame writing, of the first movie and the awful, yet at times entertaining, second movie I was hoping for something like Dark of the Moon. I never felt, for one second, that Michael Bay should abandon his formula. It works and it's exciting. All I asked for was a bit more seriousness and no more goofy jokes that the second movie was filled with. At the beginning I felt excitement, followed by some anxiety as the movie seemed to drag for minutes at a time, kind of like driving a car through traffic (I know, cliché, but it's the best thing to describe it), then finishing with an awe of excitement that even topped the first movie. The movie takes itself more seriously, yet there are plenty of clever laughs throughout, and yes a few goofy ones along the way as well as some unintentional ones, but those parts don't negate the fact that when you double-cross Optimus you pay. I highly recommend watching the movie. I don't understand critics and the people who say ""it's a wonderful spectacle, but I'm giving it a few stars because ..."" of whatever reason. They don't understand that Bay has not failed. These movies are so extremely successful for one reason: it's exciting to watch the Autobots fight the Decepticons. What would make it more exciting would be getting rid of a human lead and just focus on the ""robots in disguise"" and to keep the seriousness and lighthearted humor. Until then enjoy this movie. ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a summer movie after all, whether just saying that is cliché or not. It's one spectacular movie to watch. My advice: go watch it and just have some fun, which you will.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The destructive spectacle is real and genuinely impressive, but terrible as a cinematic experience: too many characters, many subplots, comic reliefs that do not work","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5772086/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","25 May 2020","In 2009, with the success of the first film, Bay did what he does best: more destruction and more explosions. It is difficult to truly like the second film. But, of course, the film again made a lot of money at the box office, making part three inevitable. For those who thought that the second film was just about shots, beating and bombing, you should not have watched ""The Hidden Side of the Moon"". The plot even anchors at an important moment in the history of mankind, making a fun relationship with historical facts - that the script seeks to tie with archival scenes and digital (unfinished) recreations of US presidents - between the fate of Cybertron, the planet ravaged by the civil war between Autobots and Decepticons, and the space race fought by the USA and the USSR in the 1950s and 60s. This historical stuff and glimpses of the robot planet give renewed interest to the series, even though they disappear there in the middle of the film, right after Buzz Aldrin - himself - shows up.In the plot, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), participate in secret missions alongside the humans, where they try to exterminate the Decepticons existing on the planet. One day Optimus discovers that the humans hid something that happened to him on the far side of the moon. It is the fall of a spaceship from Cyberton, commanded by Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), which triggered the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in 60s. The Autobots decide to go to the Moon to rescue the old leader, in addition to the capsules that are still in place. At the same time, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives with his new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and is looking for a job. He feels diminished, having saved the planet twice and won a medal from President Barack Obama, but none of this seems to help him establish himself in the job market. To make matters worse, Carly earns well and is harassed by the boss, billionaire Dylan Gould (Patrick Dempsey). Shortly after finally getting a job, Sam receives a message from Jerry (Ken Jeong), who works in the same place. Jerry worked at NASA during the space race and is now blackmailed by the Decepticons, who kill him. The fact makes Sam look for the Autobots once again, but despite his past achievements he encounters resistance from the new commander, Marissa Faireborn (Frances McDormand).The prologue, which recreates the arrival of Apollo 11 on the Moon and the super-secret mission that is the real reason for its existence, is by far the best part of the script, for without something well structured and that really adds mystery to the narrative and robot mythology. However, the solidity shown in the initial 20 minutes completely collapses from there. We are re-introduced to Sam Witwicky (the embarrassed Shia LaBeouf being himself) who, despite having graduated from one of the best colleges in the United States, saved the world twice, winning a Barack Obama medal and winning one second jaw-dropping girlfriend, remains the same loser who gets nothing in life. It is inexplicable as is the rest of the plot.The relationship of the ""Witwicky core"" is horrible and, in no way remembers, the great interactions of the first film and even a little of the second. The impression is that Sam's parents, played by the excellent Kevin Dunn and Julie White are there out of obligation. It may seem an exaggeration to disregard the work of the actors, but the feature itself leads us to believe that their role is merely to take us from one action scene to another. Here we have big names, like Frances McDormand and John Malkovich, lending their talent to characters who add little to the plot individually, but who together with the supporting cast make the precarious script work.Since being announced as the hero's new girlfriend played by Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has been one of the cast's most questionable additions. The first scene of the British serves to show its purpose in the film. The camera follows Rosie - who is wearing only a T-shirt and panties - in a sequence that reminds us of the lingerie commercial in which the director found the then model. Shortly after, the director follows his camera from head to toe while Patrick Dempsey's character describes a luxury car, making the analogy of the perfection of Whiteley's body with the characteristics of the car. In the few moments when he has to act, his performance is reasonable, although this was clearly not the director's concern. The gorgeous model replaces tall Megan Fox - after a string of disagreements with director Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg - not that it is too difficult.
New robots are also featured in the feature, both on the side of heroes (Autobots) and villains (Decepticons). The new Decepticons have greater relevance in the plot, especially the hateful Laserbeak. Shockwave, one of the best transformers presented so far, unfortunately has little screen time, but leaves its mark when it appears. Sentinel Prime, widely touted in the promotional pieces of the film, has a disappointing role throughout history - its only appeal is to be voiced by Leonard Nimoy (Lord Spock, from Star Trek). We see a new species of metallic sand worm (that of the Duna book series) controlled by Sockwave, one of the most interesting robot designs created by Bay's creative team.As in the previous film, the humor remains eschatological and bland. Until the story really starts to pass, almost an hour of projection passes, full of ""comical"" scenes without purpose and ridiculous subplots. Examples of this are the Autobots attacking nations in the Middle East, crude jokes, stupid quotes to ""Star Trek II - Khan's Wrath"" and Sam's mother making a joke about the boy's penis size amid an attack by Decepticons .Michael Bay also ignores something called ""rhythm"", keeping the feature at a perpetual climax, which ends up tiring viewers. Enduring the whole projection becomes a test of endurance, given Bay's inability to show a consistent narrative. The last hour is a gigantic action scene that just doesn't stop until the last thirty seconds of the film, when it just ends. The final battle has the feat of overcoming the battle of Egypt from the previous chapter of the saga. Chicago is devastated and thousands of people have turned to dust, so there should be at least some notion of shock, but such scenes just don't connect with the audience. The city does not survive the attack of 200 decepticons (including a monster robot, combat ships, four-eyed soldiers, General Shockwave and a disfigured Megatron) in the final sequence, which has 40 minutes of explosions, acts of bravery, phrases of impact and many slow cameras. The latter, a kind of technological halter that the filmmaker found to be able to shoot in 3D. Nothing more than the obligation, since the money invested and Bay's poor reputation can justify that. It is one of the best 3D productions so far. But that's it. The solution works very well: you can appreciate the formidable work of computer graphics from Industrial Light and Magic in detail and high definition, with the thousands of moving parts in each of the robots, interacting with the environment and with the humans around them.It is interesting to see the work of art direction and especially of photography when managing to portray a scenario of total destruction and even post-apocalyptic with shades of gray and specific lenses. Also noteworthy is another precise work by Steve Jablonski in yet another soundtrack that is consistent and that knew how to maintain tension and adrenaline throughout the film. ""Transformers: The Hidden Side of the Moon"" will easily make millions, which is perhaps why Bay still roams the hollywood sets. In the choreography of Bay's private war, real and three-dimensional explosions happen simultaneously, while armies collide in a space impossible to be discerned as real or imaginary, in what gives the impression of being the most expensive film ever made, so great its quality. The destructive spectacle is real and genuinely impressive, but terrible as a cinematic experience, the film has too many characters, many subplots, comic reliefs that do not work a script without emotional involvement. It's a great commercial for the effective uses of 3D, nothing more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The First Transformers was a action-packed, funny and good written movie. The Second installment was somewhat a put down, but nevertheless watchable.But what has happened to this third installment. The acting is horrifying, the writing is crap and the special effects may be the only good thing in this movie.Where the humor in the first two movies was well placed and actually a contribution to the movies, the humor in this part is just bad.As for the story, it must be said there is just no story. People keep complaining how Man of Steel is just a brainless action movie with no story, but it must be said, transformers dark of the moon has even less story in it.Like I said the only good thing in the movie may be the special effects and CGI, however watching this movie one gets the feeling that he is in a computer game and not even a good one. More than half of the movie is just pure computer added effects, making you wonder if Bay should even have taking the effort to film any actual scenes.If you are a fan of brainless action and just want to sit down in your seat after a hard day of work, watching the Apocalypse with some weird humor than you should really go and watch this movie. If you are not looking for this then I would suggest to just skip this movie and go watch another Michael Bay movie.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The thing that made this film work was that it actually had a plot and the fighting had some reason, unlike the second one. I loved the whole involvement of the moon and space adventure. Some of the action sequences were immense, the stunts were amazing, out of this world. The action was really fun and kept you watching right till the end. Don't expect Oscar worthy acting or scriptwriting but since when does an action film have real substance in acting, not a bad thing but just fact. The new girl was OK, however by her character there were some moments where women were painted in a negative light. Also there were some glitches in the language which was not appropriate and also the couple of sexual references were inappropriate, not explicit but heavily implicated. This tainted the quality of the film and was unnecessary however the overall conclusion is that ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a great fun action adventure with killer moves and a decent plot.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This time, He gets a another strikeout.This third film which looks like a 2 and a half hour toy commercial plug, deals with the battle for America between the Autobots and the Decepticons.Shia Labeouf is still good as before as Sam Witwicky. Taking over for Megan Fox is model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whiteley may have half of Fox's looks but none of the charm. The rest of the supporting cast including Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro, Frances Mcdormand and John Malkovich are mostly underused. But the only shining supporting star is Ken Jeong {""The Hangover"" and TV's ""Community""}. Jeong is very funny as Sam's co-worker, but his role lasts a few minutes.Bay's direction is, as Roger Ebert would put it ""eye candy for the blind"". Ehren Kruger's script is too banal and drags the movie on too long. The visual effects are at times both impressive and corny. Armi Morki's cinematography make us feels like we are watching a music video.Transformers fans will be wowed by it. But for the rest of us, we see it as a endurance contest. Just in case non-fans, bring in pillows.FYI: The film is in both 2-D and 3-D versions. I saw it in 2-D.

Whatever it was, the third installment of the Transformers series is obnoxious, bloated, and appallingly bad.Shia LaBeouf returns as the main character, this time shacking up with Rosie Huntington, who does nothing but stand in for Megan Fox. LaBeouf spends almost all of the first 30 minutes complaining about not being able to help save the world with the Autobots. Boo-hoo. Meanwhile, John Turturro plays Seymour Simmons, the other guy that was in the other two movies. Are we supposed to care about these people? In a film about giant robots? Regardless, director Michael Bay spends nearly an hour with the contrived plot and useless, unlikable characters. John Malcovich and Patrick Dempsey both have supporting roles in this film. Neither of them matter, yet Dempsey alone gets 10 minutes of screen time. The only logical explanation for this is that Michael Bay must have nothing but contempt for his audience.Rather than a movie, Transformers plays out like something used on Guantanamo Bay inmates when water-boarding doesn't work. The acting is bad, the story is incomprehensible, the robots are ugly, and the movie is 2 ½ hours long. Even the action scenes are impossible to figure out; Optimus Prime is literally left hanging for ten minutes, and the film cuts away when anything remotely important happens. Shia LaBeouf & co. are dangling from a falling building facing certain doom, when the film cuts to Optimus and Megatron fighting, but whenever someone looks like they might be the one who wins, the film cuts away—and with so many side plots, they don't return for what seems like ages. It's nearly impossible to tell the Autobots and Decepticons apart. They all have the same color schemes and cheesy one liners. ""Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican standoff here"". Give me a break.Michael Bay directs with the attention span of a hyperactive middle schooler. For the first hour the only thing he seems remotely interested in is Rosie Huntington's body; which is fine—for a while. And when the action finally starts, Bay can't make up his mind on where to be. Every cut seems like some main character is left facing impending doom. Not that Bay has made any effort for the audience to give a crap.The script lacks any forward thinking, trudging along at a gruelingly slow pace. Filled with stupid jokes, an insufferable romantic subplot, and jive talking robots, this screenplay is—dare I say it?—worse than the last one. The plot at points is ridiculously mundane. If this is a movie about giant alien robots, then why in God's name must there be a 5 minute montage of Shia Labeouf being interviewed for freaking jobs?!?The only saving grace of this abomination is Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime. He has a few good lines, but—just as in the other Transformers movies—he's not in it nearly enough. As a result, nothing works; the script doesn't work, the action doesn't work, Patrick Dempsey's pathetic attempts at acting assuredly don't work. Michael Bay throws every explosion he can at this movie, going so far as to completely destroy Chicago. His obnoxious direction consumes the movie, and the result is what happens when soulless Hollywood rears its ugly head.www.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

The second film was successful but critically panned as it turned the volume up to 11 and made no sense.Pre-release, director Michael Bay confirmed he had learned his lesson from episode 2. This third film was filmed from the ground up in 3D, we were told we would enjoy a decent story and a more mature structured film. All of the above, whilst retaining all the fun, explosions, soft and car porn a fourteen year old boy could want or at least wish to handle.Has he succeeded? The movie from a technical point of view is a tour de force. The 3D effects are fantastic, the set pieces colossal, see the previous 11 and raise you double. The CGI and animation on display is perhaps the finest and seamless we have ever seen at the cinema.How can it be then, that I would describe this as perhaps one of the worst films ever? The story begins with the Apollo moon landings, where it transpires the moonshot was about more than just going to the moon, the US needed to photograph and investigate a crashed Cybertronian ship. The remainder of the film revolves around huge fight scenes between the Decepticons (bad) and Autobots (good) led by Optimus Prime striving to prevent Cybertron being called to earth - very bad.This an interesting premise and the first twenty minutes hold together reasonably well following a lingering first shot which sets out the non-feminist agenda of the film. Sam (LeBeouf) is now with Carly (Victoria Secret underwear model - Huntington-Whiteley). Megan Fox leaving the series after she compared Michael Bay to Hitler, which will always dampen your career aspirations somewhat. Carly is gorgeous to look at and a large proportion of the film traces her sun kissed body and ogles her curves, at every and any opportunity.Can she act, no. However, for many this may be a moot point. LaBeouf also does nothing to dispel the illusion that he has yet to be involved in any movie where decent acting is actually required.The story then vaguely unfolds into, well it is difficult to tell, because from a thematic and structural point of view the film is a complete and utter mess. Each scene merely a very brief interlude or bridge to the next orgy of CGI created Robot on Robot fight scenes. Perhaps 80% of the films running time is used in this way, even reverting to a FPS (First Person Shooter) view at one point, confirming beyond all doubt, the continuing convergence between action movies and computer gaming.Interestingly the fighting is more brutal than ever, execution style sequences, ripping of robot body parts and spines, in slow motion with what appears to be blood on occasion. Quite why this would be the case is not explained.This is a short list of the talent on display, all of which without exception are wasted and on reflection may well be ashamed to have been part of the film. Stand up, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, John Turro, Patrick Dempsey and most sadly of all Buzz Aldrin, the only genuine character briefly on display.Ken Yeong of ""Hangover"" ""fame"" also appears in a bizarre sequence and yet again manages to confound as to why he is popular with audiences. The scene when ex-agent Simmons is reintroduced to the film appears to come from a different movie and jars to such an extreme, it is difficult to believe it was not intentional.Leonard Nimoy does a decent job of voicing the new character ""Sentinel"" but there really is no film of any substance to comment upon, just a string of CGI show reels, some appalling dialogue and misjudgements in taste. Quite how a shot reminiscent of the Challenger explosion was considered suitable is difficult to understand and a later tattered US flag waving moment, that even the staunchest of American redneck would blanch at.On this and recent evidence, Bay has to be one of the most technically savvy but shallow and incoherent directors working in modern cinema today. When compared with intelligent yet blockbusting cinema from Christopher Nolan, there is no comparison.Summary Technically and visually arresting but otherwise an appalling film, lacking any humanity, story or structure. A ""Marmite movie"", either you love it or hate it One star for the CGI and animation alone, one for the film.Not recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Of course there would NOT have been any butt showing but she wouldn't had to try too hard to act since she is already too stiff. Or better yet, the CGI should have done all her moves. I am glad that Megan Fox's character was not killed of so she can return to (if any) Transformers movies.....so Megan please be careful with what you say and Michael Bay DON'T be too sensitive. The both of you GROW-UP!!!! As for Rosie, please DON'T quit your day job!!!!

Michael Bay did not have to listen to the criticism, but he did. You don't get a resolution on issues that concern the second Transformers movie, but the movie has reasonable gaps in its story. I'm assuming you have seen both prior installments, so I'm not considering talking about them spoilers.Megan Fox prominently has taken off. Reasons for that are not entirely clear, but I guess she wanted to move along. What's good is that it is resolved and mentioned in the movie. But is is really story you are looking for here? I can't speak for how much liberties Bay takes with the Transformers franchise. But I can say that he filmed this more coherent than the last one. The jokes are still there, but he toned a few things down (thankfully) and made the action scenes look better. Plus I could actually understand and see who was who in the shot.Not superior to the still best part in the series (the first one that is), but a return to action a la Bay, without much to think about. I still would have loved it, if they put a ""3"" after Transformers. It'd be a nice touch to the title, especially considering the 3-D that is used (which is used in a nice way too).","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I really haven't enjoyed the visual effects of any other movies lately (after avatar and inception).The characters are just to support this machine movie.

Granted, I didn't have much faith in it to begin with as the second one was also a major slope down from the first; however, I didn't think it would be this bad.OK, so the first thing I noticed was the mysterious disappearance of Megan Fox and the appearance of her replacement it seems Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, a British Victoria's Secret Model. Well, where did Megan Fox go?! The only explanation given is that she dumped Sam. There's no hint as to why, when, where etc. This really bothered me for some reason. I'm not a very big fan of Megan Fox but I felt that she played quite a large role in this franchise and I was disappointed that the producers messed with the flow of Transformers by replacing her. This was their first mistake.Secondly, if I'm perfectly honest I had no frickin' idea what the hay was going on for most of this movie. The first part was all about how sad Sam's life is and how he needs to get a grip, get a job and stop thinking about the decepticons. Whilst all the action is going on in this movie Sam and Carly's relationship unfolds and develops which is a bit distracting for the viewer as the story switches and merges plot lines. Sam is jealous of Carly's relationship with her new boss, a rich man (Patrick Dempsey), who buys her a car and then *shocker* her boss turns out to be in league with the Decepticons.There is a new bad guy: Sentinel Prime, who in my opinion just looks like a robotic ent. He was Optimus Primer's predecessor and was in charge of guarding the 'Pillars', but he secretly made a deal with Megatron and is now one of the bad guys. Using these Pillars the Decepticons want to set up a teleportation link bringing all the Decepticons to Earth, which has the resources they require. In my opinion this made the film look like a race between giant robots to find some sticks. Meanwhile, the Decepticons are murdering members of the US and Russian space missions to cover their traces, but of course, they're not very subtle about this. (Hint: man mysteriously flies out the window of a high storey building). The Decepticons threaten to wage war on Earth if the humans don't agree to exiling the Autobots, so of course, the humans pack off their only means of protection up in a space shuttle and shoot it into the sky. Then, after a bazillion fires, explosions, special effects, peace is restored - as expected.I don't know why but for some reason the only thing I could think of every time I saw Shia laBeouf was Even Stevens. I didn't feel this way during the other two movies so perhaps LaBeouf's acting had slipped back into old ways and he was reprising the role of Louis Stevens.What is quite cool is how they incorporate history into this movie by saying that the 'Space Race' of the Cold War between the USA and the USSR was caused because a Cybertronian spacecraft landed on the moon.Some people really liked this movie, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. I guess the special effects are fantastic but it's effect is significantly lessened as there is no plot line to back it up. All in all I thought this movie was a bit of a mess. It lacked plot and detail that was needed and by the end of the movie I could see, hear and think was explosions, explosions, explosions. Thank god this is the last instalment so they can stop tarnishing the name Transformer oh wait that is what I would've said in 2011 but now we've got transformers age of extinction YAY!!!!

BLANK. It was all CGI which we've already seen before. Story was a disappointment. Rosie should just stick to modeling with her injected lips. As expected she wasn't able to capture and leave a mark with the viewers like Megan Fox did with the first two films. It was a major mistake Michael Bay let Megan Fox go.As you guys may have noticed Megan Fox's name is continuously brought up when Transformers is being featured on shows like E. Usually you don't bring up an actress who has been FIRED already. Now, why is that? I guess they're hoping bringing up Megan Fox's name will help with the box office numbers.Also I've noticed that Bay often compare Transformers 3 with Avatar. PLEASE! Does Michael Bay really think he can beat Avatar with this? If you're a teenage boy with passion for robots and doesn't care about the story or soul of the movie, you MIGHT enjoy this. But if you're someone HOPING THIS WOULD BE A BETTER MOVIE THAN THE 2ND ONE, forget it. It's as bad as people have feared.I am impressed with how much advertising they've spent. I'm telling you Transformers 3 is ALL HYPE. Don't be swayed by the movie being featured daily on TV shows. It's all marketing. They make it seem like this one is going to be sooooo epic but it's not. Especially with the absence of Megan Fox. To think I'm even a girl! One of the reasons the 2nd movie is bearable is because of the presence of Megan Fox and now that she's gone, this 3rd installment is just UNBEARABLE replaced with a girl with injected lips.Transformers 3 DID NOT DELIVER.

He then collects and plays with the pieces, sometimes breaking them even more. This movie is like that. It's like the little boys who used to play with the transformer cars when they were little got older and now they're still playing with them through the manipulations of cameras and computers.This film does exhibit all of the usual modern computer generated effects. The locations are widely separated with nothing being too spectacular in that regard. The costuming is simple as are the props (except the computer stuff of course). The sets are, well, hard to judge because you can't really believe they're not primarily computer generated effects. I think the problem is they keep trying to do bigger and bigger special effects and at some point it almost gets boring from being so uniformly explosive and overwhelmingly unreal. I'll invent yet another new term here to cover it: ""Action Movie Desensitization"". One can't believe that these types of films are not solely aimed at the average 12 year old out of school for the summer. There's little else in the theaters.The film also requires an immense degree of the ability to suspend one's disbelief to begin to watch it. The plot is as thin and makes about as much logical sense as a 1930's comic book plot, but it's there if you want to try to follow it. If you saw any of the preceding ""Transformer""-type films you could likely write a better plot yourself; so just substitute your own plot in your head as the explosions unfold (NOTE to writers; a college graduate usually isn't a ""teenager"").That leaves the acting. The principle characters do yeoman service for their paychecks. Several previous denizens of Transformerville return to reprise their former roles with Shia La Beouf straining his best to out-panic and out-sweat his previous filmic efforts. He does so well, along with John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Patrick Dempsey and Alan Tudyk. The always watchable Frances McDormand comes on strong as a bad-womanesque government wienie. She was cool being bad. John Malkovich provided a great characterization as La Beouf's mildly-insane, oddball boss. He and McDormand are likely the best things in the film, BUT, there was a truly kinetic, unhinged, off-the wall performance by the increasingly popular Ken Jeong. Watch for him, he's a riot.The odd addition is ""the girl""- there's always a girl. In this case the very publicized Megan Fox from the former films was unceremoniously replaced for little understood insults to the hands that fed her. Such is life. But, Fox's bad luck provided all the excuse necessary to replace her with a younger model, literally. In this instance ""the girl"" is ""unconventionally beautiful"" 24 year-old British farm girl/model named Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whitely's previous claim to fame, it seems, is the talent to look decent while walking around in public places in her underwear, which, of course, brought her to the attention of these film makers, so, at this point in her career I imagine her strategy has worked out rather well. She's not terrible in the film so at least she doesn't embarrass herself. However, skimpier costuming may have brought in a few dozen more teenage boys.I couldn't help but note that every time Whitely appeared on camera, or in some cases even close-by off-camera, the script became peppered with some rather obvious and sophomoric sexual innuendos and double-entendres accompanied by some rather epic leering. The most blatant one early on coming from someone commenting on the container La Beouf's medal came in. And, please, no one spoil it for me by claiming it was unintentional. I, at least, wanted to give the writer credit for getting away with some originality.Another thing one can't help but notice the height disparity between the two leads, La Beouf and Whitely. I checked and he lists his height in his bio as an entire quarter of an inch taller than her's states. There seems to be different people playing La Beouf as his height seems to change up and down by four inches or more throughout the film. Some of that can be explained by her footwear, but not all of it. One may wonder why I mention that? I mention it because I was so disinterested in the ""action"" on screen that I was looking for other things to find interest in on screen. Still, I have to give credit for any shorter guy willing to undertake scaling mount Whitely. It must have been very fun for him.In the long run, I would have much preferred it had they cast a ""real"" young actress in the role instead of a model. There are a number of good ones to choose from. For example, Blake Lively (barely shorter), pixieish Ellen Page, Hilary Duff (Oooo, she can even resemble a tough girl), Kay or DaniellePanabaker (or maybe both of them, they're small), Hayden Panettiere, Mia Wasikowska (shorter than whazziz name), Aly Michalka (barely shorter), Emma Roberts (who is charmingly shorter than that Witwicky guy), Amanda Michalka (also shorter) and, my personal favorite nominee, Emma Stone (also shorter). See how easy it is? In conclusion, I will posit that the theater was uncommonly packed, the most I'd ever seen on a weekday performance, and the audience uniformly seemed to like the film a lot. So, I guess that means that they will make a lot of money which, in turn, will likely generate yet another sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Believe it or not, I actually did enjoy the first two Transformers films. Yes they do have their problems, and 2 can even be a bit problematic, but they were both very entertaining films with awesome action scenes- and most importantly- a rather interesting story to tell. Transformers Dark of the Moon has the beginning of a good Transformers story but gets lost in its concept throughout and eventually just becomes a bit of a bore. It's attempts and themes of connecting to real life conspiracies feels all too forced and odd to be any fun, and its story feels bland and formulaic- typical and full of tropes that really brought the film down in levels of impact. There are a few good fight scenes towards the end, but the CGI isn't as amazing as some may claim. Yes at times it can look fantastic, and even has similar effects and plotlines the Avengers films seemed to have copied off of- but sometimes the physics of the characters on screen and how they move and walk about with no friction or fuss or shaking around them just really annoyed me here- and was never as distracting or blatant as it had been in the films before it. Not to mention, the really generic look of one of my favorite characters- Soundwave. The acting was also a bit over the top, and honestly I really missed Megan Fox in this one. When Tyreese is the best actor you have in a film, you know it's bound to have some problems, and new coming actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has almost no charisma on screen whatsoever and serves only as an obvious replacement of Fox's character. Even the music feels more drab here, and despite some cool moments and looks, the overall tone of the film falls from its darkness into just dull territory. In the end, Transformers Dark of the Moon was a major disappointment. It has its fun moments, but it's ultimately too shallow and too underdone to be anything but a lackluster sequel.My Rating: 4.2/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Okay, the most absurd casting in the history of film was made by putting British supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in the role of the main lead and love interest. She slides down collapsing buildings, runs though explosions with shrapnel flying everywhere, crawls through burning pits of smoky ash, and doesn't so much as smudge her white sweater or show a single emotion besides sticking out her big pouty lips and speaking a few lines as if lobotomized. But besides all of this, Transformers 3 is pure bubblegum, two and a half hours of explosions and robot violence with at least an hour of Chicago getting attacked that rivals the destruction in any other movie. What do you expect from yet another sequel to a movie based on Hasbro toys? Clint Eastwood giving Meryl Streep a bouquet of fleshly picked flowers?

"10","/10","This movie isn't called MEGAN FOX: Dark of the Moon...It's called TRANSFORMERS: Dark of the moon and it's absolutely amazing!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450347/?ref_=tt_urv","optimusjamie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26755289/?ref_=tt_urv","28 June 2011","Firstly i'd like to say, to all the people who're like ""Megan fox should be in it for it to be good""....NO!!! Megan fox was a delight to be in the movies, but these movies aren't just about 'Megan fox'. Yeah she's stunning' and she had a good connection to Sam in the films, but come on people, the Transformers movie's aren't romance types of films, they're summer blockbusters, action, drama, maybe a little bit of romance in there. But all together, when people go to see these movies, they don't just look for 'Megan fox'...they come to see these movies to be entertained. And secondly i'd read some reviews from people, and they're taking a dislike to the new girl Rosie-Huntington Whiteley. Tbh from a girl who's never had any acting experience in her life, she did a darn good job as Carly. Maybe she didn't connect with Sam as much as what Megan fox. But the connection between the two was still there. I think she played the part very well, there was a couple of flaws that i picked up on within her performance, but overall i thought she did pretty well.And now to talk about the film...I had concerns about this movie when Michael Bay first announced he was making the movie, because he didn't really deliver with the second film. But as the first plot lines came through over the web, i began to think ""maybe Michael could pull this off after all"" and then the teaser trailer came out and i thought ""hmmm...this could be a good summer movie"" and then when the theatrical trailer came out i was astonished and amazed and how well this movie looked. And so i went to see it at an advance screening in IMAX 3D at the odeon cinema in new york while i was out there. And after 2 and a half hours of sitting in the cinema watching this movie, i came out thinking ""WOW, Michael Bay deserves a round of applause, A REALLY BIG round of applause"" in fact i think this movie will be up there challenging for best action-invasion movie ever created! This movie was superb..i mean the action was top notch, went at a steady pace so everyone in the cinema could keep up. The drama in the film was intense and i think Michael Bay finished off the trilogy amazingly well. People who are fans of the movie's will really, really enjoy this movie. And for people who think this movie is garbage, then you must be very strict in what you want to see in a movie. 10/10 This summer isn't just about Harry Potter, Transformers dark of the moon will be up there with it. Well done Mr Bay.","36 out of 68 found this helpful.

Granted the army is back in full force once again, as are various quasi-government agencies, but toned down are the tremendous recruitment ra-ra moments that defined Revenge of the Fallen, although you can't help but to chuckle at how Bay is determined to show us the perfect US-led world with the Autobots now being at the beck and call of the American military to take out rogue nations and groups that pursue unsanctioned nuclear ambition. Well if you can't do it in real life, do it in film in time for a 4th of July salute, can't you?Then there's the token female characters, one babe in Rose Huntington-Whiteley's Brit bombshell Carly taking over the fired Megan Fox whose character in the previous two movies got written off through no less than two mentions that she had dumped Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky with many characters exalting Carly's ""great"" qualities, and the other the brainier Mearing of NSA played by Frances McDormand looking really frumpy. In Bay's universe, hot babes get to drive sleek sports cars and pout incessantly, and in what would be a laughable moment, have enough charms to casually chat with one of the main villains in the show reminding him that he should be vicious, when the villain should have just swatted her away like an insect.But there are some plus points to amuse a Transformers fan. For instance, the much loved Laserbeak gets featured here in its nasty glory, being one heck of a powerful opponent with espionage its main weapon in orchestrating much of the Decepticon web of deceit, though its combination with Soundwave was one scene too little. Then there's Shockwave looking too up to date save for his cyclops eye and owning a gigantic pet worm that you see in the trailer, and Optimus Prime finally having his trailer put to good use in more than one battle sequence. Yes, it is up to these little things that keeps things interesting for fans and the casual viewer, but that's about it, as the big bang finale treaded on familiar ground covered in recent science fiction films such as Battle: Los Angeles - this one becoming Battle: Chicago - and Skyline with its alien invasion theme with alien planes peppering the sky, and aliens flexing their superior firepower with reducing masses of humans into ash.Effort has been put into resisting the temptation to have too many robots show up on screen pulverizing each other in close combat, and having Bay's slow motion to show off some cool stunts involving humans and robots (Bumblebee seems to be the favourite to have to slow down), but for all the loud, mind numbing and eardrum busting action going all around during the action sequences, there's this distinct lack of villainy in the movie, with action sequences being overly long and losing their impact and focus.We get tons of faceless and nameless Decepticons yet again, with plenty of action in the huge finale focused on the humans and the soldiers/mercenaries, but little on the robots. I mean, if Optimus Prime can be temporarily forgotten since he's stuck in a bunch of wires dangling upside down from some broken building, something is wrong.There are also supporting characters galore, some returning from the previous film such as John Turturro's Simmons, now a multi-millionaire thanks to his best selling book, and the likes of military men Lennox (Josh Duhamel) now made Colonel, and Tyrese Gibson's Epps, and new ones with John Malkovich and Ken Jeong in minor roles, with Patrick Dempsey's Dylan being written in to be in stark contrast to Sam Witwicky as humans who share similar robot-related ancestry, but it doesn't matter since no acting chops are required to star in this film, only the willingness to spout incredibly bad lines, and look cool/nerdy. What Buzz Aldrin (the real Buzz Aldrin) is doing in this film, is something of a mystery in itself too, other than to lend some gravitas to the created back story on the space race.The IMAX 3D presentation wasn't all that impressive given the trumpeting of using technology that gave rise to Avatar, and felt for the most parts a 2D film instead, since most of the action sequences were converted to 3D in post. So you just might want to save money on this and go for a digital presentation which will suffice. Will this be the final Transformers film? I suppose the millions in revenue will make it hard for the studio to say no, but whether Bay will be back for another round, well it's anyone's guess. At least this installment was more entertaining than the previous one, but it still doesn't offer much and is at risk of running stale. There's only so much that the robots can do on Earth that we haven't already seen before in 3 movies.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

They both want to reach the Moon in order to find a well-hidden Cybertronian spacecraft and learn its secrets.Since I had already watched the two previous ""Transformers"" movies I had high expectations from this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed by the result because it was just another Sci-Fi movie without paying any attention to the plot and to the main characters of the movie. I am not saying that ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a bad movie, I am just saying that it did not reach its true potential and that it could be a far better movie than this. To sum up, I believe that if you are a fan of ""Transformers"" you will agree with me, you will enjoy watching this movie but in the end you will conclude that you expected more from it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The alien crafts resemble those in earlier movies this year like Skyline and Battle Los Angeles. There are spectacular aerial views of the combat and mayhem. The sweeping panoramic views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago Skyline with soldiers jumping out of helicopters and buildings set to a drum pounding score were comparable to some of the action scenes in the Dark Knight. The story begins with a new interpretation of the first man on the moon mission and makes an immediate impression. The scope of this film is immense as there is action on the moon, White House, Lincoln Memorial, Downtown Chicago and what appears to be a replica of Chernobyl. THE HUMANS (AMERICANS):Sam (Shia LaBeouf) wants to be taken seriously and succeeds by shouting in our ears most of the time. Maybe he was trying to be heard over the non-stop music and action. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) shouts a lot as well. Sam's new love interest Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is there to be the damsel in distress. Although her accent is out of place, Director Michael Bay does a fine job showcasing her beauty utilizing a variety of wardrobes and backdrops. Tyrese Gibson is featured prominently in the action scenes along with Lester Speight (of Office Linebacker Terry Tate fame). The soldiers seemed to have a greater role in the outcome of this film rather than the previous two.There are frequent attempts at comic relief from both the robots and the humans, most of which are not funny but at least are entertaining. For the characters that we already know from the first two films, we get more of the same. Sam's parents are less obnoxious this time (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) as is Seymour Simmons (John Turturro). But many of the new characters (played by some veteran actors) were there to ham things up. I don't think any of these guys were necessarily bad, as they succeeded in keeping us occupied until the battles took place. THE ROBOTS:In one corner we have The Decepticons who are tough foes once again, this time their heavy hitter is a gigantic snake-like robot that rips through buildings and streets. ""Spock"" does the voice of the powerful turncoat robot Sentinel Prime whose arm is like a sword and the beat-up looking Megatron is back to manipulate and scheme.And for the reigning heavyweight champ Autobots, Optimus Prime reprises his role as the robot Rambo who comes in only for the final stages of the battles after his mates take their abuse.Overall, this one was a little more entertaining then Revenge of the Fallen.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I really think Michael Bay is good at one thing and all the elements of that one thing - spectacle; from special effects, to spectacular stunts, and set pieces that virtually melt your brain there is no doubting this word when watching the film. In that sense if you were able to combine his talents with another director who knows how to work with actors, and who knows something about plot and story then this person would be a true great. As it is we get one third, not even enough. The other vital two thirds which come together to form this Michael Bay experience are invented upon in a rush and as wildly like as a kid forced into doing his homework - for instance, present the issue of getting high quality acting into this film and the solution presented is John Malkovich. Anything more Michael? No, we just need an actor and Malkovich is that man in this movie - Malkovich will do the acting now lets get back to the explosions! As for the storyline - simply don't worry about it, because if you do you will end up bald from pulling your hair out. As a spectacle this film has something to offer - it is just a shame that scratching the surface only reveals more surface.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

If you're not big on this sort of thing, but instead prefer details such as a coherent plot, comedy that's not adolescent in nature and a well-paced story, you can drop that number dramatically.It's all subjective, and it depends what you like, but I'm only a fan because I like seeing big robots beat the crap out of each other.

To be fair to this iteration, the tiniest bit of effort has been spent on a plot this time. We create a good, old-fashioned, cold war style scenario with the Russians and the Americans, and there is also a little bit of Apollo 11 conspiracy to liven it up as just about everyone battles it out for the technology buried amidst the barren landscape. We've also got a new baddie-in-chief in the form of ""Shockwave"" and he continues to make sure that ""Sam"" (Shia LaBeouf) still cannot shake off his legacy with the robots still bent on mutual destruction. The usual stalwarts make up the numbers. The John Turturro ""Simmons"" character is starting to wain a bit now, Josh Duhamel is starting to lose some of his glitter and though mercifully we are now shot of Megan Fox, we find she is substituted by an even less charismatic Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley as 'Carly"".

As there is so much shooting, exploding and fighting in this film there is relatively little time for dialogue, which was largely, poorly written, and full of clichés. Finally, I didn't rate the casting of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or her performance. She has clearly been chosen for the role for her good looks and her great sex appeal although I think she shines brighter as an underwear model than blockbuster film actress. Also, It seems unbelievable to me that Shia LaBeouf's character, although not a bad looking guy, has been in relationships with 2 characters played by women who have both topped the annual FHM 100 sexiest women in the world poll. Rosie has clearly been cast to attract more male viewers, bring sex appeal that the film didn't really need and throughout struck me as being far out of Shia's league.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Its better told than the 2nd one, but aside from the effects and action sequences, well it sucks.I'm surprised that people like this better than transformers 2. my guess is that they hated the 2nd one so much that this could seem only better. Because this movie is not better than the second one, its just told in a better way (slightly).Im sorry if you re a united states citizen, but every movie that goes for the proud us flag waving in the back style of script fails, and fails in a big way. Bay movies are no masterpiece in my opinion, they are written for people who are very different than me and my kind of people.don't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie, but i knew what it was. The action scenes are awesome, like really awesome, specially the falling building scene and the final battle: the new bad guy fought off all the autobots like a MACHO, and he gets killed in the most pussy way. the dialog SUCKS, in the name of freedom we declare you the war?? damn that was bad. At least there is no mudflap and his brother who were awful in the second film.for me there were like 6 big plot holes and did i mention the dialog sucked? but the acting was not bad for me. another thing that bugged me, Malkovich, Mcdormand and Turturro are all major Coen brothers stars, are they friends with Bay or what?.i didn't hate the movie, the action was awesome and only that gave it the six points i gave it. i would like to give it more because i gave the previous movie a 7, but i will change the score of the previous film to 6 as well, because thats is the score the trilogy deserves.Bay should go on a mystical trip to other cultures and return to filmaking after at least 5 years, he should change his views because he is being toss aside of whats really cool nowadays","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

After the rather disappointing Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen I have to say that my hopes were not particularly high for this one.Dark of the Moon is set several years after the second movie where Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is struggling to get a job and return his life to normal and yet this still hasn't stopped him from bagging the most attractive girl in the city- Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). At the same time, the Autobots discover that a Cybertronian spacecraft crash landed on the Moon during the 1960's and race against the Decepticons to reach it first and protect the secrets that it holds. The two story lines overlap and voilà the plot is born.As always the visuals impress and are the best in the franchise so far but I ended up asking myself how is this different from the previous two and it led me to this answer- there isn't that much of a difference at all. Bay has upped the ante somewhat in regards to the amount of CGI he has crammed into the movie so expect more fighting, more action and a whole lot more slowmo. While many will think great more action, I see it as part of the problem though. There is only so many times that I can be impressed with a vehicle transforming into something else, in slow motion, before it becomes repetitive and I felt like I reached my limit in this film.Aside from the first 10 minutes which dealt with the space race of the 1960's, it took a while for the film to get going. For the last hour or so though, I was enjoying what the film had to offer where it took on a Black Hawk Down kind of persona during battle scenes in the city.Several issues I had: at 157 minutes the film tended to drag in several places and led to a rather rushed final scene that should not have been; the comedy element was greatly reduced despite a cameo from Ken Jeong aka Mr Chow from The Hangover; the new love interest did not impress with her acting skills at all and was more than likely brought in merely as token eye candy for the viewers, which she did succeed in; and most importantly, the plot had more holes in it than a Swiss cheese being used as target practice on a shooting range. And that is an understatement. Also there has been zero continuity between the trilogy of films so far which does not go down well with me.I was more impressed than I thought I was going to be but as I said expectation had been lowered due to the extremely poor second film. I have to be careful here because I think the impressive graphics have partly blinded me to the rest of the cracks that appear in the film. All I can say is if you enjoyed the first movie or like good visuals then you will enjoy this one and if you didn't or want an involved and interesting plot that develops itself and the characters as the movie progresses then you won't get that here.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first movie was better than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) in how it was put together.Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) was a improvement since the second movie, but I still think it is bad. It has good scenes but it has issues.The acting from Shia LaBeouf has improved since the first and second movie, but he is given silly lines and a lot of yelling lines. I don't blame him for it though.The Transformers scenes are cool and over the top, but it takes a while just to get to a full on fight with them. The 3rd act is when it gets entertaining.The action scenes can at times look good but can also be hard to see. I didn't find most of the movie annoying, because they got rid of the problems of the last movie.The 1st act of the movie is slow and the 2nd act can drag a bit, but it becomes fun to watch in the 3rd act final battle. I think I could watch this more than the second movie.I hated Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009). I still think the first movie was better.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I went anyway and was utterly blown away. I have read some of the reviews on this website and find that this movie did not live up to the standard of those who are fans of the original transformer movies. I was never a huge fan so for me this movie was great. I would firstly like to point out the greatness of the soundtrack in this movie. Its mind blowing and makes the action and drama scenes much more intense. It fits in so perfectly as well. This is something that has not been touched upon by reviewers, and i personally think was missed by most people. ITS AMAZING. Secondly, visual effects, of course! thats an obvious one, but one that should be mentioned anyway for its greatness! Sure, we wont be talking about these visual effects in 20-30 years time, but right now, this is one of the best i have ever seen and i was truly amazed. Thirdly, Shia's acting, you may judge me on this, but i think it was his best from all three, and his comedy was spot on and hilarious! As for the whole story and plot, i think its based on opinion, i thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was carried out very nicely. Not the strongest part of the film of course, but not low enough for me to score a 1/10, definitely now. The only thing i would downgrade this movie for is the poor acting of rosie (Carly) but for me Patrick Dempsey, Shia LaBoeuf and Josh Duhamel all receive a 10/10. Im not sure if this review makes any sense because this is just me rambling after seeing so many negative reviews! Don't hate me, but i LOVED this movie! i would pay to watch it again! Best out of the three for me!","16 out of 28 found this helpful.

There are many scenes that are so predictable and Autobots are ALWAYS there in time. Apart from amazing visual effects and a higher epic Decepticon ambition to conquer the world as well as Sam's new love interest, the story is pretty much the same. It is fun at times, but the somewhat potential scenes are ruined by pure clichés of Autobot rescues.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Is this Transformers also stupid? Yes. Does it still have stupid characters doing idiotic things? Yes. Does it still have Optimus Prime disappearing throughout most the film and still not being quite as bad-arse as his cartoon 80s days? Yes. Is Michael Bay still dropping the ball as director? Yes. Does the franchise still not know how to have a decent ending? Yes. And finally, does it still have this overgrossing obsession about the military? Yes. Despite all this, we have clearly found our best entry in the trilogy, as Dark of the Moon mixes the humor and heart of the first, with the utter carnage of the second, while jacking up the ante in terms of conflict and suspense. That being said, it is freakin' frustrating to watch sometimes.With Dark of the Moon, we follow Sam with a new girlfriend but no job and a frustration of not advancing far in life despite saving the world.twice. In the meantime, the Autobots and the Decepticons race to discover the secrets of a spacecraft that had crashed on the moon many decades ago. This discovery will lead to the most haunting conflicts in the franchise as well as a multitude of surprises and twists and turns. Unlike the first two scripts, which didn't really pack anything juicy other than action scenes, Ehren Kruger's script actually does a great job fixing the Megan Fox dilemma while adding a dosage of much-needed heart with a much more likable cast of characters and less of the embarrassing stereotypes that we had to suffer through in Revenge of the Fallen. The stakes are much higher and the film never really drags along with unnecessary scenes. The final battle did take a while though.......The special effects have always propelled this franchise during the dullest of moments, and they shine once again with Dark of the Moon. If this doesn't get at least an Academy Award nomination, I will be extremely disappointing. Action junkies, you will definitely get your money's worth as a major city becomes a massive battlefield full of nasty destruction and pure mayhem everywhere. In the meantime the Transformer fights, while (once again) minimal, deliver in the visual department. That being said, it was odd to change the blood of the robots from a dark color in the second to a clear red. Not quite sure what they were trying to pull off there. That little note can be pushed aside as we see a gigantic building get torn in half literally and fall on top of another building.The cast in the third was the strongest, and it's mostly because of the small roles. While Shia LaBeouf actually disappointed a bit, the Megan Fox replacement (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) didn't do half-bad with the minimal material she was given. In the meantime, check out the talent in the small roles department: John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong, Leonard Nimoy, John Turturro, Patrick Dempsey (okay, so the last one might be pushing it, but he did well. Honest. Despite being a really...stupid character). Of course, the parents once again weren't in the movie enough (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) and pretty much disappear way before the climax.Here is where the ball is dropped: Transformers 3 is a pretty stupid movie. There is some heart, some soul maybe, but no smarts. Without spoiling too much, some of our characters (heroes and even villains) just make some dumbfounded moves and utterly questionable decisions that defy logic. And then, Michael Bay, once again, falters as a director. He does indeed have a knack for explosions and military-based scenes, but the robots fighting each other (yet again) are sometimes hard to distinguish. And then he does some very questionable things lake fading the screen to black far too many times (in one instance three times in a small scene that wasn't even necessary). I miss 90s Michael Bay, when he kept the action close and crisp, but never too close to a point of getting a headache. He got the carnage and destruction scenes right, but once the action picks up amongst those robots, it becomes a frustrating game of Where's Waldo.Bottom Line: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the best of the three films, but that's still not saying too much as the direction is still shoddy, I still don't care about Shia LeBeouf's character, there is plenty of stupidity sprinkled throughout, and it still just doesn't have the quality factor of the better summer blockbusters we've seen over the decades. While the casting, writing, and special effects improved, we are still treated to strong potential not being met. The main villains (and coolest robots) are still idiotic and reduced to cameos, as Optimus Prime once again does his ""I am going to disappear for a while and then re-appear later to kick some arse"" routine. If you are a Transformer fan, you will probably appreciate this much more, as the transformers (while some reduced to cameos) visually look amazing, and the chaos they create is incredible on the big screen. But if you are looking for quality, you may want to peek elsewhere. For some mindless fun, look no further.And be happy that this is far better than Revenge of the Fallen.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I saw it in theaters with my Dad and it was just awesome. It topped other movies like Harry Potter and also Iron Man off and was an awesome film about robots which i really enjoyed and i pretty much am now a Transformers fan.The thing that i liked in this film is that Micheal Bay did a good job directing the film. If it was not for him, None of the Transformers would have been awesome such as this. But as a director i give him praise and also respect for being such a good director. So i have to admit he was even a lot better and also he directed such a great film.The Decepticons want nothing more then the All-Spark cube for the destruction of our planet. Wanting nothing more then the cube itself. The Autobots join up to help the government with secret missions. But Sam Witwicky and his new girlfriend Carly Spencer are going nowhere when the Decepticons threaten to destroy the earth and with their new leader Sentinel Prime. It's up to Optimus Prime and his friends to save the world once again from a new threat if it's not stopped. Of course The Ark must be stopped because it's technology will destroy the world and ending all life on it if not stopped.The special effects in this film like Buildings collapsing and of course the Autobots fighting with the Decepticons is intense. Almost all the scenes had some perspective to them and a lot of those scenes were amazing. I enjoyed seeing them as they looked so real. And almost CGI like.Also Shia Lebouef is a great actor in this film. He expresses and acts so well that his performance is just unforgettable to watch. And his Talent amazing, He played recently as Mutt Williams in Indina Jones. And played as Sam Witwicky in Transformers. Though he does a good job playing in the Disney TV Show Even Stevens, And of course many more roles in the film Disturbia, And of course in The Battle of Shaker Heights. He was just excellent in this film all by himself.Also Megan Fox is replaced by Victoria Secret's model and Jason Statham's girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whitely. Of course her role and her acting is awesome. But in some scenes she does not act normal like when she's only screaming. She looks great and she is an awesome actress. But Megan Fox was replaced as in the two other films were she was still with Sam but was eventually replaced which was nice too.Although this film definitely has some great fight scenes and the soundtrack that is composed very well i should say is the best. Of course it's not that bad and it sounds a lot better because the music makes it suspenseful and yet violent. But still the fight scenes are really violent no matter what you think. This makes the movie a lot better then it already is.Although the movie is a great film. I would have to say that this is an action packed film and it's a very good one. There are many great funny scenes in it like where Simmons knocks on the door and a Russian Doorman says that means goodbye. It surely makes me laugh every time i see it and the script is very well indeed told and read by the actors which is also nice. But the fact is that if you are a big Transformers fan then you have got to see this movie. It's all based on the toys and the TV Show and of course tops it off in my case. This is even better then Indiana Jones or Iron Man and also is something you have to see to believe. The story is incredible. The characters stay true and react perfectly in each situation. And the entire film and acting is something to be remembered. Everyone is going to love seeing this film like i did in the theater.So if you are wanting to see a superhero flick then look no furthur then to Transformers Dark Of The Moon. It surely is an awesome film and is a great film. It will make you laugh and the director behind it which is Micheal Bay is surely amazing.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

But such an assessment fails to take into account the movies' sense of high-spirited fun, their playful wit and their over-the-top but sometimes amusing caricatures, human and otherwise (I can't speak for the universally reviled second installment, which I haven't seen).Part 3, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" starts with a clever premise: that the original lunar landing was really just an elaborate, for-public-consumption-only ruse to launch a covert operation to explore a spaceship - the one carrying the initial wave of autobots - that had recently crash landed on the surface of the moon. Now a new race of evil bots, known as Decepticons, are becoming activated, threatening to destroy the good bots and take over the earth for their own nefarious purposes.On the human side, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) may have saved the world in the past, but he still can't find a job. But mere unemployment can't keep an honest-to-goodness, dyed-in-the-wool hero from saving humanity once again after the evil creatures pretty much raze Chicago in a literal scorched-earth policy of rampant death and destruction.The one saving grace of the ""Transformer"" movies - which would indeed otherwise be the epitome of soulless movie machines - has been their sense of humor, their refusal to take themselves too seriously (especially the first one). Unfortunately, the wit and fleet-footedness of the first half of ""Dark of the Moon"" dribbles away in a welter of overwrought CGI effects and self-congratulatory seriousness towards the end. And LaBeouf gets stuck playing romantic lead to any number of automatons: his metallic buddies and his flesh-and-blood girlfriend Carly Spencer - and he isn't too terribly convincing in either role.

In fact, I didn't even notice the movie was bad until later. I was so excited watching Optimus and Ironhide that I didn't mind when Prime said he found Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) through eBay. I forgot most of Revenge of the Fallen; barely remember a Decepticon climbing the great pyramid which was just awful. At least had Megan Fox.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is very different. Is not a movie, I can say. Is a carnival, a celebration of stupidity and incoherence. A blatant mockery on the moviegoers. Sincerely, the most exasperating 150 minutes, didn't make it to the last scenes. But I guess Buzz Aldrin did not know.Just like I didn't know either if there was an actual plot in the film. Apparently Michael Bay and Ehren Kruger had an idea involving Apollo 11, Chernobyl and the Trump International Hotel and Tower. They got $195 millions dollars and went through with it. I'm sure they didn't even ask an astrophysics before thinking of teleporting a planet into our exosphere. Absolute madness, some sort of vulgar comedy mixed up with a hottie (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), a lot of special effects and useless characters without persona, that is what this movie is made of.A little bit of light came from Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich), Sam's boss who was genuinely funny. Sad his appearance was kind of short. John Turturro was also entertaining during some point but took big part into the senseless madness as well.Definitely, we've seen the darker side of transformers, not the moon's. These people only cared about their $43,225,329 and this is the film they understood they had to make to achieve them. Congratulations!I know you may think I did not speak about the movie, but trust me is not necessary. If you want to go watch it, go. I did. I just don't think your reaction will be any different than mine if your passionate about movies.Always remember, you can actually loose your faith in Michael Bay.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

That's always a bad sign. Also all the talk about Megan Fox not being in the movie and Shia shooting his mouth off also was tip off. This movie seems to be an excuse to show off an ugly blonde woman who seems not to know that there is any other color clothing but white and wears inappropriate attire to work. Every time I say Rosie Huntington- Whiteley on the screen all I could think of was Edna Mose and her summation of super models ""stupid little stick figures with poofy lips"". Not only is she ugly but she's the worst actress I have ever seen. She and Shia have absolutely no chemistry but Michael Bay must have been in love with her as he shot so many scenes of just her and her body that it started becoming ridiculous.Let me just say from a females perspective, Megan Fox might not have been great but her character was at least well written and we women appreciated the fact that she could get herself out of trouble without Sam. She didn't slow him down and she sure as hell would never have tried to stop him from saving his best and most trusted friend-Bumble Bee. Just for that he should have kicked Carly to the curb.As far as the plot, well we all know there wasn't one. Just one robot battle scene after another. As far as the humor and annoying characters were concerned, it wasn't as bad as Transformers 2. And these characters weren't half as annoying as the supermodel girlfriend. John Malkovich was wasted. Turturro was his usual. Tudyk and Jeong were funny. I really was disappointed that they used Leonard Nimoy the way they did. Some of the special effects were nice.The whole movie just makes you have to ask yourself what was Steven Spielberg thinking when he saw the finished product, hard to believe that he's sunk this far with his craft.3/10","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

The story is riddled with holes, the acting (from some people in particular) is passable, and it has more than its share of moments that make you think ""really?"".That said, this is a great summer action flick. Expect an entertaining, visually and audibly stimulating movie, and your expectations will be exceeded. For all its many, many faults, this Transformers movie is fun and thoroughly entertaining.It has some elements of the first two movies that contribute directly to the plot, but stands alone quite well. Not having seen the first two movies you would not be lost, although seeing the first two would give you a stronger appreciation for where the movie enters, character-wise. Transformers is long on action and short on making sense. Many times during the movie I caught myself wondering ""how did we get here?"". I believe this was the editing, which probably omitted many bridge elements of the story in favor of pacing and effect. Nonetheless, the actions sets are spectacular and, once again, found myself caught up in them cheering till the end.For 2 1/2 hours of escapism, entertainment, and eye candy (in all its forms) I rated it a 7. Withdraw the action sequences and the non-sequitur comedy bits would leave this movie a 2, which should give you some idea the impact these elements play in the overall movie. Have the correct expectation, you won't be disappointed. Expect Olivier playing Henry V, and I'll ask you what in the hell you're doing at a Transformers movie!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought ""I'm the original transformers generation"" (30 something), lets get involved by trying transformers as my 3d debut movie. I have my question answered. I'm never trying 3d again.i'm looking forward to seeing this in regular 2d. Because I completely missed it in the cinema. I was far too busy trying to 'get through' the 3D. I saw T/f 1 and 2, and was entertained by them. I can't even comment on this movie so far, having sat through the entire 3d experience. The only thing going through my brain was ""this 3d stuff is rubbish"".the image i saw wasn't a film, it was like trying to piece together one of those red 3d view-master toy camera's. absolute mind-mess.absolute fail for the 3d. give me an image i can see.Some of the other points i can think of (possible spoilers ahead)Yes I'm not sure how megatron came back. I did think he was knocked off in either of the first two.Also, some new or change of characters needed. The FBI guy you love to hate, was (as far as I can remember) introduced by talking about his memoirs. Kind of had an ""oh you made it into the 3rd film too"" air about it.Also the main (cool scripted) army guy was 'also' in this one. I think I felt a bit sorry for him that he'd made it through all the missiles of the first two and still had to deal with all this lot :)Still quite a lot of dodgy fake tan.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I consider it a Sci-fi masterpiece on a technical level. Revenge of The Fallen wasn't as great as Traansformers but I still loved the film for the battle sequences and of course Megan Fox even though her performance wasn't that great. But Revenge of the Fallen was still a Technical and Box-Office. I only loved this film for the Battle sequences. Dark Of The Moon is the best film of the Trilogy, All of the elements that makes a good Sci-Fi movies you can find them on this movies, what a hell of a movie. Ranks amongst the best films of the year so far. The best thing of all is that The added the element of Drama Darkness, more drama and in a darker way, more serious this is what I mean, all the things that made up ROTF a fair film do not appear on this film, DOTM is the best of all because the elements that made good sci-fi film and is much better than any Transformers film or any film Michael Bay has done, this is the perfect example of a good and modern Sci-Fi Masterpiece.","63 out of 137 found this helpful.

If you are expecting a detailed script, mesmerizing acting and deep/thoughtful story then you are going to leave a bit disappointed.Though if you walk in expecting amazing action sequences, massive explosions and brilliant visuals then you'll leave satisfied. Not saying that all the acting is bad, Shia LaBeouf plays Sam well again and also the comedic performance by Ken Jeong brings life to the film.Even though the film is 2 1/2 hours long, time goes by quickly. If you are looking for a great action packed film to see these holidays I recommend seeing 'Transformers'.Also if you're going to see one 3D film this is the one. I was lucky enough to see the film in IMAX which is definitely the best way to see it as the film really immerses the viewer and you can really feel it, as the cinema shakes for a large percentage of the film. This is one film which really benefits from IMAX.Overall: Don't go see the film if you want a smart and brilliant story. Go see it if you want a good time!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is so much material to cover, that the story starts already at the first minute, wasting no time beating about the bush. The first two ""Transformers"" had brainless plots, but this one has a great plot that engages and thrills throughout. Even though the ending is obligatorily predictable, I still find myself completely glued to the screen, waiting for events to unfold, and more importantly hoping things will turn out alright for the Earth. It's so engaging that I didn't even want to blink, for fear I might miss anything.The special effects are simply breathtaking and jaw dropping. The uninhibited rampage on the city is so awesome. And the 3D is very spectacular, it looks as if I was watching the events in the film live, as if I was there to experience it. Even a trail of dust look so 3D.

Soon we'll have the misfortune of another Ghostrider film despite the fact that the first one stunk. Sequels can be the best thing to ever happen to a film (The Godfather II, Rocky II) or the worst (see any of the Land Before Time series after the first). So, needless to say I wasn't totally excited about the third Transformers film especially since the second film had left me disappointed.I'm happy to report that this third film was a dramatic improvement in several ways over the second. I still feel that the first film was the best, but this film was watchable and even enjoyable. This time the cast includes Shia LeBeouf, Josh Duhamel, and John Turturro. New to the series are John Malkovich, Patrick Dempsey, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.The story follows up on the previous films as the Autobots discover a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden on the Moon. Now they're in a race with the Decepticons to reach it and to learn its secrets. In the meantime Sam (LaBeouf) is struggling with being a normal guy after the role he played in saving the earth. Slowly he finds his way back into the mix with his old friends, human and Transformer, as the Decepticons begin their efforts to rule the world.The film is visually stunning through the action sequences. The CGI and special effects work well as they make each action scene amazing. If you're looking for anything realistic this won't be for you, the fights and destruction are over the top from minute one.The acting is exactly I expected, LaBeouf plays his frustrated Sam much the same way as he did in the previous two films. Gibson and Duhamel manage to shoot enough Decepticons to make their mark in the film. Sam's new flame Carly (Huntington-Whiteley) is weak in the film but I'm fairly sure that she wasn't hired for her acting. Newcomers John Malkovich and Patrick Dempsey are definitely the highlights of the film.If there is any criticism I would say that the effort to leave the door open for a sequel is obvious and may have weakened the ending. It's not a bad film, but like the second film it fails to match the quality of the first film in terms of story.I would recommend this film if you enjoyed the other two in the series. If the second film left you feeling bad this might redeem the franchise a bit. I would give the film a rating of 2.9 stars out of 5.Rating: PG-13 Running Time: 157 minutes","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spend your money on something else.Extended review: Despite having heard nothing good about this film, I was quite excited about going to see it. Transformers was pretty good, Transformers 2 was pretty bad, but I hoped that Michael Bay would at least make something approaching an effort with the third instalment of this money-spinning franchise.Right...here goes...Plot: there actually is one, and if you pay attention during the first soul-destroying hour then you can try to follow it, although by the end of the film you will realise that such plot as there is completely fails to make any logical sense. In a nutshell, Sentinel Prime (an Autobot) was escaping from Cybertron with some new technology, but the Decepticons shot up his ship and he drifted through space until he crashed into the moon. Later it transpires that Sentinel had made a pact with Megatron to work together, so why then was his ship being attacked at all?? Some nonsense about the space programme is chucked in to confuse and add idiocy.Characters: Sam Witwitless returns as the slightly unconvincing wet who has amazingly attracted a model as his new ho. He continues to be annoying at every turn. His wench (I cannot even remember her name) is paper thin with no personality. The CGI characters are, as one would expect, almost completely lacking depth, aside from the fact that I went to see this film in 3d. Sam's parents return briefly for no obvious reason to reprise their roles and earn a few quid. There are some other characters but nobody who stands out in any way. Towards the end it is very difficult to distinguish between individual transformers as they start to all look the same.Acting: Shia Lebeef manages to struggle unconvincingly throughout the film, although excels himself when being ""terrified"". Rosie Huntingdon-Poshbird doesn't act at all, simply because she clearly cannot. The long, lingering shots of her bum and legs at the beginning of the film clearly indicate why she was chosen - in fairness, she is quite tasty for a skinny bird, although after the first 30 minutes of the film her permanent pouty-lipped look makes you want to put a paper bag over her face, or at least a photo of Megan Fox. Mr Spok (Leonard Nimoy) is an interesting choice for the voice of Sentinel Prime. Overall the standard of acting is somewhat low, as one would expect.Effects: There are lots of amazing CGI effects and stuff but personally I would have preferred 50% of the CGI budget to have been spent on the screenplay.Soundtrack: Lots of overly cheesy music utterly spoils what atmosphere was present. Way too loud, too.Length: At 2.5 hours long, this film is a killer. The first hour contained nothing of note and could have been put in the bin. At 90 minutes the film could have been slightly watchable.One last thing: I would really like my money back. This film is on a par with National Lampoon's Men In White.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

I love this movie to death. It is my second best favorite Transformers movie in the series. I enjoy this movie so much and I just wasn't bored. I have enjoyed about anything that has to do with big robots and even bigger explosions! I know people will disagree with me and put my review down, but this movie was OK and it was far from disappointment! It was Miles better than Revenge of the Fallen and Age of Extinction those two movies were just awful horrible. This one was just big improvement over the second one and the next fourth one sequel. I could really got in the story. It was about Autobots who found Sentinel Prime Optimus the last predecessor and the leader of the Autobots, who later betrayed Optimus Prime and Autobots by making ages ago a deal with Megatron, he formed alliance with the Megatron and Decepticons who wanted to re build Cybertron with pillars that could open a bridge through space and time on our planet and enslave all humans on our world. Together with Megatron they would rule the planet and all Autobots would be exiled from the planet Earth. Sam and Autobots must fight once again. I love the music that they put it in this movie, action and I like the scene with Patrick Dempsey and Sam fighting each other, that was GREAT! Other than that though, as far as entertainment and emotion goes, this was a perfect movie. CGI of robots were good, they weren't bad. I know everything about this movie what is about. It is the last good Transformers movie and the last time we see the crew from the previous movies together. The action was really great, I love the action scenes, the explosions and the story, the plot about this movie isn't terrible or confusing at all, it is good. Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky did outstanding job as always it is the last time in the movie we see him. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly Spencer did a wonderful performance as Sam's new girlfriend. She wasn't annoying, or such a bimbo diva like stupid shallow Megan Fox, she was beautiful and her performance was outstanding. She wasn't hot, she was convincing actress and I didn't thought anything bad about her. Thank god for Michael Bay replacing Megan Fox with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, I am so glad Megan was gone. Rosie was miles way better than Megan Fox was. John Turturro as Seymour Simmons did a fantastic job portraying once again his character, he gave us an outstanding performance. Patrick Dempsey as Dylan Gould as the main antagonist did an outstanding acting performance as the second villain and Megatron's second in command henchman. This is the second time Patrick Dempsey reunite and work together with Ehren Kruger. He already worked with Ehren Kruger on the third slasher horror film Scream 3 (2000.Critics are way too hard on Michael Bay! He has said himself that he just wants to make crowd-pleasing movies, and ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" has done exactly that! This film has made 1.1 BILLION dollars at the box-office; and for a good reason. So what if it doesn't have Oscar-worthy performances, and had a few bad jokes here and there. I LOVE those two movies. And the fun part about the latest entry in the series is that I actually did find something deep with it. This film had several emotional moments, and I found myself welling up with tears. And the fantastic score by Steve Jablonsky fit in very well with it.The movie had a lot of mistakes and holes that I didn't understand. I thought the mythology of the Autobots was already explained in Transformers (2007). Megatron and Shockwave did not had enough screen time in here. The blond women Frances McDormand as Charlotte Mearing Director of NSA was annoying, she annoyed me too much. She blamed Optimus Prime for Sentinel Prime destroying NEST's base and making off with the five pillars. She had no respect to Autobots at all. They saved Earth twice and that was a big thank you for it. I did not like that. When the shuttle Xantium rocket was shot down and destroyed by Starscream, in which one of the booster rockets where the Autobots hidden? Because I only saw one rocket taking off in the air and not two. And in what Ocean the rocket fall? And how did the Autobots come back from water if they can't swim and than they mystery appeared in Chicago so soon, this confuses me so much. A mysterious event from Earth's past threatens to ignite a war so big that the TRANSFORMERS alone will not be able to save the planet. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and the AUTOBOTS must fight against the darkness to defend our world from the DECEPTICONS all-consuming evil in the smash hit from director Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg. That is the main plot of the third entry of the action sequel science fiction film! The rating of this film I gave is 8/10 this film deserves it! Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a 2011 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line.

The film was the last film to have Shia LaBeouf in the film as Sam Witwicky and the end of the original trilogy of films.The film is set three years after the events of the 2009 film, with the Autobots, during the collaboration with the NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers) military force, discovering a hidden alien technology in possession of humans, which had been found by Apollo 11 on the years earlier. However, the Decepticons unveil a plan use the technology to enslave humanity in order to restore Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers.The story was a really good story and it took inspiration from a novel called Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday, written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel was a prequel to the 2007 film, TRANSFORMERS. Due to the critically panned REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, the Twins were cut out of ""Dark of the Moon"".The acting is just amazing, but can get dreadful. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky one last time and he does a great job. Megan Fox was originally signed on to play Mikaela Banes in the third film, and Patrick Dempsey's character Dylan Gould was to be the employer of Fox's character, but she was fired, instead Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays Carly Spencer and she does a great job.She is not as good as Fox but considering the shoes that she had to fill, she could have been a hell of a lot worse. Josh Duhamel, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and the rest of the cast are great in their performances, especially Tyrese Gibson, who was also in another 2011 film, Fast Five, which I previously reviewed.The CGI is amazing and the action is so fantastic in this film and the best part is at the end of the film, and it was so long but I enjoyed it and the film is 154 minute long feature film.The music by Steve Jablonsky is fantastic and much more cool and amazing was Linkin Park's song at the end of this movie.Overall, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON is not the best Transformers film, but it could have been worse.6/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It really showed the origin of the conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons.Shortly after that, there was too much of the human element in the first quarter of the movie. It gets kind of annoying when the human characters are being developed instead of the Transformer characters developing.But despite the overwhelming time spent with the character development, it was made up for by the second half of the movie. It was almost non-stop action and fighting sequences. Megatron, once again, really did not have that much influence on the plot of the movie. It just does not make sense why he is not utilized much more than what he is in this movie and even the two previous ones.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It had nearly all the elements which Revenge of the Fallen would go on to run into the ground. Dark of the Moon somewhat rectifies this, but still leaves a rancid taste in your mouth. The humor is still obnoxious and overused, Megan Fox's replacement is only somewhat less annoying, and the Decepticons have only regained some menace, but still remain paper machete targets for the Autobots and military. The camera work makes battles extremely hard to watch, not that you're missing out given Decepticons are simply punching bags these days. This movie really can't decide if it wants to be a Saturday morning cartoon promoting Hasbro toys or a series of raunchy jokes followed by scenes of robot organs being ripped out. Still it has some perks. The CGI is better than ever and there were two fights I actually enjoyed. If you want to see giant robots battling it out, see it if you must, but you're better off watching the first film or Pacific Rim.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I wanted this movie to be a fun action packed movie that played to Michael Bay's strengths (Lets face the facts , Michael Bay's main strength is that he's good at directing over the top action scenes) , to be fair the movie offers what I and the majority of the audience wanted ...in the last third of the movie.The first two thirds of this movie is like they didn't learn from the mistakes of the atrocious second movie 'revenge of the fallen' . The one saving grace is that racially insensitive robots allow it would have been great comic relief if the movie had them been crushed alive instead.The story is not my main quarrel with this movie. That been said its not a clever story. In all honesty it doesn't have to be though. Transformers movies have never been praised for innovative , new ideas like inception , or ideas that seem possible and encourage the mind to push the known boundaries of science and engineering (like star trek or space odyssey) . The transformers creators and audience know that the stories come second to the action in their movies. Thats fine in a movie like this. It doesn't have to be clever. It can be an entertaining thrill ride can knows what audience it wants to please.This movie though is a mess... Its not the story that I have a problem with.. Its the filler. The movie seems to be filled with an never ending stream of annoying characters. The least annoying character for me was the female lead (played by Rosie-huntington whitley) and the lead soldiers. There characters did not necessarily have a lot of dialogue . Believe it or not thats why I preferred them to the rest of the human characters. The first half of this movie plays like a horrible comedy that only gives you glimpses of the autobots and decepticons (which is honestly what everyone came to see....that and rosie huntington)...No one wanted to see lame jokes and characters belch out fast paced , incomprehensible dialogue. I find the dialogue annoying, very annoying , and thats my major quarrel with this movie. It spends around half the film with these annoying characters spewing words very quickly but rather unintelligibly .For example what was with the Asian who cornered sam in a bathroom... I could not understand a word of what he said...It was like he overdosed on speed (like a lot of these characters mind you).Everything in the third part was what I wanted from the movie , overpriced but great action scenes and I fairly badass fight for Chicago... that will never be enough however to make up for the first half or two thirds... You cant say this movie is good solely because of the end... Two-thirds of this movie felt like a wasted opportunity.I came into this movie saying what every person who liked the second movie said to me ''It's just a movie , Its supposed to be a stupid but fun action packed ride'' ... and now going to simply say to those people ... I wanted for the real action to come and it took ages , a movie can be dumb but It doesn't have to waste my time with pointless things that no one wants to see...So yeah if those people want to waste their own time with mind numbling stupid dialogue then step right in folks.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Squared. Truly impressive movie. Bay has surpassed himself. We know what is expected from these films and it gets in large quantities. The explosions, action, tension, ... For me, by far the best 3D movie I've seen. A few times during the film's dream thought, that scene or how this is impressive or how did they record that scene. You can spit on the story, if you like, or acting, but the spectacle is nothing to do personally. Women are not even kept her as much as would be expected. Subtract that. Eyesore to me was John Malkovich, who had such a small and insignificant role in the film, I do not know what he needed, though he cast away the strongest of all these characters. Also this was my first 3D movie with new glasses that are excellent, light and nothing to obscure the image unlike those of past huge glasses. If you like robots, action, explosions, spectacle, you have two and a half hour of pure amusement. I love robots. I must also worth mentioning that dream paid far the most expensive ticket for the cinema in your life, what pisses me off, but here, it was worth it.

I was wrong.The action sequences were loud and fun just like they should be, but the rest was actually so bad it was funny. Every line of the dialog was incredibly cheesy. Another hindering factor is it's length. Clocking in at just over two and a half hours, all the other crap can get you bored quickly.

Nevertheless i couldn't get much joy out of this movie.On the good side i found that the ""robot action"" is roughly the same than in the previous two movies, so if that's your thing you can cat least enjoy these parts. It's also a plus that they dropped the shaky cam combat shots altogether and added some beautiful slow-mo photography.Unfortunately i couldn't find more positive aspects of this movie. The dialogue was mind-blowing stupid. The verbal fights between Witwicky and the ""intelligence boss lady"" Mearing, allegedly a veteran CIA operative, where so childish and doting that several people in the theater where moaning loudly. The plots of the villains (e.g. Dylan) where so one-dimensional and naive that they should be doubtful even for teenagers. No motives explained, no safeguarding, no leverage, ... nothing! Every comic book villain is more fleshed out.The relationship between Witwicky and Carly Spencer was equally immature and very superficial. Which probably was a good thing...Probably the worst part of the movie have been the constant comical relief attempts. Agent Simmons even more over the top and unbelievable than in the previous movies, the two small transformers as cliché sidekicks, the stupid ""espionage watch"" which constantly hinders Witwicky in actually doing some real espionage, the ridiculous behavior at the job interviews, ...To sum it all up, i can not recommend this movie to anybody past puberty, and even the more clever kids will probably find the plot laughable.3 stars for the expected ""giant robots fighting"", which was delivered.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The sound and acting is also good. The movie continues the story from where transformers 2 left and fills some blanks along the way. A simple story which does drag a bit towards the middle, but the final half hour is a fun ride. There are a few twists and turns in the story, but very predictable ones. There is some amazing action towards the conclusion which leaves you wanting more.What i thought missing the most was Megan Fox. The new actress was just not a fitting replacement for her.I hope they bring her back for the next movie.Overall the movie will entertain you and certainly worth the admission price.

Too late because now my money adds to the $190m this film has already made so the joke is on me.There is insufficient chemistry between Sam and the very attractive damsel in distress to warrant an entire theatre sitting through his attempts to get to her to save her. Watching them run to each other at the end made little sense since he was with her through the end of the movie ... not sure what was the need for a dramatic reunion. This coupled with the fact that through the film Sam had no real connection to any of the autobots (especially Bumblebee) to make you feel anything made the film hollow.The plot was particularly weak (or perhaps poorly executed) so by the time the twist in the plot came around, it made for awful cinema. The writers for this movie need to look for another profession. There were some unreal moments in the movie that should have been on the cutting floor of the editing, particularly when Carly stands up in the heat of an intense battle scene as she gets an idea, and somehow her hair blows in the wind as she pouts ... can't believe a director yelled ""And action!!!!!"" at the start of that action sequence!I am not sure how many times I counted Carley's shoes changing from heels to flat shoes .... and I'm not sure how she got jeans on when she was abducted in white pants .... She runs for hours and maintains the best hair ... realism and continuity wasn't too big on the agendaGreat CG of course so they should give the graphics team a big fat bonus ... Great explosion, lots of fake glass everywhere, Tomohawk missiles save the day .... overall I would give it 3 out of 10 ....","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Usually, with a bad movie, it is easy to say, ""It is bad because of this, this, and this,"" but with Framstorners: Bark at the Moon, the problem is that everything in it is terrible.The basic storyline is not too bad, and in the hands of another director, it could have been a decent 90 minute action sci-fi movie. Michael Bay makes it 60 minutes too long, and fills it with a bunch of Michael Bay rubbish that does not need to be there.Other reviewers have done an excellent job of pointing out the many different reasons why this movie is horrible. I think that Michael Bay has been injecting testosterone directly into his brain stem, and it has made him insane. How else could someone make a huge-budget movie and not care about plot, characters, dialog, physics, or having even a tiny shred of respect for his audience?And to top it off, why does everyone in the film have orange skin tones?

This is easily one of the best films in the Transformers franchise. It makes many improvements off of the second film getting rid of those awkward and disgusting shots and Megan Fox. The plot of this films is very interesting. You really feel for these Autobots and human characters in this film in the final epic battle. The final hour long battle is the best hour of a transformers film because it gives people what they came to see, Transformers action! In this final battle you really feel the terror and the genuine fear that comes from the deceptions blasting citizens of Chicago as they go along. But again most of its flaws come from the human characters the only engaging human character really is Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). The performance from the actress who played Carla Sam's new girlfriend is awful worse than Megan Fox was in Revenge of the Fallen and the original film. I also found myself very uninterested in the subplot of Carly's boss. They keep the parents out for the majority of the film which I thank them for they were extremely annoying in the first 2 especially in ROTF. The inclusion of so much Transformers action and heartfelt and meaningful moments with the Autobots is this movies strongpoint. Overall a good Transformers film an improvement of off the previous film. 7/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

When you go and buy tickets for a transformer movie you shouldn't expect an amazingly build movie with a really smart plot. No you go in because you want to sit back and enjoy some mindless action with giant robots whom are fighting each other or because you have children who want that. Oh boy and does it deliver, it has its moments throughout the movie but the ending is just non stop action and great action at that. Micheal bay did really live up to his reputation and made the most Micheal bay movie you've ever seen. So if you're someone who seeks a movie full of action then I can't recommend a better franchise/movie. People who go in and expect to see a intricate and smart movie about giant robots who can transform in vehicles shouldn't even be allowed to rate it.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It suddenly jumps from the main plot to Sam's life, and vice-versa, which gives you impression that your watching an action-movie with commercials on TV. No matter how hard you try to get yourself suck in it, BOREDOM still dominates. But 1 scene has actually impressed me.

If so, I wonder if they (or he) is aware of the old phrase ""three strikes and you're out!"" I am also kind of hoping that has some coherence in the filmmaking industry, for that means I shall never have to endure another one of these overproduced, headache-inducing clumps of schlock again. Michael Bay has struck out three times now and I hope he stays on the bench.It's never been the premise of the ""Transformers"" trilogy, all directed by Michael Bay, that I've had trouble with. On the contrary, it was a setup that I really rooted for. It was the execution that I've always had problems with. The lumpy writing, the overblown running time, the unfunny (and mildly offensive) so-called humor, the action scenes so poorly directed that it was hard for me to even appreciate the skill and craftsmanship required to bring them to life.My criticisms of the first two movies return once again for the third (and hopefully final) installment, embarrassingly titled ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" As it turns out, when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, it was to exploit an alien spacecraft piloted by refugees from the robotic planet Cybertron. Flash-forward to present day and we have Sam Witwicky (still played by Shia LaBeouf) with a new girlfriend (Rosie Huntingly-Whitely) and a bigger egomania than ever. When Decepticons start popping up all over the world again, he comes to discover that they are planning to revive their fallen planet. From there, the plot continues to thicken, all the way up to a preposterously boring climax which stretches a seemingly endless forty-five-minute stretch and wrapping up with a cold, lifeless halt instead of a rousing conclusion.Like the two movies that came before it, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" has amazing visual effects. The transfiguring mechanical titans are blended seamlessly into the live-action backgrounds and with their flesh-and-blood costars. There is hardly a single weak special effects shot in the movie, and there are hundreds of them. And yet Michael Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger once again choose to toss their intrinsic awe and power out of the window in favor of overpopulated, bland stick-figure human characters. There are not only too many human characters in the movie, but they are all very badly-written and oftentimes poorly-acted. Even Mr. LaBeouf, who was charismatic in the first movie, is obnoxious here as all he has to do is act pompous and schizophrenic and shout all of his dialogue until his voice goes raw. Even great talents like Kevin Dunn, Josh Duhamel, Frances McDormand, even John Malkovich, are given excess screen time to do next to nothing. Gone is Megan Fox and that is a shame, for her replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a complete bore. Not only is she resorted to just standing around and screaming while the camera lasciviously ogles at her lower extremities, but unlike Miss Fox, she does not have any real star quality. I did not think Megan Fox's performances in the first two movies were particularly good, but there was a budding talent, a promise that she would one day become a considerate actress.I never got that sensation once with Miss Huntington-Whiteley.There's not one character who is interesting enough to deserve so much attention, and yet Mr. Bay lingers upon them consistently, over and over again. And when the transformers are on-screen, they have nothing to do either. They don't do any more than what they did the first two times around, which is change forms, make sloppy cultural jokes, and mutter pseudo-intellectual mumbo jumbo. When they take each other on, director Bay shoots everything at such close angles and so fast that it was impossible for me to tell which robot was on which side, who was transformed and who was not, which robot was betraying his side and who was not, who had died and who had survived, and bottom line, I just did not care. And that cheap gimmick of an action scene first playing at regular speed, them all of a sudden slowing down, and returning to normal pace does not wow here. It didn't work before Mr. Bay used it and it certainly doesn't work now that he is using it.Now I will admit there were a couple of nifty moments that I did like. And guess what? They did revolve around the special effects. An out-of-the-blue battle on the highway scene, with Mr. LaBeouf being tossed out of his transformer-car and then caught again was quite thrilling, as were the scenes with a new robot equipped with giant worm-like tentacles. I wish he had been in more of the movie. But as a totality, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is just another clanging, obscenely overproduced mess from an aggressively misguided director. It clangs and clangs for a punishing 157 minutes, which seems like twice that long, and then cuts off without really ending. But that's fine with me, because I would rather not revisit this same scenario again.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Anyways, Bay, also known as Michael 'oh-look-at-meee' Bay - needs a lot of supervision when making movies. He can shoot a car chase and military paraphernalia, but other than that, nothing else. I was traumatised as a kid way back in 1986 when I watched Optimus and his old skool Autobot buddies get killed in The Movie; sadly to say I am once again traumatised watching this Bayhem of a Transformers franchise. I am slowly recovering knowing the Bayhem trilogy has ended. This Bayhem franchise reminds me of when Batman was with Clooney and Kilmer; so hopefully the next reboot will be how Nolan did to the Batman franchise. Transformers Begins perhaps. Dark Robot?

The third and final film in the first Transformers trilogy. Although Bay's immature elements remain, the film as a whole gets serious, gets darker, and involves the Apollo missions to the moon, where the real Buzz Aldrin, one of the famous astronauts who went to the moon, meets Optimus Prime. Also documentary of Kennedy and also of the news of that time about the Apollo missions are shown in the movie. Things are much darker than the dark side of the moon, since the secret that exists there hides it very well on earth. People who have worked for the Decepticons for years in secret, assassinations of witnesses, Chernobyl and much more are connected to each other in the top film of all Transformers. The secrecy and the whole style reminded me a little of They Live (1988), where people worked for the aliens for years since they thought they would be the final winners. A much more serious invasion film, with the occupation of the city of Chicago and the attempt to enslave humanity. There is, however, the light element, as well as a great romance with a new protagonist, a model, while the other main protagonists, Sam, Agent Simmons, Lennox, Epps, etc., remain the same. The only negative part of the film is that the villain of the film is not very convincing, while Megatron comes in second role and weaker than in the other two films. On the plus side of the transformers, the terrifying and intelligent Shockwave with the huge robot drill and the scene in the skyscraper that is also the best of the film, and one of the top in the whole trilogy. In the rest, top directing, effects, action, emotion, and wonderful music once again from Linkin Park and Steve Jablonsky. By far the best film not only of the first trilogy, but also of all Transformers to date. Recommended for everyone.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was so embarrassingly bad I could hardly fathom it; but I ended up going to the new movie against my better judgement, primarily because I wanted to see the trailer for Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol up on the big screen (which did not disappoint by the way, Brad Bird's live action debut looks amazing). To my surprise, though, Dark of the Moon was not terrible, and all things considered was actually pretty good. So when it comes to critiquing a Michael Bay film, you can't really treat it like anything else. There's a certain level of expectation that comes with one of his movies, and that involves a lot of explosions, and not a lot of plot. And when it comes to explosions, giant robots, and epic action sequences, this movie does not disappoint, however, for a Michael Bay film, Dark of the Moon is surprisingly talky and I'm still not sure whether or not that's a good thing. The first two acts of the film contain relatively few big action set pieces, and mostly attempts to set the stage for everything that happens in the film's final act. On one hand I appreciate that this film actually attempts to tell a story rather than Revenge of the Fallen's method of ""look, here's robots fighting in China for no reason! Ooh, and now they're fighting in Egypt for no reason!"" but on the other hand the film kind of drags at times in the first two acts because none of the characters are particularly compelling. Normally I would not criticize a film for spending more time on story and characters than on eye candy, and I do commend the filmmakers for telling a coherent story this time around, but they could have easily trimmed some time from the first two acts and focused more on the battle for Earth between the Autobots and Decepticons. When we finally do get to the good stuff in the final act, the action and the scale is certainly epic, but parts of it feel hollow. What we're seeing is cool, but none of it carries any weight; what should be a rousing finale to a series rings a bit flat because there was not a proper build up to it. Yes, this movie spent a long time setting up the finale, and they did it as well as they could, but for the kind of impact they were clearly going for the series needs to build up to it from the get go. This is my biggest problem with the film, it's not the shallow characters, the massive plot holes, or the annoying comic relief characters; those are all par for the course with a movie like this. My biggest complaint is that Transformers did not have the ambition or the foresight to build any sort of arc into the trilogy. Almost nothing from the first two films has any impact on the events of this film (the second film is particularly overlooked). This does not feel like Transformers 3, it feels like Transformers: Yeah, We Did Another One. When you make a trilogy like this, it's essential to have a narrative that ties them together. The reason Return of the King is so powerful as a conclusion because the rest of The Lord of the Rings builds up to it, the same goes for the Star Wars trilogy, even the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy creates an arc for its story and its characters so that the ending feels like the culmination of everything, not just another ending of another movie. In my opinion, that is the biggest area where Transformers: Dark of the Moon fails, that it does not build on any established narrative, but instead goes in an entirely new direction and therefore feels less satisfying than it could have. Again, though, this is Michael Bay's Transformers, so to expect that kind of foresight to go into it is a bit silly. So let's shift gears and focus on some things I did like. This movie, has far less embarrassingly juvenile humor than either of the previous films (THANK GOD!). Oh, there's still some in there, but we don't have anything as facepalm worthy as masturbation jokes, Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro, Mudflap and Skids, or ""I'm underneath the enemy's...scrotum."" Outside of the juvenile humor though, there are some things are actually legitimately funny John Malkovich has a fun, albeit brief, role in the film, and Shia LeBeouf has some great interaction with a character played by Patrick Dempsey. I was also impressed that there were one or two plot twists in this film that actually managed to surprise me. It was nothing super heady, but the script was at least intelligent enough to keep you on your toes, even if just a little bit. And of course the visual effects work by ILM was amazing, and is a shoe-in for the VFX Oscar this year.So all in all Transformers: Dark of the Moon was an enjoyable film. It vastly exceeded my expectations based on what we got with the last film, and while not as satisfying as it could have been still had plenty of cool action sequences and fun moments. If you liked the first Transformers at all I would recommend it, if not, than this isn't going to change your opinion on the series at all.

It had poor acting, casting, and sequences. Whaah! The movie involves, now unemployed, Sam as he uncovers a Decepticon plan that could end the world. He tries to confront the government along with the Autobots, but no one listens for some reason. Then things get out of control.Where to start? Casting! As stated by others, our hapless semi-hero, Sam is dating a collagen infused model who works for a billionaire who gives her a multi-hundred-thousand-dollar car?! The Decepticons somehow keep getting these ridiculously powerful additions, while the Autobots get weak comic relief. Shia is still Shia--who is annoying and frustrating. All of the old characters return and Bumblebee is still the fave--funny because he doesn't talk.The story could have been interesting, if they would have focused on it instead of slow motion explosions and long, boring scenes that include being slung through a building by a robotic snake for what seemed like an eternity. Worst of all was the repeated placement of Sam's parents throughout the movie. I mean, in the midst of the looming danger, Sam talks to his parents about relationship issues! I fast forwarded through it and lost nothing.Other dumb things: Sam does parkour through Chicago. The decisions of the US officials were idiotic and only served to drag out the film. I was dumb for watching it (even though it was free).This movie was trash and Michael Bay continues with his efforts of essentially making movies that have the feel of a 2-hour beer commercial.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"8","/10","""Dark of the Moon"" is the Real ""Transformers"" Film!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450975/?ref_=tt_urv","aaronjbong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22836725/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2011","The first ""Transformers"" was an enjoyable experience back in 2007. Even though it wasn't great, it was still a great experience watching the film. But the second one back in 2009 had a considerable drop in terms of quality from the first film. Even Michael Bay accepted the fact that ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was a sequel with a precipitous drop in terms of quality from the first film. Then ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was announced with Bay promising that it would be a good film. And yet, it is. ""Dark of the Moon"" is a significant improvement from ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and is absolutely the best installment of the franchise.As its predecessors, ""Dark of the Moon"" has a mediocre plot. As mediocre it is, this is how it goes. Back when Apollo 11 landed, Neil Armstrong and crew were given a top secret mission to investigate a Cybertronian spacecraft that had crash landed on the Moon years ago. They discover several robots and kept the operation secret for a long time. Later, the Autobots and Decepticons learn of its existence and race to get it which can lead into two results; if the Autobots get it, the world is saved, if the Decepticons obtain it, humans will be enslaved and Earth will be used as the base to rebuilding Cybertron which would result in the destruction of most of Earth.""Dark of the Moon"" will take us deeper into the origins of Cybertron. This third installment will include much more robots, and most of them are much cooler than what's already in the previous two films. One takes the form of a Ferrari, one's some sort of professor, one's a gigantic snake-like form driller that's around ten times the size of Optimus Prime, one's super ancient, and there's much more. These robots take the action to new levels and will get our hearts racing so fast like never before. The acting, however was normal. Shia LaBeouf was great in portraying the role of Sam Witwicky. The others were also okay. But newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley seems to have a lack of experience in acting. But anyways, the result here is what you get for casting a new actress who's new to the world of acting, and for one who's new to acting, it's not that bad. The script was kind of awkward though. There were some scenes that were confusing and made me lose track of where the film is heading. Sometimes, these convoluted scenes force the characters to say strange things and I found it really annoying. ""Dark of the Moon"" loses points in the shifting of scenes. Sometimes, they make the film look awkward and not really enjoyable as it could be. Here's an example (no spoilers): Optimus Prime talks about something very serious that relates to the fate of the whole world INTO Sam finding a job with humor. Definitely ironic. But besides all those, ""Dark of the Moon"" is definitely a fun ride to experience. The climax of the film takes up almost an hour and is definitely satisfying. The huge and dangerous robots compliment to the thrill levels of the fight scenes. The fight scenes are super awesome!The 3D in this film was acceptable, although it wasn't exceptional. Depth was sometimes conspicuous, though. But at other times, the robots and the explosions were out of the screen. But definitely, the scene which had the most amazing 3D effects were when the title showed up during the beginning of the film. That was amazing! The special effects in one word: amazing! There's no need to complain about that. The robots, the explosions, the fires, were simply amazing. But what was shocking, and funny, was how they used CGI to create the face of John F. Kennedy during one short scene. The face was clearly different from the others' faces. But good try though. Through halfway of the film, expect some reminders of disaster films such as ""2012"" as well as ""Terminator Salvation"". But what amuses me in these scenes are: where are all the people. I mean, it was only a few minutes after the destruction of the world began, and the terrified people only started running away. But then, minutes later, millions of people started to vanish and barely any person was there. But anyways, that doesn't matter. ""Dark of the Moon"" is satisfying. To wrap things up, ""Dark of the Moon"" is simply a great film and definitely worth watching. I know ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was a bummer but ""Dark of the Moon"" will replace that horror. 3D is not a bad choice to watch this film. I truly recommend watching this film. But remember, don't get the expectations too high. If you do so, you'll be really disappointed with this film. Michael Bay's promise is fulfilled. ""Dark of the Moon"" delivers. It is absolutely the real ""Transformers"" film we've been waiting since 2007. Prince AJB's Rating: 8/10 (Great)Thank you for reading my review on ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". I do hope that this review is useful for you to read.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

A little more consistency would've taken at least an hour off the plot, and I'm not talking about the endless end-fight only. The main story is nice 'n complicated. Lots of inconsistencies to keep it going, but nice in itself. The inconsistencies are pretty tolerable although they're clearly meant to augment the uptime. My girlfriend fell asleep during the end-sequence about five times, while suffering insomnia as I do, I could only think ""take out that goddamn tower, Optimus, so we can get on with the rest of the evening we planned."" Get it digitally and watch the main story till about 1h50', then feel free to skip 5' from time to time, you won't miss out. A cut version, about 1h30', would be pure genius, smashing action and storyline, never wasting watcher's time and giving us our money's worth.

Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and most of the rest of the cast are back. With one obvious exception of course; Megan Fox. Due to conflict with the film's producers (Bay and Steven Spielberg) Fox was fired from the project. She's been replaced by popular Victoria's Secret's model Rosie Huntington Whiteley (who has worked with Bay before on a 2009 Victoria's Secret commercial). Also new to this film are John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, Ken Jeong and others. Ehren Kruger (who co-wrote the last installment) returns as the sole scriptwriter this time around. The film is once again (like all of Bay's films) loud, obnoxious and relentlessly in your face. It's also a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing.This adventure begins in 1961 while the Autobot's and Deceptions still wage war on their home planet of Cybertron. An aging Autobot known as Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, who also voiced the character Galvatron in 'THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE' 1986 animated film) escapes the planet with special teleportation technology called Pillars that could end the war for good. He crash lands on the moon and has been wrecked there ever since. When Optimus Prime (once again voiced by the legendary voice actor Peter Cullen) learns that the U.S. government has known about Sentinel's whereabouts and the Pillars for some time he becomes extremely angry and makes it his mission to bring Sentinel home to Earth. The Decepticons meanwhile lay in wait, waiting for the appropriate time to strike and seize control of the Pillars. Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf reprising his most famous role) at the same time is struggling with unemployment (even though he helped save the world twice and earned a medal from President Obama) and feelings of inadequacy while trying to impress his new super hot girlfriend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley).The story is once again pretty simple but things still seem to get very convoluted and hard to follow (in classic Michael Bay fashion). The film always moves at breakneck speeds regardless of what's going on (whether it's a simple dialogue scene or an elaborate action spectacle). It jumps from slapstick comedy to emotional drama to explosive action, without a moment's pause, and back again (constantly). The whole thing becomes very exhausting (like all of Bay's films) and you really need some strong caffeine or some kind of drug (whatever LaBeouf is on) to keep up with it. This kind of material can definitely leave the viewer with a severe headache if they're not in the right mindset. With that said the movie is still a heck of a lot of fun and you get far more than your money's worth (there's so much going on). The scam is that it takes you three or four times of seeing the film just to process it all. The action scenes are breathtaking, the 3D visuals are arguably the best since 'AVATAR' and the comedy for the most part is very funny. The script is a complete mess but that's not really important with this type of film. LaBeouf's shtick is getting a little old but for me it still works. The guy has so much energy and is still hilarious in the right role (and Witwicky is the perfect showcase for LaBeouf's comedic and improvisational talents). Some people hate the parent characters but in my opinion Kevin Dunn and Julie White are always scene stealers in these films. Huntington-Whitely does a good job of looking extremely glamorous and beautiful (and that's all she really has to do) but I still prefer Megan Fox (or anyone more real). Bay's directing is once again Bay's directing; you either love it or hate it. I personally love it. Seeing one of his films is a very unique experience and it is almost like being on drugs in a way. It's mind-blowing! I love creative independent films made for next to nothing but I also love big visually exploitative films (made on budgets of 2 to 300 million dollars). I think there's room for both types of film-making in the marketplace and one style doesn't hurt the other. They can co-exist! If you enjoy these types of films you'll definitely enjoy this one too.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeZHJaLfc8","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first film was average at best, and the sequel would have been the worst film of 2009 if not for the hopelessly unengaging Terminator: Salvation. Unfortunately, Dark Of The Moon fares no better than its predecessors, not to say that I had high expectations in the first place.Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky, the anonymous hero of the human race and co-leader of the Autobots. For the most part, peace has been restored with the Autobots now working as covert operatives solving international conflict for the U.S government. But when a decades-long secret hidden on the moon becomes known, the Decepticons return to wage war against their ancient enemy and relocate their home planet of Cybertron to Earth.Scorsese, Tarantino, Aronofsky, Spielbergall major directors of the modern age have gotten to be just that big on the back of reputation, and a toolbox of film techniques that they use to leave their mark on every project. Michael Bay could also be included among these filmmakers, but for all the wrong reasons. His films are typified by shallow characters, gratuitous explosions and a script that feels like it was written the night before the film's first screening. All of these traits are on full display in this film, and are just one part of why this movie is so disappointing.At a little over two and a half hours, this is the longest film of the trilogy, and doesn't it feel that way. The entire film plods along with unnecessary opening scenes and a mind-numbing final set piece. The whole First Act, and most of the Second, is centred on Sam and new girlfriend Carly's personal life, dealing with his failed efforts to get a job, and growing paranoia stemming from Carly's friendship with her boss. You would expect these useless scenes to result in a rushed conclusion, if not for the fact that the climax is also painfully drawn out. This might sound primitive, but I can only watch robots fighting each other for so long before it gets repetitive and I begin to lose interest in exactly who's fighting who, and why. But not all the blame rests with Bay. Writer Ehren Kruger delivers an uninspired script packed with action-hero clichés and one-liners that are just plain lame. If you want to give the goodies the odd 'tough-guy' line then do so, but don't have a two-on-two battle won by the Autobots end with 'class dismissed'. I don't expect Oscar-winning writing from these kinds of films, just enough creativity to keep it from feeling stale before even the film's halfway point is reached.Dark Of The Moon also suffers from obvious follies, recognisable by even the most casual film-goer. Why does a robot need a headscarf? How does a robot grow hair? Why do two robots that have barely ventured outside the NASA headquarters have thick Scottish accents? And on at least two occasions, the protagonists hide behind a wall and go unseen by the baddies, when in actuality a five year-old could find them in a game of hide and seek. Things like this just scream of an overall lack of effort in allowing audiences to suspend their disbelief.It's easy to say that Michael Bay and Paramount Pictures had the last laugh, since I left the cinema in disappointment having already parted with my money. Truth is, if another Transformers is made, I will see it if for no other reason than to expand my mental library. The mere fact that this film is cohesive enough for people to understand what in the world is going on is all that keeps it from falling into the chasm of films that should never be exposed to human eyes. But this is little consolation for an all-round failure in filmmaking.I'm yet to check if any part of the soundtrack syncs up eerily with The Wizard Of Oz. Stay tuned.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

The first sequel (which came out 2 years later), however, was a dreary mess and, while its follow-up has been touted in some circles as the best of the series, a local write-up gave it the thumbs-down; having watched the film for myself, I have to agree with the latter opinion! To be fair to it, the first half is not bad – even if one has to swallow the ruse that Apollo 11's 1969 Moon landing (complete with stock footage, and barely look-alike actors in long shot, of JFK and Richard Nixon, not to mention the presence as himself of one of the real-life astronauts involved in that historic moment i.e. Buzz Aldrin!) was really a covert mission to inspect the crash-landing of a massive space-ship emanating from the dying planet Cybertron! It transpires that the leader of the benign Autobots, Sentinel Prime, had succumbed in that disastrous escape flight but his body is retrieved and revived by his successor, Optimus Prime (who had already featured in the first two entries).Their nemeses, the Decepticons, soon learn of this and they determine to put their hands on the remaining set of pillars (they are already in possession of about a hundred others) that would save Cybertron and guarantee their dominance. However, Sentinel is not quite what it is played up to be, having sold out to the Decepticon chief, Megatron (which itself lies in a state of disrepair for much of the proceedings, the result of its failure to gain the upper hand in the two previous TRANSFORMERS pictures). In the wake of this, humans decide they can no longer trust the Machines and the Autobots are banished; this concept of 'aliens' being misunderstood, feared and ultimately hunted down was also at the core, as was the JFK cameo and the fact that a famous political incident has been incorporated into the narrative for that matter, of X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011) which actually preceded this viewing! Anyway, mixed with all of this are the usual suspects – Shia LeBeouf (who after two adventures is still basically at the point where we first met him, despite his having been honored with a medal for valor by none other than President Obama!), his girlfriend (Megan Fox having been dumped by the production, her character is suddenly deemed fickle and unworthy of our hero{!}, so she is replaced here by the likewise stunning but even less able acting-wise Rose Huntington-Whiteley and John Turturro (returning as the eccentric ex-CIA operative who has almost gone bourgeois in the interim). Also on hand are Frances McDormand as a supercilious CIA bigwig (her would-be comic banter with Turturro belongs in a Coen Bros. movie but clearly not here!), the even more incongruous (and basically irrelevant) casting of John Malkovich – evoking Jack Nicholson – as LeBeouf's touchy boss and Patrick Dempsey as Huntington-Whiteley's own hunk of a superior (who is improbably revealed as being in cahoots with the evil Decepticons!).The worst part of it, though, is the fact that the climactic action bout takes up the entire last hour and it does not even prove especially exciting (more often it is noisy and inordinately muddled) apart from the spectacular set-piece in which the protagonists are trapped inside a leaning skyscraper: when eventually thrown out and made to slide down its façade, they are required to shoot at the windows underneath in order to break their fall and literally drop back safely into the building!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Hands-down the most visually awesome action spectacle you'll see this summer- this third entry is easily the best 'Transformers' movie to date","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450428/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","28 June 2011","We are happy to announce that ""Dark of the Moon"" is our vote for the best film in the trilogy. It isn't just the bombast that puts it ahead of its predecessors; rather, this third movie boasts a stronger plot and well-developed characters- human and machine alike. Like this summer's ""X Men: First Class"", writer Ehren Kruger legitimises the sci-fi premise in a real-world context by taking a revisionist view to past events. Through the extended prologue, we learn that the space race of the 1960s was really a cover-up to investigate the remains of an alien spaceship crash on the far side of the moon. Bay injects this alternate history with gravitas by using both archival footage of JFK and Richard Nixon and re-enactments of what went on inside NASA as well as the White House, and this terrific opening portends a darker film than what we have previously seen in the past two movies.Bay and Kruger makes good on this tantalising promise with the new human and machine character additions. Chief among these is Sentinel Prime, once the leader of the Autobots during their war with the Decepticons on their home planet Cybertron and a father figure to Optimus Prime. Sentinel's allegiance and subsequent actions blur the line between good and evil amongst the Autobots and the Decepticons, and for lack of a better description, make the machines more human and also more interesting. On the side of the humans, it is Patrick Dempsey's Dylan, boss of leading man Sam Witwicky's new and equally Megan Fox-hot girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who turns out to be unexpectedly intriguing. At first no more than a romantic rival to the recently graduated Sam still struggling to find a job, Dylan turns out to be- pardon the pun- more than meets the eye once the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons unfolds proper on our planet. While there is significantly more depth to some of the characters and the story compared to the earlier films, Bay still resorts to the kind of easy humour characteristic in the first two 'Transformers' movies. Yes, despite his promise to tone down the goofy humour, there's still plenty of it on display whenever Sam appears on screen without some sort of battle raging around him.It's a pity too that Bay also uses acting veterans John Malkovich and Frances McDormand only for cheap laughs- Malkovich as Sam's tyrannical boss; and McDormand in an essentially one-note character as the no- nonsense national intelligence director Charlotte Mearing. Also unfortunate is Bay's frenetic handling of even these made-for-laughs scenes, which would have worked better with a lot more subtlety and finesse.But of course, the above two qualities are not what Bay is known for- despite the benefits a more varied change in rhythm could have done for the film- and sure enough, it is this brazen attitude that serves him well in the plentiful action bombast that follows in the last hour. Bay begins his non-stop trail of destruction from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., but he reserves the bulk of his firepower for Chicago.By the time Bay is done, little of Chicago's skyline is left- none of the iconic buildings whether Hotel 71, the Tribune Tower, Marina City or even the Trump Tower manage to escape unscathed. But this Bay-hem is also utterly, absolutely thrilling, and features quite possibly some of the most intense action sequences you'll see on the big screen this year. Indeed, Bay has learnt from the criticism of ""Revenge of the Fallen"" to hold his shots for longer so that his audience can get a sense of the awesome scale of the unfolding action, and my goodness does it totally rock!The highlight of this colossal climactic sequence takes place inside a toppling skyscraper as Sam, Carly and returning face Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are hunted by a serpentine Decepticon known as Shockwave and forced to slide down the glass exterior of the toppling building. Other breathtakingly exciting extended setpieces include one where Sam and series regular Lennox (Josh Duhamel) are dangling off a metal rod whose sharp end is lodged inside a Decepticon, and another where Optimus Prime faces off against a group of Decepticons led by wounded leader Megatron who makes a return from the previous film. These are especially awe- inspiring when viewed in 3D, and Bay, who was convinced of the format by James Cameron, grasps the additional dimension to amazing effect.Never mind that only 60 percent of the film was in fact shot in 3D (with the rest, especially the closeups, shot in anamorphic and then post- converted), this is probably one of the few films since ""Avatar"" to thoroughly make use of the format. Nowhere is this more evident than in an aerial sequence where a group of paratroopers led by Lennox infiltrate the Decepticon-infested Chicago city, all the while pursued by flying enemy robots. Shot composition by d.p. Amir Mokri is excellent, and there is excellent use of foreground and background to create depth in every scene. The added dimension also helps illuminate the other technical achievements of the film- the mix of physical staging, live-action stunt work, location shooting, and visual effects just seamless and simply remarkable.On pure visual spectacle alone, ""Dark of the Moon"" beats both of the earlier 'Transformers' movie and in fact probably anything you'll see this summer- so kudos to Michael Bay, who has clearly outdone himself by creating his most exhilarating work to date. Yet this third film in the franchise also emerges its strongest entry not just by visuals, but also by a well-grounded plot and rich character additions. Sure it's pure summer popcorn entertainment, but on that level alone, it succeeds immeasurably and on sheer entertainment value, this is the must-see blockbuster of the season.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

And the voices of the robots that annoyed me in Revenge didn't annoy me here somehow.Also have a look how Megan Fox was finished in this flick due a few sentences and if you listen closely yo can spot that Michael Bay finished her off. Out Megan Fox and out was her career. The new comer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly the new love of Sam (Shia LaBeouf). Shia performed excellent again, Rosie was just in it for her body and legs. Alos on board was John Malkovich (Bruce), always nice to see him but his new teeth made me watch that in stead of the flick itself. I would also like to mention John Turturro as Simmons, he's so funny.The effects are again extremely well done. The start of this flick and Buzz Aldrin being involved made it all more believable.

The scenario setup had promise though. The Apollo program and the space race were an elaborate front to get to the moon and check out a UFO which crash landed there. This crashed ship turns out to be a casualty from Cybertron and naturally holds some cargo which both the Autobots and Decepticons desire. These events are combined with more historical fiction including Chernobyl and with quality writing could really have taken off somewhere intriguing. Unfortunately, Michael Bay chose to focus on an extremely uncharismatic Shia LeBeouf and his insecurities of unemployment, jealousy concerning his girlfriend, and wishing he had more recognition from his previous attempts to save humanity. To extend an even bigger weakness, John Turturro is also back again and now seems like even more of a Daffy Duck sidekick instead of an actual human being. Michael Bay tries harder this time to make the hand-to-hand combat amongst machines work but anyone sitting in the audience will continue to find it quite challenging to tell the difference between Autobot and Decepticon until they somehow untangle themselves. Also, the humans scurrying around beneath their robotic feet while dodging falling bits of building somehow never get accidentally squished which should really give a lot of credit to the machines situational awareness.The Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, reprised his ministerial role and speaks only in philosophical platitudes which contribute nothing to anyone and is most likely why he receives far less screen time to perch on his soap box and spout them at whoever is unlucky enough to be in the room when he begins a sermon. His speeches resemble a page-a-day motivational calendar. The female lead this time, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is not Megan Fox but is interchangeable enough that it does not matter. Casting also added ensured the new accent brought a British accent with her to make her even sexier to the American male audience. The first hour of the film has her getting in and out of quite a few low-riding vehicles in extremely short dresses which have most of the audience straining to catch a glimpse. I wonder if Megan Fox left this series before or after she read this script; she dodged a bullet here. The new additions of Patrick Dempsey, Francis McDormand, and John Malkovich hold their own with limiting material but Ken Jeong's character is just flat out ridiculous. John Turturro is already in the film to provide the lame comic relief; adding Jeong helped make the first hour even worse than it was already shaping up to be.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

A sensational plot (not gonna spoil it for the rest of you) bringing together more of the side characters, countless action, many emotional moments and times of laughter, and the 3D made James Cameron's Avatar look like something made by a 6th grader. Also The much criticized Rosie Huntington-Whitely greatly surpassed expectations and left me thinking Megan who?. This film is amazing and must be seen even if you are not the biggest Transformers fan. 10/10. Heres fingers tightly crossed that Michael changes his mind and comes back for a few more.

The story was too thin to carry it longer than a half hour, yet it runs 2.5 hours. There isn't one likable character (though John Malkovich and Ken Jeong are pretty funny in their brief appearances). Many characters are introduced late in movie, and then only because more bodies are needed to populate the screen. I'm not really certain who the intended audience is here. Hasbro produced the movie, ostensibly to keep the toys selling. Yet, the movie is clearly not for kids. Autobot violence is one thing, but there are scenes with guns that go too far. The language is also too strong for kids, with several s--t and even a couple f-bombs dropped in for bad measure. It is also much too silly to be taken seriously by adults. Despite a couple tearful attempts, there is no heart or soul to it. The direction is very inept and Bay seems to still be getting the hang of melding live-action with CG action. I suppose he will keep going until the toys stop selling.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Regarding whether this film is any good or not, my title for this post says it all. This movie is very similar to the first two films except the visuals and effects are even more over-the-top which I didn't know they could do. I happened to like this film because this is my kind of movie. I enjoyed the two and a half hours of explosions and more battles between the Autobots and Decepticons.In this film, Sam Witwicky returns as the hero who saved the world except he can't find a job. He has a girlfriend that is not Megan Fox. He gets caught up in these robot fights again when the Autobots are betrayed by one of their own and the Decepticons are intent on destroying Earth by moving Cybertron, their home world to Earth.The acting is pretty good with one exception. Shia LaBeouf is pretty good because you know what to expect out of him. John Turturro is solid and as usual, brings more comedy to the film. I liked the additions of Frances McDormand and John Malkovich's charm because they are two wonderful actors. I didn't like the new chick because she just seemed phony and pathetic. I wish they brought back Megan Fox because she can act a little bit.Overall, this is a film with impressive visual effects even thought it sort of lacks a plot. I didn't mind that because I wanted to see cool fights and extreme visuals. That is exactly what I got. I love these kind of movies because they are perfect examples of summer popcorn films. I don't know how they did the visual effects for the last hour of the film, but they were impressive. I rate this film 8/10.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

However, just like its previous cinematic instalment, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a poorly crafted, overlong, robot-infested-mess which is populated continuously with cheaply written dialogue and over-the-top acting.In 1961, John F Kennedy tells the American public that they will endeavour to put a man on the moon before the end of the century, but what the American public isn't told is that the space-race has been commissioned to reach a Cybertronian craft that has become stranded on the dark side of the moon. However, nothing is never simple as it seems, as Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is once again drawn away from his post-graduate job-hunting and attractive British girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and is placed slap-bang in the middle of the reoccurring war between the Autobot protagonists, commanded by Optimus Prime, who must once again stop the villainous Megatron and his Decepticon partners from destroying planet Earth.At two-and-a-half hours in length, 'Dark of the Moon' is just a long, tedious film to watch, which is primarily down to the films incredibly disjointed plot. For the first two acts of the film, Bay continuously jumps between the romantic-comedy and action-adventure sub-genres, before deciding to simply settle on an all-out extended action sequence, which then culminates in a third act which contains nothing more than exploding robots and extended scenic destruction. In between the constant on-screen destruction important plot-points are information is seemingly thrown at the audience hoping to create anything that can be seemingly considered a workable and engaging plot. Despite having a potentially workable premise in using the moon landing of 1969 to establish a link between the extra-terrestrial robots and humanity, it is instead reworked into a complex plot involving years of conspiracies that are never fully explored nor investigated.Alongside the disorganized plot, Bay once again attempts to place considerable emphasis upon the actions and choices of humanity, rather than the Transformers themselves. For example, in during the beginning of the final climatic fight sequence, Sam is about to save his girlfriend himself from a dangerous, metal-laden fortress, however as Epps (Tyrese Gibson) is unable to follow due to the impending doom that lies ahead he instead offers the pesky young adult a hand-gun, just in-case he encounters any large and sophisticated robotic killing machines. This is the conclusion of a sequence which shows all the former soldiers coming together out of retirement to help Sam and the human race, before they decide that the situation is ultimately too dangerous for them. All the while the Autobots are eventually introduced back into the situation with yet another preposterous explanation that just further cements films lack of structure. This focus upon humanity isn't helped either by the stale acting and cheesy script which despite newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley attempting to work beyond stereotype she is unable to do, as the script clearly has her labelled as nothing more than 'Sam's attractive love-interest'.Once again Michael Bay has attempted to circumvent the simple rules of filmmaking by filling his third Transformers film up to the brim with energetic action-sequences and detailed computer generated imagery hoping to cover the fact that it contains a convoluted and difficult plot, sub-par acting and terrible dialogue. 'Dark of the Moon' would work perfectly if the final climatic fight sequence was released as a stand-alone short film examining the effects of modern-day technology on film-making, but as a two-and-a-half-hour feature film, the third film in the Transformers franchise misses the boat (once again) completely.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

The target audience were kids, so the marketers came with a list of what kids used to adore : comics, reptiles, kung-fu films and pizza! For the exact same reason, Mickael Bay and Paramount marketing dept are coming back with robots, race cars, heavy weaponry ... and centerfold girls! And that is why Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is an adulescent, a teenager who depends on his girlfriend and his parents for a living. Anyway...The introduction of the film (linking the Apollo program with fictional events) is appealing, but the rest of the script makes absolutely no sense. The motivations of Sentinel Prime are absurd, and nothing is really logical in this movie.The cinematography is awful. The action scenes have no rhythm, and Bay constantly relies on camera shaking and slow-motion. The SFX are awful, robot 3D models are difficult to visualize.Acting is terrible. Of course, LaBeouf does not how to play, but I would expect something better from Malkovitch and 'Torturo'! This is really a film you should avoid.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It also heavily panders to an American audience with clumsy over the top patriotism. It felt like a parody of Team America with Autobots acting as a hit squad for the United States, sorting out those pesky people in the middle east. Never mind the way they crowbar in Buzz Aldrin and the Apollo 11 mission.Lastly there is the portrayal of women in the movie - they are treated either as a sex object (with lecherous camera work ensuring a good view of tits and ass), or as an overbearing/nagging annoyance.

Despite the heavy reliance on special effects, the movie actually has a coherent story in which human characters figure prominently. Some of the dialog is snappy and the movie keeps the audience engaged. The principle characters are interesting and are not lost in all the noise and mayhem caused by the robots. The robots, both good and bad, are actually interesting, with humanoid features that make their behavior more plausible. One can almost feel sorry or elated when a robot is destroyed. John Malkovich and John Tuturro are especially excellent and the rest of cast give energetic performances. One is almost rooting for the good guys to win. Heroism abounds as the robots and humans join together to fight for the survival of the planet. They form a united front which transcends the obvious chasm that separates human from machine. Leonard Nimoy's voice-over work is excellent. This movie is one of the better examples of the sci-fi, action, fantasy genre. In this case, the format works.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

The characters were awkward but that made the movie entertaining. The actions scenes were incredibly good. And the plot itself was great.When I saw the second part it was kindly disappointing because the acting wasn't as great as in first one, storyline was poor. But at least the action was a doze of adrenaline.Then I thought that maybe Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon will redeem itself. How naive I was. Now, what wrong with this movie?Let's begin with storyline - it is boring and some of the twists make it even more boring and unrealistic.The action sequences presented way less than the drama and comedy scenes. And I thought people go to view such movies for a lot of action and possibly bit of drama.The jokes by the secondary characters are plain and stupid. Only few jokes were to laugh at.Some of the scenes were made as if they were only made for a trailer. Don't believe me? Watch the trailer again after you watch movie.The greatest villain from previous movies was really pathetic. How comes? On the other hand, small transformers managed to influence the storyline more than him. Are you freaking kidding me? So, let's cut the long story short. It's a bad sequel, and I don't recommend to watch it. Even if you were fan of the first movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

At least, my dream was more understandable. After reading similar previous reviews, I'm glad I didn't waste more time on it.I should have got the hint that the movie editing is so poor right at the beginning, when they used real footage of JFK turning his head 3 times for 1 short scene. The rest of the movie (that I watched) suffer the same from poor effort of editing that make the movie unpleasant to watch.Editing aside, the story is also weak. If human have to be involved in a robot war, at least make them interesting or appear useful to the story. Neither important reasons are ticked here. Alas, showing more robots is not helping the situation either. Our eyes and brain have to suffer trying to comprehend what's really going on. Majority of the bots are greyish silver, on every single fight scenes, you have to watch closely to know which side is winning, Decepticon or Autobots? The robot consist of small and messy metal pieces that I can no longer think, imagine or care which part of their body transformed from what part of vehicle. The metal beard and few strains of metal hair are cringe-worthy. We desperately need a reboot of this franchise. Just like what they did to Batman. The next people making Transformers should just use Michael Bay's versions as case studies. Just do all the opposites and the movie will mostly be better already.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was pleasantly surprised that Bay could take a beloved toy and cartoon from the '80's and make it into a good action flick. Beyond the first movie, there really isn't that much of a story to tell and so they should have stopped. Transfomers also lack a wider culture to draw from so each movie feels the same- I'll compare it to Indiana Jones which usually has the same hero and villains, Nazis, but Indiana has the benefit of a plethora of interesting civilizations to write stories around. So please stop Hollywood, stop making these movies. They are merely a product for consumption and merchandising.This movie was way too long with unending action scenes. Am I the only who gets annoyed by Shia's fumbling? I felt the movie also went into an inappropriate realm the others didn't. There was a scene where a man is killed and it is made to look like a suicide. It is depicted comically as he falls by the window and there are even jokes afterwards about him being splatted on the pavement. This is just one example. I don't mind dark humor, actually I love dark humor, but this just seemed out of place with the tone and audience of the movie. I thought these movies were at least in part for kids?Lastly, since I completely zoned out in the middle of the movie and was just hoping it was going to end soon, something dangerous started happening - I got to thinking. Autobots are supposed to be gender neutral but are all voiced by men? Why? It is not as if they have synthetic voices. There does seem to be an affect on some of the voices to add a deeper growl but why can't that be applied to a female voice? The autobots could have the same personalities and be voiced by a woman. I would guess most people view the transformers as all male. I looked into matter and read how at one time female autobots were added but were somewhat anatomically correct and were stereotypically more feminine. Sigh... However, I'll take no female voiced autobots over giving ""female"" autobots breasts and gender specific roles which is far more tragic! These movies are decidedly male and I do not mean that because they have explosions.I gave it 2 stars because someone works very hard on the CGI.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It seems that he has not only failed to learn from his mistakes but has actually managed to produce a film worse than the critically slaughtered Revenge of the Fallen.The film is pretty much split in two in terms of plot. The first half follows the main character Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) through his failed job hunting days, in which he spends a lot of his time moaning about his lack of independence and sizing up the competition that is his girlfriend's boss. We don't see much of the Transformers themselves during this part of the film, besides an Autobot mission in Ukraine and an annoying assassin robot killing annoying people. The focus here is on Sam's relationship with Carly, that's right Megan Fox's character is gone. She is played by first time acting model (alarm bells should be ringing) Rosie Huntington Whitely who plays the posh, well educated British type. Why does Hollywood insist all British people are like that? We're introduced (reintroduced in some cases) to several other over the top characters in this part of the film including Sam's Boss (John Malkovich) and Agent Simmons why is John Turturro still in these films!?The second part of the film is pretty much one giant battle in Chicago. Megatron; leader of the Decepticons (the Transformer villains) has come up with a plan to wake up a long lost army, invade earth and enslave the human race in order to rebuild Cybertron; the transformer's home world. The Autobots, the US military and Sam Witwicky go in to try and fight them off. There's a huge robot snake thing that destroys a skyscraper, soldiers skydive into the city from battle helicopters and the transformers Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and co tear apart Decepticons. This should be exciting and wake the audience up after a boring first hour and a half, but it is done in such a way that it has you muttering to yourself please end now please end now. Bay seems to have the need to shoot EVERYTHING in slow motion, including Huntington-Whiteley's ass. The dialogue delivered by the Transformers and soldiers whilst they're fighting is ridiculously cringe worthy. There are several moments where the film has the opportunity to do the unexpected; to kill off a main character! They come ridiculously close to dying each time but, surprise surprise, are saved by the perfect timing of something falling or a hero who you thought was miles away turning up. This happens far too many timesMichael Bay doesn't seem to understand that what matters in a film is a good story and scenes that are effectively put together, not how much stuff you can blow up in slow motion.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Why Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean chose to follow the former, I will never know, but that proved their undoing. Now Transformers follows that same path.Transformers I was simple, light fun. It seemed perfectly comfortable with the fact that it had giant robots based on a toy-line, and Spielberg's stamp counterbalanced Michael Bay's beautifully. Transformers II tried to be ""Empire Strikes Back"" when it could have gone ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". It deliberately ignored the fact hat we came for the giant robots, and to a lesser extent, Shia LaBouf's Sam Witwicky. And it didn't want to hear how little we cared about the military team or Megan Fox's plastic girlfriend.Along comes Transformers III, a case study in Michael Bay's strengths and flaws. When it allows itself to be silly or crazy-violent (collapsing buildings, Optimus slapping the crap out of something, John Malkovitch) it works, it really does. But when it tries to be a Homeric drama, it stumbles badly. There are changes, many of them improvements on the dismal and bloated ""Revenge of the Fallen"": Megan Fox is replaced by another piece of plastic, less spunky but arguably more likable. People who accused part II of racial stereotyping will find less to hiss at. And there are no giant robot balls.The flaws are the same: the messy plot and bloated running time leave more room than they should to question some gaping plot holes: the ""cunning trap"" allowed many effective moments to strike out at the autobots, and none were taken. The main villain's motivations only half make sense. And the historical revisionism is mostly pathetic, as is the omnipresence of flapping flags and Optimus delivering one too many sanctimonious speeches.So see it if you want to see the series to its probable ending. But see it with low expectations, and if your idea of good 3D is stuff lurching out the screen at you, you can skip the extra expense here.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

That was a much better experience than watching this darn movie. ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is the worst American movie I have ever seen since I saw ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" Like murder and adultery, both movies have no right to exist.For the third straight film, the Autobots and Decepticons are once again on a race for the possession of something. The Autobots must find it before the Decepticons or else. Let me ask you something. Does it really matter what they're after? Would it make much of a difference if I told you they were fighting for a washing machine? Not really, because its only purpose is to provoke these robots to pound each other relentlessly until one of them lose their head. That last sentence might sound like the entire blueprint for ""Dark of the Moon"", but I assure you that there's actually a plot this time. *wink*Before we get to that, I must first state the obvious fact that Megan Fox's Mikaela has been replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's Carly. Different characters, but both are just about as irrelevant. Now how can I describe Carly's role in one sentence? We get a long and carefully planned shot at her panty-covered butt before we get to see her face.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/transformers-3-movie-review/","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

RATING: Don't waste your time. (Ratings: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the Instant Download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")NO SPOILERSI actually saw the first Transformers movie a couple days ago on Netflix. It was bearable. I saw the second film two years ago and it was terrible - the fight scenes looked like a tornado hit a scrap yard. Michael Bay appears to have learned from his mistakes and created a somewhat watchable movie this time out.The movie revolves around young Sam Witwicki (Shia LaBeouf) who is friends with the good robots (Autobots) and his girlfriend Carly (Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who is a stunning blonde (and replaced Mega Fox - see the Internet for details on how she got fired). The movie tries to be about relationships and really falls down on the job (with comic-relief from mom and dad (Kevin Dunn and Julie White)). And it tries to be about heroism. And it tries to be about saving the world. But in the end all it is really about is robot fight scenes.The subtitle of the film is ""Dark of the Moon"" - but I bet it was supposed to be ""Dark Side of the Moon"" but was changed so as not to affiliate itself with the Pink Floyd album of the same name. It always surprises me when people talk about the dark side of the moon because there is no such thing. The Moon rotates on its axis same as does Earth. It's just that it is locked in a gear-like orbit with us so only one side ever faces us. People think of this as the ""light"" side when in fact it goes through light and dark phases just as the Earth does. More accurately, what people should say is the ""Far Side of the Moon"". But hey, who am I to complain?Michael Bay has hijacked some of America's greatest and most devastating moments to create a realistic feel to this film. And to his credit, he has succeeded. But I feel violated. He has retold perhaps the greatest achievement of humankind by turning the moon landing into an exploration of the moon for Decepticon (the bad robots) technology. He even enlisted the REAL Buzz Aldrin to play a cameo in which he tells the Autobots (the good robots, remember?) that all of Apollo was a covert mission to harvest robot bootie from the moon. My God! BUZZ ALDRIN! I hope they paid him a boat-load of money. I really do.And again, later, the Autobots leave Earth in a space shuttle - Discovery - only for it to be blown up before it reaches Earth orbit. For me this was too close to the events of Challenger and Columbia. It certainly looked very much like the real thing.And in the last quarter of the movie, the Decepticons attack Chicago - with scenes that look amazingly like the bombing of the Twin Towers.This is just artistic exploitation. I found it foul and manipulative. I don't have much else to say about that.Otherwise, the film was a virtual who's who of cameos and other talent. Leonard Nimoy voiced the sage Sentinal Prime robot (there were several asides to his role as ""Spock"" in the original Star Trek as well). John Turturro as ""Simmons"", the conspiracy theorist. Patrick Dempsey as the human bad guy. Frances McDermand as the government agent. John-FREAKIN- Malkovich (!) as the eccentric guy who had no business in this film but to give Sam a job. Ken Juong who played basically the same character he did in ""The Hangover"". Bill O'Reilly as himself. And Alan Tudyk (""Firefly"", ""Serenity"") as a German uber-cyber-guy.To his credit, Michael Bay succeeded in knitting all the robot fight scenes together with a plot. A flimsy plot, but it made some sort of sense if you didn't dwell on it. The movie had a fair amount of swearing in it and people being reduced to ash, so I was surprised it didn't merit a ""R"" rating rather than ""PG-13"".I saw this movie in 3D. It was cool. But if you do see a movie in 3D, try to sit near the center of the theater. While all movie screens have a ""sweet spot"" where the light is focused (and it is around the middle of the theater), 3D movies have this in spades. I sat on the left-most aisle of the theater and had a lot of parallax problems. Things on the far right were split as though I had crossed my eyes. So, please, sit near the middle/center of the theater if you pay an extra $4 for 3D. You'll thank me.Shia LaBeouf has said this is his last Transformers movie (actually, I read it was his last action/adventure role). Here's hoping that it's the last Transformers movie - period.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

It is by far the worse in the series. LaBeouf gives a solid performance and that is about all the movie has to offer. Huntington-Whiteley is beyond plain... a cup of coffee is more expressive than she is. All others are very, very forgettable. This is bad movie because even though there are great special effects, the story sucks big time... too many loose ends, too many undeveloped characters, too many inconsistencies. This is an action movie, and as such we do not expect great psychological complexity; HOWEVER, movie goers are not THAT stupid (learn from e.g. X-men First Class). It feels like the marketing team put too many demands on the story (appeal to this group... and this other... and this other...), and the plot dissolved in thin air. Now all good guys (I mean machines) have thick very identifiable thick accents. I could not tell you how did it all end, because I left by one hour and 50 minutes into the movie. Give my my $10 back! The worst is that time is the most valuable asset a person possesses, for once gone it never can be recovered...

"5","/10","""Transformers: Dark of the Moon""- Misogynistic, bloated eye-candy Fun to watch for the visuals, but the 'writing' will make you gag","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2576825/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","6 March 2012","Looking back, I find it hard to admit that I actually defended the last film ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"", and gave it a halfway decent review here on IMDb. I don't know what possessed me to try and defend it. Looking back, it is a bad movie, but it was full of so much eye candy that I found it highly entertaining and I didn't really analyze its faults as I should have. So I'm going to be giving a more objective review of this, the third film.Michael Bay delivers ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", perhaps the single most entertaining pieces of misogynistic, exploitative filth I've ever seen. It is an awful movie, I will admit that up front, and it's depiction of women as nothing more than objects is flat-out disgusting and shameful. (Does Bay not understand that women are people as well? Because he shoots every woman in this film like he was shooting a car commercial- sleek slow-motion shots that show off the curves while paying no attention to development. It actually made me queasy after a while.) But, it's also very pretty to look at, and its clear that Michael Bay doesn't give a hoot about the story, as long as he can deliver pretty pictures, and in that sense, this film works.The plot is.. Um a plot? I guess that a long time ago, an auto-bot named ""Sentinel Prime"" (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) crash-landed on the moon, and there's some sort of Doomsday device that will cause the Transformers home world to materialize in the Earth's atmosphere, and Sentinel teams up with Megatron to make it happen, so Optimus must save the day. Blah, blah, blah. It's the same exact movie as the last two- some Doomsday weapon from the Transformers past shows up and Optimus must stop it. First it was the ""Allspark"" cube in the original film, then it was a Sun-Harvester Energy thingy in the second film, now it's a transportation device. What-ever.Shia Labeouf is back again as Sam Whitwickey, the human hero of the film, although his purpose in the series is no longer clear. He isn't needed in this film, nor was he needed in the second film. He's just used to set up some crummy jokes. Megan Fox has been replaced by some model named Rosie Huntington (I think, I honestly can't remember her name) who can't act to save her life and is the object of fascination for Bay's disturbingly perverted camera work. She literally has no development, and her establishing shot (a tight close up on her rear end for about 30 seconds and she ascends a flight of stairs) makes it clear that Bay only wants to objectify her, so I really didn't care about who she was. John Turturro also returns and is quite funny, and new characters played by John Malkovich and Frances McDormond are also a lot of fun.The effects are astonishing. The level of detail has again been vastly improved in the CG models, and the Transformers look more real than ever. The facial detail and expressions are so well-made that I often forgot I was watching effects. As far as I was concerned, they were real. So props to the effects department.Also, I will comment that this is one of the few films to use 3D ""properly."" The 3D Bay uses here is not only the best 3D since ""Avatar"", it's also possibly the best 3D I've ever seen in a live-action film. Better than ""Avatar""'s 3D. Everything is lush, and bright, and there is very little noticeable ""blurriness"" or ""murky images"" that plague other 3D films. The effects also don't give themselves away- there is almost no ""ghosting"", and nothing too crazy or gimmicky. Bay essentially shot the film as he would a 2D film, and that's what makes it work- the 3D adds an immense sense of depth, and doesn't rely on things flying out at you. It was technically a very impressive 3D film and is worth seeing in 3D if you have a 3D-tv.Also, the action is a huge step up in scope. From an incredible opening space battle (that makes excellent use of 3D as ships soar past the camera), to a scene where our heroes have to flee a sky rise building while it is collapsing, every piece of action is astonishing. I'm torn with what to give this film. It is a terrible movie, with a weak, derivative plot and almost no character development, plus a nasty misogynistic side, but the visuals are worth seeing at least once. I give this an average 5 out of 10. Bad movie, great action. Buy the Blu-Ray (or 3D Blu-Ray if you have a 3D-tv) and watch the action, but skip over everything else.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

To the contrary, DOTM had everything listed above in even greater frequency. Bay even takes his time with it, drawing out the nonsense for three (3) hours! If anything, that's a feat in itself.""But wait,"" you say. ""Maybe I want to turn my brain off and just watch mindless action for a while."" That's fine, I can respect that because aside from the pretentious I-only-watch-Oscar-worthy-movies film buffs, that's a guilty pleasure we all get from time to time. The problem with this film is that you feel like you're watching the same thing over and over again. If I'm going into a movie expecting nothing intellectual, at the very least I want the action sequences to be interesting/stylish, I want the dialogue to be funny, and I want the music to be captivating/cool. Movies in this category are seldom ever considered ""good"" by critics but have spawned memes like ""this is sparta!"" and ""release the cracken!"" and fulfill some of those things mentioned above.Unfortunately, for all the money spent on the film's admittedly impressive visuals, the ""action"" in Transformers 3 expects audiences to be captivated by flying debris and destruction which makes up 2/3's of the film. It stops being impressive after watching it for an hour straight (an iPhone in the blender can simulate this pretty well). The musical score is equally uninspired, and the dialogue sounds like it was scripted by a 3rd-grader. I spend the time writing this review in hopes that I can save the time of others.

These include the digital effects, the general quality of the action scenes and set-pieces, the Steve Jablonsky score, some of the art direction and designs (the word 'some' being the keyword here) and finally the implementation of the 3D effect (though 3D in film is just that - an effect. It does not alter the quality - or lack thereof - of a film).My feelings on all other aspects of the film (and also 'Revenge Of The Fallen' and to a far lesser extent the first Transformers) I pose in the form of the following question:How can such an appealingly simple, low-concept idea get so much, so wrong?Even ""low-brow"" entertainment can be done well and done poorly you know folks (very poorly in this particular case).","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I really wish that were a joke.I'm not going to point out the plot holes, or tell you about how disappointed I am with the excellent supporting talent who should be ashamed for signing on to this movie, or make fun of Rose Huntintwatley orwhateverhernameis for looking like she has a bad Botox job and the fact that she can't act. To tell you everything that is wrong with this movie would be like writing a novel.Just rest assured that this is yet more mindless drivel from Michael Bay and his cronies. If you liked either of the first 2 live action Bayformers movies, or if you liked Armageddon, or Avatar, or 300, or Sin City, or The Dark Knight, or any other number of appallingly bad movies that make stupid people think they're watching something interesting, fun, or original... then you'll LOVE this movie... but I pray you are never put in charge of children in your life.You might say, ""Well, what do you expect from a film based on children's toys?"" My response to that question? SHUT YOUR STUPID FACE! I could say the same thing about Toy Story (based on talking toys), or Lord of the Rings (based on a fantasy novel), or The Road to Perdition (based on a comic book). People need to stop making excuses for bad movies like this, because the truth is, you can have a a movie based on toys and still have deep and likable characters (Toy Story), you can have a mind-blowing CGI experience and still have palpable human Drama (LotR trilogy), and you can have your guns and violence and still have a compelling story worthy of hearing (Road to Perdition).When people pay their heard earned money to see this kind of garbage that insults your intelligence, caters to the lowest common denominator, and does nothing to stimulate thought, people like Bay will keep producing garbage. Don't be afraid to discriminate with what movies you spend your hard-earned money on. Don't rate something above average and the say ""it was pretty good."" Demand more for your time and money, and you'll get more, but only if people stop allowing crap like this to set the standard!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

That's a pretty awful film, though I still found it more tolerable than Tree of Life. Here at least we got some explosions and giant robots fighting (though I couldn't make much sense of it). There is no plot, however, or at least something resembling a plot: There are some robots that turn into cars and stuff and they fight and stuff and then, suddenly the film ends. The acting is terrible as well, which is expected, specially considering that the new pretty girlfriend of the main character was performed by a model and not a professional actress.Michael Bay certainly is one of the most financially successful directors in Hollywood, being the best paid director in 2010, earning over 100 million dollars. However, it remains a mystery of how these transformers films have made nearly one billion dollars in box office. While the general public doesn't generally has the most refined taste for films, I still think that generally films that are successful in the box office tend to be decent. That was not the case here.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sound effects awesome. 3D effects spellbound.And a special thanks to the writer Ehren Kruger for overcoming Revenge of the fallen with a superb script. The chase of the autobots from Earth to the moon for the Cybertronian spacecraft sets the plot with couple of twist (three in fact).Rosie Huntington-Whiteley she is damn nice compared to Mikaela who ditched our dear old ""Messenger"" or ""Alien Badnews Magnet"" boy Sam. Inclusion of Sams parents was quite unnecessary while concentrating on human-decepticon killing agent could was a new kind of plot missing in the previous flicks. And as always one person to stand in the way of Sam :Frances McDormand(Mearing) was good. John Malkovich's small cameo was interesting especially the embrassing part of Sam. The new ally of Sam is also does his part well (John Turturro) Former agent Simmons.

She wasn't anything special. I wish they'd kept Megan Fox. And the Einstein and Scottish Autobots were just lame and pathetic and pretty painful to watch.The special effects and fight scenes however, were very good but needed much more of it to keep me interested.In my opinion, the only good things about Dark Of The Moon were the action scenes and the end credits.Once again, director Michael Bay and the writers have embarrassed themselves by making a joke of a much loved childhood TV show as these films focused more on teenage romance, which just happened to have Transformers in them.Its obvious that everyone involved had no idea what Transformers was before making these films as the story and characters stray far away from the original cartoon's classic story.I thought Revenge Of The Fallen was probably the best of the 3, but they will never beat Transformers: The Movie from 1986.I'm giving this movie 5/10","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

So much that I feel its necessary to review this.Right from the start, the movie lacked coherence. Sure a plot was visible, but it was never seriously pursued. It was interfered very often by the humor that was no longer funny but became irritable. An excuse that every scene was significant wasn't good enough. The bots lost their characters. The cast seeming to get together from their earlier espionage wasn't planned well. overall, it didn't quite seem like a sequel.The audience were lost in the screenplay. First half had its moments now and then. But the second was a total disaster. The climax seemed to drag on forever. There was very little plot and an endless amount of Roland Emmerich there. The slow motion scenes never made sense anymore and were totally unnecessary.Sure the visuals were a treat but could never quite gel in with the script and the screenplay and thus lost appreciation. I tried to feel the emotions that the movie tried to radiate, but the mindless screenplay blocked out everything.I give it a 4 for the visuals and visuals alone.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I haven't seen any adaptation made by Michael Bay that I liked. From X-Men, and Superman to now Transformers. In fact, he doesn't make adaptations, he only steals the name of the characters and makes something of his own and Transformers is no exception.Even though the movie has amazing effects, the story runs extremely fast at first, and then super slow towards the end, you are presented with characters that you are supposed to know but they never explain to you how or why. From a Transformers fan I would say ""hideous"", as an common cinephile, ""confusing"". The comedy is very cheap, many sex jokes there, and the screaming, gosh!!!, two hours of screaming.The worst thing of this movie is that Michael Bay transformed Optimus Prime, a wise and brave warrior that preferred non-violent actions, into a cold hearted murderer.To sum it all, this movie is everything but Transformers.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sounds familiar? Transformers 3 is like the last two Transformers, only longer and with more explosions. Michael Bay's focus was clearly on the spectacles, and not in story telling. The story, if you try to follow it, doesn't make sense, and it's everywhere. If I can describe it to you in one word it's: vomit; it's all over the place, and it's the regurgitation of the first two movies.Acting was okay. I thought Shia was good, Rosie okay, and the other actors, just doing the same thing. The one character that I loved was Dutch, played by Alan Tudyk (very underrated actor in my opinion). And Ken Jeong... I don't why he was there, he didn't fit in with the Tone of Transformers movie. And Patrick Dempsey as the bad guy? Please. Overall, if you just want to see explosions, robots, hot girls, and 3D ... go see it.

I felt like I wasn't angry with the movie unlike when I watched part II, everything was the same but slightly different, more muted, not a lot, but more grounded in reality, again a little.Mike Bay is no longer The Fallen, it's official. The movie is too long, loud, mental and semi offensive but all that gets a pass as Bay is on Bayform again. People saying Rosie Huntington Whitley can't act can fall silent, I can act and for her debut performance in a feature film of this scope she pulls it off with aplomb and a slight coolness, plus for a woman she's hot. Shia is the weak link again, I like the dude but he needs to take it down a notch, a notch the size of Jupiter. Frances MacDormand apart from looking EXACTLY like my mum, and how off putting and weird is that in films, I've still not recovered from her turn in Burn After Reading, I mean she looks like my mum, anyway she is great in this role, slightly amused but not showing it, classy. Military goes bang as expected and it's awesome to behold. I hate, hate, hated part II Bays redeemed himself in my book. Looked amazing, Sentinel was great, Shock and Soundwave totally underutilised, though looked very cool, imagine how much more cooler the end battle would be with less generic-decepticons and some actual characters, Laserbeak is excellently done. I'm totes pleasantly surprised. Part IV please Mr Bay.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

But to their dismay, the other side wanted something totally different to bring their own world to the planet that is was weak in their eyes – the Decepticons.In 2009, there was a revenge from the Decepticons to take the earth's sun to destroy it so that they could bring the world to a extinction, but the Autobots including its leader Optimus Prime fought his own brother, Megatron and his other brother, better known as The Fallen. Both Megatron and The Fallen had their plans foiled by Optimus and the only human who could understand them – Sam.In 2011, the Decepticons bring a whole new strategy to the big screen – they use a member of the human race to deceive the humans and the Autobots. The only way to stop the Decepticons to destroy them and to stop them from bring Cypertron and re-creating Earth to make it their home.These movies can't compare to any other Sci-Fi movie. They are what we call great entertainment. I have to give props to the greatest iconic director of all time – Steven Spielberg and the genius behind the Transformers Trilogy – Michael Bay. There is no one in the nation that can outdo these 2 gentleman. The cast was incredible from the boy who started the phenomenon – Shia Labouef to the newcomer girlfriend, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The third movie was in one word – INCREDIBLE!!!

The movie would only look good in the eyes of children (some children may not like it as countless civilians are being spared amongst the havoc, as the main characters just stroll in and survive everything). The way the SWAT team fall off a building and then glide at a supersonic horizontal speed with such control is beyond my belief. Terrible ending. No consideration to the destruction and death toll caused in Washington during or after the battle.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Got to say I am very disappointed and after Bay promising this movie was going to be a big step up from the last 2, it never felt like it.Michael Bay overdid this movie, he should have kept it simple. He should have known the factors which made the last 2 movies a success and re create it or at least include some of it but Dark of the Moon tried to do too many things and failed to focus on the core.A small example, for any movie the soundtrack is a major part and I was surprised to see it took an hour and half into the movie for transformers trademark soundtrack. Last 2 movies they gave me goosebumps every time Optimus Prime entered the scene with background music on, but this time around it was more like 'meh'. I always thought Megan Fox was just about looks, but the new girl made Megan Fox's acting look very good. Graphics was overly well done. Probably the recent best movie in terms of action, explosion, robots and cars but if you are a hardcore transformers fan, lower your expectation. Nevertheless you will definitely get your money worth at the theater :)","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

One of them are blockbusters, which are most of the time brainless visual feast, something you enjoy watching and something you don't nitpick every little detail (like ""ah, this is so unbelievable"" or ""yeah, not very likely to happen..."").Michael Bay is the top director in this category. He knows how to entertain and he is a visual master. I don't see how anyone can deny that.The Transformers movies are not something where I'm relying heavily on plot and script. And believe me, you will hear about ""ridiculous story line"", ""why didn't this one do that in the previous films"" and more. But all I ask of you is this: what is it that you look for in a summer blockbuster movie? The CGI is getting better and better. This is really spectacular in 3D and the noise ... wow! It's amazing! I'm predicting this film to be the second most popular film of 2011 (after Harry Potter of course) and the reason is that it deserves it. There is a script, and the funny part is that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the one-liners the characters shout at each other, I think Shia is a great actor and we got a new female lead who is a lot more believable than Megan Fox was. Even big names like Frances McDormand and John Malkovich are added to the mix and make this more enjoyable. It may be easy acting in front of ""nothing"" (i.e. the robots added later) but the believability of it is a lot stronger here than in many other films.Jabolonsky's music is powerful, cinematography is great, cgi is perfect, acting is believable, you will laugh, you will be excited and you will enjoy it.Give in and let go ... enjoy this visual feast for it will blow your mind. Totally worth the money. I'm 40 yrs old and my 14 yr old daughter agrees with me :-)","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"","","Transformers: Dark of the Moon - gross, overfed and offensive","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2459310/?ref_=tt_urv","mattbarberuk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27041442/?ref_=tt_urv","16 July 2011","Transformers: Dark of the Moon – another piece of evidence in the trial of Michael Bay. A while ago I reviewed the previous Transformers movie, and I suggested that I was discomforted by Bay's sexual politics – his slightly unpleasant juxtaposing of Megan Fox's arse with shiny cars and metallic technology. Bay has skilfully avoided this in the third film of the trilogy by sacking Fox. Instead, he unpleasantly juxtaposes newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whitely arse with machinery. Does this help? No – instead Bay comes out of directing this film looking like a cross between a teenage boy and a fetishistic sex offender. And that's just the start of why I find Bay offensive...The film concerns the discovery in 1969 of an Autobot (good Transformers) spaceship on the dark side of the moon. Inside the spaceship lies Septimus Prime, the legendary former leader of the Autobots, and a collection of mysterious columns. The Decepticons (nasty Transformers) use the columns to revive their flagging forces and, having apparently dispatched the last remaining Autobots, plot to enslave the human race.Good points? Not many – the special effects are satisfying, particularly the mechanical Transformers. There is a degree of Top Gun pleasure in seeing explosions and militaristic technology and if you don't appreciate this then you find yourself appreciating the loving, if adolescent, care and attention Bay has lavished on his presentation of these elements. There is also something compelling about the tying in of the space race with the Transformer mythos – though this, as I will later suggest, is also taken too far and tips over into offensiveness. To give Bay his due – there is more plot in this movie than in the previous two combined.Bad points? Unfortunately I have a limit on my website server that prevents me from listing all of the bad points of this movie – so I might have to summarise the main ones...First – the aforementioned sexual politics. This is nothing new – the erosion of the distinction between technology and sex has been a staple of the action movie and it even enhances some movies. Michael Bay uses it bluntly however. He pans provocatively and lingeringly up the long legs of Huntington-Whitely then allows the camera to dwell with as much attention on the lines of a sports car. When used critically or even ironically these kinds of shots can be interesting – but here the enthusiastic fusion of sex and flesh with machinery and metal is just unsettling. When combined with Bay's unalloyed regard for the American armed forces it becomes worrying.Second – the conspiracy plot. In some ways this makes the movie – the moon landing is a rich source of myth and paranoid narratives – but bay takes it too far. He suggests that the whole space race was a military conspiracy, depicting presidents, astronauts, cosmonauts, NASA administrators as complicit in the deception - he goes so far as to engages the real Buzz Aldrin to play himself. I think it's the scale of Bay's proposed conspiracy that is uncomfortable coupled with a clear lack of its implications. The space race, whilst a component of the Cold War, has always had an idealistic aura much like the climbing of mountains. To suggest, albeit in the context of a fantasy movie, that the space race was a part of a wider, covert military exercise is analogous to his combining technology with sex – the act of juxtaposition is not uncommon, but the way Bay does it makes it offensive.Third – the battle scenes are interminably long and indistinct. For the casual viewer the sight of one machine fighting another is bound to be confusing – the sight of one machine fighting another for half-an-hour is enough to give you a headache. But again I felt uncomfortable. The final battle, taking place as it does in central Chicago, seems to draw a great deal of imagery from 9/11 – building toppling, people falling, panic, dust, shots of office paraphernalia tumbling from sky-scrapers. Again this is not unusual – but Bay frames these scenes in a prurient, almost salacious way. When he shows a man falling from a building he sticks with him almost to the end. The 3D technology give the viewer a real sense of what it may have been like to fall from the World Trade Centre – but it is tied up in a vision of fantasy spectacle that is just wrong. And as my wife noted – despite all this carnage, Rosie Huntington-Whitely still found time to change her outfit three times.Amongst all this sex, conspiracy, militaristic posing and inappropriate nods to 9/11, the worst aspect of the movie must surely be that for all the money spent and for all the technology used, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is rather boring. Aside from the traditionally eccentric displays from Johns Malkovich and Turturro, the rest of the cast is bland and unengaging. The leads Shia LaBeouf and Rosie Huntington-Whitely act like they know they're in an action movie and fail to wring and chemistry or believability out of their performances. With Huntington-Whitely this is forgivable as it is her first proper role – with LaBeouf this is simply another performance that falls flat.So apart from the fact that I find Michael Bay mildly offensive and Shia LaBeouf boring; apart from the fact I found the combination of technology and sex distasteful and the conspiracy narrative to be degrading; apart from the fact that I somehow found the battle scenes dull and perversely distasteful – I'd recommend you to go and watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon.But don't forget your sleeping pills, blindfold and earplugs.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Its too long, over the top, pointless and takes a good hour for people to actually understand what the plot is.It starts off with a neat and clever little homage to American history that promises so much more than it delivers. Then it gets messy! We see our hero for the first time with his new girlfriend. And this is where the special effects is most impressive because those lips are surely not real? But she is easily the most beautiful thing about this film. It is RHW that stopped me from leaving prematurely. Not for her acting ability of course. But cue a bunch of random explosions and slow motion action sequences that seemingly have nothing to do with the story. No character development, the script is terrible and some of the one liners are cringe worthy. Throw in a couple of big name actors and actresses that have no reason to be there, but maybe good actors can salvage the mess? No they can't. Alan Tudyk is probably worth one star in this movie. But not enough to make a bad script work.Shia disappointed me in this too. I always thought he had brilliant presence and charisma as an actor, but maybe because of a lack of story, direction and script it ruined his last outing as Sam Witwicky.Yes the cars are gorgeous, RHW is too, the special effects are impressive, but only in the chase scene on the highway which was, might I add, a carbon copy of the first Transformers movie. All other effects lacked something I can't quite put my finger on. The ending is a joke too. It is no more than anyone expected but although the film was about an hour too long, the ending seemed horribly rushed.But thank god this is the last one at least for Michael Bay. Just because your making a movie with fast cars, beautiful women, explosions and spectacular SFX, doesn't mean it'll be any good! 3 out of 10 for Alan Tudyk, SFX and RHW's lips!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

This third installment outdoes ""Revenge of the Fallen (ROTF)"" but it never surpasses the grandness of the first ""Transformers"". It ends Michael Bay's successful series on an assuring note, leaving no potential possibility of a sequel; rather, it leaves a sense of satisfaction for wrapping up any loose ends.The plot is much simpler than ""ROTF"" but it is still complex to follow compared to ""Transformers"". The background centers on the American-Soviet race to the moon. The American government, unbeknownst to the public, sends Apollo 11 to investigate alien wreckage on the dark side of the moon which turns out to be a ship from the robot planet Cybertron. In the present day, the Autobots learn of the secret mission and discover that the ship holds pieces to a weapon used to teleport matter between two points through a space bridge. The U.S. National Intelligence Director (played by Frances McDormand) fears its use as a means to invade Earth and the Autobots feel betrayed by humans who promised to share information so a mutual distrust ensues. Elsewhere, the Decepticons collaborate with certain humans to eliminate individuals involved in the space program and plot to invade Earth again. As all of this continues, we periodically follow Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf) struggling with two things: a relationship with a new girl (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and the search for a job. But, once again, he is going to be part of this war and fight for the survival of his planet.In an interview with USA Today, Michael Bay promised to trim the ""dorky comedy"" including the twin ghetto robots (Mudflap and Skids) and make the third film darker. He keeps his word, for the most part, by showing more death and destruction than his previous works combined. Bay has the power to make his scenes emotional when he gives it his all yet he gives ""DOTM"" too little dosage of that power. There is enough to get people caring but not to the point where they succumb to grief and despair over hurt or loss like in ""The Rock"" shower room sequence. The slapstick nature that haunted ""ROTF"" has been cut massively in ""DOTM"" in favor of Bay's routine commercial comedy. I have to confess something; while a lot of people say Bay's sense of humor is overdone or foolish, I find it strangely entertaining. The comedy pays off with funny (even if goofy) dialogue and surprise cameos; however, all pale in comparison to the secret weapon: Ken Jeong. The man has officially become a sensation and now he serves as the secondary comic relief. He delivers the bulk of the commercial comedy and is gut-wrenchingly hysterical. I say ""Kudos"" to Bay and writer Ehren Kruger for being more certain of this movie's direction than in ""ROTF"".""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a 3D visual fiesta for the audience and I think they will get their money's worth with the glasses. Debris, people, and robots fly through the third dimension for an experience unfelt since ""Avatar"". The action scenes, patched with slow-motion instances, still command the screen with awesome spectacle even if they don't quite take the breath away the way ""Transformers"" did. The transformations are fun to watch while Bay's explosions are less wild than before. Cinematography and sound are at the top of their game; it wouldn't surprise me if they, along with the visual effects, are nominated for Oscars.The robots are treated with more respect this time around: Optimus Prime has a bigger role, Megatron reveals his fears and dismay, the miniature Wheelie and his new partner Brains are not mere merchandise for kids, and there are no gargantuan robot balls clanking anywhere. Several new robots make their debut such as Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), a bird-like cyborg called Laserbeak who serves Megatron, and the Decepticon Shockwave who controls a snake-like machine for transportation and decimation. As the robots have become leaner, the fighting, especially in the long climax, has become more brutal and violent. The robots are definitely revamped although one of the main problems of ""DOTM"" is its lag from peculiar human characters.Acting was never a great strength in the ""Transformers"" trilogy and it is not significantly good in ""DOTM"". Shia LaBeouf gives one of the most weird, bipolar performances of his career. In some scenes, he angrily freaks out, an unusual mood swing from his likable, humble side; it's a strange case of role reversal. On a more positive note, Ehren Kruger's script gives Shia's character into his doubts and troubles, enough to create a substantial protagonist. Newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a terrible actress and I abhor saying it. Of all the actresses out there, she is the one selected to replace Megan Fox. Although Fox may have underperformed her role in the first two movies, she is much more realistic and alive than Rosie. Almost all of the supporting actors behave childishly from John Malkovich to John Turturro with a few exceptions including Frances McDormand and Patrick Dempsey. Sadly, both of these fine actors failed to give ideal characteristics to their roles: Dempsey should have had a more tough personality whereas McDormand could have hinted a slight fragility in her strong character like she did in ""Fargo"".Do not let my final rating discourage you from seeing ""DOTM""; it is only my individual opinion of the entire movie as a whole. Nevertheless, ""DOTM"" is destined to be a mega hit in the box office and a standout summer blockbuster. If you wish to see jaw-dropping action, you found the right film. If you prepare in advance to follow a hard story, you will probably have an even greater time. If you want to have fun, simply have fun! My Rating: 5/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

So I fell asleep as I do when there is to much action and sound, my brain shuts itself down. As with the marvelous car-race scene in The Matrix 2 and Die Gõtterdammerung shown in cinemas in Norway from The Metropolitan last year. Sweet dreams.Sorry for that, but I lost the red line as the story was disturbed of too much action and could not hold my attention. I am kind of sorry I have to add 10 lines as a minimum, I prefer to be short. When that said I liked to see Patrick Demsey other than Dr.Sheperd from Greys Anatomy.

Also Rosie Huntington- Whitley did all that was expected, But why in hell did you have to cast such beautiful people in the main roles, like cheap American series, all beautiful with no lived lives, It is not enough to say I did that and that and nearly died hear all the tragedies of my life, and so on. It has to show in the faces for the characters to be credible!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Michael Man's franchise stinks more than a Tea Party convention.First of all, will a much more advanced alien civilisation team up with US army to attach Iran's ""illegal"" nuclear facility? Why is it legal for one country to have nuclear technology and not for another? It is so stupid and certainly autobots would have better things to do.And then we have Frances McDormand's character bossing autobots around. Yes, sure, as they would take orders from a brainless high military officer. Ah, and of course, some completely out of place republican joke about Obama.Really, it is unbearable and it pains me as the action is good and the potential of the film high.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Or twos. For that matter, the first one could be pretty rancid, too. But the intended audience for the Transformers movies don't care; no matter how wretched and incomprehensible these movies are, they make money. Probably partly because they're now being released in 3D, tickets to which are more costly, but I digress.Some people like to watch things blow up and require little else in a movie. We refer to these people as Michael Bay fans. Bay here continues his long-standing tradition of churning out a pile of exploding crap - but with robots! They make all the difference. Imagine a movie in which every scene was essentially a ""we're running out of time"" scenario, with every other minute filled with something either getting hit or hitting something else, and you have a Michael Bay movie. This is not news.I can't blame Bay for making the movie or for actors like Shia Labeouf and John Turturro and Josh Duhamel appearing in them. The movies are mints, both domestically and internationally. Explosions are the true worldly language. And I can't blame those who want only this kind of movie to exist; after all, in theory their patronage allows smaller films to exist. But all of that aside, this is a trainwreck of a movie. It has a laughable plot, hysterically bad acting, and unfathomable fight scenes and seems to have been filmed by a pixie in the middle of a glue-sniffing marathon. It's inept and probably shouldn't be watched unless one is actually under the influence. Or paid.Anyway, it seems something's been dormant on the moon lo these many years - hence why no one's conveniently been back since '72 - and it has something to do with our new friends, the Autobots. Megatron, evil bad guy supreme, is back; Optimus Prime, super good guy revives an older prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) inside the ship found on the moon, but before you know it the Autobots are fighting Megatron's Decepticons in an effort not to take over the world. Some robots return from the first and/or second movies. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Labeouf), the luckless loser of the first two films who somehow manages to get the girl and his own pet robot/car, is also back - with a new girl, played by the very British newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and is now looking for a job. He's constantly whining about it, too. Oh, and his new girl - whom he met while getting a medal from President Obama, no less - has a kick-ass job doing something or other with a suspicious-looking Patrick Dempsey.In short - robots attack, other robots fight back, good robot-on-robot action, boy saves world again, gets girl, and roll credits.What's there to like about this one? Well, Huntington-Whiteley is not terrible. She may even be better than the deposed Megan Fox. But she doesn't screw up, and that's good. She looks pretty, and the camera notices. Hm, other than that, there's some interesting fight scenes. But let me tell you about those fight scenes.When you have two robots fighting each other, particularly amid an urban landscape, you should make sure they are discernible from each other. I know, sounds elementary and obvious, but not to Michael Bay. There are plenty of fight scenes in which each or all robot participants are gray/beige. Optimus Prime is easy to pick out - he's blue and red. Bumblebee is yellow. Most, if not all, of the Decepticons are gray and black. Even some of the Autobots are gray and black. Then the action is so whiplash inducing that it's tough to understand who's actually winning a battle.This kind of movie requires that one suspend disbelief. This movie in particular, however, requires that you expel disbelief from your mind for an extended, indefinite leave. First, there's the robots. They're sentient and have weaponry. And yet somehow they're not bulletproof. Now, I'm not bulletproof, although I can strap on a vest that will make me so, to a degree, but the reason we humans don't wear them is that a) we're not always in peril and b) the vests are pretty heavy and not at all slimming. Why aren't these robots impervious to Earth bullets? Then there's Sam Witless. Fresh out of college, he expects - because he saved the world twice! - to land a Top Job. He's an idiot. There's literally no reason for him to be hanging around at all in this movie, because he shouldn't possess the skills to fight alongside the Autobots. He's small, he's dumb, he's weak - or so he seems. Yeah, in the fight scenes he's suddenly Superman. He runs like a stuntman. (For that matter, so does Huntington-Whiteley.) How did he come to have such power and strength? How come he's given - more than once - firearms? Has he training in operating these weapons? I am thinking no. He's like a little kid who thinks he's Indiana Jones and John McClane rolled into one. Just awful.To top it all off, we also get the return of Sam's parents, who apparently are RVing around the world and visit Sam a week earlier than he'd thought - oh, sitcom time! As before, his mom's incredibly dumb but well meaning and his dad's a sullen jerk who obviously turns good at the end. (For half the movie he brings up how his son doesn't have a job yet.) I hope none of you saw this in the theater. If you did, I hope you didn't pay extra to see it in 3D. Why bother? This movie's an embarrassment. Amazingly, Frances McDormand is in this movie. She has a rather large role. She should burn all copies of this movie and pretend it never happened. She should return to, you know, good movies. I felt so bad for her here.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

All the boys need is insanely super cool robots and sexy girls. Thiz one is the third movie following ""Transformers"" (2007) and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" (2009). The story still revolves around Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his new super sexy girlfriend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Thiz time, they have to uncover the mysterious origins of Autobots and Decepticons which later take them to a hidden fact when Apollo 11 landed on dark side of the moon 42 years ago. The movie featuring a real hero, the second person ever to walk on the moon, Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin. The Director is still Michael Bay. I aware that Michael Bay always has a young spirit in all of his movies, even in his war movie like ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). But I also have to say most of his movies are always filled with exaggerated brainless actions and comically overacted characters like in ""Bad Boys"" (1995), ""The Rock"" (1996) and ""Armageddon"" (1998). If it's not because of Steven Spielberg's involvement as Executive Producer that contributes lots of technical elements, I think that thiz movie would have been easily forgotten. Yes, the detail of Special Effects is incredible. It's very clear that the main attraction is on its robots. The Autobots consists of Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Dino, Brains, Wheelie and the leader Optimus Prime. They are back in action to fight for freedom. And the villainous side named Decepticon consists of Starscream, Shockwave, Soundwave, Laserbeak and the leader Megatron. All of them still dream of tyranny. The robots are voiced by some well-known Actors such as Hugo Weaving as Megatron and Star Trek's Mr. Spock, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime. Thiz is one of the very rare cases which the robots have better performances than the human Actors. All actors are drawn to be unnecessary comical characters without exception, including John Malkovich, Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong and Tyrese Gibson. The model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has the same color of lipstick and hair, it doesn't mean that she can instantly replace Megan Fox's character. As you can see, she is there only to provide the visual pleasure, not acting. Julie White repeats her overacted performance as Sam's mother, thiz is one of the ugliest actings you will ever see. Sam's character is not lovable at all. I don't know what Shia LaBeouf thinks when he delivers such a character. Sam is just a jerk with amazingly gorgeous girlfriend beside him. He looks so cocky and egoistic by always yelling and swearing during the entire film. It comes to my mind, maybe they need to get rid all of the human characters in next films, and let the robots deal with their own conflicts, just like what we had in original animated TV series ""The Transformers"" in 1984 to 1987. Thiz movie has shown that's one step back for the Actors and one giant leap for the robots.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I liked the first two, but didn't love them. The first one disappointed me the first time I saw it because it was too childish. The second one I liked much better, but even though the fight scenes were great, there was still too much mangled metal flying around the screen to really tell what was happening.This time around Bay promised a darker movie. It wasn't a lot darker, but enough to satisfy all audiences I think. I think Bay went into this wanting to throw just about every possible action sequence into one movie. He accomplished that goal. What a wild ride. Epic action/destruction scenes. The action was much easier to follow this time. The camera wasn't so jumpy, and they slowed stuff down just right so we could tell what the hell was going on. Much appreciated improvement!My only complaint is that when they fired Megan Fox, they had the perfect opportunity to leave a lame ass love story out of this action/scifi flick, but instead they write in another sucky girlfriend plot. Lucas couldn't do it, and Bay should have taken notes. Quit trying to write a love story into our action/scifi flicks already! The new girlfriend wasn't hard on the eyes, but all I saw was a pointless character. If I ignore her like I do Jar Jar Binks, the movie was a solid 9, with her in it, it was an 8.Very satisfied this time around. LOVED IT!

But, it is really only appropriate for kids ages 13 and up. View her video review here or read below: ""Transformers 3, Dark of the Moon is a non-stop thrill ride. This action packed film is a fantastic addition in the Transformers series. The cinematography and special effects are absolutely breathtaking in 3D! This film has so much action and the sound effects are so intense that it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film!My favorite character is Bumblebee because he is so sweet and he is there to catch Sam when he falls. Literally! And of course, once again, I love Shia LeBeouf's performance! I have been a fan of his acting for years, even before Transformers. My favorite scene is in the beginning when it shows actual footage of the moon launch because it is fascinating to see how many people were so eager to witness that back then.I love this movie so much because it has everything: Action, comedy, suspense and romance. The one thing I think is unnecessary in this movie is that every time the Decepticons are killed, they bleed. It's weird because that didn't happen in the first two films and they are machines—they can't bleed! Also, the blood looks very unrealistic so it seems pointless.This film is for ages 13 and up because there is a lot of adult humor that is very inappropriate for younger audiences. This film has a lot more violence than the first films. There are also somewhat gruesome deaths throughout the movie.Overall, I give Transformers 3 two thumbs up!!!!""

The 1st one was a bit like a Disney/teen movie, funny and the story between Megan Fox and Shia LaBouf was cute, my kids loved it. In the second opus, it was more about pure action, like the 2nd Alien, robot fighting without any plot whatsoever I liked it because I am a fan of CGI and Sci-Fi movies...However, I always found that Megan Fox was great here to compensate the excessive number of robots and metal, cars and trucks in the movie. Her character could have been more deep and I was expecting that M.Bay would give her a chance one day.The first thing that really made me spend a bad time in the theater is that each time I saw Rosie Huntington-Whiteley I was thinking ""she does not match"". It is like having Lara Croft instead of Ripley in Aliens. Then, in my opinion, the chemistry between the 2 main character was not working at all.I have nothing personal against Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, she is probably a great artist, but she do not do a good job at replacing Megan Fox. It distracted me to the point that I could not connect with the characters. Too much boom, bang swing, splash and no connection: I started watching my watch... There is a point where CGI and technical skills, kills the movie if there is nothing else. I got enough action in Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, so I was not so impressed by the new actions scenes. Since Godzilla, blowing up things is nothing new...It seems that M.Bay decided to follow the Batman, or Star Wars series where the 3rd opus is more dramatic and dark than the other ones.But to get back to my point, robots even with a soul cannot replace the cute face of Megan Fox. Even if she was not the best actress (or she had the worse script and dialogs, we will never know), she was bringing some human beauty and feelings to the opposite mechanical actors, giving Shia a real goal to save his lovely lady: this was connecting me with the characters and adding some humanity to an otherwise very cold movie...M.Bay maybe think he can replace an actress with another, but us, the public will greatly miss Megan Fox.

After the disaster of the Revenge of the Fallen i was in doubt to see the third one, but it was not disappointed at all. But still through all movie something was missing.Do you remember when you saw the first transformers film, it was something new, fresh. Third movie was great but the charm is forever lost. Like in all movie sequels first is always the best because of it freshness.Bay promised a lot of this film, that here the story is better, action, characters. But we could split movie in to parts ! First part of the movie is story, it gives you answer to all questions and explain every thing it gets quite boring, because it in evolve in Sam boring life and the problems with job,friend, family. It is not a lot of actions at all. But second part is all action and there is no room for story. I didn't like that very much. And when Decepticons prevail city is more alien invasion movie than transformers.It is not amazing movie and there is nothing new it is just summer pop corn movie with no deep story or anything.And another thing in million of explosions Carly is NOT dirty, and her hair looks beautifully !","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

To me it seems like Michael Bay is trying to milk the franchise and people of their money because he knows that the movie will do okay in theaters based on the fan base. The plot is very dull and very uninteresting and I find it incredibly hard to believe that Sam witwicky would abandon the girl that HE SAVED THE WORLD WITH for another girl so quickly. It would have made more sense to me if they had left the girlfriend part of the story out completely. Instead, however, they wrote a girlfriend part of the story in and made Sam seem like a total dirt bag. All in all this third installment, as far as I am concerned, takes a big dump on the series as a whole.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I promise to give you a sound and logical review for the new Transformers film.In 2007, the world was blown away by Michael Bay's testosterone filled extravaganza - ""Transformers"". It was loud, over-the-top, and packed a heavy punch to the senses. What made it so special was the beautifully rendered action sequences, and the concepts behind them. This was Michael Bay being Michael Bay, and not giving a s**t what you thought about that. Fast Forward to 2009. Bay releases one of the most commercially successful movies in box office history - ""Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen"". This time the critics were less accepting and universally bombed virtually every aspect of the film. I, along with most, agree that it was a step in the wrong direction for the Transformers franchise. While the action was stellar and even bigger than the first, key elements helped completely ruin the experience. The comedy was slapstick and stupid. The story was jumbled and incoherent. The finale was cliché and stale. Nevertheless, for Transformers fans it wasn't all terrible. The CGI was brilliant and the action was still breathtaking. Now here we are in 2011 with the complete Transformers trilogy out in the world. ""Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon"" is the finest film in the series hands down. Gone is the poor slapstick humor asserting itself in the middle of our beautiful action scenes. It has been replaced with funny situational comedy and genuinely humorous anecdotes. The story is now coherent and easy to follow, and the characters (both bot and human) are well built and likable. The bots now share the film's universe on screen instead of overwhelm it. The action is as always intense and over the top. The finale is wonderful and intriguing and keeps you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat. Michael Bay has truly made this series his own and ended it with a loud and thunderous bang. In conclusion, if you are an action fan then you will love this film. There's beautiful women, exotic cars, mass destruction, and gigantic robots that beat other's as**s in full 3d. There's conspiracy theories, government cover-ups, and huge military operations with equally awesome military equipment. There's heroes and enemies, betrayals and redemption. This is what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be. Go in, kick back, and enjoy the carnage! As a lover of good action movies I must give this one a 8/10.(Transformers - 7/10) (Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen - 6/10)","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"","","A dark plot ruined by silliness, corny touches, pointless franchise characters and everything done OTT just because they can afford it","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2507203/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","23 October 2011","What is there left to say about this endless franchise? I guess that the summer season will always produce overblown effects movies that make for easy crown-pleasing noise – it may as well be the devil we know rather than one we don't. This third film opens with a surprisingly engaging rewriting of history to place the Transformers at the heart of historical events from the middle of the last century. This is the preamble to a story that sees the city of Chicago in ruins, people vaporised in front of the camera and a plan to enslave humanity to rebuild the lost world of Cybertron. I'm not suggesting it is Shakespeare but for sure the plot on the face of it offers at least something of interest.Sadly within seconds of his opening, we are introduced back into the same nonsense that makes these films so difficulty to enjoy. The silliness of the dumb ""comedy"" that they try to introduce, the overly wordy plot exposition (these films normally assume that most of the audience are too dumb to follow without it all being explained via one character explaining things to the other) and just the sheer unnecessary overblown nature of everything that does hurt the film badly. The plot is hurt by it because it is not given room to breathe, while we see plenty of devastation, we are never allowed (or even encouraged) to feel anything about any of it. I'm of the opinion that interesting sci-fi can still be full of action – but this film seems to be in an either/or camp because it is all about the spectacle here.Once we do get rolling with that though, it is hard to deny that the film is technically very impressive. The effects are great and the sheer scale of it as a film is impressive – Bay has an ego for sure, but given the cost and the complexity of the projects he pulls of, one can understand why. And make no mistake he has done what he set out to do with this film – it is just that personally it is not enough for me to simply have effects thrown in my face. If only some of the effects shot money could have been put towards the script then maybe we could have had decent characters, or comedy that is funny, or a tone that actually draws the audience in. Sadly we get none of these things, all we get is a constant audio/visual assault that is good for that, but that alone. The action does impress even if it doesn't engage and, as much as it is an overused device, I did appreciate the slow-motion simply so I had a fighting chance of seeing who was hitting whom etc.The script is responsible for the silly dumb comedy (Sam's job interviews?) and also the unnecessary characters that are now just cluttering up the screen. So Sam returns which is understandable, it is hard to jettison your main human character, but he is a poor character – an unlikeable little oik portrayed with the usual lack of charisma and presence by LaBeouf. As we all know Huntington-Whiteley replaces Fox and her part in the film is made clear from her first shot (it is of her legs and ass). This is all she is and, while easy on the eye she is stiff and unnatural throughout the film, feeling like little more than a doll. While she is poor, she is not as annoying as the many returning characters who simply add nothing but brand-familiarity; it also hurts that several of them are played by very good actors. Turturro is an embarrassment – nothing else to say. Gibson and Duhamel are both good at the ""running with guns"" thing but their presence as characters is daft and again hurts the narrative. Dempsey is a decent turn while McDormand at least has the decency to look like she's there for the money and do as little as possible. Dunn and White return as his parents – someone thinks their characters are funny and worth bringing back to do the same old stuff over and over, they are wrong. John Malkovich does a stupid and unnecessary character that achieves nothing but earn him money and lose him respect. But this isn't an actor's film is it? It is about the action Overall Transformers 3 is just what you expect it to be. Not quite as bad as the second film but it has all the strengths you expect (technically expensive) and all of the weaknesses too (almost everything else). It is an ""event"" movie so the normal rules don't apply, but I liked the plot and I liked the effects – a bit of work on the script, dropping loads of characters, dropping sappy rock ballads and maybe letting the camera stay in one place for longer than 2 seconds and MAYBE this could also have been an enjoyable film rather than a technically impressive battering. It is empty and lacking atmosphere, heart and intelligence while it rushes to throw as much action and money onto the screen as possible – whether the audience care about what they are seeing or not.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"","","How about we transform into a better movie?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2523080/?ref_=tt_urv","The_Film_Cricket","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0310469/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2011","Having endured the mind-numbing dumb-headedness of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, I arrive at this second sequel with a sense of overriding weariness. We know the pattern by now because it doesn't seem willing to change: The good-natured Autobots have a tiff with the hate-fueled Decepticons and they have brought their war to our planet so we can watch one of our most beautiful metropolises (In this case, Chicago) demolished for well over an hour. What did Chicago do to deserve this? Transformers: Dark of the Moon has more story than the previous films, but it is still another loud, dumb, crude, overlong monstrosity. The story is convoluted and involves a plot that begins in the early 1960s, surmising that President Kennedy's determination to put a man on the moon was fueled by an alien spacecraft called The Ark that landed there (Kennedy occupies the film via a bad special effect that is ineffective and rather creepy). Between the giant robots that inspired the moon landing and the mutants that got involved in The Cuban Missle Crisis in this summer's X-Men: First Class, it is wonder that JFK didn't resign.Here in the good old 21st century, the war between the two robot factions has come to earth and the only real question to be raised is which faction will occupy the planet once our cities are reduced to rubble in the mechanical struggle. I didn't really care why the robots came to earth or what they did when they got here. After the movie explains their intentions, I somehow felt that I was better off not knowing. I thought back to the simplistic purpose of this summer's superb Super 8, in which the visiting alien's central focus was a willingness to tear this planet apart just to get off of it, The Transformers plot over-extends itself.On the human scale, the Autobot's top ally is Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) who has graduated from college, taken up with a gorgeous new girlfriend named Carley (Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whitely) and is frustrated because he can't find a decent job. On top of that, a billionaire car collector who is Carley's former boyfriend. Sam is frustrated a lot in this movie. He screams a lot, throws fits a good chunk of the time and seems so animated that we wonder if he isn't on something. It is possible that Mr. LeBeouf may have figured out what I have about his role: If we stand back and look at this plot from a distance, Sam really has no purpose in this movie.Humans are beside the point. My overriding problem with Transformers: Dark of the Moon rests with the robots. The Autobots and the Decepticons are incomprehensible when you look at them. I can't tell one from the other. They seem built from a morass of metal that forms something 40-feet tall with arms and legs and something that might be mistaken for a face. This time around some have hair for reasons I can't begin to explain. Those faces aren't expressive, but hidden within all the metal. They have mouths but why do they need them? When they fight and their bodies are pressed against one another, you can't tell one from the other. They're metal, therefore they can't get hurt, so why do we care? If they get destroyed, they can be rebuilt. Right? Plus, they make no logical sense. How does a 50 foot-tall robot have enough metal in his body to transform into a full-sized pick-up truck? They are on this planet to fight one another, but what are they fighting about? What makes a robot good or evil? Who decided which side they would be on? What makes them intelligent? What makes them able to think and talk? What do they do when they aren't fighting? Who sent them here? Who built them? Why were they built? Why do they transform into a automobiles? The robots are all male, so are their females? Was this trip really necessary?","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even the CGI (which up to this point was pretty good) is bad, there were scenes where I felt like I could see where the green screen was. The frustrating part of it is that you can see the potential of this series, the transforming robots are cool and the comic book story behind it is interesting. But other than the robots everything else in the movies is total crap. Cliché after cliché and the girl they have playing Sam's girlfriend is totally useless, she is nothing but eye candy the whole movie and then at the end they give her a few lines to try and make her character matter. Another thing that angered me was the lines they give the robots, why are they all using slang? They are a millions year old race of robots and they use our slang? But I think that sums up the problem with this movie, Michael Bay took a good story and changed it into a stupid pop culture music video. Also, I am waiting for him to make a movie where all people do is get out of cars, apparently his signature scene. I also hated the Star Trek line they threw in at the end. This is more than just a bad movie, its an insult to movie goers, Michael Bay is telling us this is what you like. I hate myself for going to see this movie, but I am a sucker for the blockbuster and so I found myself sitting in the theatre wringing my hands. I would love to see Christopher Nolans take on this story, not sure if this is his style but at least he would spend more than 10 minutes writing the story.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Michael Bay is a grown up child with a creative imagination, and indisputably, a very hard work ethic. He makes movies to entertain, and knows what every male wants to see: action, sex, humor, action, action, and more action, and knows how to deliver those in a solid manner. With blood pumping entertainment and orgasms for your eyes. Some may complain this movie has too much visual flare for your brain to process, even more so in 3d, but this has set a new bar in the eyegasm genre, and it's damn entertaining to watch. And that is what we go to movies for is it not? To be entertained? What he does NOT always do sometimes, just like many film artists, is make movies with an outstanding plot or outstanding actors. Does he have the potential? Absolutely. Does he try his best? Of course. But his specialty is fun for the audience and damn good entertainment.Bottom Line is, this movie is entertaining, from the visual and audio effects alone, regardless of plot or acting. If you were disappointed in those two and it ruined the movie for you, I'm sorry. I personally thought the plot and acting were good, not amazing, but good enough in the package, it was enjoyable for me, and if you go to movies to be entertained and can look past your pet expectations of amazing plot(It's not exactly easy to pull S7vens and Shaw-shank Redemption's out of a hat) THEN GO SEE THIS MOVIE.

This film is pretty much the opposite. Where the 2nd film introduced a slew of awful new characters, this film's fresh additions were more than welcome, especially the villains. The set of baddies in this instalment are fantastic (even the human bad guy is decent) another thing is this film has probably the best supporting cast of the franchise, including Francis McDormand, John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk and Ken Jeong. I'm not a fan of Rosie Huntington Whitely as a replacement for Fox but she does her job I suppose. Shia is probably at his best this time round, though. I also have to say that this is probably the darkest and most bold of the Bay Transformers movies, lots of betrayal and death, which is fine by me! The Story is in part a mystery which I think really helps the first act and when the action gets going it's about as good as the franchise gets. It does fall into some superhero/sci-fi cliches and it may be a bit overlong but this one is pretty darn good time if I do say so myself. A strong 8 from me.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"","","Transformers 3 is epic in 3D! (No spoilers)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451375/?ref_=tt_urv","nicholasjinmcgowan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26785983/?ref_=tt_urv","30 June 2011","Hi. I'm a pretty huge fan of the three Transformers movies because I think the action in them are great. This may surprise many of you but I actually quite enjoyed the story in the second and third movies. I recently watched Dark of the Moon and I loved it! Mainly because of the awesome 3D, special effects and action scenes that I loved it and gave it a 9 out of 10. Now again, this may surprise you, but the story actually engaged me at the beginning of the film and I thought it was interesting. The final battle in Transformers 3 is great, especially with 3D. It's a pretty cool ending to all three action movies. I think one of the main reasons why many critics dislike Transformers 2 and 3 is because they aren't fans and they don't understand the Transformers' characters well. Because I understand all the characters in the movie, I loved it! I gave it a 9 out of 10 for an interesting story for the first half of the film then for an awesome ending.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"10","/10","I never miss a chance to watch and review a Michael Bay movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454549/?ref_=tt_urv","prashanta_guha","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20322169/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2011","I've always reviewed Michael Bay movies, because I've actually liked them. All of them. This is because I consider Michael to be among the top ranks of directors, at par with notable names of today, like Christopher Nolan etc. I believe everyone has an area of expertise. For Nolan, it's creating something which will utilise every single neuron in your brain, and you'll still probably not figure out the actual story or get confused in between. With Bay, it's creating ""awesome, mind-blowing"" scenes of mayhem, action, destruction, and larger-than-life CGI and VFX shots. Both are very good at it.Like I've pointed out before, the Transformers movie DO have a story. The first one was excellent in all aspects. The second, a little bit disappointing (only on the story part), I'll admit, but then, that's the problem with most sequels isn't it. This one, the last one probably, had to go out with a bang, and that's exactly what it did, so I don't really get what people are complaining about.The story is better than the second, though not quite up to the first; the IMAX-ready shots, complete with excellent animations of transformations and added VFX, CGI etc are again the USP of the movie; Shia, John, Josh, Patrick, Frances convincingly play their part; eye candy gets replaced by eye candy, so no complaints there. The 3D increases the viewing experience, but like the pioneer of 3D movies James Cameron said, it's always better to shoot in 3D with his Fusion camera rather than convert it later (makes a hell of a difference).I again stress the fact that critics will do what they're meant to do - criticise. You want action, you go watch this movie, and you'll be surprised that that's not all there is to it. All in all, very entertaining, despite the run-time (all Michael Bay movies are long) and an IMAX 3D experience not to be missed.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

If you're hungry for big explosions, robot-on-robot battle scenes, sprinkled in with shots of the lovely Carly played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley- you'll receive your fill and then some. The primary cast from the previous two films returns, with the exception of Mikaela, Megan Fox's role, who (all sex appeal aside) was easily replaced as by the aforementioned Ms. Huntington-Whiteley. New additions to the cast include Frances McDormand, who was overly qualified for her one-note part as the Secretary of Defense. John Malkovich is excellent in his limited role as Shia LaBeouf's new boss, Bruce Brazos. (I have a sneaking suspicion that the part was written for him specifically) Patrick Dempsey does well as Dylan Gould, Carly's rich and handsome boss and for Shia LaBeouf, competition for her affection. Special acknowledgment goes to Alan Tudyk as Dutch, Simmons' (John Turturro) special assistant, who nails every scene he gets. The primary Autobots and Decepticons return, with some new looks and some new additions here and there to each side.Critics will pan this movie for this reason. All special effects aside, the plot is only an excuse for the action that occurs. The characters (new or old) are not very compelling and I felt more emotionally for the 'bots more than anyone else. I didn't seem to care about the human casualties because most of them are pretty damn useless. But listen critics, this is strictly clap your hands and smile stuff, this is the equivalent of Michael Bay jingling car keys in front of us and (just admit it) we love it. It puzzles me why Frances McDormand got into this, she's been part of so many gourmet movies, why would she be part of this greasy cheeseburger of a movie? I think it's because she's the same us- we love junk food every now and then. So when you see this flick, sit back and relax, and enjoy it for what it is. Oh, and bring extra napkins- at 2 hours and 37 minutes running time- this is a big helping.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's Transformers.Michael Bay is a visionary director, and sometimes he gets carried away in his work. The second movie was relative immature. This one has a good balance; brief enjoyable humor underscored by a sinister undertone.With Dark Of The Moon, there are moments where you'll wonder, ""why is this in here?"" or say ""he (Bay) could have done better than that."" But the hairs on your arms will be raised, and you might even get all emotional inside at moments, because when the movie does try to sock you in the heart, it does so with a crippling blow.As with the first two films, there is room for improvement. But as a whole, this is a perfect addition to the trilogy, and I say it's well worth watching.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

In fact I found some of his movies such as The Rock, Armageddon or The Island to be very decent - if outlandish - action movies with great cast and great cinematography.But the Transformers series is a torture to watch and the latest episode, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, is the worst of all. While the idea of mixing transformers with space exploration and moon program was intriguing, it was not exploited enough in an otherwise story-free screenplay that goes from nowhere to nowhere in 2 1/2 hours. Let me summarize the plot: boom bang - bang boom - boom boom - bang bang - boom bang.With such an amazing material even the good cast (Malkovitch, McDormand) can only go so far. As for non-actor Labeouf he still mixes up shouting and acting. Give him a beautiful and surprisingly decent Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and he can't for a second make us believe in a love story. Patrick Dempsey plays his character the same way he plays any character - charming but without any depth or believability - but I'm sure it won't bother his female fans.Even the special effects are boring and the sound effects are totally annoying - and nothing is new or original it was already seen and heard in the previous 2 movies.While I don't see anything wrong with cashing easy money for the old days and while I understand that this movie was aimed at young boys happy enough to see their favorite toys on screen, they still deserved better. They deserved a 1 hour 30 minutes movie packed with action, driven by a story and special effects that feel special.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I didn't feel that the new chic was the best looking match for Shia and to not to have a continuous story as to why is confusing. Story line wasn't as interesting as I anticipated too. The story made Sam look needy for attention when in the last two he was not that kind of person. If there will be a Transformers 4 I hope they do whatever they have to to get Meghan Fox back.

After the mess that was Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, many people involved, including Bay and Shia LaBeouf admitting it was bad and wanted to make amends. Dark of the Moon is an obvious improvement on Revenge of the Fallen, but lacks the claim of the first film.Starting with a montage of how the Space Race to the Moon between America and the Soviet Union was to get an alien spacecraft that crashed on the dark side of the Moon. Soon we discover that the Soviet tried to use Cyberonian technology that resulted into the Chernobyl meltdown. Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the Autobots bring back Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) and revive him. But more important Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) has a new British girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whitely) and is looking for a job, which he gets with a aerospace company lead by John Malkovich. On the Deceptions front they are killing humans that worked for them and trying to revive all of the Autobots Pillars to make a sky bridge and turn Earth into a new Cybertron: sounding very much like a plot from a two part episode of Doctor Who.One of the first big improvements is the removable of the Twins, the two annoying, racial stereotypes who should have been given a unpleasant death. During Revenge of the Fallen I was pretty much cheering for the Deceptions to win, showing how much Bay failed with this 'lovely comic relief' characters! Megan Fox is also gone because we all know of the aftermath of calling Bay, Hitler. Huntington-Whitely replaces her and Bay showing that Transformers does not need actors. Huntington-Whitely's performance has been criticised but I personally thought she was passable. She is better then Fox who is a really bad actress and her character is more charming and likable, but at the same time not going to win over feminists because Bay leers over Huntington-Whitely's body and she is just a damsel in distress. The comedy is toned down and the plot is a little more focused. The other new feature is 3D, Bay being won over to shoot the film with the technology. It has been called the best 3D since Avatar, Avatar still has the best 3D in a film so far. There were times in the film when it was not in 3D and the affect was pointless: it only really worked during the slow-mo scenes.The action is really strong, shaky cam is not used as much and there are excellent set pieces, particularly with Optimus Prime using a sword and an axe. We do get robot on robot action and Bay's love for military porn. But like the previous films Bay focuses on the humans, the characters people do not care about. Optimus gets more screen time and you got to love it when he kicks butt. But the film suffers when he is not around and like during the Battle of Chicago he does not have that big a role and Bay focuses on the soldiers and even when Optimus is in the middle of a big fight Bay makes as watch LaBeouf in a fist fight. Like the previous two films the special effects are excellent and Steve Jablonsky does give a great score, obviously influenced by Inception.Bay also still sees the need to have bad comedy, whether it is in the form of annoying and pointless characters like Wheelie and Brains, or Ken Jeung role as a guy who worked with the Deceptions and ends up being made out to be a strange weirdo, ending up with a gay joke, oh high class wit. I would have made Transformers to be a little more light-hearted and tongue in cheek, but still pretty serious, Spider-man and Iron Man would have been great models to follow. Dark of the Moon is too long and should have been a fun two hour film, it focuses on a human characters too much, including a boring and unfunny montage of Sam going to job interviews. Many scenes could have been cut out. I also have a problem with the swearing because a lot of families went to see it and the film did use strong language. Compare it to other PG-13/12A releases like the new Batmans, the X-Men series, the new Bonds, etc, swearing is toned down and kept to a minimum.Frances McDormand was a fine addition as the Director of NEST and John Turturro is a lot less annoying as Agent Simmons, given a more serious role. But the role of Shockwave was marketed as if he was going to be the main bad guy, but Dark of the Moon suffers the 'Angel' like X-Men: the Last Stand did, making a character has a bigger role then they really did.To me Dark of the Moon felt like a end of a trilogy and I would not be surprised if the series has a mini-reboot. If it does I hope the filmmakers make the Autobots the main characters and the humans as support, not the other way round. If Dark of the Moon was the sequel after the first film I properly be a lot more positive towards it. The action is fun, it is escapism, but there are too many problems.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I liked this one too but the storyline was just all over the place. The movie seemed all rushed and same stuff over and over again. In fact at some scenes it looked like the movie ""SKYLINE"".So let's start, in the second movie Sam Witwicky was tired of all this chaos and wanted a normal teenage life, and in this one his character was just looking for trouble (MAKES NO SENSE). Now let's start with not including Megan Fox: Michael Bay really dropped a ball for not including her in this one, yes we all know she's very pissy and has a nasty attitude, but dammit she was perfect for these series. For God sakes settle your differences and REPRISE her character back if there will be a next one. This newbie was horrible and they both look horrible together, they had no chemistry nor any past like Sam and Mikaela did.Leo Spitz was such a lovable character in the second one, why the hell wasn't he in this one? He had and awesome comedy timing with agent Simmons. Also sam's parents role was so short. There's a reason why reviewers are saying this movie was ""missing the heart and soul"".Transformers is loosing it's originality, same stuff over and over again ""end of the world"" blah blah. I really thought this movie was gonna be about Deceptions planning to destroy our Moon which would eventually destroy our world, and humans and Autobots would try everything to save it, that storyline would've been interesting to watch but the title ""Dark of the Moon"" made no damn sense? Common Michael Bay give us something new and interesting to watch! Yes we know machines can transform, yes we know there are two sides, yes we know other side wants to destroy the world, yes they have failed in 2 movies already, was another 3rd movie necessary on the same subject? Graphics as usual was great which is y I am giving the rating 6 out of 10. Some new characters were great like John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk, and Ken Jeong. But you have to to realize if Shia LaBeouf is heart of this series, Megan Fox was the Soul. Therefore this movie was just half as good as the others!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I say, let's impeach Bay and cut of his loins for ruining already ruined trilogy.Now! This is a final, ultimate battle of giant robots and humans. And we get to see an infinitive abundance of special effects and unnecessary explosions, but Bay, being a master of explosions, how dare me to keep Bay away from his explosions?! Shia LaBeouf entered in a high irritating mode, Josh Duhamel was there... well, he was there, with no exceptions, John Turturro was there, again for a comic relief, John is a great actor, but he did this for the money. Tyrese Gibson... again... he was there with a dry humor as most of his military crew. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley... a replacement for Megan Fox. I didn't actually care for Mikaela, but without her, a half of audience losses an impression from the previous films, so Bay had to pull out another talentless beauty, by the looks of things... Rosie, a well known model, no talent for acting at all, her lips were freaking terrible! Her lines were... well everybody's lines were horrifying! Her shoes did a lot better performance than her. Patrick Dempsey, what a hell is he doing here? Except playing a traitor of human race, that was disgusting. A bad villain. With no charisma... no charm. Nothing! Terrible character. Frances McDormand and John Malkovich, two greatest actors on the cast list did this for money also. And they were both there for some dry humor! Julie White and Kevin Dunn were again there as Sam's parents... well actually I am a cartoon G1 fan and I call him Spike, not Sam, and Spike... didn't have a mother! Alan Tudyk, a former Firefly co-star, he was good. Ken Jeong? The most irritating guy ever in the film. Only because the fame of ""Hangover"", Bay was like ""Let's take this dude, the ratings will be higher"" No! It's just making things worse! The worst character ever! Buzz Aldrin? What a hell?! OK, now for the robots, I have never understood the idea and concept when it comes to the design of robots in this film. But, that's passable, I'll leave that alone. But, when it comes to the personality, robots didn't have it. They were totally without any personality or soul.

I just don't quite get that why Sam and his girl friend and some GI have to be caught in every crossfire and witness every destruction of the key Decepticon players. And this far-fetched human intervention is poorly mixed with the main line of the story, like some of side stories. Why they cast the fine actor Malkovich for such a nonsense negligible role? What is it about Sam's parents and job interviews and things? These made the movie into a two and a half hours Spagetti.I am glad that Prime finally finished off Megatron in this Michael Bay's version of Transformers, so that Bay can't make any more Sequel and stop destroying my appetite for more.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

If high school teenagers like this movie, they are doomed to be shallow adults in the future. What's the purpose of producing this stupid computerized CGI craps one after another? This transformer crap should be ended after the first one, because there's no more story that could be more interesting than the first one, all the series or sequels are just trying to fool the general movie goers to spend mindless money to keep watching it. Now, it's 3D, but does it make any big difference? Boring characters, boring designs of the transformers, boring scenario, plots (is there any?), endless explosions, endless catastrophic machines fighting machines, machines fighting human beings, stupid dialog, stupid parents, stupid companies, stupid NASA, stupid military operations, transformers of cars, flying robots, evil against good....blah, blah, blah, and blah. I've never seen so many stupid junk jammed into a stupid movie like this series. And this time, replaced one more stupid Victoria (underwears) girl who absolutely got no acting talent at all to play the girl friend of that young actor who has so pathetically kept signing up for this stupid franchise.My younger son forced me to accompany him to watch this movie, but after 20 minutes torture, I just couldn't stand it and told my son I decided to wait outside. Yes, that's how bad it is. This stupid movie is for kids under 12, but the violence is definitely not for that age limit. Somebody has to bash me with a baseball bat turning me into a vegetable first, then I might be able to sit through out this movie.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sure, she won't be troubling the Academy next year, but this is a Blockbuster action flick, not Richard III.But my problem with this film is that it's SO DULL! Non stop action isn't exciting for long - it gets tedious quickly.

Instead Mr.Bay casually cut-copy-paste the scenes from different hits around without putting much thought about the story line.In order to make my point i will enumerate my findings :1.Since the movie had a huge budget and due to Mr.Spielberg, Bay did managed to produce spectacular affects but all in vain. The movie has parts borrowed from a different movies like the infantry action on the ground reminds one of Battle : LA, the snake-like twisted metal thing borrowed from some Asian movie with similar monster etc.2. In the first half the director Bay did tried to evoke a comic feel but then again he just pasted it w/o using any sense. The corny dialogue between Shia and his mother when he was having troubles in relationship makes you sick because of the way it was filmed and inappropriate timing.It's like how Hellboy with its serious tone was a bit manageable but Hellboy 2 was a pain.3. The fight between the Autobots and Decepticons is so much overdone that it becomes mundane and you actually loose track of who is attacking whom and why should i care. While initially the autobots can't fight the decepticons and struggle but at the fag end they can rip a hole in the decepticons by just punching.4.The pet robots of Shia try desperately to put on a comic relief but oh! the humanity.5. Shia as Sam ""The Wise"" is obviously invincible and is able to fight the menacing robots while holding her girlfriend's hand all the time. He can swing around like Tarzan and still not break a sweat, while the elite military unit is running haywire(Proves how much talented he is, all the while he can't get a job for himself)6.The plot of the movie COULD have been awesome but i can't understand why Mr.Spileberg didn't watched the movie and let it be released.7. The stupid acting of Shia was topped by Rosie in nearly all aspects. (Makes you wish that if Megan Fox had kept her mouth shut it would have been better)8. Lastly I am really disappointed by the treatment handed out to such a series and won't be watching another sequel if Mr.Bay is even present on the set, forget about his involvement in the movie.Peace to all!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm not going to waste my time describing the ""story"" as it's clear the screenwriters didn't spend more than a minute trying to put something together. The only thing I'll say about the story is that they try to connect our robots to the moon landing in 1969 and claim that Apollo 11 had several secrets. If that sounds interesting to you then it's best just to watch the teaser trailer and leave the rest of the film alone. This introduction only lasts around seven-minutes and then it's back to the brain dead, idiotic, loud and incoherent mess of a movie. It's really shocking that no one has ever tried to come up with a story that you could follow but I guess to Bay as long as you have loud action scenes then nothing really has to make sense. Taking a look at the box office numbers it's clear not too many people object to the horrid mess that this film is. I'm not sure where to even begin but once again I just don't understand the need for a ""B"" entertainment film to clock in at nearly three hours. It's 154-minutes to be exact but even this is an hour too long. The first thirty-minutes are pure boredom, the next hour has one long, drawn-out dialogue sequence after another and the final thirty-minutes gets to all the action as Chicago is destroyed but by this time I was wishing a real alien invasion would happen and put me out of my misery. This movie is without question one of the worst big-budget movies ever made. The story makes no sense. The comedy is so bad that you can't help but wonder what anyone was thinking. Just take a look at the job interview sequences. Then you have the incredibly stupid parents who are back with even more failed attempts at humor. The performances really aren't any better with Shia LaBeouf really sleepwalking through his part. It's hard to believe that he could have been any more boring as the performance is just downright annoying as is the character. Rose Huntington-Whiteley plays the girlfriend and her performance actually makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep. The supporting cast includes John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro and Tyrese Gibson but they too sink in this horrible material. TRANSFORMES: DARK OF THE MOON is just downright bad on all levels. The one saving grace are the wonderful special effects but these aren't enough to save the film.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's nothing new, but why fix it if it ain't broke?Shia LaBeouf reprises his role as Sam Witwicky, who, when we last saw him, was helping the Autobots – the good guys – fight the Decepticons – the bad guys – and keep hidden secret images imprinted away only in his mind, that could destroy the world, if they fall into the wrong hands.This time around, he's rooming in D.C. with Carly (the excellent Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), as he desperately seeks a job doing something more than sort mail. While the skeleton of the story's different, the action is much the same. Trade Megan Fox for first-timer Huntington-Whiteley (who was better than Fox ever was at playing a not just a pretty face), and viewers still have a hot piece to look at, although it should be said, in the end, Huntington-Whiteley's character Carly has a very important role in helping save humanity.Bay and filmmakers take viewers on a journey back in time to see man's first step on the moon, and we learn that it wasn't only a mission of exploration, but that we were there to cover up the crash-landing site of an Autobot named Sentinel Prime.Flash-forward 50ish years to present day, and humans are allies with the Autobots as they help us fight many of the world's wars. This allegiance comes to a screeching halt when Sentinel Prime, ""the Einstein of the Autobot world,"" is brought to Earth. For decades, he's been protecting pillars that, if joined together, would create a teleportation machine. Needless to say, if the pillars end up in the wrong hands, who knows what might be brought to Earth.And that's just what happens, and war is waged once again between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and it comes down to Sam and the rest of humanity to help the good guys fight the bad guys.Even though this is the same old story within the same old format, it's not bad. Bay sticks to his recipe of a good – not great – summer action flick, packed with great young actors in LaBeouf and Huntington-Whiteley, and perhaps an even better supporting cast in Frances McDormand as the head of the human team, John Malcovich, as Sam's pain-in-the-ass boss, and Patrick Dempsey as an evil villain; and returning favorites including John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

Did the director or the writer get a blow in the head or something since the last movie? Transformers 3 is horrible. It was hard to follow, Rosie was modeling another new dress or new lingerie on the screen, her acting was not entirely bad however she did not appeal to me as a nice character. Megan Fox did so, and I was actually complaining about her acting before. Not any more. There is now a new level zero for acting. Also, the language was so foul and I am not a puritan, but I don't think I have heard so much cussing before in just one movie. They did not cuss much at all in the previous movies. This was a cussing extravaganza. I consider it of VERY bad taste in that respect. And all that paired with hard to follow action and dialog, spiced with many cuss words to maybe hide the lack of substance and deliver a shock in a different way? Get it together folks.

The guys pulled off a carpet, had me get down on my knees, and scrape all the green glue beads off. THE ENTIRE 1ST FLOOR. As my dad put it, ""Its hard, you're gonna be tired, and you're gonna sweat like hell."" Comforting. Although I think watching this movie was the more exhausting experience.Transformers 3-D (or ""Transformers 3: The Dark of the Moon"" if you want to use it's full obnoxious title) is a special effects reel. There is a plot, a plot that started with promise, the space race of the 70's was to investigate an alien spacecraft? Sure. It could be a pretty good time. But, what lead me to believe that I was in for a movie with an intriguing plot, I do not know. It is an excuse for us to see robots beat the crap out of other robots.I'm having a hard time figuring a standard to hold this to. Is it a sci-fi? A war movie? Or just an eye melting sequence of special effects? I don't know because the tone waves around so much it's hard to tell. The movie has dramatic elements too. Moments where sad music plays, and people look sad, mainly Shia Labdwqiufcgydil, who looks like he's trying to have a good time while acting in this heap, and the audience is supposed to feel sad, but in reality, I just felt awkward.Megan fox is gone, because... I couldn't even tell you why. Some people say she quit because Shia Labouiyfouysdfgbliu claims he ""shagged"" her. Some say she got fired because she made some statement about Hitler (?????????????) But I think her terrible acting is enough to justify it. She has been replaced with a Victoria's Secret model who's never acted before. Because that is so much better. But to be fair, she was far better than Megan. But the new girl added nothing to the movie except something pretty to look at. The effects are nice. But the main problem is the length. This is a 160 minute movie. 2 HOURS AND 40 MINUTES LONG. That is quite absurd for a movie about giant robots beating the crap out of each other. The first half was kind of cool, but self indulgent, and you could cut most of it out. I could understand 2 hours. Maybe 2 hours and 10 minutes. But stretching it out for this long in such a show-offish, over-the-top manner is too unnecessary. The final act of the movie would be great if they had given me a little time to breathe between action scenes and catch up with the characters, similar to the way Die Hard let me breath between explosions. Die hard worked because it was suspenseful. Because you cared about John Mclain, and wanted to see him succeed. I don't care about any of the nameless autobots, or whether they succeed (although comparing Transformers 3 to die hard isn't fair, I'll admit that) . The physics are off too. If you crash through 10 sheets of glass, you die. At the very least, you get cut a lot. And if an explosion is detonated 5 feet away from you, you die. You don't just stand there like it didn't happen. In the words of Will Ferrel: ""How do you walk away from an explosion without flinching like that? There's no way! The movie system is completely irresponsible for the way they portray explosions!"" The humor is better here. It doesn't make me ROFLMFAO (I hate it when people use that expression), but I confess I chucked a few times. When it comes to comedy, Michael Bay is no Ivan Reitman, he is more Tyler Perry. The racial stereotypes are downplayed, but still there. There is more emphasis based on comedic dialogue, which he also doesn't know how to write. The worst part was the mom giving her son a self help book about woman and like, breaks the flow. I was supposed to laugh, but I was saying to myself: NOT THE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!The story has tremendous holes in it's plot. THE DECEPTICONS ARE JETS! WHY DO THEY NEED A STARGATE TO TRANSPORT THEMSELVES TO EARTH! JUST FLY THERE! And why did the Autobots lead the Decepticons to Chicago to fight them? And why did the U.S. wait so long to tell the Autobots about the ship on the moon? Why not just tell them immediately? And the Decepticons' war is with the Autobots, why are they attacking humans?(this hole was brought up, but not answered.) And the guy in sector seven new about this. I think this ship on the moon would have trumped the whole ""probe on mars"" story. But I don't know if they even gave answers to this stuff because the plot was so uninteresting it lost me a lot.Complaining about plot holes in transformers is pointless. This is about effects. Not more. The problem is, I grew out of effects. The first time I saw transformers when I was like 9, I could look over the story and characters because of how great and unique the effects were, but I see this kind of thing every summer. There is nothing unique, special, or memorable about this. I just felt like it wasted my time, like I payed $11 to stare at a wall. What I would like to see, is that battle of Cybertron that we hear about in every opening monologue, make that into a movie. But as for now, this is just another routine, boring popcorn movie. This is one of the hardest movies I have had to sit through, and that is that.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

So the film goes on maybe for a bit too long, it is still very enjoyable. I have watched the other two transformers and they were both very different from this one, in a good sense. I would highly recommend this film for children as i'm sure they will enjoy it. The only downsides in my point of view are, i much preferred Megan Fox in these films, the new girl (sorry i don't know her name) just doesn't suit the job for me. Also as i said before it does go on for a while, i do hope there is another Transformer film as i do enjoy watching them, so overall, a film worth watching","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But it is sad that there was not that big a build up in terms of rivalry between the Decepticons and Autobots. Important characters like Bumblebee and (even) Optimus seem to get very little screen time.Genre: It is a pure action film; and nearly two and half hours of it! Gets exasperating after a while; but a bunch of good looking Ferrari's and McLaren's save the day. The story definitely has loopholes – I didn't think for a minute it wouldn't; so no big surprises there.Special effects (which is the reason why people go to a Michael Bay movie): 3D visuals was good awesome, I've got to admit it. The initial sequences of ""clip pasting"" from the past did not seem so realistic. In fact those first few screens seemed way too fast; as if the movie couldn't wait to get to the action mode.Casting and performance: Somehow I NEVER really liked the mom-dad characters of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf); can do without them really. The new girl (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is good looking, but doesn't really seem to perform that well esp. in the intense action sequences. LaBeouf does a good job – fighting (whenever armed) and screaming (when disarmed). He seems to have gotten used to his character! Overall, the casting of the movie was not that great and the characters never really seemed to connect emotionally. I felt it could have been better.Read the full review at http://blog.nrajesh.com/review-transformers-3","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had given up on 3D after foolishly seeing Piranha 3D. Thus, I paid the extra $3.50 for the privilege and was enormously disappointed. I had expected to be drawn into all the action and be amazed at the 3D effects...but there weren't any. The movie was strangely flat. What was Michael Bay bragging about???I have, in the past, seen lots of 3D movies...especially the ones made in the 1950's. The smart directors, like Alfred Hitchcock did in ""Dial M for Murder"", use the process to enhance the movie experience. With a picture like Transformers 3, (since this movie was not a work of art), the need was there to have things pop out of the screen. After all, it is a pure popcorn picture with explosions, action, and chase scenes).If you want to see this movie (I thought it was too long and too silly) save your money and see it flat.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Does he write his screenplay on the set? With the set pieces and the thought process that has to go into the action sequences (which covers most of the movie) seems impossible for that.. Is he that genius where he shoots what he feels like and covers it up with VFX later? Does Chuck Norris writer cringe hearing this movies dialogues? What is the gorgeous girl doing outside of a calendar or a ramp? Watching the graphics expertise makes me feel like a crazy amount of money, talent, time and effort is being drained down in the wrong hole. The VFX work is sophisticated, complex and involves heavy planning, thinking and execution effort and in my opinion Michael Bay would go a long way and win many hearts if he can try just being a visual effects supervisor. Really the work here is much better than Avatar or Avengers.Synopsis: Fox is replaced by another hottie. Characters from the previous editions reprise same roles and dialogues. Nobody know what Decepticons are fighting for and Autobots are like overstayed guests.With a long list of mechanical characters, Bay tried to bring in the entire Hollywood to elevate the missing aesthetic value like Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, John Turturo etc. Instead of utilizing their special talents to arrive at a fresh flavor, all these talented actors succumb to buffoonery along with the rest of the cast. The robots behave more human than the actual actors themselves which is another thing that makes me cringe. There is actually a weird scene where a division captain instructs his team to hold fire until he commands, while actually all of them are shooting.If not for the visual effects grandeur, its rating would have been on the negative.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The ancient Greeks said that for a story to satisfy the spectator, it needs to have a start, a middle and an ending.This one starts with endless scenes of Shia LaBeouf's new love life, ends with a cheap message from Optimus which makes us wonder what was there any different from TF1 and TF2, and the middle is a clusterfck of useless characters, pointless drama/jokes scenes and slow motions which show us nothing we haven't seen before. TEN MINUTES, you will watch one of the Decepticons take down a building. TEN MINUTES.I'm sorry, is this the WTC September 11 reenactment of American valour and heroism, or a TRANSFORMERS MOVIE.

You go merely to see gratuitous explosions, an attractive love interest that's as hot as butter, and this time around, it's in 3D! I'm all up for leaving my brain at the door, but when you ask me to do that for nearly 3 hours, where I'm bored the hell out of my mind for 2/3 of that, you can count me out. The problem with ""Dark of the Moon"" isn't because of the story or acting (we expected that since day one), it's because it takes a millennium to get going, the action scenes are way too repetitive, and the resolution always leaves something to be desired. I sound like a bitter old man but in actuality, I'm in the demographic for this film. When Michael Bay puts some originality into his set pieces, takes out the convoluted and tiresome story arcs, and trims about an hour off of his movies, then he can give me a call.See, that's also the problem. For these movies, the plot is always so long and details, but it goes nowhere and doesn't make any sense. It's a movie about robot vs. robot, can't we just leave it that way? We don't need a long, unnecessary explanation that serves as filler. That's why the whole first two acts suffered. Nothing interesting, nothing worth my time. It's just filler. And by the time the action rolled around, I just didn't care. It's almost as if Bay copied and pasted the action from his last film into this one. As for the 3D? While I disliked the movie, I cannot deny it, it was worth it. The depth is just outstanding and the explosions have layers. It wasn't at Avatar's 3D brilliance, but oh boy, was it close enough. And the special effects? The robots look the best this time around and it shows Bay knows what he's doing. Too bad the action is repetitive and the film is a total bore.While I've had my rant, I have to say, this wasn't the worst ""Transformers"" and was actually an improvement over part two. Less corny jokes (thank god!) and this time, we can actually SEE what's going on! All in all, I didn't hate ""Dark of the Moon"". It could've been worse, but it could've been so much better. The day Bay makes a solid popcorn flick, I'll give his film a good review. Yes, your film doesn't always need to rely on story and development, but when you make trash, at least put some effort and excitement into it. When you have over-inflated trash, I don't care if I see it in 20D, it's just trash.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But if the producers have $195 million Dollars to burn, literally, then at a time like this, it is evident that people with money are not prudent enough to avert another financial melt down. Sure, this movie will surpass its budget from just the opening box-office revenue. My big question is whether this Film has enough acclaim to propel the franchise forward? With due respect to the producers, director, actors, and fans of the series, I seriously doubt there will be a fourth compartment to this franchise. If ever there is one, it would be as lucrative as whipping a dead horse. Don't get me wrong. Michael Bay is a fine director with some excellent films in repute. Although Bay has produced (some with Jerry Bruckheimer) over 20 mega titles, as a director, he will always be remembered for ""Bad Boys"", ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"". Even so, Bay has never been considered for an Academy Award nomination. On the contrary, he has earned Razzie Awards for Worst Director for ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"". Although personally, I enjoyed both those movies. But if I were to guess, as a kid he must have been obsessed with firecrackers. This third outing has the Michael Bay signature scribbled all over it. Explosions, special effects, explosions, CGI, the other side of the moon, an underwear model that replaces another model who refused to show off her underwear, and some more explosions. Yes, the script tries to be better than the second installment titled ""Revenge of the Fallen"", and tries really hard to give depth to the characters. The tactic used this time is developing deeper emotions in the human characters while rendering a darker plot. There are some other bits and pieces which I will get to later, but that's about it. Did I mention there are explosions in this film? If you have missed the first two titles, no big deal. There is no plot continuation whatsoever so there is no need to watch the previous two titles. Actually, I would recommend not watching the second installment. The first and biggest plot hole sees Sam Witwicky as a college graduate, but without a job. Apparently, after helping the Autobots save the world twice, and receiving the congressional Medal of Honor from President Barak Obama, Sam is still not worthy of a job. Go figure. Meanwhile, the Autobots continue to work with the US government in tracking down Decepticon stragglers until an alien fuel cell is found at an abandoned radioactive site in Chernobyl. On investigation, the fuel cell emerges as a classified object retrieved during the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969. Arriving on the Moon in search of the Fuel Cell's source, Optimus Prime finds a downed spacecraft that was also classified by the US government. Inside, lies a dying former leader of the Auotbots, Sentinel Prime, and beside him, five strange pillars. What follows is over two hours of special effects that will engage your optic and acoustic nerves to the max. Then again, what more can you expect when the main producer is Steven Spielberg himself.You have action, you have fast paced action and you have mindless action. Guess which category this film falls into? At times, even the last category goes over the top. As I mentioned before, the film attempts at showing its never-before-seen sensitive side. But seriously, who are you kidding? This film and its predecessors were always meant to be a testosterone fuelled adventure. The acting is horrible and in now way conveys what the half-baked script tries too. I was under the impression that Shia LaBeouf is an up and coming actor. Sadly, this has to be his worst movie as an actor or his best movie as a bad actor. Introducing Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in her first ever acting role (let alone first ever major film production) may be controversial in itself for replacing Megan Fox, but she is proof that you can never expect serious acting from cat-walk sirens. Is she better than Megan Fox? Stunningly better looks, extremely two dimensional acting. While Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do not add anything fresh in their third appearance, adding John Malkovich and Kevin Dunn along with John Turturro does slow down the pace to some well received lighter moments. There are also well placed cameos from Francis McDormand, Patrick Dempsey and Buzz Aldrin. I thought this was a clever venture to have Aldrin pegged to the film's version of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Blending a Film's fictitious plot with historical events is always considered a scriptwriter's gift for thinking outside the box. However, the rest of Ehren Kruger's screenplay takes a massive beating with more holes in the plot than craters on the moon. Pun unintended.This third installment will entertain you if you have nothing else to watch. Teenagers may lap up all two and a half hours of it, but will forget about it even as the end credits roll up. If Michael Bay AND Shia LaBeouf can salvage some critical acclaim after the box-office buzz settles, it would be an ideal time to quit.

The action sequences were always going to be good but the issues with plot that plagued Revenge of the Fallen have not improved on Dark of the Moon.Without giving away spoilers for those who haven't seen it, i found myself constantly asking open questions-lots of why's, how's, what's when's and who's. It almost appears as though the film at its running time has been over edited(yeah you heard me) or maybe the wrong parts of it have been edited. Side stories that have no purpose being in the plot as well as characters you wish were annihilated by a stray decepticon rocket are given screen time. The rampant product placement, the idiotic childish attempts at humor, obvious plot twists and some of the unnecessary action sequences all designed to make you forget the plot holes big enough to swallow Cybertron. This film just need a simple enough plot to tie together the gaps between the action sequences and maybe 45-50 minutes shaved off the periods of dialogue that were simply not needed. Honestly you will find better story lines in the cartoons from the 80's.I would only recommend this movie for people who honestly don't care about the story and are happy to spend their money seeing explosions. You will enjoy the visual spectacle even if you don't understand. However if you are the type of movie fan that needs a story that makes sense as well as action sequences than spend your cash on Captain America or Green Lantern.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"","","The dialogue, acting and writing are all appalling, but, hey, aren't the special effects great?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2465336/?ref_=tt_urv","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0345596/?ref_=tt_urv","27 July 2011","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Transformers: Dark of the Moon manages the seemingly impossible task of being a film nearly three hours long that manages to move along with a plot so apathetic and piecemeal for that long, without giving the slightest suggestion that it does anything close to engaging you or holding your attention until all the big action starts and everything starts blowing up at the end. Like being told of The Promised Land and having faith until the big pay off comes, it has what can barely described as a 'story' (especially by someone not bowled over by the first two films) that after a hard day I have neither the time nor the inclination to describe.""In the beginning, we were a peaceful race of mechanical beings..."" From the off set, the serious attempts at dialogue serve as an indication of the unintentional laughs that are to follow, which are some of the few high points of forcing yourself to slog through this unthinkable third part of the soulless modern day Transformers franchise (but as long as they're making money, right?) Once again the script writers manage to get it all wrong, delivering characters that never come off as real people and dialogue and situations that sound even faker and less likely to happen. I said in my recent Wall Street 2 review that it would be better if Shia LeBeouf was in another Transformers film, well here he is, as bland and lifeless as the last two times, just one of quite a few actors failing to deliver rubies when handed pearls. Respectable, established actors like John Malkovich and Frances McDormand pop up in secondary roles, obviously trying to keep their dignity and not get dragged down with everything else but both really should have known better.In all honesty, I have no right to complain about any of this, as I expected no less, but I had expected good stuff from what the film had been sold on, the special effects and in particular, what some had described as 'the greatest action sequences ever recorded to film' at the end, but even these I found to be under-whelming. Maybe I'd had enough of the relentless onslaught of mediocrity before it, or maybe there's nothing that can impress me any more, but it was the final part of what, like the last two films, had been a complete waste of my time. **","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It contained some of the most outstanding and 'cool' original action scenes I had seen in a movie since the Matrix. It wasn't perfect, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is firmly part of my blu-ray collection.The second installment was a mess and should have hinted at what the third would bring, but hope of a return to the near perfect pacing of the original was anticipated.So in a short and sweet manner, with no spoilers. Here's my account of TF3:Story - it was there, but nothing is explained well. Pacing is horribly off and I could have watched in silence and still have known what I know watching with sound. Too many loop holes and pointless 'essential' characters.Characters - Humans in this movie are pointless and pretty much ruin it in my opinion. Bot's wise - not enough development for non TF fans to care a note about who and why they are. New love interest, while being hot, is just plain annoying and unneeded. And What the hell are the parents doing?Special effects - Boring, over long action scenes (that don't contain bot fight as I enjoy them). Regardless of the quality of the work done, it doesn't change the fact that watching half of the stuff happen on screen is just plain ball-crap.One thing to note; I don't agree with a lot of people when they say they can't tell who's fighting who as I've always been able to distinguish grey from a colour of an Autobot - really has never been an issue for me.Overall it was over long, boring, unfunny, confusingly paced, full of unneeded scenes, full of unneeded characters, unwatchable for a second time.4/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The first one was, and even though the second one went overboard with the toilet humor, it still had its moments. To this threequel's credit, the story is better and more disciplined, though. The first 20 minutes set up an intriguing premise about the ""real"" reason for the moon landings. Yet it never really follows through with it. After that pre-title sequence it's back to the usual with Sam and company as they try to stop the Decepticons' latest (and greatest?) scheme. For what it's worth, Michael Bay reined in some of his baser tendencies. Sam's parents get a whole lot less screen time, and he ditched the racist Autobots from the previous installment. Also, since he shot this in 3D this forced him to tidy up the camera-work and editing. The visual effects also top everything that came before it. There are some really jaw-dropping visuals that probably looked amazing on a cinema screen, and still looked pretty awesome on my HDTV. On the casting side, he got some more veteran actors to do glorified cameos and add legitimacy to an otherwise mostly talent-starved ensemble. However, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime was a stroke of genius (along with an obligatory Star Trek reference/quote). What didn't work in the film's favor was the tiresome and endless nature of the carnage and destruction. The last hour of the film is basically an extended action sequence, and it was a chore to sit through. The human drama is clichéd at best, insipidly stupid at worst. Michael Bay certainly doubled down on why the films have been so popular, but it seems like he forgot to make it a little more enjoyable. As a result, lengthy stretches of action were rendered boring and depressing. The score didn't help matters much either. Like the previous two, Michael Bay was content to use the kernel of a good idea and slather it with visual effects and mindless action. He knows his audience, to be sure, but his cynicism is on full display here. TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON corrects some of the more egregious missteps of its predecessor, but it unfortunately loses its soul in the process.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first Transformers and thought it was awesome to see those characters brought to the big screen, but the sequels just haven't managed to live up to expectations and my faith in the series is long lost. As Optimus Prime states, at least I haven't managed to lose my faith in myself. The special effects are extraordinary and we get plenty of action, but there is no character development whatsoever. The movie is exceedingly long (over two and a half hours) and not even with all that extra time do we get to see some character development. The final showdown is also extremely long, but I guess action fans won't be disappointed because they get a lot of excellent fights and cool visuals. As for me, I would have liked a better story with more character development. I could have also used a bit more comedy; the jokes just get old after three films and I would've really enjoyed something fresh and original in the series instead of relying on John Turturro all over again for the funniest moments. There are some new additions to the franchise, some interesting actors, but none of them are enough to save the franchise. Transformers is one of those movies that is extremely loud and makes a lot of noise, but really never ends up saying anything at all.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is back again to save the world for a third time from the Decepticons, although this time he has a new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). He meets her at the White House after receiving a medal of honor from president Obama. Sam is out of college, but is having trouble finding a job, although he is living with Carly who is doing well at her new job working as an assistant for a rich man named Dylan (Patrick Dempsey). On the meantime, the Autobots are helping humans maintain peace between them while the Decepticons remain silent. Lennox (Josh Duhamel), who works with the Autobots, receives a call from Ukraine saying that they have found some form of alien life at a former radiation plant. The Decepticons seem to be searching for something and the answers can be found in the past: they have to do with man's first arrival at the moon. A few select men at NASA have been hiding some key information about what really was hidden at the dark side of the moon: a Cybertronian spacecraft containing some dark secrets. Both Decepticons and Autobots begin a race to uncover this secret that could threaten life on Earth. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, and the rest of the Autobots are back along with some new ones, while Megatron leads the Decepticon's new army. There are some plot twists so I do not want to give too much of it away, but the main focus of the film is almost entirely on the action and the almost hour long destruction of Chicago.In this third film we discover that Optimus Prime isn't the last remaining Prime after all since Sentinel Prime has been unconscious in the dark side of the moon during all these years. When Optimus Prime finds him he revives him with the Matrix; but Sentinel isn't the only new character in this film, we also have Frances McDormand as Chief Mearing in charge of the NEST operation, the funny Ken Jeong as Jerry Wang, Sam's co-worker who might know what NASA was hiding doing the trip to the moon, there is also John Malkovich as Sam's new boss, and then there is Alan Tudyk as the Dutch who is Simmons's personal assistant. Even though we have all these new characters (remember I also mentioned Carly who replaced Megan Fox, and her boss Dylan) the film still seems more of the same and lacks freshness and originality. None of these characters were able to bring something new to the franchise because the script was mediocre and the film relied solely on the spectacular visuals and action scenes. Much of what Michael Bay puts on film is eye-candy, that is the reason he brought Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to replace Fox as she isn't much of an actress, but she is just as hot as Fox. I just wished Bay spent the same amount of time he does on the action scenes with the screenplay. The 3D visuals work really well in this film, especially with the action scenes and the destruction of Chicago, but the movie just felt way too long in my opinion. I'm also tired of the open ended finales which suggest there might be another sequel on the way, and wish they just brought closure to the Transformers franchisehttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This time around both the Autobots and the Decepticons are...well...oh who cares about the plot, it's really just an excuse to blow things up. And things do blow up, get smashed and otherwise destroyed in every way imaginable within a ridiculously long 154 minutes.While not the worst in the series, ""Dark of the Moon"" is miles away from the first film (which isn't saying much). Just like ""Revenge of the Fallen"" the film is crammed full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. New characters both human and robotic crowd the screen many spewing ""comic relief"" lines that detract from the story. Instead of Megan Fox they plucked Rosie Huntington-Whiteley out of Victoria Secrets to play Michael Bay's required T&A; the results are most unfortunate.Whether you're a huge unwavering fan of the ""Transformers"" movie franchise or a detractor their is one thing I'm sure we can all agree; this series has stagnated. How many times have we already seen Sam come a couple milliseconds from death, another evil metallic monolith trying to take over the world or Optimus Prime kicking the gears of yet another robotic bad guy. We've all seen it before and as a result this film is just a retread of the same old tired themes told in the exact same slapdash way.

This film is the third in the explosive franchise about robots, girls, and cars. After the critical failure of the second installment, Michael Bay vowed to make a much better film, and he did just that. Now, being better than the second film is like saying this rotten egg tastes much better than this dung pile. The movie was overall enjoyable, but was extremely long (2 hours 45 minutes). A lot of the movie could have been cut out, and a lot more action could have been put in. The first hour and forty minutes is filled with very stupid humor, and very unimportant things, like Sam Witwicky's job. In addition to all of this, a lot of random actors get thrown in for a dose of star power (I'm looking at you Ken Jeoung. ) If they had cut all of that out, and put a little more needed action into the film, it would have made the movie about two hours long, and much more manageable. Transformers was also lacking what it was supposed to excel in: action. There were only two memorable parts of the film, and they were about five minutes long each. If Michael Bay had added more action, it would have made the film much more balanced, and much more watchable.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It had a great conspiracy theory, stupendous robots, mind boggling action scenes, and a cast of characters who blended quite well - Dutch is my favorite new character. It was not warm and fuzzy like the first movie. There were scenes that had me holding my breath. I couldn't figure out how the Autobots were going to save the day after the humans turned their backs on them. The drama was intense. Tyrese's statement that the bad guys always have the best sh-- was just hilarious. If you are a true fan of the Transformers franchise and were fortunate to see the classic animated series, you will have the time of your life seeing them battling on the big screen.It is so much better than the second one.

And that's really all there is to the process. No sense in nit-picking apart this familiar heap, because even with something as drastic as the female lead of the movie undergoing not just a change in actress, but a change into an entirely new character, this is exactly the same deal as before. This is a tad bit better than the preceding installment in the series, because the action sequences are a bit more comprehensible than the putrid blur of overly polished CGI colliding with impossible to grasp chaos that was the spastic seizure of colors and lights called Revenge of the Fallen. But even with the slightly noticeable refining of the control and pacing in the special effect mayhem this time around to show that Bay is serious about his special effect action, it's still more than obvious that it's still the only aspect of his movies that he focuses on, and pours any effort into. And these action sequences are of course awesome if you just want straight up kick-ass action, as they're everything fans of blockbuster brutality will get their adrenaline fix over, but it's an incredibly tiresome and painful time getting to them with all the unnecessary filler scenes of immature comedy that drag on and on and serve no ultimate purpose. People argue that Transformers movies are good for good action and great special effects, but they seem to forget that this argument isn't valid if these dumb scenes are overlooked. Nothing has changed or at least improved in these movies by the now third installment, and it's getting incredibly predictable and annoying, and it's a bad sign when something gets more annoying with each installment, and goes on LONGER than before with each new installment. If Dark of the Moon is an indication of anything by this point in the series, then it's that no matter how many Transformers movies are made after this one, it's all downhill from here at this rate.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a convoluted mess that's caught in no man's land. It actually takes itself too seriously yet offers ridiculous action (ridiculous as in dumb, not as in wild or fun) and even more ridiculous characters. It wants to be taken seriously but functions in bizarre surroundings with a foolish plot. Movies like Thor and X-Men worked this year because they evolved characters, told a smart story and grounded the concept but still delivered the action. This movie tries to take a similar approach but it simply can't stand on its own as a film. Does silly, wild but dumb appeal to even the youngest crowds? Maybe it does but the rest of us want way more in our summer movies.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Ofcourse the original from 2007 is still terrific as well. But if you dont mind Mark Wahlberg replacing Shia LaBeouf then give the 4 & 5 editions a chance as well...Somehow I think the first 3 Transformer movies are (quite) a bit more silly and childish. Perhaps these first 3 movies are better suited for a younger audience, while (on the contrary) the last 2 editions are perhaps better suited for grownups because there is more serious and better acting.The bad; Shia LeBouf. I liked this actor in the original first movie, but in this sequel his acting isnt quite convincing me, but even annoying me sometimes. Thankfully we have some more established supporting actors like John Malkovich and Frances McDormand starring alongside, in order to raise the level of acting quality to a higher level.The good: it's entertainment and it's big!

The prologue like scenes in the beginning were pretty good and the base story which the initial scenes were telling were pretty good. It was almost as if it was a justification for the title. However when it is repeated so many times in the movie one sort of tends to zone out. The graphics was amazing and you can watch the movie just for that. But nothing more. In movies of this kind you almost know what is going to happen in the end though the way they finished it it left me thinking how many more transformer movies are gonna come. I would have said that the new characters did a pretty good job if there was any focus at all on the them. It was fast paced definitely but even for such a pace two and a half hours seemed excruciatingly long. There were definitely some scenes which could have been left off without any loss of continuity.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If your the type of person who likes a descent plot with good comedy and tons of action don't wait a second to see this movie in 3D. This movie has the best quality 3D special effects that I have ever seen in any 3D movie. If your jaw isn't dropping during these fight scenes then you don't know anything about action movies. Aside from the action the comedy presented in this movie is actually funny. In Transformers 2 I got the feeling that they were trying to hard to make you laugh and it came across as cheesy. In Transformers 3 the combination of great cameos and swearing brings back a fresh sense of ""make me laugh action movie"". Cons: Action drags a little in the end, but Id rather have that then wanting more. Pros: Good Plot, funny comedy (for an action movie), great cameos, action that will plow your socks off, has an ending (Super 8 what).In short if you thought Transformers 1 was great and thought Transformers 2 tried to hard. Don't wait a second to wash the bad taste of Transformers 2 out of your mouth. See this movie for a non stop 3D action thrill ride that might just make you laugh.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

No, this is no remake of ""The Wrath of Khan"". Nimoy voices the duplicitous ancient Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, in Director Michael Bay's visually spectacular ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". This is the first ""Transformers"" movie for me. I could not get through the first ""Transformers"" on DVD, and passed on ""Revenge of the Fallen"". Michael Bay gets the job done in ""Transformers 3""—impeccable action set at hyperkinetic pace. Bay bludgeons sensory overload as his narrative style—and it works for him. We hardly notice the 2 hours and 37 minutes. Neither do we notice the absence of Meg Fox, who lost her invite. Victoria Secret model stunning Rosie Huntington-Whiteley assumes her place as Shia LaBeouf's Sam's girlfriend. Huntington-Whiteley is hotter. We see her Carly introduced as she walks in wearing Sam's shirt and a thong. This punctuated my error in not going with the 3D option.Bay filmed ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" in digital 3D. No post-production afterthought. The movie looks awesome. The visuals are breathtaking. Bay creates a swirling visual mural as Decepticon drones and airships float above a devastated Chicago. In a very cool aerial sequence, Lt. Col. Lennox (solid Josh Duhamel) and his Special Forces Team dart through the Chicago skyline in their glider jumpsuits. The climactic battle between Optimus Prime (noble Peter Cullen) and his betrayed mentor is a live action samurai anime spectacle. As imposing gleaming gladiators, the Autobots and Decepticons move as graceful warriors. Bay brings back action old school. As a director he is the masterful technician—the human elements are not his strong suit. Then again human drama is not the deal with ""Transformers 3"".The story by Ehren Kruger is surprisingly engrossing, albeit flimsy. Like ""X-Men: First Class"" Kruger's tale is convincing revisionist conspiracy of the 1960's. Context: The Autobots and Decepticons are sentient robots, who are mortal enemies. Nearing Autobots demise at the hands of the Decepticons on home world Cybertron, Autobot leader Sentinel Prime (Nimoy) escapes in a ship called the Ark carrying the technology that could vanquish the Decepticons. With his mission thwarted, the Ark and Sentinel Prime crash on the Dark Side of the Moon. Detected in 1961, the Kennedy Administration declares the Space Race which was really a covert government operation to retrieve possible alien technology from the Moon. In 1969 the moon mission accomplished the intended goal. Now present day, Sec Def Mearing (callous and commanding Francis McDormand) is well aware of that NASA mission, and the presence of her peacekeeper Transformers under her watch. Turns out in this 50 year conspiracy, the Decepticons too have their human allies.Shia LaBeouf is convincingly frustrated and funny as Sam Witwicky, and rightly so. As Sam he had saved the world from the Decepticons, and received the Medal of Honor from President Obama, all on the down low. So this Ivy League graduate and Earth's savior struggles to find a job. In the meantime he is living with his super hot girl friend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley). Carly works for charming and arrogant accounting magnate Dylan (slickly menacing Patrick Dempsey), whose intentions are opaque. Sam manages to get a menial job at high tech government contractor working for eccentric John Malkovich as Bruce Brasos.While this transpires, Josh Duhamel's intense fearless Lennox leads his Special Forces team to investigate transient readings from Chernobyl in the Ukraine. This unveils the global Decepticon threat, and the reemergence of leader Megatron (reliably evil Hugo Weaving).So the narrative mechanics are poised to intersect, which is really Bay's excuse to blow crap up with amazing style. Bay brilliantly plays to his strong suit. In the midst of all the stunning visuals and breastbone vibrating explosions, the acting leads are solid. LaBeouf performs dependably as his subdued Sam transforms into the hero with vulnerability and a sense of humor. Too bad Duhamel isn't asked to do more. He is leading man handsome, charismatic, and brilliantly underplays the thoughtful hero. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is beautiful, which seems to be the leverage point of Carly. She does so with unaffected presence, and touch of humor. Dempsey plays in position. Tyrese Gibson, relegated to second string, is always cool. Gibson may be the smartest and luckiest actor in Hollywood next to Robert Downey Jr., being in two mega franchise movies—the other being ""Fast Five"".Bottom line: ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a great summer movie. You shall be entertained.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first movie was okay.. generic, but exciting. The second movie had bigger robots but this, just didn't even need to happen. I think if they had just done the first movie, Transformers would have a better reputation. The films just consist of fight scenes between the robots and people in random parts of the world, with some attempt of an actual plot -although it always just seems to be the same: robots taking over the world. And of course they have to give it an interesting title to make it appealing. ""The Dark of The Moon,"" in my opinion, just sounds like a rip off of one of Pink Floyd's greatest albums.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Too bad he doesn't find any. So he just decides to bust in on the incompetent military leaders and shows them how it's done. Wow. Exactly what you would expect to excite those teenagers - I mean apart from transforming cars, explosions and Megan Fox. Not that I wouldn't approve of all that. It's just that the whole impression is not convincing, the action scenes are rather boring and Megan behaves quite erratic.So instead of people spurting blood, deep insights by main characters and some nice bikini shots we just get two hours full of explosions where no one dies, people who don't have to make any decisions and a bitchy female lead who behaves like a 15-year old girl. Oh and did I mention the non-conclusive moral sermons? As if you could get a message to those youngsters among exploding cars and collapsing buildings...Also the cuts are rather crude, sometimes you feel like you have fast forwarded too much and then again they crammed so much dialog into one scene that you get confused.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It definitely blows the previous ""Transformers"" films he's done right into the stratosphere! With Shia LaBeouf back once more as protagonist Sam Witwicky, looks like his reputation as an A-list actor just got brighter (no way LaBeouf will work cheap so easily now) With Bay's constant signature explosions, continuous robot brawls, few comedic moments (most notably Ken Jeong delivering a few of his somewhat obvious, toned down ""Hangover"" shtick), and various acts of betrayal and cunningness, Bay has just made his formula go unstable (in a good way)! I needed some time to make sense of all that madness and this movie reduces ""Revenge of the Fallen"" to ashes.Megan Fox's replacement (newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) didn't quite fill in the void she left behind (because Fox was a little more active and a headstrong female figure than what Rosie could possibly pull), the script could have improved by a tiny percentile, and the acting needed several tweaks, but in the wake of every destruction on-screen, my adrenaline just kept growing higher. What caught my attention above all was seeing factual U.S. historical moments crossed over with the fictional storyline. It was amazing on how the filmmakers can make these intertwine. Hasn't changed one bit since ""Forrest Gump."" Thanks to minimal support of 3D from fellow director James Cameron, Cameron and Bay just made the film work out.

One minute there would be some type of awkward comedy going on and the next there would be a full on battle. It just didn't make any sense! All of the characters seemed extremely flat and the twists were predictable. Also, Sam's love interest, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Victoria's Secret model), while being attractive has very little acting skills and it was quite obvious during the movie.

Unfortunately the film cannot sustain this level for long and pretty soon we're back to the usual 'big robots hitting each other in the streets of America' scenario that (personally) I've seen enough of.On the plus side, there were some nice comic moments mainly provided by John Turturro and Alan Tudyk. I will also give a nod to the guys that did the CGI, it's all top-notch stuff and some of it is quite spectacular. On the downside I found many of the human characters irritating, in particular Sam Witwicky. He comes over as a bit of a petulant kid when he doesn't get the job he wants. Carly; well I guess she was just there to show off her curves, but as we all know, Michael Bay likes curves. I guess the whole franchise doesn't quite work for me because the filmmakers are so insistent on putting human traits on alien beings. Every robot, whether it be Autobot or Decepticon has to have a character and most of the time and in a lot of cases, it just makes them look stupid.

I actually like pop-corn action movies, though.Although John Malkovic and ""Dutch"" were good fun, the rest of the acting was bad enough to take away from enjoying the action, as action movie lovers like to do, especially the main actress.Secondly, the plot telling did not allow for a continuous feel of suspense to arise. This was partially due to important scenes being way too short, others were way too long.The action scenes were not as well spread over the film. There was one action scene in the first half, and the second half was one action scene. The second half dragged on too long because of this.As an action fan I have to say that the fights were ""cooler"" in the second Transformers. Better and more convincing fighting from the Autobots.I'm not a fan of 3D in the first place, by in my opinion, unless your in the center of the one row 3D is actually enjoyable from, I would don't recommend seeing this movie in 3D. There is so much action, that the low definition and blur of 3D really stones you by the end. It's too much.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Three films in and I'm still waiting.Number Three starts off well - the linking with real twentieth century history is a nice touch, but then the usual set of two dimensional 'heroes' take over and any promise turns to cliché.The humans are either macho soldiers who only live (and die) to serve the U.S. of A. The scientists are all only there for comic effect. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looks great, but does little to add to the story (plus has an interesting ability to simply stand still in the middle of a warzone in order to safely survive it). Shia LaBeouf does what he always does, i.e. kill more Decepticons that the entire Autobot army put together. Seriously, the guy is completely indestructible and has the superpower of being able to shout several miles across a trashed city to his friends. I don't know why he doesn't just take on the big bad robots all on his own and give Optimus and co a holiday.I reckon a cut should be made of this film where it completely takes out all human characters as the robots are far more interesting. Optimus and Sentinal Primes are the stars. Even the other robots are bland and you can't tell one from the other (apart from the two small really annoying ones who must come from the same planet as Jar Jar Binks).Enjoy the robots. Ignore the humans (and the plot and the over the top special effects and the numerous plot holes and the 2D acting and the clichéd characters and the fact that it's only designed to sell toys). I could go on. I hated every human moment of this film. I'd rather just watch Optimus Prime do some sort of monologue for two and a bit hours.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Perhaps Seeing It In 3D Helps.......?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2496590/?ref_=tt_urv","gradyharp","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3223254/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2011","Being curious about the current 'state of the arts in Hollywood' is possibly an acceptable reason for viewing this grueling 2 1/2 hour + mechanical mishmash, but after enduring the storyless CGI exercise in visual and auditory assault the viewer can only hope that in the theaters, with the added dimension of 3D to the soup, the film might have had some saving graces.Apparently the 'story' goes something like this (at least in a neutral writer's words): 'Autobots Bummblebee, Rachet, Ironhide and Sideswipe led by Optimus Prime, are back in action taking on the evil Decepticons, who are eager to avenge their recent defeat. The Autobots and Decepticons become involved in a perilous space race between the U.S. and Russia, to reach a hidden Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon and learn its secrets, and once again Sam Witwicky has to come to the aid of his robot friends. New villain, Shockwave, who rules Cybertron, is on the scene while the Autobots and Decepticons continue to battle it out on Earth.' In other words this is an action film where the main characters are expanding and imploding auto parts in some semblance of a battle for taking over the earth. What little dialogue there is was written by Ehren Kruger and the comic book cum video game cum 3D epic was 'directed' by Michael Bay.Given that the film did so well in the theaters (likely due to the novelty of 3D) it made a lot of money. The cast assembled is an admirable one: Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich (for his brief few seconds on screen), Ken Takemoto , and the voices of the mechanical dolls supplied by such actors as Hugo Weaving, Frank Welker, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Foxworth, James Remar, and Francesco Quinn. The problem is that there is so much destruction of the city of Chicago and the flying pieces of the fighting Autobots and Decepticons that finding a story and caring about the non-mechanical actors is tough. But then this is what the public is spending money to see so it is obvious why Hollywood is making movies like this. Could there possibly be another installment coming? Probably..... A must miss award to TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON. Grady Harp","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's all very samey and there are now so many characters involved that it must be hard work for the ""writers"" to fit them all in with a line or two. Annoyingly, there are even more comic characters in this one than the last, which I think detracts from the action too much, it doesn't blend with it as it has with other films like 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' or 'Kick Ass'.Deep Wang was ridiculous and totally unnecessary, the Jar Jar Binks when R2-D2 and C3-PO in the forms of Sam and Bumblebee or Simmons, were already providing the comic relief.I would also have been perfectly happy if they hadn't replaced Megan Fox at all, but to bring in Rosie Huntingdon Whiteley was a really bad idea as far as I'm concerned. She reminded me of the Decepticon made to look like a human girl from the second film (Rise Of The Fallen), plastic and unnatural. I was expecting her to grow a metal tail in an attempt to give Sam a lobotomy at any moment. She doesn't come across very well at all and may need to reconsider her acting career.I don't know if they're trying too hard or not trying at all with this one. It's a repetitive story that seems to be just an excuse to blow up more cities and things. The comedy is too much and the action too fast and furious to really gauge what's happening and to whom. I suppose as a mind numbing, nip to the loo or grab a beer without bothering to pause it type of film it works just fine and I've definitely seen worse, but I just feel a bit saddened that they haven't really thought about this film series properly, as they had a real opportunity to give us something amazing. They should have just kept it to the Witwicky's and the NEST agents.Also, why do the Autobots have Earth based accents?I've heard that the 4th and 5th instalments are awful, so I am bracing myself for those as I move forward, but come on guys, you've got gold to work with here. I don't expect miracles, but just slow down and release something good, not just something to keep the name in the cinema. You don't have to try to compete with Star Wars or Marvel.

This project has experienced a lot, making his way to the screens through a long and thorny path of very large troubles, at least remember the conflict Megan Fox and Mr. Beem, in which she left the project or the protests of one of the most commercially successful directors against converting the picture in 3D, which As already noticeable among U.S. television viewers have already begun to lose popularity. But the long and arduous wait viewers and fans of robots come true - now at last it was time to see one of the most ambitious projects of the year, if not - the most ambitious.After the critics pretty well received the first part of the franchise, and then smashed to pieces a sequel (which turned into a very rich harvest ""Razzie""), Michael Bay has promised that trikvel get better. And now, seeing the creation of new director ya3D can confidently say - Mr. Bay entirely kept his promise. The main advantage here is a very good and coherent script written by Ehren Kruger, this time alone - without colleagues to create the second part of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. Now the script, as compared with the second film, refined almost to the smallest detail, there are no inconsistencies and gaps. It becomes evident that received ""Golden Raspberry"" for the script to ""Revenge of the Fallen"" Ehren Kruger rehabilitated.As a result, the script came from a terrific story, perhaps the most dramatic and tense, compared with the previous parts. The third part of the history of robots almost completely riddled with treachery, which enhances the drama.On changes in the cast will not talk much - because of the well-known conflict with Megan Fox, director of the film took place girls photomodel Sam Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, igra3D which was the debut in the film. Of course, I, like many, leaving Megan caused disappointment, but began an acting career looked great fashion model. Only wish Miss Huntington-Whiteley successful career in kino3D.What about the other actors. The film played beautifully Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel and John Turturro, who played roles in the film with great enthusiasm. Also noteworthy is a good game and Patrick Dempsey, Kevin Dunne, who appeared in the film with a very respectable beard.Film3D also boasts stunning visual effects, excellent operator and a very high quality soundtrack. Feel free to say that the special effects in the third part of the most powerful and spectacular than the previous two films. Thanks to them, in great detail and look spectacular giant Decepticons (for example, Shokueyv) and the Autobots.By carrier-art Amir M. Wet is as good as the work of two previous statements in the ""Transformers"" - Mitchell Amundsen and Ben Seresinu. Some were even taken priemy3D powerful. A longtime composer Steve Jablonsky offered to the audience (not the first time), another stunning soundtrack. With music by the previous parts were quite a few in common, all the tracks are new and sounds great. In places the music is smooth and quiet, but mostly exciting and almost making their way to the bone.Also, the film contains a lot of humor, which is mainly small roll in the Autobots and quite a few characters. Quite comical watching some of the characters (Dutch, for example). Is enough funny scenes, it is worth recalling at least the scene in the bathroom with Sam and Jerry (Ken Jeong).""Transformers 3: The Dark Side of the Moon"" - an incredible and breathtaking spectacle, captivating fiction thriller with a very good drama as well as a humorous element. Very bright, dynamic action, which claims to be one of the most exciting blockbusters of the summer season.

Put into this film is amazing, every dent, scratch and the many explosions (as well as the transformers themselves) look fantastic.Its worth just seeing this movie for the awesome action scenes and out of this world graphics, but i have not talked about the acting yet.The hot chick was bland, annoying and a total buzz killer, she looked great while standing still but any time she moved or spoke i felt horrified, oh and did i mention Sams stupid parents are back and more Witwickish then ever? Onto the other characters, Sams bosses, fantastic, John Tuturro fantastic, the auto bots and deceptions, great.this movie only falls short on the acting department when it comes to Sams ridiculously hot girlfriend and some of the extras.Ah now the story you ask? Well this film has a story, shame its spread as thin as you can get without there being hardly any story at all.In short without spoilers, BIG EXPLOSION STUFF CRASH ON MOON! EARTH IN DANGER OH NO! Sure their are some twists but anyone who has seen the last 2 movies will probably know what is going to happen and why.Now onto the man himself, Michael Bay and his band of merry men.First of the Direction is VERY solid, not great or different from what Bay has done before but the action is the best yet, the score swells to the occasion and everything else (apart from the crap editing and thin story) works okay.TLDR a slight improvement from T2 but nowhere near as deep or meaningful as T1, if your a fan of either go see it, if your new to the series you should see it if you want to.Rating: *****/********** Not Great, not terrible, not as good as Transformers 1","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm not a fan of Michael bay; personally he's not the greatest mare in the stable but I can say I finally can feel closure to the adventure that began in the first film. Truthfully that's all that matters. I didn't and won't ever expect to go into a movie about giant alien transforming sentient machines thinking it will top Inception or tease me intellectually. The initial plot is the worst possible idea of all time, and it has got to be the longest rant about false history I've ever endured..Its so annoying and it lasts the first 20-30 minutes.But After we get over the fact that Sam (Lebeouf) had been dumped by his girlfriend and the FIRST moon landing and outer space adventure was staged to retrieve something it soon becomes safe to retract your hand from your face. Because after the pleasantries are over its all a big thrill ride of sarcasm, robots, Bad ass revenge, explosions, and actually a surprisingly good subplot in my opinion. I went to see this to be entertained. Its a film based on a cartoon, not a documentary. If you wanna criticize physics, locality, and even the social standing of women I think you'd ought to check out the cartoon for yourself. Transformers is what it say sit is. And this one ""and then some"". I could complain all day about it but it was 100% worth watching. Except for Rosie, at least Fox was an actor. Five things say this movie deserves an 8: The cliché but unexpected betrayals, The death scenes, The worm, Sam's coming of age subplot,and the Cole Train.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

As a major action buff, I live for these types of movies where Robots are fighting in our world and we clash as one. While pretty much everyone in human existent absolutely loathed the second transformers movie, I walked out having had a fun time and was able to be entertained for the 2hr 30 min run time. Keeping some entertained for over 2 hours is no easy task, but with Michael Bay's hand at the director realm, we got great action and fast paced witty dialogue. I am not trying to defend the second film, all I'm saying is that I liked it. There are a lot of Michael Bay haters out there and it really disgusts me that people go to see these movies, only to return home just to b**ch and nag on the internet about them later on. Shia LaBeouf has majorly improved as an actor over the years with this franchise and has worked under the intense eye of Bay who can be known for being a bit of a douche on the set. Newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replaces Megan Fox as Sam's girlfriend and despite this being her first acting experience, she does a good job and also looks quite good in tight dresses in the process. The SFX and VFX are amazing and never cease to amaze me as Bay pushes the envelope as to what is going on on screen. It is required that people suspend their disbelief for a movie like this but given what it is about shouldn't make that too difficult. The story is a bit confusing, with one too many twists near the end and the script needed work as is the case with most of these types of movies. This is one of those movies where you can go in and turn your brain off and just enjoy yourself. Nothing wrong with that. The opening sequence is spliced a bit odd and may confuse you but the 3D actually worked in this movie which surprised me but also delighted me. It was shot in 3D so that helped. This is really only meant for action buffs who could care less about plot and characters; and while those elements are important, I certainly don't look for them in a Michael Bay film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I actually do heart the first one the most but that's me. I rate this film 10/10 because I'm a die hard action movie fan and that's basically the reason he and I go to see movies like this. We were both disappointed when we heard that Megan Fox was not returning due to conflicts with her and Bay but nevertheless, we loved this movie from beginning to end. The Transformers movies are all awesome to me. My overall opinion about this movie is that it's a great final chapter to the trilogy.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I almost walked out of hobo with a shotgun (because my moral fibers disagreed with it) and I nearly walked out of this one cause I lost complete track of the story and all I could remember was a bunch of CGI robots destroying Chicago in 3-D.Michael bay, next time you make a movie, please slow down enough to tell us what's going on. that's what's wrong with this one, along with the stupid clichés and mistakes. And another thing, I never saw the original transformers, but to hear the words ""Transformers! More than meets the Eye"" somewhere in the film would've made me smile.On a positive note, The 3D Effects in this one are actually really good. In most modern flicks they're a joke, only showing little bits of 3D here and there, but in this one, objects were coming towards me a lot so i have no complaints about spending the extra 3 bucks for glasses. Also, as mentioned in the headnote, The special effects look like they had a majority of the budget spent on them.If you're looking to satisfy your craving for transformers, stick to the TV show. it's on Teletoon Retro at certain times.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And after seeing this movie, I'm still not. To me, the movie is an overall failure as a piece of entertainment. I found the characters to be thoroughly uninteresting, especially Shia LeBeouf's character. He is still the annoying person that tries to play off as a courageous hero in the story. Co-star Rosie Huntington-Whitely plays a almost non-existent role except for just being the pretty face on the screen. Michael Bay still creates initially serious scenes that later become riddled with lame jokes and crude humor with the help of the little robots that serve as nothing more than a poor excuse for comic relief.The plot is filled with holes and a little hard to follow but none of that matters because everyone goes to the theaters for the action! That is the one thing the movie does well. Stunning, computer-generated, robot-mashing, action. Of course, this is just my opinion and everyone seems to have their own. I generally dislike this movie because the characters lack depth and the plot development was clearly not a point of focus when the script was written.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It sort of makes sense and it has enough complexity that it can support the massive amount of action. That's another thing. The finale action scene is like an hour long. At some point you become immune to fire and explosions and its just boring again. Only Michael Bay could blow enough stuff up that it becomes normal... I don't want to ruin anything but it doesn't really make sense for the Autobots to be under the governments control and have to answer to them since they're a different species are like super strong.On to actors: Shia LaBeouf is, as always, mediocre. He's the goofy, everyday man that manages to save the world, again, and somehow gets no recognition for it. It's sort of charming but LaBeouf doesn't really help his own character since he is getting annoying after the third installment. There is not enough of his parents, especially his mother played by Julie White who is fantastic in her mania. Tyrese Gibson is shockingly good in this and seems to have a more individual part rather than being in Josh Duhamel's shadow. He shows some depth and has his won motivations. The new chick, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is bad. Like does not act at all bad... Megan Fox looks like an actual actress compared to her and its obvious she was just picked randomly from a pool of attractive women.This brings me to my biggest complaint against this movie: Sexism. Michael Bay is possibly the most sexist director in the business and it is deplorable that this is acceptable. Huntington-Whiteley literally has no depth of character, wears the skimpiest clothing and manages to wear stilettos for an hour long action finale. The exploitation of her is disgusting and any women shown with strength, Frances McDormand playing the head of the Autobots department, is portrayed as ignorant, power hungry and bitchy. I cannot blame Megan Fox for leaving this franchise and I think she is better off for it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And i'll say it again- DAMN, the movie is Tomahawk spectacular!Transformers. Ever since the news of its third installment was released, i was anticipating this movie like none other. With an intensified desire to watch and an irresistible attraction to the robots in disguise, i was all willing to work deeper into my pocket to fork out the price for a 3-D ticket.The movie begins with a fictitious twist to the moon landing history- the discovery of one of the Autobots spaceships remains on the Moon. Years later, Autobots and Decepticons on Earth realize the existence of powerful Cybertronian parts in the ship and war between the two intergalactic parties starts- the final battle.The movie has a solid storyline- smart! The twists and turns in this movie keeps me on the edge of my seat. However, i have to admit that the beginning was a tad too choppy and it made the movie a little messy. It progresses at warp speed, developing the characters and story simultaneously in between scenes. Unlike Transformers 2, this movie does not start with a 'bang' at the beginning or has continuously loud action scenes at the stage of development. It takes a more subtle approach, building everything to a peak so high i have never seen in any other movie. When the twist of the plot is revealed, the movie kicks in in high gear!The real Bay prevails- the action movie maestro, and for the next hour or more, the movie blasts to the end. The struggles between the Autobots and Decepticons, and the Autobots-side human allies and the Decepticons- side human allies take over, lots of explosions, running, screaming and shooting. The effect is mind-blowing! And my eyes were locked to the screen, in awe at the transforming vehicles and true-to-life gunfire. The music comes at the right time, rushing adrenaline through my veins.Some scenes in the climax strike straight to the heart and it would be a lie if i say i had no goosebumps or chills run down my spine. At times, i was touched by the characters' words and actions. I was constantly rooting for the Autobots, cheering every time they tear a Decepticon and take its life; i felt like having a gun or bomb or anything that can shoot so that i can help those Autobots. I was deeply pulled into the movie, fitting myself in Sam's or any other soldier's shoe. I had never really felt this absorbed, this connected in the movies.The fight was one of the greatest ever, different characters- human and robots, converging paths. I can't word out how the movie manages to link the characters together with its plot. You have to see it to believe it. Kudos to Bay and his crew, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and the rest of the casts for a tremendous effort. Alas, I don't really like Megan Fox but her character is definitely nicer to watch than Carly Spencer, Sam's new love.As a fan of Transformers, and always will be, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Iron Hide, Ratchet, Sideswipe to name a few, will always play a role in me. A lesson of loyalty to be learned, and to have faith in oneself teaches a lot about life itself. And a story told in such epic grandeur, my money is well worth spent and i don't mind returning to the cinema for another run of endless action scenes.Sit back and relax in its beginning and buckle up when it comes. Because when it comes, there is no stop! Transformers 3 rocks to its core and Dark of the Moon is a perfect end to this trilogy. Transformers forever, an Autobots at heart, and a ride i will never forget! Damn!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Τhe directors had made a good background with the first two movies and Ι had great expectations for this one. I would understand the disappointment if the movie was low-budget, but it wasn't. It was full to the brim with cgi action scenes and special effects, the action was almost constant and yet not satisfying. The only kind of action scenes I can remember are with with things collapsing, people falling, and Sam (Shia LaBeouf) shouting his girlfriend's name. The autobots where absent in the majority of the film, and there were almost no fight scenes involving the transformers. Even the last battle, which we've been waiting for the entire film, lasted for less than 5 minutes, and it wasn't so epic after all. The creators also tried to make Sam look tougher in the third movie, which doesn't suit him. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as the new girl was beautiful (too beautiful for Sam to be having her from the beginning of the film actually), but that's as far as it goes. Furthermore, they put more characters to make the script funnier (Malcovich, Frances McDormand, and the two little autobots) but they overdid it and the result was kind of childish. To sum up, I just believe that they could have put all this budget to better use.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first Transformers (2007) film surprised me. A film based on childhood toys, and their 20 minute narrative adverts, about robots that can change into vehicles and other such objects, should not have worked. And to boot, directed by a well known pyrotechnics obsessive, and general hack of bullshit. But the first film had a certain charm, which was elevated by the Shia LeBeouf performance, which pretty much catapulted him, and encouraged Steven Spielberg (also executive producer of all the films) to take him as a new toy. After the debacle of the second in the series, 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, the fans and general audience wanted a Tranformers film that was as thrilling, funny, and silly as the first. Well, the idea is quite neat.Turns out that the 1969 moon landing was not carried out just cause we could. No, it happens that there was something ""alien"" on the dark side of said moon. So Buzz Aldrin et al had the top secret mission of taking a peek at the craft that crash landed. And that craft was, of course, one that was occupied by some dead Autobots. Back to the present day and Sam Whitwicky (LeBeouf) has been shunned by the government that works with the Decepticons, and has to get a regular job. As Megan Fox was essentially sacked from the franchise for suggesting that Bay was like Hitler, we are led to believe that Sam has got himself a new stunner of a girlfriend (as Sam's mum states in a later scene, he must have a big cock!). So we are introduced to Carley (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's lips on legs), in a simple, tracking shot that follows her legs and arse: nice! She has a nice body, but her face is dominated by over-sized lips, and is about as charismatic as a transformer that can't transform: i.e. a van.What transpires is a series of battles, instigated by some objects that have the potential of bringing the robot world through space and time to occupy planet Earth. Humans have been working with the Decepticons for years, which has helped them get information from various companies. When this action begins, the main setting is Chicago. An alien invasion- style visual style takes over, many scenes looking very similar to 2005's War of the Worlds.The film does have some effective action sequences, but doesn't really deliver anything different that the previous sequel. Basically, it's rubbish. What always amazes me about these kind of films, is that we have developed our English language, that apparently also developed in a civilisation of robots, that existed in parallel in a distant galaxy. Well done Mr Bay, you have released yet another film littered with CGI spunk stains. Plus, the toy company, Hasbro, has a new film to sell their new line of transformers toys!! I have discovered recently that the new toys are not easy to transform, not like the ease of their 80's counterparts.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Many Scenes didn't go with each other. They could either be deleted or shortened without anyone will ever notice! 2. The 'Lead' actress, whatever her name is. How many of you feel she's got 'I'm Hollywood & I'm fake' written all over her face?? 3. The 'Lead' actress...4. The 'Lead' actress...5. Plot. It's so awkward & shallow that if we threw in a different story in, no one would even care as long as there are robots in it.6 The running time. This definitely has something do with the poor editing and its plot. The entire movie could be shot in 90 mins or less, but apparently they didn't think so, in which it starts to getting boring at a certain point.7. Casting. NSA director, Sam's gf's boss, that former fat black marine and again The 'Lead' actress.8. Were Sam's parents really needed in that movie? I totally forgot what scenes they were in, how about you?? In fact, I forgot about 99% of the movie right after watching it.9. It's T3 now, not T1 anymore! You guys need bring up a notch if you want to keep your loyal fans.

Fire Michael Bay and bring Christopher Nolan on board.2. Fire Michael Bay 3. Fire Michael Bay 4. Kidnap that 'lead' actress, whatever her name is.

Transformers 3, makes the 80's cartoons I used to love as a kid, look like Citizen Kane. The story is almost a copy of the previous movie, and it's so, so bad. It goes from one set to another, with no sense or point. We never care for a moment about any caracther, not even my beloved Optimus Prime. Man, in the cartoons even the Decepticons had a lot of personality. Megatron was tough, but Starscream was a badass, I always loved the disputes between him and Megatron. Michael Bay seems to wannabe a James Cameron like director, but it's far from it. In Cameron's movies, we always have a link to the caracthers, then we get the action and CGI as a part of the process. It's like building a house, you've start at the foundations, and only then you place the nice design on top of it. He also seems to add now a few elements of slow motion, alias, Zack Snyder style, but again, it just doesn't add up If you liked Transformers 2, you should go and see this movie, as it's almost a rerun of the same. If you think Transformers 2 was a empty soul with a overdue makeup, skip this one into TV or PirateBay. Getting a ticket for it is just asking Hollywood to make them more like that. My wish is that the series get a reboot in 10-15 years from someone like Cameron, or even who knows, Christopher Nolan, that would be asking too much, but great nonetheless Shame on you, Bay","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

To tell you truth, I didn't have high hopes for this one after I saw the mess of Revenge of the Fallen. But when I left the theater, I thought WOW! Bay redeemed himself! What makes this movie great is the whole story plot with the alien space ark and pillars that could create a space bridge between Earth and Cybertron. I'm not saying anymore. I also loved the new characters which were not only robots but humans as well. Some of them brought the comedy to the film.What I didn't like about this film is the whole hour and a half of chaos in Chicago at the end. This is where Bay didn't learn his lesson. He thinks to make an excellent movie is to destroy cities and bring destruction and violence. My other problem: Everyone knows how the main villain is this film is supposed to be Shockwave. I was going to see a whole new transformer so I was curious to see how he was like. Wrong! He only appears twice in the film and you learn like nothing about him except his name. It's hard to call him the ""main villain"" when it's probably Megatron again.Overrall, great film compared to the other two. Bay has made progress! Totally recommend it!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's another overlong, noisy, and completely over the top offering from Michael Bay, who as a director understands nothing of nuance, subtlety, or how to properly direct his actors.The plot is vapid and routine. Once again the Autobots and the Decepticons are back on Earth and battling it out. The best thing about the film is the calibre of the special effects; the CGI is endless and exemplary, and shiny chrome and plate metal have never looked so good. Kudos to the special effects guys for creating such a realistic-looking race of giant robots and featuring them for so much of the screen time.I admit that I got a basic enjoyment from this film from watching the endless destruction of both cities and robots. There's something of an appealing kaiju quality to it. Unfortunately, the rest of the elements of the film are rubbish. Shia LaBeouf is really awful in these films, not even making an effort, although the worst actor in it is Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley, who doesn't even try to act; she just stands around and looks dumbly on. Jon Turturro is here, doing a bad impersonation of Al Pacino, while Frances McDormand comes in to pick up her pay cheque. The worst thing about Ehren Kruger's dumb-as-nails script is his insistence on going for the lowest common denominator throughout, i.e. aiming it at the teenage male crowd, thus including endless stupid comedy relief (those mini-Transformers) and generally spoon-feeding to viewers.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It has a hot chick in it, the storyline is questionable, and it has a sh*t-ton of action in it. I personally think that it was better than the first movie, and that it was a lot better than the second. I actually happened to be one of the few who liked the second movie, also. The action in this movie is unbelievable, the way that it goes into slow motion, and the absolute violence of the robots fighting just blew my mind. Although there were some disappointments, like the fight between Optimus and Megatron could have gone on for a little longer, it was still really great. The characters are still the same, throughout the series, Shia Lebouef was still his goofy self, and still kind of trying to impress people throughout the movie. Rosie Huntington Whiteley did a good job for her first acting career and was a good replacement for Megan Fox. And of course there are the transformers who are always the same and then there are the crazy ones meant to be there for the little kids. The storyline was pretty good and had a few questions to it, but the way I see it is why would you go and watch a movie and ask yourself why would someone do a certain something in the movie. Just enjoy the movie for what it is, a summer blockbuster meant satisfy the minds of people who want to see a sh*t-ton of explosions and robots beating the sh*t out of each other. So I recommend that everybody should go see it and that they should just enjoy it and not be predetermined to say that it sucked, because it really was one of the best movies that I have ever seen.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It would be unfair to analyze, critique or compare this to any ""normal"" movie. Being somewhat limited in scope by the source material, director Michael Bay, delivers what the fans want ... full scale noise and all-out action.While he admitted that part two of this trilogy was lacking much, it appears his efforts to improve part three come not from script improvement, but rather by tossing in some familiar Hollywood faces: John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey and Ken Jeong. Oh, and we also get Bill O'Reilly, an odd sequence with legendary Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and the best surprise - Leonard Nimoy voicing Sentinel Prime.Most of the same key players are back: Shia LaBeouf as Sam (friend to Optimus Prime), John Turturro (cashed in on his 10 min of fame), Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson as soldiers, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents in a couple of throw away scenes that cost much less than the CGI that dominates the movie.While I remain an avid opponent to 3-D, this film offers a few of the best uses since Avatar. Unfortunately the dimmed coloring offset the benefits and continue to annoy me. Just remove your glasses periodically and you can easily see how much brighter the colors are without the 3-D muting. Such a shame.Michael Bay knows explosions. And there are no shortage on display here. We get plenty of rock 'em sock 'em action and the military is on full display, especially with some pretty cool skydiving tactics. Heck, we even get Frances McDormand as a power-hungry bureaucrat. For those who know Chicago, the familiar sights abound. The Wrigley Building plays a vital role, though it still bothers me a bit to see a skyscraper destroyed. I will say the tilted office is not close to the rotating hallway of Inception, though the effort is appreciated.The battle of the robots is what people pay to see and the 40 plus minute final battle is something to behold, even if it drags on entirely too long. And I can't fail to mention that the lack of presence of Megan Fox' character is explained a couple of times as having ""dumped"" Sam. Sam has rebounded nicely with Carly, played by supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who looks just fine in a $200,000 Mercedes, a slim white dress or conversing with an injured villainous robot. Yes, one must maintain a sense of humor during the film.The use of slo-motion, the ties to the space program, and the connection to Chernobyl are all a bit heavy-handed, but this is a Transformers movie, not a documentary. And the actual transformation of these guys is still one of the coolest on screen moments you can find ... even if the story and dialogue will have you desperate for brain resuscitation when the movie finally ends.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

What an insult to the transformers image. 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. With the departure of Megan Hox I expected to see a better actress who looks hot. However, the replacement chick, Rosie Huntington-Whitley, who looks as though she just walked out of an underwear catalogue, doesn't add much. The movie starts off dreadfully. The attempt at creating a historical link is ridiculously bad. There is very little action and the few that you get to see is unimpressive. The supposed 'comedy' parts do not amuse at all. Only Julie White manages to draw some giggles. Shia LaBeouf is irritating. He seems to have reached a new level of overacting. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and John Torturro are wasted in horrible roles with very limited screenspace. While most of the human characters are dull, another major disappointment is that you won't get to see much of the Transformers Michael Bay has a reputation of making expensive lavish with no heart. 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' definitely fits in that category.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

He gets what he needs, because investors know he sells thickets. So, when you hear about Bay and Spielberg, one can assure there WILL be something extraordinary going on. You will buy and people will be paying Bay for a merely entertaining moment and an absolute mess of a story. That's what I saw yesterday. There were big robot monsters exhilaratingly killing themselves in confrontations better even than the ones seen on the first one and the second one. There's where I found some kind of relief for my money. The amazing hand to hand combat seen on the first movie was better this time, as I found the most of the Autobots were involved this time in close combat sequences against a giant army of invader Decepticons. I met Dino, Sideswipe, Que and other Transformers from which my favorites were Soundwave and Ratchet. This time, is about one spaceship that crashed on the Earth's Moon in the ages of Kennedy. Therefore, the first step of mankind on our natural satellite (one of the biggest achievements in history) was not even for the sake of science, but a race between the U.S. NASA and the Russian aerospace intelligence to reach the ship and find out what's inside of it. The NASA won, but not much was the prize, only the location of the spaceship. Years later, after a mission in the Middle-Eastern (which has no relation, to me, with the context; just a mere reason to kill Iranians) and a visit to the ruins of the nuclear central in Chernobyl, Ukraine (my God: Russians needing Americans for research), Optimus Prime (Cullen) found some kind of proof of what the space mission was all about in the first place. The spaceship, The Ark, is the rest place of an old buddy named Sentinel Prime (Nimoy), the master of the actual leader of the Autobots. He left Cybertron in the middle of the war and took with him ""something"" that could have given the Autobots the victory: pillars, hundreds of them. He got lost in space to hide those pillars and, after he crashed on the Moon, he locked himself inside the ship with five of them. The pillars are means of transportation which can be used by Transformers to bring troops to this world and, in Decepticon hands, they could be very dangerous, so it is imperative to keep them away from Megatron (Weaving) and his brand new band of robot-fellas, along Shockwave (Welker) and his giant robot-worm-pet, Soundwave (also Welker) with his scary robot-vulture-pet (Awesome!), and Starscream with his usual cowardice. Decepticons go after those pillars.The story with the Autobots and Decepticons is poor, but should work alone if it were. There goes Sam Wickity (LaBeouf) again, but this time with the hyper-sensual Carly (Huntington-Witheley) instead of Megan Fox (Bay is a man of word) covering the role of his hot girlfriend. The lucky guy keeps his supermodel in a ruined store and she lives on with his love, cause he still looking for job. She works in a male's paradise and has a female's paradise (and even some non-female) of a boss, Dylan (Dempsey), the guy who cares for her so much to give her a Mercedes (hell of a car), while Sam has a substitute of his Bumble Bee (joke of a car). I had seen this kind of treats, where the girl rather to be with the deprived guy even thought there is a rich (powerful) and handsome guy who falls for her, but this is way too much. It is just ludicrous. Dylan does a deal for Sam to get a shot in a cars company, where seemingly isn't any possible way of a quality standard (or human real emotions). There is where Sam meets a marked guy (Jeong) who has information about something the Decepticons cares so much to send robot-mercenaries to take human lives off At this level, the script is very complicated (not complex) without the characteristically absurd jokes Bay always frequents in his movies. Yes, there are a lot of them in this movie, tons of them. So much, that anyone can begin to doubt about the credibility of every single character. And there, exactly there is where Michael Bay fails every time. Sexy and uninterested supermodel girlfriend; rich Simons with gay butler; armed ex soldiers surviving the fall of a building. Those are affairs that would probably build a good plot each one in a different and separate movie, but in one single movie all of them could be (and they ARE) a complete and irrevocable mess; one that not even all the fights of big robots from all the galaxies would compensate. As the time passed by, I started to think about the Island. If there ever was a movie that made me feel the progress of a director in the matter of legibility it was his Island. McGregor and Johansson provide real emotions, real dialogs and even an amazing change of personality in the same movie But that was then. No real emotions in this movie. No real dialog Somehow, I know Bay don't want to be a real director. He does his own movies, I know that, but he doesn't take it seriously. He's like a child, a big child that sells thickets and makes movies appear good with exaggerated takes and freezing sequences. Fancy style is what it is. But, as long as he keeps selling, he won't change. If, in some way, I found this movie better than the second one is because the return of the body combat. But both movies are despicable, and if I had known that before I wouldn't have left myself to be tightened by the first movie to see all the other movies in theaters.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I also have the opinion that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the worst block busters I have seen. I won't give away much of the story (what little there is here) and get on with the review.Like I said, there isn't much of a story here, and what story there is gets very predictable. Who cares. This film is 100% meant for those who want to shut their brains off for a couple of hours, sit back, and enjoy some amazing visuals. The story itself is MUCH better than that of Revenge of the Fallen. With RotF, I felt that they tried to pack too much in to it all at once. There was no set up for many of the film's larger plot points, and they were just presented in an ""in-your-face"" fashion, like ""oh by the way you should know these eight things so we can get on with the movie."" This film, however, uses a much more simple plot line and in my opinion it works. For the most part this was a film you were meant to go and enjoy for what it has to offer. That would be: explosions, special effects, some comedy mixed with even more explosions and special effects. For the hell of it throw in a beautiful woman, who unfortunately was more eye candy than anything as her acting wasn't all that great(much like Fox). Did I care though? Even if her acting sucked I still couldn't stop paying attention to her, which I feel is exactly what she was in the movie for.The special effects and explosions mentioned above were top-notch. People put a great deal of work in to making this film look visually stunning. Many of the stunts were unrealistic, but we as an audience should forgive this because it is a science fiction film. Who cares about the technical crap when you realize the film was never intended to be for the most part realistic. If you have the ability to switch off and be stunned by what you see on the screen without thinking ""he should be dead"" or ""they would never do that"" then this is the movie for you. I know some movie-goers have trouble doing this, and in some instances it's justified. Not here, though. We were promised an action flick that will entertain the dumb side of us all, and Bay delivered.Remember, I absolutely HATED the second film. The special effects were great but jumpy, the story was convoluted, and it was just an overall piece of crap, in my own opinion. This film makes up for most of the mistakes the second one made, and I believe it accomplished everything it was supposed to. So use this review to make an informed judgement. You should have a pretty clear idea of what to expect. If you expect it to get to you on a deeper level, you'll be disappointed. If you wanted a new ""Dark Knight"" or some other action film with substance, you'll be disappointed. If you expect to see a bunch of robots blowing up buildings and each other, have decent special effects, and laugh every now and then, you have a chance of walking out of the theater (or your living room) pleasantly surprised like I was.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is some exciting action and I found myself engaged enough to want to see the outcome of the struggle. Out of place one liners that made no sense broke my interest in the story which gave me time to think about how goofy this movie is. I am not concerned about continuity with the first two movies (I never saw the first and the second is just as forgettable as this one will be). The Sam character should never be given words because the writers have no clue how to develop a character. I can suspend my disbelief for giant mechanical extra terrestrial life and even an unlikely hero, but not for the painful dialogue that was supposed to flesh out the latter. I am not looking for poetry, but something that will not make me groan. Pairing Sam with a pretty woman largely for exploitation also cheapens what could have been a much better action movie. Leave out the fan service and focus on the story. Transformers has potential to be good grown up entertainment. Like Batman, I hope that somebody else tries to recreate the characters one day. Over all, for $1.02 rental, I enjoyed about ninety-nine cents of it. Michael Bay et al may keep the change.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Get to the movies as soon as you can! 4 Stars ladies and gentleman, I believe Micheal Bay, his cast and crew deserves 4 big fat stars on ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"".It was widely admitted that ""The Revenge of the Fallen"" was not very well accepted by the viewers as the 1st installment of the ""Transformers"". I am beginning to believe now that even director Micheal Bay agrees with this trail of thought. Back to the drawing boards it was for him and the team. They must have done some extensive research at the pre-production stage of ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". A noteworthy comeback to the franchise and if I may so; a must watch movie of the summer. I would fearlessly say that this will have a standing at the top 3 movies of the summer of 2011. Viewer preference wise and box office wise. Micheal Bay is a favorite of mine since ""Armageddon"" and for those of you who know his work, he has used every method in his big book of secrets in this summer hit. ""Transformers"" was always said to be too much of action and metal clanking together, whilst this cannot be avoided, this time round, the entire movie is dominated by the humans and a plethora of emotion in comparison with the previous movies. There is a bit of ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" carefully blended in with the Autobots and the Decepticons. A magnificent musical score that compliments the scenes with immense depth, edge of your seat CGI, Cinemax, Stunt choreography and deep concentration in some lovely character development is what you are about to experience. Maybe even more but definitely none less!Megan Fox is no more; I have to address that concern, don't be disheartened; Rosie Huntington-Whiteley the Victoria's Secret diva has some wicked talent. She is amazingly talented and is stunningly convincing and yes indeed an Aphrodite on screen. Shia LaBeouf, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel & Tyrese Gibson are at their very best. Hardcore to the cause and determined for victory, they carry the entire story line along with Whiteley onto the highest levels of the Trilogy. Deep connections between the humans and the machines are introduced and concentrated on shifting the paradigms of viewing pleasure at well-timed intervals. Introducing John Malkovich and Ken Jeong to assist Kevin Dunn & Julie White with the comic relief within the 157 Minutes is shrewd choice. Even I did check my watch once since I felt the length of the movie (Another typical Micheal Bay Trade Mark) however, the choice of the addition of such characters for comic relief was needed, and rightly chosen talent indeed. Need I say more?If I am to pick a bone, I would pick the writing. However to make such a great movie out of the toys I played with back as a kid, I am just going to let this one go!Title: Transformers: Dark of the Moon Directed by: Micheal Bay Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington – Whiteley, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Ken Jeong & John Malkovich Rated: Rated PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of sci-fi action violence, mayhem and destruction, and for language, some sexuality and innuendo Rating: 08/10 157 Minutes","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

With Michael Bay's epic realistic effects, and the soundtrack from Steve Jablonsky, this movie is so worth watching. Many say that the story line is bad. But I don't think so. I mean, it wasn't bad, I actually enjoyed it. It was unpredictable and entertaining. I don't really care that Megan is gone, the new girl is damn hot and fits with the story line. Though I'm not sure why Megan would break up, hehe. In any way, this is the best of them 3, and it deserves so much more stars. I walked out of the movies, smiling. And in the sad moments, I almost cried. Of course there are the people that hate the too much action and explosion stuff, but hey - that's transformers? I seriously doubt that you don't expect that when you get to the theaters. This movie is number 1 on the movie meter currently, and that's how it's supposed to be.

She is one.) Shia's acting never ceases to impress me. His hysterics, humor and ability to be dramatic at the same time cracks me up and makes me believe his character.Rosie was so much better than I thought (of course I had extremely low expectations). She's running around in 8"" heels and neat, tight clothes but her acting was quite believable, much better than Megan Fox's. Her character however was un-needed.Do we always have to have a super hot girl running around and breathing hard enough to where her abundant chest takes center screen? Why can't average Sam have an average girl that can actually have a talent besides running behind him and then screaming his name? Overall, her character was nearly useless except to point out why Mikaela is no longer in the picture and to say, ""Over there!"" The storyline is the same of course (decipticons trying to take over blah blah blah) but this time, things finally come to a head.Optimus, Bumblebee and the other Autobots, that we don't really care about, must dig deep within themselves and start getting dirty.I, for one, loved the fight sequences. They were long yes, and sometimes chaotic but I felt like I was watching a different auto-bot fight. It was meaner, more desperate to the point where I was actually scared that Bumblebee might not make it! And that's my other complaint: I love Bumblebee and Sam's interactions. They're always funny or heartfelt but there was hardly any of that in here. All relationship (alien/human, alien/alien/, human/human) scenes were soley focused on Carly and Sam.Overall, I liked it and it's definitely better than ROTF. But it lacks the human/alien interaction that made the first one so special.And to those who complain about the phsyics...you do realize that this is a movie about machines transforming right? Phsyics and logic don't apply to a robotic alien movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But the fact this is a Michael Bay Transformers movie, this one is not good either. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is only a weak installment that has not changed a lot from last time. The reason I say it's better than last time is without spoiling, it does try with the moon element that gives details of the Autobots' history of the war they were fighting. But it still contains the same issues with a mostly dull story, action that can at best be hit and miss, obnoxious human characters that offer nothing but filler, and despite the nice designs on Autobots and Decepticons, the explosion effects are unappealing. I would simply recommend to not watch this, but I can only recommend this one to those that actually liked the first two movies. I'll give the movie credit for trying. But it still shares the problem from last time that can make this one bad. After watching this, I feel the franchise would close its story after this one.

He wouldn't shut up and he screams almost every line. Too bad his plot armor was in the stratosphere. I also don't buy the idea that a person like him would land someone as good-looking as the girl character, whose name does not matter to me whatsoever because her character was terrible and her acting sucked.All of the humans are annoying. Not only are their characters poorly-written, none of the performances are any good. Not even from Frances McDormand, which caught me so off -guard. She is way too good for a movie like this.Writers, you couldn't just write a different character for the love interest? You just replaced Michaela's name. That's all you did!The Decepticons did not need human collaborators.Personal point: That's not my Soundwave.The plot makes no sense!The dialogue is absolutely horrible.Thanks for assassinating Optimus' character. He would not say something like, ""We'll kill them all."" He would never execute someone in cold blood. Ever! He would never kill Megatron after the latter saved him. (They should've went with the ending they had in one of the earlier drafts of the script where Optimus and Megatron agree to a peace. Two enemies putting their differences aside to fight a bigger threat. That's always incredibly satisfying to watch. It's like a secret kink for me. This movie would be a point higher for me if they had done that.)Come to think of it, they assassinated Megatron's character, too. I don't understand why Megatron would just take crap from Sentinel, or allow himself to be beaten by him.Shockwave was cool but barely does anything.It's too long! 2 1/2 hours?! Are you kidding me, Michael?All of the robots are cool. Though, I have to ask why a number of the Decepticons are snarling, drooling animals. They look like a completely different species.I like that it's brutally violent. And all the robots are cool. If only the movie only focused on them.Some of the music is good.The best acting came from Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, and Leonard Nimoy, because of course.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:In this movie, The Transformers saga continues more or less in the same tone as the previous two instalments. The effects and scenery continue to be well done and at moments exciting, but beyond the extravaganza and explosions, little to none substance remains. These movies aren't in that sense made for depth or thoughtful philosophies, which remains the main point to be aware of.Secondly, the characters can feel very one-dimensional. The main protagonist Sam spends most of his scream time running, with his new girlfriend (which poses a major plot inconsistency) running behind screaming. Rarely does it feel like the characters are human, which robs the dramatic as well as the more tender moments of impact.In terms of consistency, this movie is, nevertheless, the soundest. It's a clear improvement from Transformers 2, but not enough to really be satisfying except to its target audience.My personal grade: a bland 5/10.

I'm addicted to the action, the explosions, and the stunts. Shia LaBeouf is fantastic as always. All of the original characters were good as well, but it seemed like they were trying to shove their stars down our throats. The movie easily could have done without Patrick Dempsey and especially without that model Rosie-whatever. She was unexperienced and clearly just added for her looks. Who would have thought that I would have missed Megan Fox! But I definitely wish that they had hired someone who deserved the role for something other than their sex-appeal. She added nothing worthwhile to the movie. Other than the force-fed celebrities and beauties, the movie was full of drama and action and I loved it! There were twists and turns at every corner. In addition, you could really connect to the robots (as ridiculous as it may sound) but every time one of the good robots was killed I was affected. They had original robot characters as well as new ones to add to the plot. All in all I loved the movie (especially in 3 D) and would definitely go see it again!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Years later, the Decepticons put into motion a plan to secure the contents of the craft— artefacts that would help them finally win their war, if only it wasn't for the intervention of plucky teen Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), his 'clearly out of his league' girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and their metal pals.I watched the first two Transformers films in the company of my son, but I'm watching this one alone: I simply cannot subject my poor boy to any more of this mindless drivel. Admittedly, I thought it would be impossible for Michael Bay to make a more terrible film than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but here it is 154 minutes of noisy, CGI-filled crap that easily ranks amongst the very worst movies I have ever seen.A man for whom more is never enough, Bay smothers his ridiculously OTT action with expensive CGI special effects, overloading the senses, yet never managing to generate any feeling of excitement or tension. Frequent ill-judged comedy only goes to make the whole thing an even more painful experience, one that not even Huntington-Whiteley's hot bod can prevent me from awarding the lowest possible rating.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

You have a full invasion of a major American city using armies of Decepticon ships. I liked the idea of the Americans going to the Moon because there was something there they needed and the Russians not going because the Americans got there first. If only it was used in a better movie.The girl is not Megan Fox anymore and, if I thought she was kind of bland in the previous movie, you should see the new girl. Blonde with British accent, though.

It turned out that a producer on one of the channels wanted to treat the audience with a Michael Bay double feature. The reason for that was the cinema premiere of Transformers: Age of Extinction.Quickly i started treating the TV set as moving picture on the wall and did some other things while occasionally casting a glance in it's direction. But i didn't really miss much. It quickly became clear that this movie has great special effects bordering with a video game brought to cinema. Therefore the second star in my rating.Shia LaBeouf has one and the same facial expression throughout most the movie which also summarizes his acting in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley might look interesting in some men's magazine, with or without her clothes, but as soon as she opens her mouth, her inability to act becomes obvious, even at the low level implied by this movie.Even this is too much text for such a moneymaking masterpiece.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first film. 7/10. I think people can understand that rating. The second film, i gave a 5/10, and again I think some will agree. There are some bad and good of that film, so it evens out to mediocre. But the third one, was great. And yes, that's probably the best word to put it. There are flaws, of course, but I think that this was the movie that was trying to take itself seriously, for the most part. There aren't as many annoying robots this time round, and I honestly didn't notice any racial stereotypes, there might be a few subtle ones but they stick out like a sore thumb like in the other films. Many people are complaining about Rosie Huntington's character being the only likable one, and that laBeouf's is obnoxious and screams a lot. I find him fine this time around, and that he only screams for comedic reasons. I should also add that Huntington does a fairly good job for someone whose never acted before. I was impressed. I feel the third act was taken very seriously, and Bay knew he had to finish the series in a well executed way. I believe he succeeded. He is slowly moving away from that fast paced editing, and takes us on some nice long shots to let the audience breathe. And there was no more forced storytelling like in the last movie, we learn with the characters at some points, which was pretty nice. This movie's only big mistake was the runtime. Quite lengthy. ANd let's not forget that the effects and action is spectacular, as always expected from a transformers movie. It's a well made movie, and while not all the problems are gone, they've at least faded a little. And that is all I have to say. In the end, I give it 8/10. But hey, that's just me.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I believe the 3d box office for the film was driven in equal parts to a wonderful story, a wonderful star (Shia Labeouf), a wonderful supporting cast ensemble, and wonderful CG capably drawn in a dimensional medium.I was happy that the dimension in the film was used to paint the landscape rather than as a neon flag to be waved in front of one's nose. My experience was that negative space elements were treated, in the most part, with respect. I like the fact that in much of the film the camera moves were slowed down so one could truly enjoy and explore the airspace.Granted there were some scenes where the camera moves and cuts were exhaustively fast and furious ala 2D.I like the fact that the medium is starting to come of age. To me, there were more positives in the crafting of the film than negatives. (Not to be confused with positive and negative space).Other than the weight of the shutter glasses over a 2.5 hour period, I found myself wonderfully immersed in the story and visuals rather than being constantly pulled out of the story by Marx Bros-esque face slapping 3D.Meredith Day - Dreamland 3D","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes it's true ... look it up on the internet!

However , fortunately , in the case of ""dark of the moon"" the writers did their best since the first movie in the franchise to offer a pretty comprehensive and easy to pick up story . It is not something exceptional, but still better than nothing . This time the movie was given a darker and grimmer tone (Bay actually kills people on screen this time around ) , by enhancing the sense of a end-of- the-world , all caps disaster and a full-scale war not lacking in deaths and sacrifices. The film begins with a cool back story lasting around 1 hour until the real action makes its way to the screen . That very hour , being scarce on action and epic battles was surprisingly intriguing for me. I assure you , if you can sit through the first hour you will be on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie . Unlike the first part , the film's last one and a half hours are literally bursting with rousing action , full scale battles that fully delivers on its promises unlike other lacking movies of this very caliber (like X-men First Class for example) . However what i didn't quite like is the fact that during those action set-pieces , the story got totally lost and felt totally nonexistent.Characters , acting - This time around the cast was more ample than before with newcomers like John Malkovich playing Sam's boss , Frances McDromand , Alan Tudyk and others. Shia Labeuf returns as a more mature , determined , but desperate Sam Witwicky . Rosie Huntington Whiteley- now she's a matter of discussion. And NO , I wasn't angry because Megan Fox wasn't in this movie . For her first time on the big screen , Rosie was pretty good and charming , enough to make you forget about megan . John Malkovich , John Turturro, Alan Tudyk and Ken Jeong provided the humoristic component , which by the way was the first in a TF movie where the humor felt at home and not out of place . Particularly , the scene in the Russian bar is worth a billion dollars. The whole overcrowded theatre laughed their *** off ,including me . The Robots - what was wrong with them in the first two movies pretty much remained unchanged here assuming how much I despise those cheesy dialogs between decepticons that were all like "" oh Lord Megatron , this is our greatest plan "" . Quite possible , this was the most frustrating thing in the entire film for me . The autobots on the other hand were surprisingly good and sounded appropriate , fortunately . Vissual and audio effects , soundtrack- Mr. Bay really outdone himself with this one by showing us one the best visual and audio effects since Avatar. One should definitely see this in 3D as this is the visual spectacle we were all waiting for . The film was more dynamic than ever as the intrigue and the stakes were way higher . I can't tell you more about the effects without spoiling parts of the story , but tell you what, I was always on the edge of my seat , my eyes and ears were in heaven while experiencing this . The soundtrack- another masterpiece by Steve Jablonsky , one of my favorite composers , who provided an emphatic , heroic score . Like the previous Transformers score, the cheesy popcorn factor is very high and I wouldn't have it any other way. I won't say that this score is better than the previous scores, but it's definitely up there. If it is the last Transformers score, it ends on a high. Steve Jablonsky, Michael Bay and Transformers are a perfect fit and I really hope they continue their fruitful relationship long into the future.Bottom Line- Overall , Transformers dark of the Moon simply destroys Revenge of the fallen in every aspect and lifts itself to the highs of the first film in the series . If you don't mind seeing an summer action popcorn-flick , this is the perfect choice as your impressions after watching it , especially in 3D will be no other than positive and euphoric . No matter if you're a fan of the series or not , you should see this film . Its not perfect at all(a lot of goofs and plot holes , the story could have been a lot better, the villains are terrible except for sentinel prime) but all in all it ultimately does best what it is meant to do - to entertain.PS: Noticed a plethora of negative reception towards the movie , as from experienced moviegoers as from professional critics. My advice to you : Trust no one and go see this movie if u enjoy such spectacular movies. One can complain about a movie for his/her entire life only to find out , in the end , that this is all he/she can do .","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

That's what sums up this utter piece of crap. I never ever saw a movie this bad in my entire life. Even the superb visual effects couldn't cover up the lack of storyline and well constructed dialogs. Maybe I can say something about the acting skills? Nope. There simply were none. It's really sad, because Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is one of the hottest girls I've ever seen on screen (at least when she doesn't purse her lips trying to look hot).Overall it's a pity Michael Bay was in charge, because I remember the transformers cartoons as having an interesting storyline where you could really connect with the characters. In this movie, I couldn't. Dark of the Moon lacks those same characters. Bay didn't even try to give them personality like the cartoons did. The action was to rapid, the scenes to short to get to know them on a deeper level. And yes, even the action was horrible. As I said, the scenes were really short, jumping from one scene to the next without waiting, without explaining, without giving the watcher something to understand. I still don't know what was behind the dark of the moon... Something really creepy I think. OK, I need to stop dissing this motion picture. The visual effects were at least great.

The acting is OK , nothing to jump about , but way better than the other 2 parts , as the final part in a trilogy this film is perfect. The robots look amazing and the battle scenes are awesome. This film deserves to be watched in cinema and watching it in 3-D is necessary since this is one of those films that needs to be watched in 3-D to be believed. This film is probably one of the best blockbusters to come out this summer and in my opinion is one of the best films of the year. i give it a 9 out of 10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","A complete waste of time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2518444/?ref_=tt_urv","Antagonisten","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0157498/?ref_=tt_urv","14 November 2011","I know that Michael Bay is the king of crap, and in that regard slamming one of his movies for being a jumbled mess is probably pointless. But still, despite myself I enjoyed the first two Transformers-movies. The first more than the second, but the second was alright all things considered. There has always been a mental cramp when it comes to comic-relief and the scripts have always been paper-thin. But something still appealed to me, I guess I could blame my 1980's childhood with a box full of Transformers-toys.First of all, I said before that the scripts were paper-thin for the previous Transformers-movies. Considering that, this movie seems written on a napkin and then added to and subtracted from in a system of loose papers. Then someone dropped the pile of papers and all the pages got mixed up and nothing was where it was supposed to be... But Michael Bay seemed to say ""screw it, we'll just shoot the movie anyway"". If I say that this movie makes no sense, I'm being as kind as I could ever be. Most of the time it's just a confused mess of events piled on top of each other. There is no cohesion at all, there is no plausible connection to the story from the first two movies. I understand that the writers were probably struggling here to find a new approach and create something out of nothing story-wise. But they chose the wrong direction. Completely.Second point, this movie is almost one hour too long. There are so many places where this movie could have been cut, trimmed and polished. It would even have helped with the story because it's such a mess now that you could remove most of it without it really detracting from your understanding.Third point, this movie wastes a few pretty good actors. And no, I don't mean Gray's Anatomy, but rather John Malkovich and Frances McDormand. I think that for them this was a fire-and-forget movie. Just go in there, do the scenes, forget about it and smile when you see your bank-draft. Because people are not the main thing here, the special effects are. There is no room for characters, proper dialog or building good drama. It seems like Bay sat in his directors chair and said ""Oh, these people have been talking for almost a minute, let's have a robot smash through the wall and break something before people fall asleep"".In the end this really is a complete waste of time. Special effects are, just like in the previous movies, very well done indeed. Product placements are very obvious and hugely embarrassing for all involved, especially for the companies that payed to be shown in such a crap movie. I guess if you are twelve years old and have ADD there might be something here for you, but everyone else should just stay away. This is a brainless blockbuster in every wrong way imaginable.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think the two main problems are the weak story line and Rosie. This is of course not a romantic movie but even a pre-schooler would show more passion for her boyfriend and look more convincing than ""Carly"" does for ""Sam"". She is right in the middle of historic and sometimes very dangerous events, yet she sounds and occasionally looks more like she is in a fashion show. Despite Rosie, I think the movie starts pretty nice with the Apollo story and John Malkovich and the visual effects are extremely good throughout the movie but not enough to cover the weaknesses. And for god's sake (and I have two mention that I am not an American), what is a British girl with of course a British accent and quite poor in acting doing in a movie that looks, sounds and feels so American? Rosie's inaptitude for acting made me feel like a bit I am watching a British sci-fi TV show with mediocre visual effects and story line like Dr. Who.

"4","/10","An improvement on the last film but then again the only way was up","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454630/?ref_=tt_urv","lekgolah","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22869412/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2011","Having enjoyed the first film a lot (a good blend of action and comedy), I was greatly disappointed by the second film (too much bad comedy and barely any memorable action scenes) and was concerned how the third would turn out. It seems that Bay reduced some of painfully unfunny comical moments from the last and improves on the action however there are still some moments that take us back to ROTF reminding me that Bay still hasn't learned entirely from his previous mistakes.There's no writer's strike to hind behind this time and Spielberg is back on the team so what stops this from being as good as the first one? The best answer that I can give is that the film feels too chaotic and messy in its storytelling for it to become truly enjoyable. There are some key plot points that are delivered either by crazy robots who are hard to understand or by human characters talking really fast while the camera is focusing on their skin molecules. If you are going to tell a story in a film aimed towards a young audience, speak clearly or as in this case, it turns into someone making a mess of a job interview by speaking too fast in an effort to cover up any holes in their presentation hoping that those listening will not notice. I know that the story isn't really worth worrying about but we deserve to have an understanding of what is going on.Other issues include unnecessarily comedic moments such as Ken Jeong who should have been taken out of the script (but his scenes are pointless so maybe there was no script for him) as that could have allowed for more time to be spent trying to develop the Autobots. Thankfully that character has an abrupt ending that couldn't have come sooner. However the film does achieve at some points in being funny. Perhaps if the film had concentrated on being like the trailer i.e. being darker and focusing on the events at-hand it would have been so much better.Thankfully the film never becomes too offensive unlike the last, making for an enjoyable final act as Chicago is destroyed. Amongst all the chaotic destruction that we have all seen before is an action set-piece set within a collapsing building that we keep you fixed to the screen. It has everything that Bay forgot to do with the rest of the film, which is that there is tension, there is a purpose to the scene, the build-up is great and you are actually concerned for how the characters will escape. If only there were more scenes like this one, which you actually care for!Returning cast members (Shia, Sam's parents who are actually pretty good this time, Josh Duhamel and John Turturro) are all watchable. Meagan Fox's replacement may divide opinion but I found Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to fit in well amongst the rest of the film. John Malkovich is funny at first but his character soon feels more like a cameo. Ken Jeong was horrible to watch and nearly derailed the film. Patrick Dempsey was good at would he did but come the battle he had little to do. Frances McDormand played the cold government agent role well while Alan Tudyk was good but deserved a bigger role. But of-course the film is about the Transformers and the auto-bots in this are all pretty good. Like last time there could have been more of Ratchet and Ironhide but they have their moments. Bumblebee is as good as he was in the first film but I felt the focus had been moved too far away from him and Sam's relationship together which was important in the first film. Optimus still demands the audiences attention every-time you that red and blue truck enter the screen but there is one scene where I found myself questioning his actions but on the whole he was great and Peter Cullen is fantastic as ever.There is something wrong with the villains though this time as they never really seem to be much of a threat as they seem to get taken down pretty quickly. More of an emphasis on the villains strengths and capabilities would have drastically improved the already enjoyable action scene at the end. Sorry guys but the once great Starscream from the first film is gone and we are still left with a sniveling henchman that is embarrassing to watch at times considering he was the one who tore those jets to pieces at the end of the first. Overall this is enjoyable to watch. When it works (collapsing building and car chase scenes) it really works and this also goes for the humour. Sadly the film is not perfect but I doubt anyone was expecting it to be. Once again the trailer promises something else but what we end up receiving is still worth your attention if you enjoyed the either of the last two.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Just wow. If you thought that director Michael Bay was going to take a gentler approach to the third film then be prepared for a surprise. Dark Of The Moon is huge both in action and in the amount of CGI. This time the decepticons have a very transformers-like plan to take over the world. Who stand in their way? Only a small number of autobots and humans. How good is the film? It's somewhere between the first and the second films. It has only two things going for it: the fantastic CGI and the impressive 3D presentation. For a film like this Bay has given up such things as character development, a coherent story or tight direction. Dark Of The Moon is a mess, but not as much as Revenge Of The Fallen. Characters come and go for little or no reason. The humor is awkward, lousy or disgusting. Some scenes are underdeveloped or unnecessary. The acting is bad or passable. The score is loud and generic. The American patriotism is, once again, over the top. A shocker is in store for viewers concerning the American space program. But the worst thing is that Michael Bay still hasn't learned (or decided to ignore) why the transformers cartoons were likable. The transformers themselves were real characters, and they looked different and interesting. In this film it takes some effort to see who's who when they're fighting. Dark Of The Moon is a money-making product at its simplest. It's meant to lure audiences with its predictable combination of humor, action and special effects. It's passable entertainment, but I wouldn't watch it a second time. Like the previous two transformers films Dark Of The Moon is a true product of the Bush era.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you want to see scenes of the actors standing just right, this movie is packed with meaningless shots that look great. The one that put it over the edge was with the replacement to Megan Fox. The new girl was standing there with explosions behind her and a car flipped over. She blinked, but other than that there was nothing. However, from this she moment, we can make the connection that she went on to manipulate Megatron into action, which means she actually saved the day. During a literally explosive situation, this girl did two things: thought up a plan and looked nonchalantly amazing while doing it.Difficult to follow action sequences. The fight sequences were like watching spaghetti get tangled around itself and other noodle in a thick, rich soup of tomato sauce. Putting it in slow motion, ""it"" being punches that blast robots apart or transformations from and to car form, did not make for good entertainment. If you did not get enough slow motion transforming in either of the first two movies, this may be your fix.And, a tired franchise. Belligerent Sam. Boring/cliché jokes.Energon detectors. Autobots doing the dirty work of the US government. Going to the moon only to peep aliens. Sam lands another model grade girl friend.JJ Abrams, Mike Bay, and Jerry Brukhimer, love to take kind of controversial topics and use them as a platform. I cannot wait until one of these guys gets hold of a script about Christopher Columbus just to see how he gets into the minds of pre-teens, high-schoolers, and other impressionable demographics. Maybe they'll think up that Columbus left Europe to flee the zombie hordes only to discover an alien race building hydro electric dams on the bottom of the ocean and enslaving sea horse to carry the electricity on saddles made of silver to power a matter altering camera which would be meant to destroy humanity at a point just before it became to powerful to match, only find out they were too late; the humans were already too powerful because of their will to live, love, endure, and make movies about it.Sam Whitwhicky had something funny about him in the first film. When Megan Fox was in his bedroom in the 1st movie and he had to deal with his parents, that was funny. But he grew quick tempered. His belligerence grew to be pretty excessive by the second movie, and in this one, he would have been tazed by any normal law enforcement agent with a zapper.The over use of mini Autobots as a source of humor is akin to the Star Wars prequels using Jar Jar Binxs as a source of humor. Mildly amusing at first, but not enough to last for parts 2 and 3, for almost 5 hours. And, the minor character jokes get rehashed, too. The fat guy doing donut jokes was funny in the first one, by now all the jokes were forced and weak.ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, sorry to ALL CAP, but this was mostly a nag so far, the brutality was great. I do not like on screen violence, so the humans being evaporated is not what I liked. Rather, it was some of the robot deaths that were pretty good. When you know a bad guy has got it coming and he only bleeds out -- that is not as satisfying as seeing his robot skull being taken apart. Plus, Optimus leveled the boom on some bad guys and the degree that he kicked butt had good ""Wow"" factor.All in all, a less than average movie. What started as a good series should have stopped after number 1 and stayed in the realm of imagination or comic books.

I am not giving Megan Fox props for being a good actress, but I wholeheartedly feel that she is 100% better than Rosie. I have also read plenty of material about how clueless Rosie is. I am under the impression that in an interview, she did not even know who Bumblebee was? WTF is that?

I think I'll start with my one word review - wretched. It's one truly wretched movie. I'm not sure how you spend almost $200 million and make something this bad, but Michael Bay found a way. I usually begin one of these with a plot summary, but with Transformers: Dark of the Moon, I don't see any point. The plot here doesn't really matter. The plot is pointless. It's all about big explosions. And if there's one thing Michael Bay can do, it's make a movie with big explosions. The problem is that without a story I cared 2 cents about, the big explosions get pretty boring pretty fast. At 2 hours 34 minutes and with no interesting story, this thing is like running a marathon in mud. It takes forever. By the time the film's big finale rolled around, I was done. I couldn't take anymore. What a bore! But to be fair, I went back and watched the last part about three times because I kept falling asleep. You would think that any movie that ends with giant robots doing battle would have an ending that would hold your interest. That's not the case here. And if you're going to begin your movie on the moon, why not end it on the moon? We've seen Transformers battle on Earth before, so why not take the final battle back to where it all began? What a missed opportunity. And does Michael Bay believe in editing. There's so much fat here that could have easily been cut out. For example, ss I said when writing about #2, why are Sam's parents even in the film? They add nothing but minutes to the runtime. That's just one example of the many I could cite. And I realize I'm starting to ramble, so I better stop here. I could go on and on about the poor CGI, the bad inside jokes, and the embarrassing treatment of Leonard Nimoy's legacy, but I won't . I don't want to overstay my welcome like Transformers: Dark of the Moon.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Perhaps with the awful yet beautiful performances by said Megan Fox in the first two movies. No, wait I'd rather start with the ""subliminally"" racist autobots introduced in the second installment of this film series. I mean really why would you even include those bots? Anyways, This is supposed to be a review the third ""horror"", I mean film. Simply put, the movie sucked. I argued with my lady friend to go see it and in the end I looked like an idiot.

Unlike most people, this is the first Transformers film I have seen (I don't get out much)and I was impressed by the action (I am easily impressed, due to not going out much). My senses were stirred, rattled and rolled. But I question why the very beautiful Rosie Huntington Whiteley (Carly) was in the film .... she added nothing except a stunning body and big lips, but managed to keep her perfect skin totally unblemished and her white clothes unmarked, in spite of the carnage she was involved in. This girl may be a model, but an actress??? Also, it is impossible at times to know who is the bad guy and the good guy (transformer-wise); they look alike. At times the scenes were a tangle of metal and you hoped that it was the good guy who won; but were not really sure. And why do advanced aliens use bullets (or similar)? Humans can destroy whole cities with one bomb; aliens could do that, or even more. Instead at times they pick off individuals as if they are still in WW1. But in spite of those niggles, still worth seeing the film. As for the choice between 2D or 3D, I saw it in 3D but wanted something to fly out at the audience and make my girlfriend jump .... I was disappointed. But, as to whether it as good in 2D I don't know .... I would have to watch it to make that judgement but now I already know the ending .... and anyway, not sure when I will next go out.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is just nothing in it to recommend it to cinema-goers. Obviously shed-loads of money have been thrown at it but they forgot to make it good. It might have been better had the actors been any good but it is hard to say that anyone did a good job of their contribution to this mindless trash. I suppose the special effects and CGI are fairly well done but that is just not enough to make it entertaining to the viewer. A movie has to involve its audience rather than have them checking their watches every five minutes. I think I lost interest in it before the title of the movie appeared on the screen and it just got worse. I am really astonished that the target audience (12-22?) is willing to put up with this - better sci-fi movies have been made with a fraction of the budget and a lot less effort. Perhaps they do so well with these movies because their audience manages to still have hope over their experience. So sad to witness actors of the calibre of Malkovich getting involved in this crap.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Flash years later and I found it for cheap with the fourth Transformers film so I thought I would get it as I had seen neither film. I really enjoyed the first film and I thought the second film had its moments. A lot of people had told me that this one was a better film than the second one so imagine my surprise as I found it worse...a lot worse! I literally have to scratch my head as the first film had such potential and had the makings of an awesome franchise. The second one was not great as it was too long, but the action was cool and I liked how Optimus Prime was the one to take out the bad guys instead of Shia's character Sam. This one though just was bad. When I watch a film based on Transformers I expect a film where the Autobots must do battle with the dastardly Decepticons. I do not watch it to see an advertisement for the military and see Sam get another really hot chick on the heels of the last one. I also do not watch this film to see humans perform stunts while showing the minimum amount of robot fighting it can show. It is almost as if they have a limit of a few seconds before they have to flash to more human action! The story, well it is rather a incomprehensible mess. We see that the moon landing back in the day was actually a way to examine a mysterious ship crashing onto our planet. Flash years later and we get to see Sam's latest girl's butt. We also get to see a man who has no business with her whining about not having a job and not feeling important because he saved the world so he deserves more. The humor is worse than the second film and the scenes of him interviewing are not fit for an action film. Once again, I want to see robots, not filler garbage. The film ran 2 hours and 20 minutes and they want to show a bunch of nonsensical crap. It adds nothing to the plot and is just a way to have humans relevant in a story they should not be relevant in. Meanwhile, the Autobots are doing missions for us and keeping a lookout for the Decepticons and there is something that ties in with that moon landing that may turn out to be a deadly secret and there is a boss who has nice cars and John Malkovich in a very bizarre role that makes as much sense as the rest of the film and an even more awkward scene with Sam and some guy in a bathroom stall. We get a battle at the end with the Autobots against some very nondescript Decepticons which makes me wonder if they even try. The only Decepticon that stood out was Shockwave who was sadly underused as he actually looked cool and Megatron was almost not relevant.So the Transformer films seem to get progressively worse as they continue. I am finding part of the problem is that Bay wants to focus too much on the humans. Shia was insufferable in this one and I wanted to see him less not more. I did not want to see a guy who I could beat down in a fight in less than two minutes taking down a Transformer. The guy and his gal survive some stuff in this one that makes the old Indiana Jones action scenes seem less ridiculous. I also cannot stand the way the Transformers keep getting less distinct as the series goes on. I didn't even recognize Megatron at first glance and why is it so difficult to give him his trademark bazooka gun? Why do they keep using swords and stuff? Never did that much in the comics or cartoon. Why can't Optimus have his awesome gun and have it sound the same way it did in the cartoons? So this one just was not enjoyable for me at all. I did not want to see humans versus robots, but rather Autobots versus Decepticons. That last portion in Chicago was just one long bore as you get to watch people paragliding, people in collapsing building and then you see Optimus and think, ""Oh boy, now the action begins!"" and he promptly gets caught in wires. Just does not make any sense, nor does the series. Lets have little cute annoying robots because the film is enjoyed by kids, but the first time we see Shia he you get to see his girlfriend's butt. I honestly do not see how this one did so well at the box office, it was just a mess with a overly complicated story to get humans more involved. In the cartoon, the Decepticons wanted energy from Earth and the Autobots tried to stop them, that's it! Oh, and during their movie they had a huge planet that transformed! Heaven forbid they do that. Speaking of that 1986 film, it was a way to introduce kids to a new line of toys, so I find it sad that it had a better story and better action than this film! Going to watch the fourth film as I got it as part of the set, but I do not have high hopes for it; however, at least Shia will not be in it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And Just like Hitchcock, he gets a little over-ambitious sometimes.In this very ambitious third installment of the Transformers Saga, Bay literally ""Reaches for the Moon"" - Someone else commented that this film is riddled with clichés, but I say the clichés are turned on their ear. This film starts out with Documentary style filming, combining ""News Footage"" scenes with ""Live-Action"", first-person footage (If you can call the CGI here, which is very photorealistic, ""Live Action""). The inclusion of real-life footage of Kennedy mixed with a pretty convincing lookalike filmed in Black and White Video style *almost* had me believing that it was really Kennedy in all of the scenes- ""Almost"" - Because the final cameo of ""Kennedy"" has a different angle, and in colour, and at that point, the differences are apparent with the lookalike actor.Although the story told here does not quite match the story that has been told in the first two films, it is still a very good story: ""Down in Flames"" - Bay cannot now back up and make any new Transformers films, he has destroyed his world, literally. And so I am expecting that, this film is the last film of the Franchise, if more Transformers films are made, some serious ""Rebooting"" will have to be done.This film loses ""Mikaela Banes"" (Megan Fox) and 'gains' ""Carly Spencer"" (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) - Which from the start is a total loss, as the ""Mikeala"" character had been developed from the beginning, this ""new chick"" is dumped on us and we are supposed to believe that Whitwhickey has developed a relationship that rivals his earlier association with Ms Fox. No - It does not work, and Sam Whitwhickey's puerile salivatings and palpitations and teenage jealousy rages are just not believable, the character Carly is simply not believable, she's a card-bored cutout. As a real actress and woman and most importantly high-style Fashion Model, she works VERY well, I believe THAT. But in this film, I do not believe HER. Mikaela, on the other hand, was shown as a talented and gifted Mechanic- That I believed.So from the moment Spencer walks up the steps in first-time reveal, on tip-toe even, the average viewer might go ""Oh Come On"" with in-credulousness... Incredibility? Disbelief maybe. Personally, I DO NOT believe that a chick like that would ever be interested in pimply-faced Shia Lebouf. But I can suspend that a bit cos of *my* ex gf'sSo with my only spoiler of this review over with, I can get into the way this film looks, mostly happening in ""Washington DC"" and ""Chicago"" -And on the Dark Side of the Moon, I believed THIS. The first time we see an Autobot, one of the little guys, I'm still not sure what they were called, and then later as we see the Autobots on various missions, the transformations are better, the overall look of the Autobots are better, the CGI is very very good... This is why I gave this film a ""9"" - It would have been a ""10"" if not for the female-lead change.Excellent performances here from John Turturro, Frances McDormand, ""General Glenn Morshower"" (Who I think lately is always a character named Morshower in his latest films), Alan Tudyk, John Malkovich, and even Shia LaBeouf - Plus the return of Tyrese Gibson as ""Epps"" which makes this his reunion with ""Lennox"" (Josh Duhamel), makes this a great ""Mega-Ensemble"" cast. And Leonard Nimoy who just had to be given lines referring to things Spock said in ""Star Treck"" - That was another mistake, but mostly he plays his character well, as do all of the Autobots and Decepticons.This film is just too overwhelming. There is no relief, no space to relax, this film is a juggernaut- It plows over you. Some of the editing is confusing, mostly it adds to the very rapid pace of the film. (And I have said this before and will probably say it again}: Too Much ""Future Shock"" - Enough to kill 1,000,000 Alvin Tofflers.But despite the changes in female lead and other small inconveniences, this film is a warp-15 thrill ride, I was wholly exhausted after watching it, especially the final ⅓rd of the film. For those who like massive mechanical destruction on a scale that makes Brobdingnagian look like Microscopic, insane stunts that no human could possibly perform (but they did), well then this is for you.It's just Mindless Entertainment, insanity on a galactic scale, and the warping of not only time and space, but of our minds as well. Michael Bay has come a very very long way, parsecs, light years, from ""Bad Boys"".","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

That being said, this movie is a VERY close second to the first movie. The biggest improvements in this movie from ""Revenge"" are the removal of Skids and Mudflap, and the fight scenes are a lot more recognizable. What I mean by that is I felt like in ""Revenge"" when Prime would fight it was hard to tell who was who and which blade went where, etc. But in ""Dark"" they do a tremendous job in slowing the action down so you can get every aspect of where the punch lands or where the blade slices. I was a bit worried when the film started and a couple of the first Transformers we see are the ""pet"" robots that Sam owns. But, Bay (much like Lucas did with Jar Jar in Revenge of the Sith) keeps their scenes to a minimum and near the end of the movie they actually have some pretty funny scenes.Acting overall was good. The actress they got to replace Megan Fox did an OK job. She should stick to her day job, but her acting didn't take away from the excitement of the film in anyway. Shia LaBouf did a good job, once again, as Sam. John Tutoro was back as the leader of Sector 7 again, and I though his performance, along with his new parter, were very good as well. Bringing in some veterans like John Malkovich and Frances MacDormand was a good pull by Bay as well. I liked both of their performances and thought they fit their roles well. Malkovich could've held back on the fake NY accent, but again, it didn't take away from the film in anyway.I grew up watching the Transformers cartoon of the 80's so I consider myself a fan. I'm not a fanatic and didn't really follow them into comic book land or watch the recent animated series. I know some super-fans have been disappointed by these films, but if you're looking for a fun summer movie, with REALLY great action, and sequences that are simply exciting to watch, check out this movie. If you get the chance to see it in IMAX 3D, do take advantage of that as well. The explosions are pretty eye-opening in 3D and the IMAX just makes everything more exciting.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I never understood how a franchise that's making so cool trailers can possibly be bad. I had even watched the first two movies and liked them more than the average ratings. Dark of the Moon, however, answered my question. Little did we know that this was the part where the eventual downfall of the franchise will begin. And trust me when I say this, I really wanted to like this movie. Only if the pesky humans gave me a chance to do so.The movie, once again, starts with Autobots saving the world from Decepticons. But then one of them gets caught by the bad guys. To be honest this, THIS is the very problem of the movie. We have come to watch Transformers for the big CGI fights, not to see the conflicts of humans and robots. Because I believe I'm speaking on behalf of all the people when I say this, but if there's ever a conflict between humans and Autobots, we will any day prefer the Autobots, even if they are wrong.The CGI of this movie is amazing. This is one thing Michael Bay is really good at (other than the explosions of course). I really like to watch the Transformers turn into sports cars and drive across long distances all the while fighting the Decepticons. The thing is, however, it's literally the only reason why I watch Michael Bay's Transformers movies. I don't watch it to see how Sam enters the gents restroom and someone else who comes in thinks he's in a cubicle having sex with another man. Nor am I interested in seeing Sam's parents trying to be funny because let's get real, they're not.The acting of this movie is also terrible. Though I'd give it some extra points for completing Sam's arc, I'd also deduct some points for not showing Mikaela. She was the only human character I was interested in looking at ^_^. Even the Transformers act in a very campy manner. The villain of this movie looks like a discount version of The Fallen. And as usual the fight later shifts to Optimus Prime and Megatron, making the villain, once again, completely useless.There's not a single thing for which I'd want to rewatch this movie. It only stands among a sloppy series, plus it's the part where the franchise starts failing until Bumblebee came to rescue, so there's absolutely no reason to watch it. It's so forgettable I had to watch Honest Trailers and Cinemasins just to remember what happened in it. And even then I couldn't remember half the things.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Enough is enough just sit back and enjoy the dang movie already. Transformers Dark of the Moon is a great action film that will get all those people sitting in the crowd going crazy in their seats with all the explosions and battle scenes. For those saying that the story line sucks let me tell you that its not the story line that sucks because it is perfectly fine, its yourselves believing you have such a superior mind that is making the films storyline not work out. This seems to happen with all movies regarding things that use real events in history as a back story for a film with supernatural things in them. You all have to be like the X-files and just BELIEVE. Stop telling yourselves thats not possible or thats stupid and could never happen and instead begin asking yourselves what if... or that would be pretty neat if that actually did exist. Now I'm not going to lie this movie wasn't perfect but the reviews I have seen on the last 10 or so pages and from real critics are just way too negative and are not letting the film get the chance it deserves. Overall 8.5 out of 10 and no that is not being generous that is being truthful.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This third movie has moved little past its cartoon predecessors, adding only modern computer graphics in excess to such point, that sequences become a blurred mass of pixels.In retrospective, I really loved the initial 10 minutes of the movie.. after that, it rather chokes the viewer hoping to draw away attention from the poor script and failing ability to create truly captivating personas.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yes, the transformations and effects and most of the Chicago battles are spectacular (not the janky JFK) but after nearly three hours the fatigue is real. There are some surprising horror moments with the bird thing, some great actors doing some bonkers ad-lib by the look of it, and there's an orgy of creatively mad ideas, like integrating NASA space program and going to Chernobyl, and some great practical effects.
But overall, the editing and pacing is epileptic and lurching like a kangarooing car. The 3D varies but the spottiness, lack of consistency and disregard for 3D framing makes it almost negligible if not the for the utterly bright, crisp photography unhindered completely by 3D.

U all complained about the second one having too many random action scenes without enough plot or background (where did that robot come from?), and wanted it more centered around the characters. NOW U ALL SAY ITS TOO CENTERED ON THE CHARACTERS AND NOT THE ROBOTS. hypocritical morons. If you liked the first and second movies, then see the third, and don't believe all the h8r's bashing this movie giving it one star. ITS ABOUT AS GOOD AS REVENGE OF THE FALLEN. Its worse in the fact that Sentinal Prime wasn't as memorable as Fallen prime (he was really cool at the end of the second) but better in the fact that you didn't have the annoying beat bots. This one was much more centered on the people (as stated above), with Megatron being on screen for all of ten minutes, with one scene with him talking to Starscream (my personal fav), which kinda irritated me, but whatever. I would say if revenge of the fallen was 8 outa 10, this would be like a 7.8. Still highly watchable, if you base that on a mike bay film, which always have over the top action, without being totally unrealistic (a la shoot em up, or transporter), with a decent script for an action film. One of the autobots was also a Maybach, which are like THE most expensive cars in the world, so that was pretty cool.See it if you enjoyed the first two, and forget about all the trolls posting one star reviews on this site.And whoever had the review calling this film 'worse than the holocaust', do us all a favor and go lie down in the street.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This sums up Transformers 3 in a nutshell and fans of the series wouldn't have it any other way.If your looking for a movie with an in depth story and interesting, well developed characters then this is not the movie for you but if your looking a summer blockbusters full of mind boggling action then grab Bumblebee and take him for a drive down to your nearest cinema.However, compared to the previous instalments the story is more developed, with Shia Labeouf and the new love interest Rosie Huntington- Whiteley both providing a decent backdrop to the action. There are a few twists but they are easy to see coming and you certainly wont be remembering the movie for the story. On the whole, the story is the best in the series but this wasn't difficult to accomplish, but the real reason you see Transformers is for the action which doesn't disappoint.Just like the previous entries, Michael Bay has directed a movie with special effects so extraordinary that your eyes will be glued to the screen and the hairs standing on the back of your neck. As you would expect, the action in this movie surpasses the previous films which is evident in a skyscraper scene which is just spectacular. The transformer sound effects sound recycled from before but the music which plays during some of the action scenes is very impressive and adds to the movie as a whole.There are only two things that disappointed me, and considering there were an issue in the previous two films it is disappointing to see them persist. As mentioned the story is decent but I would still like to see it developed. Secondly, with so much action on the screen it becomes difficult to work out who is actually fighting each other which can become as issue in the latter parts of the movie but these two issues don't detract from the spectacle.Lets just get this out of the way, if your wanting a deep story in your films then avoid this movie. For everyone else, this is a must see just for the action alone. If this really is the last in the series then its a fitting conclusion to a ground breaking trilogy, and if not then the next director has got one hell of a job to improve the action, but not the story.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie is much better than that boring Godfather movie than my daddy loves! I mean what!!! Why would you like such a slow boring movie that doesn't have explosions?! I might sound nerdy but here goes, I will prove the fact that this movie is so amazing!! Also I will tell you about how Transformers is cool and Ninja Turtles is evil!!!First of all, the ACTING! Very very good acting! The Chinese man was so funny (my daddy says he's Korean but he's stupid because he likes The Godfather!) but at the same time very realistic (woops what a big word) and Sheeya LaBeef (woops what a silly name) was incredible and showed how scary and dangerous it would be if robots came and started destroying everything! And his girlfriend was very good too! She showed how hot and sexy a girl would be if she was only wearing undies!!!Second of all, the STORY! The story was so complex and smart, also not very long and understandable (woops, sorry guys I'm very good at English because I got a B+) so after the movie I ended I felt sad because the best movie ever was over! So much cool action! Like the big spaceship and explosion and the big octopus robot that was killing the big building! Yeah some parts of the story was boring like the parts where it showed us what was gonna happen next! I mean come on! Focus on the special effects cause that's what makes the stories and the ideas in the movies work! Stories are about EXPLOSIONS! And The Godfather did not have explosions! And I'm pretty sure because I haven't seen The Godfather but it looks boring and boring movies don't have EXPLOSIONS!Third of all, the ROBOTS! Wow the robots are so cool and I want one and so does my brother! The robots are so cool like Bumblebee I love Bumblebee I have a Bumblebee toy but I was playing with it in the toilet because he was going on a mission to the sewers to defeat the ninja turtles and so I flushed the toilet! But Bumblebee never came back! This is why I hate the Ninja Turtles! They killed Bumblebee! And Bumblebee was cool!Anyways even though there is war and hungry people in the world it doesn't matter because this very good movie taught us that the Transformers will come and save us one day! I'm looking forward to that day! They're coming aren't they? In fact I'm going to ask Mr. Jenkins, my science teacher! He's the smartest man in the world!But good bye everyone! Hope you have fun reading my review of the greatest movie ever and I hope you do not watch boring Godfather!!!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Transformers Make millions for the same.If they didn't and these movies, or Bay did suck. They wouldn't be making them still.If you think the 3D or special effects in this movie are crap, or even just alright. You should lose all credibility to reviewing movies. I know 3D. I know special effects. And this is TOP NOTCH. That alone is worth the price of the ticket.Shia Lebouf. is great. I said it when he was a kid. I said the same thing about Cristian Bale when he was a kid. You can see the talent.Shia if your reading this. You keep doing what your doing. And I think your timing is incredible. I had such a good time at this movie. I think the last time I had this much fun watching a good old fashion, nothing too deep, action summer blockbuster, was a long time ago.The last time I had this much ACTION fun was probably LIVE FREE DIE HARD.Maybe a little long. Not too much. Story was I thought the best out of the three. Funny. I really got into it. Maybe cause the critics bashed it. And maybe cause I'm not a huge fan. Or I found the second one very long, and needed a different pace to the edit.I picked up on some interesting little SPOCK Pop Culture a few times through the movie also.I'm not into spoiling movies. But if you want some Summer fun. Eye candy at it's best! Transformers 3 is the ticket.If you were expecting Clock Work Orange, or No Country for Old Men. You shouldn't complain about what your walking into, or writing bashing reviews with this film. If you think were going to have another STAR WARS, JAWS, or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS type of Summer Fun movie come around this lifetime. I don't think that will happen. It's about talking robots that turn into vehicles. A kids toy. An old cartoon. They made a movie. And for that this third instalment in my opinion. Was FUN! Lighten up!Cause frankly there's a lot of disappointment when it comes to highly anticipated summer blockbusters.Great Job to the cast and crew. Thanks for the memories of SUMMER fun from days gone.What do you want.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The second movie was a disappointment to what the first movie accomplished and left a bad taste in the mouths of fans and critics alike. Now we are introduced to the third and final film that tries to reset the bar set by the original and send Transformers off in an applause. From the middle to end this movie reaches the sheer adrenaline that was presented to the audience in the series opener. Delivering more action and story then the both films, but the major issues associated this with film is the running time is stretched a little and a lot of dry, unfunny humor. Those few hiccups may be a problem, but the last hour of amazing robot vs. robot action will distract from those flaws a bit. Plus the added 3D is a nice touch to the film and is one of the best incorporated 3D I have seen in a movie. Transformers 3 was not a great film by any means, but best one of the series and a great summer flick where you can sit back and enjoy all the action this movie has to offer. Michael Bay is not the greatest director, but is the best in crafting some of the best action sequences ever displayed on a movie screen and does his best work in this movie. He has to be given a lot of credit at what he does best and never fails to raise the level of action in each one of the Robot movies, despite the lack there of story and acting. He knows his weakness as a director and knows how to outshine it with his craft, making his movies enjoyable to watchable. In saying all those things, the story that follows Shia Labeouf character use to symbolize an anchor in the sense that it ways down the film, never letting it reach its potential. It was redundant at times to watch him and his gang of pointless cast members running across the screen, screaming, making bad jokes and doing nothing but serve as a human connection for the audience to relate to. Rosie Whiteley, who is a far better actor than Megan Fox and more charming, was a great plus to the Transformers story. Also new comers John Malkovich and Ken Jong are meaningless, replaceable actors that are placed in the film to be a comic relief that never gets there. The human cast that succeeds in making their presence be felt are Patrick Dempsey and Frances McDormand who were incredible to watch in this film and display the best acting out of the cast. They fit in perfect and brings a certain edge and seriousness to the film. I'm going out on a limb here and say that the thing that makes this a good film are the robots. Their acting has never been showcased in the movies and never given enough screen time to understand them better, but Bay must have realize that and given them more depth. They display better performances than their human counterparts and give the audience what we have been yearning for since the begin and that's more connection to them. I mean beside them having more depth, they have a lot of nice eye dazzling scenes and just grabs the enter child in you. This apocalyptic movie tone is way darker than its predecessors and pushes the boundary of a PG- 13 movie. The Transformers trilogy as a whole if not one of the greatest cinema has seen, but on the perspective of action films, it has set the bar high for action films in the future. Transformer 3, while a flawed movie at times sends the Robot series out in style and is one best sequel by far in the summer non worthy sequels.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is the third of a terrible trilogy of tumbling crashing metal. Hopefully it's the last. People how could you make this a billion dollar movie? It's just too brain dead. The only good thing : the battle in Chicago and the destruction in the city involves some amazing filming. But the robots all look alike and it's too long and confusing. A little less confusing than in the past. Michael Bay has always been about visuals and not story and dialog. This is no exception. Bad the worst thing is the casting. Rose Huntington Whitley just isn't beautiful. She is tall and slim but her face is way below average - actually quite frightful and her acting isn't good. Her diction is poor for a British actress too. Huge mistake replacing Megan Fox who was the only good thing about the last 2 movies. Patrick Dempsey isn't right as a villain he comes across as he always does - a weak good guy. Frances McDormand is usually such a good actress but even she can't do anything with the silly lines she is given.

This film was fantastic entertainment! You should go home liking this film and you should love it in 3D. The film is no Shawshank Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator etc (my favourite films along with four lions :P) but is just as entertaining. If you are one of those fussy film watchers that critics everything then this is not for you.In conclusion, this is a very entertaining film, flooded with action. The story line wasn't greatest but was still a good film! You must see this is 3D, well worth the extra money unlike other films. I cannot state how much more you will enjoy this in 3D!If not in 3D it may not be so great. Im giving this a solid 8/10, thought i'd give this movie some much deserved support and was entertained!

"","","The sequel that 'Revenge of the Fallen' should have been","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2455301/?ref_=tt_urv","ced_yuen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2784057/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2011","""Transformers, robots in disguise! Autobots wage their battle to destroy the evil forces of the Decepticons"". Simple lyrics, from the theme-tune of the 1980s cartoon, outline what 'Transformers' is all about: the simplicity of good versus evil, combined with the novelty of shape-shifting robots.The key problem with the sequel, 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen', was its attempt at 'humour', which took attention away from the robots' story. The film became defined by bad decisions. Offensive stereotypes, irritating characters, robot testicles – there wasn't much room left for good and evil.Hope, however, is not lost. With 'Transformers 3', director Michael Bay demonstrates that, to an extent, he is able to learn. 'Dark Of The Moon' is far from perfect, but it does redeem many past mistakes.This instalment begins in the 1960s, when a Cybertronian spaceship crash-lands on the Moon. The US government quickly launches their space program to cover things up. Fast- forward to today, and it transpires that the vessel contains *Important Things*, which the Autobots must recover before the Decepticons do so. As usual, humans are caught up in the ensuing destruction.Much effort has gone into making the robots' war relevant to humans. The destruction at the end of the first 'Transformers' had little impact on its sequel. Now, there are consequences. Autobots must follow military rules and procedures. Cities have sensors to detect Decepticon presence.Transformers now occupy the background of little-known historical events such as the moon landing and Chernobyl – a simple but inspired move. Finally, the Cybertronians seem more like a civilisation than a handful of characters. It feels as though the fate of man is tied to the alien war, giving the film a sense of threat sorely lacking in earlier outings. The Decepticons are now far nastier. The scenes of collateral damage in the first 'Transformers' had a slapstick quality, but this time the approach is brutal. People die on- screen - the camera follows as people plummet off skyscrapers.The action is much more coherent. The fights, previously a series of tumbling metallic blurs, have been replaced by specific choreography. Bumblebee, for example, seems to have picked up Taekwondo. The clarity of the action allows for some truly stunning set pieces.The improvements, which could have made this the strongest entry in the trilogy, are undermined by a few persisting issues. The racial stereotypes remain. There is a very strange Chinese character called Wang; an English-sounding Autobot calls people ""old chap""; a Scottish-sounding one threatens to ""bottle"" an enemy. These are not offensive so much as they are painfully unfunny.The unnecessary, overpowering minor characters remain. Sam's (Shia LaBoeuf) parents return, sucking life out of every scene they occupy. Sam's boss, played with crazed zeal by John Malkovich, is nonetheless pointless. Supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley performs acceptably as Megan Fox's replacement token eye-candy, but the fact remains that the romance side-story is a waste of time - time that could be better used.Despite a steady introduction, the middle is rushed to accommodate an overly long and busy third act. Bay, no doubt, felt indebted to his military contacts - there are far too many shots of soldiers getting into position. The action can be spectacular, but the truly impressive scenes are diluted with an overabundance of activity.Overall, 'Transformers: Dark Of The Moon' is a success. It is inexcusable for the same issues to keep reappearing, but these are outweighed by numerous improvements that this entry brings. Those who didn't like the first film will have no reason to see this follow-up. For those who did, this is the sequel that 'Revenge Of The Fallen' should have been.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Michael Bay directs, and he and his buddy, Steven Spielberg, are executive producers, so kids or kid-like fun dominates.It's a CGI smörgåsbord impressive for its volume alone. Almost every frame is full of metal parts that burrow, blow up, or just jabber. Although Bay is clearly having a ball, when he gets down to toppling a big building in venerable Chicago (the echoes of 9/11 are sobering), it's almost serious filmmaking: Awe overtakes humor, which has its own part in summer fluffy fare.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and girlfriend Carly Miller (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley--foxy but no Megan Fox) are primary civilians to stop the Decepticons from conquering the earth. Earthlings are in the process of banishing the Autobots, who have been faithful allies. It's all pretty hazy to me, so I'll stop here with the plot and return to the visual, where Bay puts all his effort.The re-creation of downtown Chicago, with the Wrigley Building taking center stage, is as good as the London of Cars 2. In fact, just seeing street signs such as ""Wacker"" gains immediate sympathy from the natives and travelers in the audience. Transformers is another version of special-effects porn at which our American filmmakers are so adept.The effect least impressive for me is 3-D, an ubiquitous bother that is finally on the wane as admission prices rise and consumer enthusiasm wanes. The drain of light, making a dull screen image, can be mitigated if theaters were willing to pay extra for bulbs that burn out quickly. I am left to hope for deliverance from this annoying sideshow except in the case of the documentary Cave of Dreams, in which appreciating 30,000-year old cave paintings is enhanced. Although Bay does an adequate exploitation of the process for romping around the summer screen with thin fare, 2-D is just fine for me, thank you. However, at two and one half hours, he is a magician who keeps the kiddies in their seats. Or maybe it's Huntington-Whiteley substituting for Fox. Anyway, the visuals are the stars.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I loved this move, and so did most of the movie goers out there, who spend their money to be entertained. Don't believe me? Look back over the past ten years to see what the public has been watching. It's all been moving towards ENTERTAINMENT, not human stories, not higher art, not big name actors.This was a thoroughly entertaining movie. If you love action and adventure, you should see it. Rates up there with Ironman 1 and 2, Aliens, Star Wars, etc. You get the picture. (No pun intended)GO SEE IT ALREADY.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you want every film you watch, to have in-depth development of realistic characters dealing with emotional themes, or to have the intro, mid and final sequence to be in accordance with your idea of 'film-making' and not the director's, or to judge the director's work based on prejudices from previous works, or to have an impeccable storytelling, script, narrative, plot, dialogue, timings, chemistry between the lead roles, cinematography, and the likes, you're better of staying the f...(far) out of here. Go watch something else, there's close to 2 million titles in this website's database so you (and your pet, or whoever you live with) can have a wonderful life researching titles that match your theoretical frameworks to study social phenomena in a particular school of thought or to match your deep philosophical needs, so that then you can climax away. This isn't what you're looking for, specially if you are explosion, adrenaline and testosterone intolerant.To the rest of us, the mundane, the ordinary people, who enjoy a no-brainer, a popcorn flick, and who are not in their crisis-something years, who enjoy a summer flick for what it is, and not for what we'd want it to be (maybe as a substitute for our imperfect lives), I'd like to say if you want to watch a good movie with great visuals and intense action sequences, then this film will do you just fine. For the men out there (and perhaps some ladies?), there is also some eye-candy. Let me put it this way, it is called eye-candy for a reason; do we really care if she lacks charisma?, or do we care if there's no chemistry between her and the lead man?, or do we care if ""she's be better off in underwear commercials""? I certainly don't care. I you, for some reason do care about that, then you're one of the aforementioned individuals and my advice is to get the f...(friendly) out of here. This movie is worth your money and time, and furthermore I'd go ahead and tell you that afterward you won't feel disappointed that we didn't achieve world piece or we didn't discover the origin of the universe. Just go in with an open mind, and it will not be a let down.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was most impressed by the way history was so eloquently woven into the story, some Forest Gump-like effects were at work, but well done just the same. I have to say that the Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeof) transformation was just as noteworthy as that of the hasbro characters, he has grown up in this role and wears manhood well. He now has a new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whitely), who I have absolutely nothing against it just felt like the final matrix when the Oracle was replaced. There were some lines to explain the new girl, and maybe that did it for everyone else, but I missed and prefer Mikeala (Megan Fox). And that's as much as I will say about that. There were some new characters added to the list of humans and to the Transformers, most noteworthy on the human side was Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who was a complete surprise, even with a luminescent smile and an extremely well groomed exterior he was so unlikeable. I liked the fact that this time around a woman was running things, Mearing (Frances McDormand), I did not like the fact that she was so inept at it. Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) was a cool addition to the Transformers as the former Autobot leader now resurrected. I wondered which came first the homage to Star Trek and then he was cast or if Nimoy was cast and that prompted the homage. This film had some of the best CGI imaginable, but where the special effects were concerned they actually paled to the flying squirrel scenes, those were awesome! There were a lot of exceptional autobot versus decepticon fight scenes, and I must say that Battle: Chicago, was so much better than Battle: LA. All I want to know is when will D-Town get its turn at being digitally pulverized. Our metroplex has some great landmarks that can be torn apart, like the Electric Moon, the rocket shaped building, the green lined building, the AA center and certainly the Cowboys stadium. I want to be able to sit in the theater and say, I was at a game there or I ate there or I used to work there. Since no more Transformers are on the horizon, maybe Dallas will get its turn when giant mutant armadillos roll in. For the fantastic CGI and the fact that you have to see the full set, Transformers gets a green light.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even if you thought the action could never top the intensity or breadth of the first two films, ""DotM"" finally cuts to the chase and brings us all-out carnage! It's pretty darn awesome watching the transformers duke it out in foreign lands and on the highways (in a scene which could possibly surpass the highway chase scene in the first movie), but the last hour or so is entirely devoted to a massive invasion where robots and ships are literally tearing the city up and brutally massacring each other. The ruined cityscapes are about as imaginative and artistic as what we see in the ""Crysis 2"" video game; the intensity and the stakes are about as high as what we see in a ""Terminator"" movie; the action is easily the best of the series. And with strong storytelling and cinematography, ""DotM"" easily bests most other alien invasion movies (especially following the releases of ""Skyline"" and ""Battle: LA,"" both of which were rather disappointing).This movie may be overshadowed by the weaknesses of ""Revenge of the Fallen,"" but rest assured that the story for ""DotM"" is fleshed out way better. The conspiracies that are unveiled are quite sublimely integrated, and seeing them unravel feels like a refreshing revelation. The climax works very well to tie up the events of the first two films, and ultimately I feel that this movie incorporates a number of elements that may have been lost in the last film (namely, the ideas that the transformers are covert, the ideas that they are fighting for their way of life, and most importantly, the idea that they are fighting for freedom). As far as the human element goes, the story takes the franchise's hero to his next logical step; all of this drama might test your patience a little (especially with so much hit-or-miss humor), but it all contributes to the amazing finale.Cinematically, ""DotM"" shows excellent photography and editing; the shots are indeed prolonged and evenly-paced, allowing you to see the action much more leisurely than the last two hectic movies. The film has its share of wonderful scenery, but it feels rather drab and grim overall (which helps add a sense of doom and gloom; parts of this movie are rather scary). Acting is a mixed bag once again; Shia LaBeouf continues to be himself, for better or for worse. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has a few weak moments, but I felt she was an ample replacement for Megan Fox. Patrick Dempsey is convincing as a jerk. Ken Jeong's role was pretty darn wild, for better or for worse. John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, and Tyrese Gibson all return and are still great; Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Alan Tudyk are interesting additions. And of course, Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, and Leonard Nimoy are superb in their voice acting. Aside from using my least-favorite Linkin Park song, the music is great.I'm not sure at this point if I'd rank this over the first film or not. But at the very least, I'd put them on the same level, and in time I'll see which one I value the most.Casually recommended! 4.5/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4/5)","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And the actors are not that good, mostly because their characters are more shallow than an empty oyster. Now, the adding of John Malkovich was a plus to the cast and the entry of Rosie Huntington Whiteley is more than welcome because, despite this being is first time as an actress in the big screen, she showed more acting maturity than Megan Fox.Recently Michael Bay open the door to a new Transformers movie, possibly a new trilogy (let's hope so because i'm tired seeing Megatron dying and being resurrected only for more humiliation and death);now the important here, new story with a new enemy or sequel, is how things will be made, how the story will be told. Because if it's to follow the same premises than it's predecessors, what's good in making 4, 10, 100 Transormers movies when we know at the beginning how things will go and how it will end? If a new movie is on the go, i think it's time for a chance? Do you?","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

As incoherent as the plot may be, the metal-mania on the other end, is a spectacle of cataclysmic proportions. Acting in this film must be more difficult for the actors themselves, rather than for the audience to see them but it isn't about them. It never really was. When Michael Bay brought the alien robot race to Planet Earth, it was made very clear that it's always going to be about them. Thus, you will be made to watch this T:3 through the eyes of the Decepticons to whom, humans don't matter. So shall be your approach while watching the absolute Bay-hem that dominates the movie's tedious 157 minute length. Only then, will you have a blast....Following the likes of George Lucas and Wachowski Brothers, Bay ventures forth with his indulgent film-making with some of the best artists around who aid the rendering of his metallic vision with gargantuan destruction being the enthralling lure for devotees, much to the shame of critics who shunned them on every new venture but couldn't stop their movie installments from making billions. These films are beyond critics. The sheer scale of their production and presentation warrants a mandatory viewing regardless of their critique for one doesn't chase their substance but their astounding visual effects that make it all larger- than-life. Apollo 11, USA's maiden voyage to set a man on the moon, has been a cover-up to the discovery of an Autobot ship's wreckage that escaped the last battle on Cybertron. For over 40 years, humans and Autobots alike, have been kept in the dark about the dark side of the moon. Optimus Prime uncovers the conspiracy on a mission in Chernobyl where he discovers familiar parts to be used for teleportation by Autobots. After convincing the bossy head of the secret Government agency, Optimus flies to the moon to bring home Sentinel Prime, deactivated in the ship's wreckage. With the matrix, he brings Sentinel to life and along with him the apocalypse that had been planned all this while, by the Decepticons. A jobless Sam (Shia LaBeouf), in desperate search for credit, is suspicious of his new girlfriend's boss but takes up his offer to work. He inevitably becomes a part of the new battle against the Decepticons, much to the dislike of his girl (Rosey Huntington-Whiteley) and his annoying parents. While the pillars are assembled all over, hundreds of decepticons are summoned to Chicago as they prepare to teleport Cybertron into Earth's atmosphere. Thus begins the hour long devastation of Chicago in 3D as Decepticons lay a siege on a much destroyed city, while military operatives dive down from airplanes in bat-wing-suits while our world's leaders decide to send the Autobots off into far away space. But this was never about humans standing a chance by themselves..... Devoid of any richness, emotion or rationale is the tale of humans here. Sam's relationship with Carly lacks chemistry and with her fashionably plastic persona, the rawness of Megan Fox will be deeply missed. John Turturro's Simmons is now a haughty, attention- seeking non-contributor whose presence is questionable. The same goes with Gibson and Duhamel, whose military persons don't carry any weight in such out-of-control situations. John Malkovich and Frances McDormand are wasted in inexplicably empty roles. Those who draw our attention away from the void of these soulless characters are Sentinel Prime, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron and the numerous talkative Autobots who are richer both in character, dialog and screen presence. Indeed, such is their transformation that one can analyze them as though they were humans. That is of course, until Michael Bay puts them in Chicago.Bay is at his cinematic best in the carnage that spans highways, high rise buildings, city streets and skies. He renders 3D in its best form since 'Avataar' to dazzle the viewer with robots, guns and humans flying through the screen. The special effects surpass all prior attempts at depicting metallic annihilation of a city and while there is a resemblance to some of Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds', its intensity is pure and unique. As Shockwave goes through the epic deconstruct of a building, Optimus Prime slices through Decepticons, Bumblebee repeatedly transforms from and into a sexy Camaro, we witness the prowess of Bay-hem and the might of one man's vision to enthrall an audience. 'Revenge of the Fallen' was criticized for its plot and character development but it looks richer in those aspects when compared with Dark of the moon where the plot's sheer incoherence is louder than the clang of metal. Why do the characters exist and why do they do what they do? Sam's relationships are irrelevant and so are his job interviews when total devastation is upon Earth. It takes over 50 minutes for the film to grind its gears but then, it does follow up with summer's most explosive action. Bay succeeds in making 3D look worthwhile and his robots cooler than before but we could've only hoped for a shorter length that focused more on them rather than the excessive human role. There might not be a sequel to follow because Megatron, Starscream and much of the Decepticons are destroyed to the core by Optimus and his Autobots. Thrice the aliens have tried to invade and have failed. Another attempt would seem ridiculous for Paramount to even finance.In the end, this isn't a movie outing you base on reviews. Ratings don't matter in this case. What matters is that you are among the first week viewers who contribute to a stellar opening as always for this franchise. While Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots pledges his presence forever on Planet Earth, to save and protect, you were there....in the theater... to witness it all.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"9","/10","don't believe the hate!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2452618/?ref_=tt_urv","apope42","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17984468/?ref_=tt_urv","3 July 2011","there is one simple reason in my opinion for all the hate generated over an over-the-top action film about KID'S TOYS...(cheez, I mean).....which I will get to soon. But it's NOT, repeat, NOT any of the following, although they are contributing factors. It's not Michael Bay hate, although there is an element of jealousy in the professional movie world, which I say is not the cause, because this is the case with almost every successful action picture. There's always a feeling that the character-driven drama is somehow more worthy or more artistic. It's not Megan Fox fans, if there are any still, dissing the picture out of loyalty, nor do those purist fan-boys account for the raw bile being spewed, very wrongly, about this near perfect summer movie. No, and I will not go on with what it's not. I read a review here from someone from the UK who states he's not an American, which I think summarizes it. It's posted here on this site, so if I misquote, you can check me. The reviewer didn't think much of the scene where Abraham Lincoln's statue is destroyed. But this is an example of where the movie succeeds and makes me, and I think the audience it is aimed at, a fan. I didn't consider myself a Michael Bay fan, thought Armageddon was one of the silliest and worst movies ever made. Hard as it may be to believe this 3rd installment of the Tranformers franchise has made me rethink that opinion. I don't go to blockbusters, as a general rule. I didn't see ET for many years, just as a resistance to all the hype. Conversely, especially now, when important critics line up in a mob to stone a movie and/or its maker, I go to learn why. I'm not a Transformers fan, the TV show was one of the most shameless cartoon marketing ploys, but my kids liked it and it wasn't like some other drivel, it seemed to have some basis in right versus wrong, and few if any unsavory elements, so I basically put up with it, without thinking of it much. I didn't like or hate the first movie, the second seemed worse and I basically agreed with the criticism, too loud, too dark (not in theme, hard to see), confusing battle scenes, story holes really so big the story wasn't even on Saturday cartoon level. When I saw so many saying the same things, I prepared myself for the worst.To repeat the title of this review for emphasis, Don't Believe the LIE! Michael Bay and his crew obviously listened to any valid criticism leveled against 'Fallen', most of the battle scenes take place in daylight, many are slowed down and simply glorious in the detail and realism of the CGI effects. (Some effects not related to robots are ridiculously poor, more later.) At least in the theater I saw it in, noise levels were the best I've seen in years. I have pretty sensitive ears, and hate going to a movie where the sound is like a rock concert. The story is just complicated enough to engage interest, without adding extraneous detail or annoying subplots. Remember, especially all of those reviewers here, who seem to want Star Trek style consistency and detail from a movie based on a Saturday morning cartoon, designed to sell pre-teens toys. C'mon, people! So why the hate? I am sorry to say, it's painfully obvious. The movie has the audacity to be....GASP....Pro-American! (shudder) Yes, a summer movie, made in the USA, by Americans, released near the national birthday anniversary of July 4th, shows a pro US bias! How dare they! and it had Bill Oreilly, instead of Chris Matthews, John Malkovich instead of Sean Penn, flags wave, echoes of September 11th in the destruction of Chicago. And the really unforgivable sin, it finally puts the Communist slogan, used to great effect in other sci-fi films, in the mouth of a villain. I hate to bring politics to this, but the conclusion is inescapable. I saw the film with a very eclectic crowd, trying to escape crushing heat, in a nearly-closed mall on the Saturday of the holiday weekend. Everyone stood up and applauded even cheered at the end. How long has it been since that has happened? My 14 year old son saw it on opening day, in a different city, different demographics, and said the same thing happened. Now, about those poor effects. There are scenes showing 'dead presidents' related to the moon conspiracy subplot, which are shamefully poorly done. JFK looks like a figure from Disney's presidential robot exhibit, they show Nixon on a TV screen with the real kinescope of an appearance during the moonshot, and an actor in the same frame, the actor doesn't look as much like Nixon as Anthony Hopkins did. The movie admittedly is too long, I think because of trying to please others by adding material to make the story less disjointed than part 2, but it isn't insufferably so. I got a little restless just before the climactic battle, but some judicious cuts of the parent's roles and the set-up scenes with 'McDreamy' to show him in a good light before the surprise would have solved this minor problem. Go, with family if possible, this weekend if possible, and be inspired, as silly and puerile as it seems, but some goofy toy robots, some forgettable jokes, and some kick-ass, drop-dead gorgeous, and heartbeat-racing action, with a definite and unapologetic American pride.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Their are a couple of scenes showing action in slow motion with the new girl and her lips look horrible, eyes seem to be sunken in and she was way to tall for the kid. Why was she always wearing white and High Heels???? Really!!! The shift in the plot and graphics...WOW...my wife even got into it.

Two years ago when I saw revenge of the fallen, I fell asleep towards the end b/c honestly..........it sucked. When I saw dark of the moon last week in IMAX 3D it amazed me in so many different ways. First of all, The 3D was superior to the degree that some scenes felt uncomfortably realistic. The 3d in DOTM beats any other 3d film I have seen in the past. I don't like to exaggerate, but it may have been up to the level of avatar 3D-wise. Second of all, SFX was superb, much better than the past two. My jaw literally dropped about five times during the intense scenes, especially the ones toward the end. And finally the robots were so human-like that it was shocking. Truth to be told, some of the robots have better acting skills than Shia's new love, Rosie-Huntington Whiteley :p. Seriously though, this is a must see movie for any fan of Action and/or AMAZING special effects. Don't be cheap people pay the extra 5 dollars for the IMAX 3D, you will NOT regret it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think all of these movies are fun and good in their own ways, even The Last Knight. This one is on another level. The action sequences and CGI were pristine and enjoyable. The Bay-style humor works best here (if not in this one, then Age of Extinction).Dark of The Moon adds to the mythos of the franchise and history as a whole and is all the better for it. I think Michael Bay is a bad director and makes bad (however enjoyable) movies. Dark of The Moon is the crowning achievement here. It has a phenomenal villain In the form of Leonard Nimoy's Sentinel Prime and the voice cast is stellar as always.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was not a big fan of the first 2, and a big fan of Shia Lebuf. But this one blew me away. And I believe it has to do with the story. The story was way better to get your mind drawn into this universe than the first 2. The action/fighting scenes were a step forward for the auto bots. The absence of Megan Fox I think played out well for the storyline of Sam, and Shia acted better in this go around. The Transformers them selves were much better. You always root for bumblebee and Omptimus Prime. Prime and the Autobots had a role that suits them better in this film. One of best of 2011 and by far best of the trilogy.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Second One: Heavily Flawed, but still fun for me. I'm sorry. I like it. I've watched it many times thinking it wouldn't hold up. It still does.I'll start with the good: Plenty of great action scenes involving humans and Robots alike with just about everyone getting there own bad ass moment. Bay is great at directing action. The plot, while thin and similar to the other films, had enough twists and turns and mystery to keep me invested. There are even a couple of big reveals that I liked. The acting is competent, though it does stray with some and I even got some laughs. I also liked the new girl, despite the Liv Tyler lips. I also like that John Tuturo's character wasn't all that annoying in this one. Even Lebouf's parents were used to a small degree in this one, and weren't quite as annoying, except for one overly-vulgar joke.Now for the bad, the part most will probably want to love: I said I liked the new girl, but I liked Megan Fox's character a bit better. Fox's character did more in the other films. This girl is pretty much a damsel in distress the whole time. Another big problem is that Shockwave is deemed as the film's main villain on the IMDb pages. He ain't. He may as well not have been named. He has no real dialogue and probably fired his gun once. Another false point is that the cameos by Ken Jeong and John Malcovich. Malchovich serves no purpose and his last couple of scenes should have been deleted. Jeong is just annoying and I was so relieved when his character died. No real spoiler there. There is also some really bad attempts at humor in there, too. The only other bad thing I can name is that we spend too much time with people. I let it slip with the first 2, but this time was too much. We needed a few more scenes with Robots at this point.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Honestly, Dark of the moon, and all the Transformers movies for that matter could have been so much more, so much better. There's no denying that at all! At this point though, we knew what to expect walking in, I knew what to expect walking in. Honestly, I liked this movie. I enjoyed the big dumb action, because even as bad as the Transformers movies have gotten, they still have giant robot wars, and for me, that trumps movies about Boy Wizards or typical action films. What is important is that there isn't just a marginal improvement over revenge of the fallen in this movie, there is a huge improvement over that film. The story is far better, the characters have more to do. The ONLY real complaint I can agree with is that there needed to be some more scenes removed from this film. Seriously, this movie could have done with 15-20 minutes worth of editing.When the problem in your movie amounts to a lack of editing, I have really got to ask about the basis for all the complaining. A lot of people also apparently take Star Trek too seriously because of a certain line Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime said in this film. Guys, I'm like a hardcore Trekkie, and even I don't care! Star Trek is great, but to take it that seriously, like even WAY more seriously than I do is complete bullshit.So no, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that Transformers Dark of the moon didn't have problems, it did, but in my opinion the faults from ROTF have improved SO much in this movie that any problems can be easily overlooked in my opinion.Dark of the moon is an enjoyable action film, and to be fair it's not nearly as bad as some overwrought critics have said it is.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Critics may not like most of his films, and a lot of the audience are divided up, but Michael Bay knows how to entertain and bring in the big bucks, and make your money worth while. His films contain sweeping scales that show off his skills in technicality, and the action will make you gasp. If Bay delivered at the top of his game in one film, the perfect example would be Transformers: Dark Of The Moon, the third adventure in the wildly successful blockbusting franchise, a franchise that has made well over $2 billion. This is the best movie in the franchise, and one of my all time favourite movies and easily the best 3D experience! Throughout the film locations pops to life, from the Cybertron-War at the opening, to the intense Motorway chase and the mind-blowing, hour long Chicago climax that will knock you off your seat. Depth is monumental, even in faster cut shots the ability to sense space is easily done as it's so convincing. Dark of The Moon delivers incredible action alongside a solid storyline that just gets better and more involving throughout, it's the strongest plot of the franchise and I love how the Space Programme is used against the backdrop of a darker mission to the Moon. This entry also introduces new characters to the epic franchise as well as returning cast members. Shia LaBeouf, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, John Turturro, Ken Jeong, Alan Tudyk, exceptional newcomer Rosie Huntington Whiteley and co are all on top form with razor sharp performances. Like I said Michael Bay is the master of scale and chaos, the finale of this film is the best I've ever seen. Chicago falls to it's knees in the last act, an epic battle of robot-smashing, pyrotechnic carnage that goes on for nearly a whole hour. Sometimes I get the temptation to skip most the movie and just watch this part but the build-up is just too good to miss. The visuals are perfect, the sound roars to life and it's the best battle in film, jaws will drop at the size of this movie, and it's the best 3D I've ever seen speeding ahead of Avatar and Gravity. Dark Of The Moon packs incredible action shots, some of the best I've ever seen including actors walking amongst backdrops of explosions and collapsing structures. Overall a spectacular special effects bonanza with Michael Bay at his best.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This may be more of a rant towards all of the ranters who give this entire series a bad review. Why? Purely because they don't like how much it follows Sam Witwicky. I can only presume these haters, either never watched the original 80's TV series or movie, or just never payed attention, because the Witwicky family has always been around. Daniel Witwicky was one of the main characters in the 86 Movie. He was always with the Hot Rod and the Autobots in Autobot City. Which we can only presume he is a descendant of Shia LaBeouf's character since the events o the old series take place after the Michael Bay Movies.

There were some draggy moments but over all a roller coaster ride. The point that Mr Bay spends so much of energy/time/money just to shoot a frame of 2-3 seconds really pays off.The special effects are mind boggingly brilliant and this time there is a decent story backing up but for me the thumbs up comes from the fact that this times humans are contributing in some kind of robot killing and esp the gliding scene where a few soldiers glide in the sky with some nasty robots chasing them is brilliant. Shock Wave is scary and Optimus Prime is a rock star. Micheal Bay has mixed his ingredients right this time and congratulations it tastes brilliant. A good fun/action filled movie and good to have the transformer series back on track.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was expecting to go home and write a review listing every horrible thing I could think of in this movie, and there are a few, but the last half of the movie really made up for it and made this one awesome summer movie.The movie opens to what I think is pretty brilliant with the whole Apollo landing and the astronauts come across a strange spaceship and some autobot. Then it shifts gears to Shia Labitch's girlfriend's butt, and she wakes whineyboy Shia out of bed. Yeah he spends most of the movie whining and being a jerk to people. He also won a Congressional Medal of Honor from Obama, but yet he can't find any jobs (in a very funny montage) until John Malkovich gives him one. However, he is soon discovered by the Decepticons, and Whineyjerk breaks into a facility to call upon Optimus Prime once again. I don't know why the Decepticons keep going after him, but I guess we need to find some way to fit him into the movie.Whineyjerk calls on the team from the previous installments as the Decepticons take over the earth. They are bringing their home, Cybertron, to our planet and it's really up to the autobots to save them. Seriously, the humans are like ants and it really shows. Like just when you think the humans are about to take out a Decepticon, here comes an autobot to save them. This happens more than once. The action is exciting this time around and they really hit home with some fresh ideas for some of the action sequence. In fact, if you love action, you will love this movie because the last half of the movie is nothing but action. It's a huge war in Chicago. Just be prepared for some moments where you can't tell if they are autobots or Decepticons. You just have to go with what's going on. Heck, I can only name two autobots: Bumblebee and the legendary Optimus Prime. I don't know the rest.The villain in this movie.... is not Megatron again. This makes me a little mad since Megatron is always made to be a big wuss in all three movies. I thought for a moment that Megatron will finally grow some gonads and give Optimus a run for his money. It doesn't happen. I feel bad for you, Megatron.With all said and done, this is a well done summer movie flick. It's another prime (no puns intended) example of a summer movie done right, unlike that last Transformers movie. I even like some of the twist and turns the movie throws out you. It keeps you entertained. Now... let's see a Go-Bots movie!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

After the critical disappointment of the second film, Bay wanted to improve on it by removing MOST of the crass, juvenile humor that plagued the second one. While it's still bombastic an over-the-top, it's noticeably better than its predecessor. Plot follows Sam and the Autobots discovering a conspiracy involving the 1969 Moon Landing.One thing that's an improvement over the second one are the human characters, Shia Labeouf is less of a baby here (Ignoring that one scene) and gives a solid performance overall. Rosie Huntington-Whitely makes Megan Fox look oscar-worthy, John Turturro returns but has a lesser role than the previous movie, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson reprise their roles doing their whole military guy thing. Newcomers include Frances MacDormand, John Malkovich (Is this a Coen brothers movie???), Patrick Dempsey and Ken Jeong, who is a highlight in this movie. Sam's parents, while still present, are here for just 5 minutes.I also have to point out the incredible 10-minute opening of this movie. It's executed in such a way that it keeps you interested by the get-go. The score is fantastic, Steve Jablonsky does a great job scoring these movies and this might be his best one yet and the title sequence might be my favorite ever.Now the titular Transformers themselves, which thankfully have more screen-time here than before. Optimus Prime now has his cool trailer (Which may or may not turn into something else) and his axe this time around. More Transformers are introduced here around, notably the Wreckers, who have American and Irish accents and NASCAR cars with gatling guns equipped in them and Sentinel Prime, Optimus's mentor who is by far the most interesting character of them all.Decepticons are somewhat lacking this time around. Megatron has a more limited screen presence than in the first two but he does sport a badass design for sure. Soundwave is back with Laserbeak in of the more violent scenes in the movie. Shockwave is here and what a massive disappointment he is and Starscream is mostly the same.However, the majority of the runtime is spent on Sam and his shenanigans, which drags the movie down to a grinding halt and is my biggest complaint about his movie.Aside from those complaints however, the action in this movie is awesome, from the attack on Chernobyl to the spectacular highway chase scene, it's pure eye-candy. Bay had to film the scenes slower in order for the 3D to process and I think it certainly improved on the shaky-cam of the second film. Third Act however, is something else. A 45-Minute battle set in Chicago where the Autobots have to stop Cybertron from destroying Earth. With awesome set-pieces such as the Driller attack on the toppling building, Optimus mile-long killing spree (Arguably the best part of the movie) and the Fight between Sentinel, Optimus and Megatron at the end might be the most satisfying take-downs I've ever seen.Speaking of brutality, this movie might just be the most violent PG-13 movie ever. Energon, which are what Transformers are made of, are colored red in order to imitate real-life blood, people getting burned to crisp by Decepticons (Jeez!). The entire Third Act also feels depressing, like a real war. Throughout the course of the movie, we are subjected to normal PG-13 fare but throughout the 1-hour mark, the tone of movie suddenly becomes so dark, innocent civilians getting massacred, it's horrifying stuff.Overall, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a improvement over it's predecessor, not oscar-worthy material but good enough to be enjoyed for repeated viewings. I think what makes this a better movie is how it wraps up the trilogy with a proper, satisfying ending, which is not what I can say for others trilogies. I surely hope there's no fourth one which breaks this ending!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But to their dismay, the other side wanted something totally different to bring their own world to the planet that is was weak in their eyes – the Decepticons.In 2009, there was a revenge from the Decepticons to take the earth's sun to destroy it so that they could bring the world to a extinction, but the Autobots including its leader Optimus Prime fought his own brother, Megatron and his other brother, better known as The Fallen. Both Megatron and The Fallen had their plans foiled by Optimus and the only human who could understand them – Sam.In 2011, the Decepticons bring a whole new strategy to the big screen – they use a member of the human race to deceive the humans and the Autobots. The only way to stop the Decepticons to destroy them and to stop them from bring Cypertron and re-creating Earth to make it their home.These movies can't compare to any other Sci-Fi movie. They are what we call great entertainment. I have to give props to the greatest iconic director of all time – Steven Spielberg and the genius behind the Transformers Trilogy – Michael Bay. There is no one in the nation that can outdo these 2 gentleman. The cast was incredible from the boy who started the phenomenon – Shia Labouef to the newcomer girlfriend, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The third movie was in one word – INCREDIBLE!!! I give Transformers a 8; I give Revenge of the Fall a 9; but I give Dark of the Moon a 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It astounds me much more that it is one of the highest-grossing films of all time, with making almost 1.2 billion dollars in the box office despite a ""low"" budget of 195 million dollars. I had no idea what to expect after Revenge of the Fallen, but this caught me completely off guard. Everything in Dark of the Moon is out of this world, the characters, the musical score, the story, the mystery, the action, the intensity, everything compelled me.

I guess I am enjoying these transformers movies more than I should but the action is indeed spectacular and the movies are so sexy, I can't help. Although some of the humor was falling flat. Shia being hyperverbal and saying dialogues in a hurry is not that funny. I don't remember him being that way in the last two. Jerry Wang is one of the most annoying characters ever. But there are some surprisingly cool plot twists and betrayals that keep happening and transformers as well as human action in the second half is pretty awesome. Both transformers and most of the human elements in the second half are pretty engaging. I do appreciate Michael Bay recontextualizing real-life historical events. Cool deaths, amazing VFX as always, maybe too long and the new girl is smoking hot just like Megan Fox in the first two movies. Transformers spurting out red color liquid while getting slaughtered is a nice addition.Just FYI, I am watching this franchise with a friend who is a fan and has already watched all of them. Otherwise, I wasn't planning to watch it on my own. I don't understand the negative reviews or people who watch these movies just to hate them. These movies should be judged/enjoyed as Transformers media, not as films.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Premise of the story is that NASA sent Apollo space crafts to explore crash landed Transformer space craft containing an elder Transformer named Centinnel. They found five ""pillars"" that is part of the technology to teleport matters. But it was a trap. Decepticon was there first, and they stole most of the pillars before Nasa got to them. They left Centinnel there because Optimus Prime was only Transformer that could revive Centinnel that in turn can operate the pillars.Shallow story is a hallmark of director Michael Bay's movies, and this one is no exception. It's all about wham !, Bam !, rock um, sock um battle between the robots. It's made in grand scale, but if you expect any depth, you're watching the wrong movie. There're some cruelty as was seen in the previous Transformer movie, that I really didn't care for. But I could see that they had to bring this in to keep the story going.The movie is best of all the Transformer movies, but it's still not much more than an expensive cartoon.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Like ""X-Men"" the background of this movie is historically real.

That said, not many people go into a movie like this for the acting or plot. The action and special effects were very good and this was a very exciting movie and very fun to watch.

It recent years I have stop reading a lot of critics because it seems they have forgotten sometimes you just need to not analyze so much and just sit back and enjoy the show.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third movie installment in this franchise and surprisingly, almost as good as the first one. After ""Revenge of the Fallen"" it seemed this franchise was doomed, and I didn't want to see this one at first but a few buddies informed me it was actually good, so I decided to give it a chance.A half hour in or so it seemed this movie wasn't going anywhere and the plot seemed as thin as before but then it all starts up. To say this is an action movie is almost an understatement, since during the last hour or so it's hard to find a scene where something is not blowing up or crashing or being shot at. However contrary to what other critics have said it wasn't an insult to the ears.The plot that can be a little hard to follow at times with all the mindless violence, but it doesn't really matter it's not that complicated. Even though I will say this time the plot is far more fun to watch and easier to understand then the convoluted ""Revenge of the Fallen"".I would like to talk about the acting in this movie but there really isn't any. It's hard to act while literally everything is blowing up around you and people just keep yelling things. There are some nice one-liners though.As a director Michael Bay is known for mindless action movies and sometimes he fails and sometimes as with this one he succeeds. Some of the statements above may seem to be denouncing this film but there really not, since like I said at the beginning you just have to sit back and enjoy the show.Side note: I've seen 3 movies in the last couple weeks which is more movies that I've seen in theaters in months. 2 of which I saw in 3D (Captain America and the last Harry Potter movie). I didn't feel like spending the extra money to see this in 3D and I think I made the wise choice. The Colors seemed brighter and even thought this is the lesser of the 3 movies I would almost want to say I had a better experience in this one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, just how many of those will have been following the series from the beginning?This is a good continuation of the story, however. Loaded with a bunch of eye-candy and all sorts of action sequences, this movie continues to thrill those who like to watch action and sci-fi.There are some serious flaws in the scenery, though. For example, when we're expected to believe that serious stuff is happening in Chicago, it's actually Detroit's former Packard auto assembly plant that is the backdrop for some scenes. Granted, many may not know of the difference, but for those of us that do know about it, it's a serious flaw. After all, Detroit is NOT Chicago, and vise-versa.But however you look at it, this movie continues to entertain those of us who enjoy the sci-fi and action genres, and it does it quite well. Here's looking towards another installment or two of the series.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The action is slow, and the movie tries to give you a lot of information, but it did okay.The problem seemed to come when we really go to meet the autobots. I just could not garnish much excitement for the good guys. Okay, they are robots, but they did not give me any reason to care if they were blown away or not.The action heats up in the second half almost to the point of there being too much. Things are happening all over the place, and the battle rages on and on. In the end the movie came to a satisfactory end, though hardly a dramatic one.

South Park even has Bay in an episode to poke fun at his lack of ideas for an actual plot. That being said, guess what the new Transformers offers...?If you guessed another action packed flick with not much else to offer, then you're correct.Now I gave Dark of the Moon a 7 solely based on the fact that the fight scenes blew me away. Michael Bay is obviously good at one thing, and he shows it off in this one. The majority of the fighting takes place in downtown Chicago, and it was exciting to see how the action integrated with the layout of the city. Buildings are taken out left and right, glass shattering everywhere, pretty much complete chaos. I can go on and on about the battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, but you kind of know what to expect there. What I got tired of was the unbelievably stupid plot. Almost every 5 or 10 minutes I was literally putting my hands in the air and saying, ""Are you serious?"" I'm not going to delve into the details, because I want you to go see the movie for yourself and see what I am talking about, but just know what you're getting into.Several other reviews I read talk about how certain things in the movie were unrealistic. A few folks went on to complain about the way a machine crashing on the moon would create a different reaction. C'mon people, you've got to let some things slide. I accept the fact that it is a movie, but of course there are still certain issues you cannot look past. Overall, I enjoyed Dark of the Moon because I'm an action junkie. The fight sequences in this Transformers blow the other movies out of the water, but don't get your hopes up that all will make sense. Obvious flaws are abundant, but it's still worth the watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Being one of those people who grew up with the action figures and animated series it has been exciting to watch the movies so far with the first of the franchise films being created in 2007. Perhaps the Revenge of the Fallen (2009) was not as successful as the first instalment of the Transformers however, the release of the Dark of the Moon looks to already be impressing with the Transformers Craze well and truly alive.If that alone doesn't convince you that the craze is here, then perhaps a website dedicated to showing off all things transformers around the world that people own or make will, at www.thetransformerscrazy.com you will be shown how crazy this craze really is. Making her spectacular film debut is the gorgeous UK model Rosie Huntington Whiteley, as Carly, Sam Witwicky's girlfriend, who has turned out to be the perfect replacement for Megan Fox. The plot picks up with Sam being unemployed and fresh out of college finding that he has to prove his place in the world. Sam struggles to show what he has so far done to save the world due to the government silence agreements and continues to try and prove his significance.Although the plot is quite basic it at least has a plot around all that action. The first manned mission to the moon was revealed to be in relation to the alien spaceship that had crash-landed on the surface. The Arc as it is known belonged to the sentient machines known as the Autobots, who are working for the US government as peacekeeping mercenaries .The contents of The Arc, possessed the power to allow the Autobots and Optimus prime to defeat the evil Decepticons.Sam and the Autobots set out on a mission to revive and rescue Sentinel Prime. The evil Megatron and the Decepticons become a threat wreaking havoc. The plot could have been thought out a little better, however the action made up for what the plot lacked. As can be seen from the trailer the action makes it a worthwhile movie not to mention Rosie Huntington Whiteley playing the perfect girlfriend.The visual effects and sound design are the best that I have seen in a while it has to be said and technically speaking has to be rated as the best this year. For any transformers fan a must see and for those who are not still entertaining!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He now has no meaningful use in the movie. And the script writers have tried to use whatever straws they can grasp at to make some sort of an important role for him. It was sad. 3. The hot girl thing - they have taken it to the lows of a really bad teen comedy. So desperate to somehow show Sam as a big man. 4. Very bad editing. So many scenes have no meaning and some just pop up with no meaning to the story. And some just go on and on. They made action and real cool CGI boring, how ironic. I love action. Yet there I was looking at the time scale to see when this movie would get over......... 5. Bad story. All the moon thing was very cool and mysterious in the trailers, but couldn't they have put in a little effort to have some sort of a real story. It was just too lame. 6. Bad Acting - Most of the actors were just irritatingReal Disappointment.........Still I give it a 4 - its completely for the graphics, if you like action, give it a try, only if there isn't anything better.Or you may still have to watch it - the reason why I had watched it - its a transformer movie - i need to know what happened. lol.............. :-)..................Cheers. :-).......................","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But, for those who didn't, despite what critics had to say, you will love this dark and action-packed finale to this amazing trilogy! In the fashion of the previous two films, Dark of the Moon takes a turn at giving history a little rewrite. This time with the explanation of the big space race in 1969. It turns out that we actually ventured to the moon to explore an alien spacecraft that had crashed landed there, unaware that it belonged to the Autobots. Years later when Optimus Prime learns of its existence, he retrieves the precious cargo and returns it to Earth, in hopes to keep it safe and away from the Decepticons.I saw this film twice in theaters and it is just everything you could hope for in the final better and more! Of course, in true Michael Bay style, there are a lot of explosions and much destruction, but also there is a solid storyline that features a brilliant and totally unexpected twist! This film definitely took a darker turn compared to the others, and I dare say that it is the best of them! It did feel a bit off having Megan Fox gone, but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was able to come in and give her character life that aided into the masterfully crafted story. Along with the returning cast, a few other new editions were added, such as the wonderful John Malkovich and Frances McDormand! We also were introduced to some awesome new Transformers, which included my personal favorite, Shockwave, who was able to branch out into this mechanical snake-like creature.It's sad to think that the end came so quickly, but it couldn't have ended more perfectly! It's just an exciting ride that is packed with action, explosions, laughs, twists and turns, and heart. Not to mention that while most films gain nothing extra from being in 3-D (except for $3 more from your wallet), this movie was what the 3-D technology was made for! It was just spectacular.. especially during the action sequences (which were aplenty)!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story line is good sound and music and voices is great. But tell me one thing why Autobots can't fly while Decepticons can......? When you making the next one add the characters of autobots ooo why you not include the bugati character or any plane or chops in autobots...? over all instead of all comments movie series is the best. I think yo must include the variation in story and vilon army in next part and upgrade the music background sound and voices. Best entertain you provide Mr. Micheal bay.

The action and locations are visually fantastic with great sound effects and music to match. The storyline is engaging especially for a film based on a Saturday morning cartoon made to push toys. John Malkovich has a great time in a lengthy strange cameo (that didn't need an actor of his calibre) as Sam's boss but he's enjoyable in every scene and a welcome surprise. Megan Fox's replacement model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a fine addition, with a natural striking, quirky look. And while not a veteran actress she's more than adequate as the love interest. Josh Duhamel, John Turturro and Tyrese Gibson return. Both Patrick Dempsey and Shia LaBeouf are on form with the Witwicky character given a little more development and purpose. Sam's toilet encounter aside there's less forced humour in this instalment and at times some of the robot attacks are violent, possibly be fitting of a Terminator movie.  Most notable robot characters are present. Key voice Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is back, and oddly the leader against his traits remorselessly goes 'postal' in the closing act. Leonard Nimoy voices Sentinel Prime who gets much of the dialogue and is the most interesting of the robot characters development wise. It's a pity that like the previous two films this one also lacks the rapport between the robot characters that the cartoon captured so well. It's a missed opportunity, there's little interaction between Starscream and Megatron (Hugo Weaving who is given little to do) and the Autobot's shenanigans, bouncing off each-other and camaraderie is missing.It must be a blast for the new generation but for those who grew up with Transformers it still fails to capture or match the original magic. That said, it moves one step closer in the right direction. Michael Bay puts every buck on the screen with great compositions and flair. It's loud, it's spectacular and debatably the most satisfying, balanced and rounded of the three.Considering its origin (based on a series of cartoon and toys) it's solid entertainment which is being overly analysed and unfairly panned.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","This is also one of the best 3D movies to date","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2461018/?ref_=tt_urv","filmworld1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27105204/?ref_=tt_urv","19 July 2011","This is also one of the best 3D movies to date. One major critique of 3D is that 3D glasses make the film darker, but here they do a very smart thing, the film itself is brighter than your average movie and this problem evens itself out. Another thing that worried me before I saw it is that if there was so much high-speed action maybe that and the combination of 3D would give me motion sickness, end of the movie: no problems.The BadThe villains suck. Megatron does absolutely nothing throughout the whole film until right at the end, and even that was a let down. Shockwave appears briefly at the start and vanishes for two hours, he himself doesn't actually do much, it's all down to this big nameless tentacle- clad decepticon he works with. Starscream does nothing, but then he never did anything anyway. I'm not even going to mention Patrick Dempsey. But the biggest let down is with the movies main villain ""Sentinel Prime"". Basically he is Optimus' predecessor but he changed sides to the decepticons and made a deal with Megatron to bring life back to their home planet Cybertron. This is the driving element of the movie, but there are many plot holes from this. Early in the film Optimus basically says he wants to make Sentinel Prime leader of the autobots again, and offers him the matrix (an item that brings dead transformers back to life) but Sentinel Prime declines. Then he changes sides. Why did he decline taking the matrix? it would in definitely be a help in his ploy. Sentinel Prime gets numerous chances to kill Optimus once and for all, but like all lousy villains he delays his hand and Optimus lives.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","An improvement over 'Fallen' but well short of the first film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2457983/?ref_=tt_urv","MF210","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2368825/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2011","My Rating: **1/2 out of ****Spoilers As far as summer blockbusters go, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is adequate but underwhelming. While a big improvement over it's predecessor, Revenge of the Fallen, which was stupid even by director Michael Bay's standards, Dark of the Moon is no better than mediocre. There's a lot of flash here but for a film that's over two and a half hours you need more than that and Dark of the Moon is pretty hollow. When the first Transformers came out it provided eye-popping special effects with spectacular, though at times a little hectic, actions scenes and it did present characters you could at least identify with and care about. It wasn't a deep film by any means but it didn't pretend to be. Unfortunately, spectacular visuals and action scenes with a dumb plot only worked for one film. The two sequels are ridiculously too long and the cuts are so fast during the action that you have no idea what's going on, and by the end you don't even care. To be fair, Dark of the Moon is not a terrible film, it even has some merits. I really liked how Bay took a real historical event like the moon landing and injected the Transformers into it. I had reservations about this when I saw the first trailer but really it's done quite well and we even get a compelling reason why another man has not set foot on the moon in over forty years. This was also done in this Summer's far superior X-Men: First Class, which used the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also, it's interesting that Sentimel Prime, an Autobot, is the villain of the film. This makes the Decepticons no more than a foot note but it is at least an interesting approach. For about 90 minutes, Dark of the Moon is entertaining enough. The visuals are still spectacular (never a problem with this franchise) and things move fairly quickly. I can honestly say I did not expect to see Sentinel Prime join with the Decepticons so that was a nice unexpected turn. However, there is still another hour to go and those 60 minutes feel like an eternity! The action isn't compelling and it's so drawn out that you're just aching to leave, but you spent $15 and want to stick it out to the bitter end.One final complaint; I don't like 3-D. Michael Bay decided he would to do Dark of the Moon in 3-D and it was a mistake. It's hard on the eyes and does nothing to enhance the cinematic experience. Unfortunately, moviegoers are going to have to put up with this nuisance more and more in action films so we're stuck with it.If all you're interested in is great visuals and some mindless action, give Transformers: Dark of the Moon a shot. It wasn't worth the $15 ticket, could've been an hour shorter, and better off without the 3-D, but while it maybe underwhelming it's not a terrible film. Still, if you're anybody but a die-hard Transformers fan I'd wait for DVD.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, all is not so dark and bleak as he has found a new love (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and the world appears safe from those dreaded Decepticons. But things can change quickly as an Autobot spacecraft which was first discovered in the 1960s, becomes a point of interest for all robotic protagonists and antagonists involved. ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" sizzles in its set-up and its plot development early with a vibrant energy and excitement from its highly likable cast (which even includes stand-outs like Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Ken Jeong), but is steadily destroyed by the titled characters. As the clock ticks and the running time becomes astronomical (running nearly 160 minutes) the movie begins to lose its wheels with an unending finale which literally takes up about an hour of the movie's running time. The ""Transformers"" series continues to deliver what it promises---sleek cars, sleeker women, and tons of chaotic noise and visuals. In the end though, the complexities of the human performers always seem to take a backseat to the titled weapons of mass destruction. Director Michael Bay seems to overlook and sacrifice legitimate premises and possibly interesting outcomes in favor of confusing and over-wrought visual effects which ultimately do very little to advance the effectiveness which potentially could have developed within. Sometimes less is more and I do not think it could be more prevalent, cinematically speaking, than in this particular movie franchise. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The stage is set early in his apartment, with his very briefly clad girlfriend walking up the stairs to where Sam was still in bed. She(model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is quite pretty. But Sam has a bigger issue at hand, his parents are coming to visit him in Washington, D.C. and he doesn't yet have a job, and that would be a big deal with mom and dad.That is the personal and love-interest story. But the story about the autobots begins in 1962, with Kennedy as President. An impact of sorts is detected on the far side of the moon, and it is assumed the Russians, who the USA was in a space race against, were responsible. In this fictional story, it was this impact that was the catalyst for Kennedy to declare his intentions to send a man to the moon before the decade was over. And, we see again in this film, the moon landing in 1969 depicted.But what was discovered in 1969 was a crashed space ship, one that contained remnants of the vanquished autobots. This was of course kept secret, but now in modern times artifacts brought back from the moon are on the verge of starting yet another autobot war on Earth.The critic Ebert has a good, complete review. I enjoyed the first half of the movie, for its story line and tying it back to events in the 1960s. But as I have experienced with the other transformers movies, the fighting among the autobots wears thin long before each battle is over, and at a running time of right around 2.5 hours is too long for me.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yes, it was at times silly, but the focus was never totally off of the main characters (and what we want to see from these movies in the first place), the robots. The second movie took the concept ""more is better"" and ran with it, to less than satisfactory results. More action scenes and more robots, but also more ""wacky humor"" and more focus on the humans.  It was an indecipherable, overly-long mess that was made to be as loud and eye-catching as possible, but it was a noticeable step down in quality from the first movie. And now we have the third movie, which turns down the potty humor slightly, but features some awful writing and a story that's just silly. Forcing the character of Sam (Shia Lebeouf) and others to be a part of a plot that they have no reason to be in anymore just adds a lot of unnecessary, empty scenes to a movie that has no business being 2 1/2 hours long. I liked his character in the other two movies, but in this one he's so over-the-top and hysterical that it's annoying, and the storyline with him and his new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whitley) is an uninteresting distraction at best. John Turturro returns again in a role that wore out its welcome about 45 minutes into the first movie, Frances McDormand is wasted, John Malkovich is REALLY wasted, and Alan Tudyk is REALLY. REALLY wasted. Don't expect much from the casting of those fan-favorite actors. If you're under the impression that I hated Dark of the Moon, that's not true. If you ignore the horrid writing and tune out the parade of annoying or pointless characters, there's a decent action movie buried in here about a bunch of robots smashing and blowing each other up. It's just a shame that so much of the movie is spent on the weakest, least interesting part. It's a great idea to ground such fantastical beings as Transformers in our reality through some human characters to relate to, but if that portion of the equation isn't at least adequate, the whole movie suffers. Enough of my rambling. If the many flaws of the second movie didn't put you off, then you'll probably like Dark of the Moon even more. The action is easier to follow than in Revenge of the Fallen (though there are virtually no good robot vs. robot fight scenes until the very end of the movie) and the editing overall has been improved. I was just hoping that a better balance between the Transformers and humans would have been found by now, but the scales still tip far too much in the wrong direction.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
